        "file_text": "47.\t The thirtieth session of the General Assembly opens at a time when important events are occurring on the international scene. At the economic level, the ills from which the international system suffers have been the subject of a more careful diagnosis is being made to remedy them.  At the Political level level, war is ending in Indo-China, while considerable progress is taking place in  the field of decolonization. These transformations undoubtedly constitute an important stage on the road to establishing peace. However, a long road lies ahead before true justice prevails in international relations and before peoples who are still oppressed can enjoy fully their rights to dignity, freedom and independence. It is, therefore, within a new context where the peoples of the world are torn between despair and hope that this thirtieth session, whose work you are called upon to guide, is opening.\n48 Mr. President, your responsibilities are difficult and complex, but we who know your qualities as a statesman and an eminent diplomat, your foresight and clear perception, we who know the well deserved respect that your country enjoys, rejoice at the unanimous choice of the General Assembly which has brought you to the presidency of this session. I therefore ask you to accept the warmest congratulations of the delegation of Mauritania on that mark of confidence and tribute of esteem addressed to you and, through you, to your country, Luxembourg.\n49.\tI should like also to pay a most earnest tribute to your predecessor, my friend and brother Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria. The delegation of Mauritania is all the more happy to express its gratitude to him because he is not only a worthy representative of Africa, but also the Minister for Foreign Affairs of a brother country with which Mauritania maintains the most fraternal and fruitful relations. The history of the United Nations will for ever bear the imprint of the courage, the personality and the qualities of the man who, despite resistance and criticism, was able to define the problems and was among the first to lead us to a fuller awareness of them. It is therefore appropriate for us to express our gratitude to him for his important work during the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session of the General Assembly.\n50.\tThe Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, also deserves our appreciation for the remarkable way in which he discharges his lofty and difficult mission. I wish once again to assure him of the support of Mauritania in his courageous and persevering efforts to win respect for the principles of the Charter and the ideals of equality and justice.\n51.\tI said earlier that the peoples were torn between despair and hope. If we examine the international Situation we note that it has been marked by events which are bringing us closer to peace. Among the super-Powers a network: of new relations, based on economic co-operation, is being established over and above any differences of political regime or ideological system. That new spirit of co-operation and understanding has grown out of the realization that within the context of the balance of nuclear power certain geographical or political boundaries cannot be altered by force. It is also fostered by the fact that it has been realized that two powerful industrial and trade blocs can both benefit from economic co-operation.\n52 In Europe, where for a long time peace initiatives, attempts to settle by peaceful means problems inherited from the Second World 'War, died in the face of misunderstanding and suspicion, anew era of confidence mutual respect is gradually beginning.\n53' the,Viet Nams and in Cambodia, whose peoples nave for a long time been dying from war and foreign intervention, peace is being restored. This is not a peace resulting from a compromise or from a partially observed commitment; it is a peace which has been dearly bought by those peoples. The Cambodian people imposed upon itself the sufferings and the painful sacrifices which we know of to recover its independence. Its victory is a victory for all the peoples who are still struggling for their freedom and dignity. Because of the victory of the Cambodian people, I can today greet their representatives in this Assembly, where they have been restored to their rightful and natural place. The victory of the Vietnamese peoples is no less significant. It was because of a lofty struggle that those peoples obtained their ultimate objective their independence and freedom.\n54.\tHaving implacably devastated the two Vietnamese States, the United States ought to have undertaken to assist in their reconstruction. Not only has the United States not shown such generosity: it has even gone so far as to oppose the admission of the two Vietnamese States to the United Nations by the abusive exercise of its veto. My country cannot but deplore such an attitude, which nothing can justify.\n55.\tIn the field of decolonization considerable progress has been achieved through the concerted action of liberation movements and the United Nations. The concrete result of that action is the accession of many countries to international sovereignty. I should like to express the warmest congratulations of Mauritania to the representatives of the brother countries which have acceded to independence and are with us today. I refer to Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe.\n56.\tOn the economic level, the seventh special session, devoted to development and international economic co-operation, was one of the rare gatherings where dialog prevailed over confrontation. That was all the more fortunate since international economic problems, and in the first place the fundamental problem of development, are today more acute than ever. The specific measures proposed by the special session constitute an important step towards the establishment of a new international economic order, because they are measures which were unanimously accepted by all the Members of our Organization. We know that the resolution adopted at the seventh special session [resolution 3362 (S-V1I)] suffers from definite gaps and shortcomings but it none the less reveals a sincere desire to embark upon a useful and constructive dialog.\n57.\tMy country has already had an opportunity, at the beginning of last month, to state its basic position regarding the development problems faced by the countries of the third world. We emphasized particularly the need to stabilize prices of raw materials, the need for the adequate transfer of resources to finance development and a more equitable distribution of industry throughout the world. While our demands have not been fully met, we must nevertheless recognize that our legitimate claims in those various fields have been welcomed with sustained interest.\n58.\tThese outstanding events constitute beyond any doubt a substantial success for the forces of peace throughout the world. They are therefore a legitimate source of hope. It must nevertheless be recognized that peace is far from assured everywhere and that more justice in international economic relations remains a distant target. Those negative factors constitute serious dangers for the world community.\n59.\tThe first of those factors is the question of Palestine, which directly affects international peace and security. The people of Palestine, whose existence throughout the centuries was closely intertwined with geography, with the very land of Palestine, have been chased from their homes, dispossessed of their goods and reduced to wandering and living on inter-national charity. This injustice committed against the people of Palestine is at the root of the whole problem of the Middle East. It is therefore obvious that any solution to that problem must necessarily include the restoration of the legitimate national rights of the people of Palestine, including their right to return to their homes and their right to independence and to national and international sovereignty.\n60.\tIn the other occupied Arab territories, Israel pursues its policy of intimidation and colonization by force. The establishment of a systematic policy of settlement, the implantation of settlers from everywhere except the region concerned, is in itself very revealing of the Tel Aviv authorities' view of a contribution to the establishment of peace in the Middle East. Quite obviously, what the Israeli authorities have in mind is the creation of an irreversible situation of violent change and faits accomplis.\n61.\tWe have of course followed with great attention the praiseworthy efforts of the United States Secretary of State to unfreeze this explosive situation of \\\"no war, no peace\\\", a situation whose maintenance cannot but threaten the peace of the region and, therefore, international security. While the results he has obtained can be regarded as a first step towards a solution, it is none the less true that the price paid to Israel in armaments can definitely jeopardize any chance for peace in the Middle East. Moreover, those results will remain limited and without any real effect on the situation if similar and urgent efforts are not undertaken in the other sectors on the Syrian and, partic-ularly, the Jordanian fronts. In any case, it must be understood that any kind of peace in the Middle East will be an illusion so long as the Arab territories remain occupied and the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people have not been restored to them.\n62.\tAnother negative factor is the tragic situation in southern Africa. Indeed, the peoples of South Africa and Zimbabwe remain under the yoke of a colonialism based on racial segregation and the domination of the majority by a handful of foreign settlers. The racist policy of the Pretoria regime, which denies to 13 million Africans the most elementary human rights, is an insult to the international community and to this Organization itself. The Organization cannot accept in its midst those who reject its principles and systematically trample under foot its relevant decisions. The South African regime has no place in this forum so long as it does not subscribe sincerely to the principles of equality and respect for the human person, principles that are the framework and the very essence of our Organization, With regard to the rebel Ian Smith regime, the Members of the United Nations have the imperative duty scrupulously to apply and strengthen the sanctions imposed on that regime by the Security Council.\n63.\tI should like here to assure the peoples of South Africa and Zimbabwe of the active solidarity and unwavering support of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania in their struggle for dignity, freedom and national independence.\n64.\tThere is another problem that causes us concern  that of Angola. We hope that that country will once again find peace and stability so as to accede to independence in unity and brotherhood, without being torn apart. The people of Angola are living through a difficult period of their existence, but we are convinced that if they are left to themselves they will be able to meet the challenge and recover their national cohesion.\n65.\tWhile I am speaking of colonial problems, I cannot fail to mention the problem of Western Sahara, which is of the utmost importance to us since it involves our territorial integrity and the unity of our people. We shall, of course, have an opportunity in the Fourth Committee to take up the substance of this problem, when the report of the Visiting Mission to the Territory [A I 10023, chap. XUJ, annex] and the advisory opinion requested of the International Court of Justice have been communicated to the General Assembly. But I should like now to reiterate the mutual determination of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and the Kingdom of Morocco to find for this problem, within the framework of the United Nations, the most appropriate political solution, a solution that will take the utmost account of the respective rights of the two countries. I willingly refrain from dwelling on this problem, since the General Assembly last year took the twofold action which I have just mentioned and the results of which are not yet known. Hence, I shall consider it my duty at a later stage of this session to set forth in detail my country's views on this problem, which affects our national unity and our very existence.\n66.\tWhile the problems of Africa are of particular concern to us, we cannot fail to mention other problems which, while they are far removed from us in distance, are nevertheless of great concern to us. One of them in particular is the problem of Korea. The Korean nation was divided by the accident of occupation. At the beginning, there was a temporary demarcation line, which later was changed into a definite boundary not because that was the desire of the people of Korea but because the prolonged presence of occupation forces tends to create an irreversible situation. That situation, which some are trying to make ever more final, is a permanent threat to peace in that region because it is contrary to the sacred principles of the territorial integrity of the country and to the interests of its people. The use made of the United Nations flag to give an appearance of legality to such an undertaking, to camouflage the occupation of the southern part of Korea, must be stopped by our Organization. The people of Korea must in fact have \nthe possibility of achieving their independent and peaceful reunification without any foreign interference.\n67.\tThese hotbeds of tension or selective confrontation are not the only problems with which the international community is faced. There is another crucial problem of our times: the growing gap between the developed and the developing countries. So long as the measures decided upon by the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly for the establishment of a new international economic order have not been put into effect, this gap, which is already scandalous, will continue to grow. We hope that the developed countries will give us proof of their true political determination to implement these measures which, if they are respected, can contribute to the establishment of genuine international co-operation.\n68.\tThe United Nations is an appropriate framework for such international co-operation. Reform of the economic system of the United Nations and the establishment of structures tailored to the new economic facts cannot but make our Organization more able to play its role of catalyst. It is by doing this that our Organization, an instrument of peace and understanding among peoples, can see its role as a factor for political, economic and social advancement restored to it.\n69.\tThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania, for its part, is prepared to make its contribution to this task of renewal, which is of necessity a joint task.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "106.\t  Mr. President, first of all, I should like to express my satisfaction at seeing you preside over the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. Your skill as a leader and a diplomat, your sensitivity in dealing with international and European problems, are a guarantee of the effectiveness of this session of the Assembly.\n107.\tMay I also take advantage of this opportunity to repeat my sincere congratulations to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who brought to bear his well-known abilities in presiding over the twenty-ninth session and the seventh special session.\n108.\tI am also happy to welcome to this Organization, on behalf of the Spanish Government, the new States which have recently joined the United Nations\u2014Cape Verde, Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe.\n109.\tWhen making up the balance sheet of the work of the United Nations during this thirtieth anniversary, we can note, despite certain flaws that can be corrected, a positive evolution towards a greater harmonization of national interests which, since they become daily more interdependent, call for increased cooperation.\n110.\tThus, in the year that has elapsed since the last session, international events have taken place that are of great importance the overcoming and ending of a conflict which affected an entire generation, the holding of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to which I shall refer later and a series of international meetings on subjects of the greatest importance such as food, population, industrialization and the International Women's Year. All these point to a positive trend towards such co-operation.\n111.\tHowever, among the aspects of the international situation which merit particular attention at this thirtieth session, there are some which are testing the capacity of the United Nations to carry out effectively the goals which the Organization has set for itself. These include economic problems, such as raw materials, the energy crisis, matters of development and monetary reform, and also certain political problems which, by giving rise to concerted stands by Member States, affect the efficient functioning of the United Nations and its organs. It would be easy to yield to the temptation of thinking that the answer night lie in a procedural reform of the Organization, but I believe that it would be better to seek the roots of these difficulties, and to think less about the methods of this Organization, since the polarization of attitudes is due largely to the lack of the proper substantive solutions.\n112.\tPerhaps it is in the economic field that these points of difference between different countries have been most obvious, since they have given rise to positions that conflict with the general interests.\n113.\tAmong such positions we may note the protectionist stands that seek to improve the net foreign trade position of certain countries, as if the only way out was to export more and import less; the stand that fails to relate the energy problem with the fact the energy is a requisite for development; the stand that tries to dictate to the countries that are solely producers of raw materials, abandoned to their fate and deprived of any other financial resources than those they can themselves provide; the stand that supports a monetary system which primarily serves the needs of trade. We could give many more examples of this type of opposed stands.\n114.\tThe interdependence that has grown up in recent decades, and the inevitable osmosis between national economies, make it necessary to seek solutions at a world level. Such solutions will not be possible if all parties are not prepared to yield something of their respective positions so as to emerge from this situation by means of genuine co-operation. The technical machinery for such implementation is not a matter for this body, but the expression of the political will that can make it possible is our concern. For if such determination is lacking and is not transmitted to the specialized bodies and conferences, it will be difficult to find solutions to our existing problems. We have reached a point at which it is not possible for everybody to benefit, because there is no basis for a general and immediate gain. We must look to future gains, which will be possible if we are all prepared to sacrifice something, the greater sacrifice being made by those who can make it most easily, for at this time there is more truth than ever in the old saying that you must know how to lose in order to win. By giving up something of our respective economic ambitions in order to rebuild a more harmonious world economy, we may be able to ensure victory for peace, a peace which may be endangered by growing economic tensions. Such tensions can only be dissipated by effective co-operation that will permit an economic readjustment based on a transfer of income that will have similar effects on a world-wide basis to those achieved in national economies.\n115.\tIn other words, the institutional disagreements which we often deplore might be overcome if a united stand were adopted by all. Thus we would be able to eradicate one of the most important root-causes of these disagreements, and we would not feel called upon to look for procedural means as a solution, when what is required is effective and genuine international co-operation among all Members of the Organization.\n116.\tPursuant to this line of reasoning, I wish to express the will of my country to take part in this effort, as we have repeatedly stated, and most recently at the seventh special session,\n117.\tSpain is a country still in the process of development. In certain important aspects of our efforts to obtain and ensure a steady supply of raw materials we are suffering financial deficits. Yet we have already undertaken the same commitments as the more devel-oped countries, by forgoing certain advantages or benefits in order to help countries less developed than ourselves. We believe that by so doing we have given adequate proof of our will to co-operate.\n118.\tOut of a spirit of true international co-operation we have begun the process of decolonizing Western Sahara in order to allow the population freely to decide its own future and to permit fruitful co-operation with the other countries of the Maghreb so as not to upset the stability of the region and thus to maintain peace there.\n119.\tThe decolonization of the Sahara may well stand as an example of how to overcome a situation of dependency through the strict implementation of the principles and norms set forth in the Charter concerning Non-Self-Governing Territories, and the determination of the Spanish Government to act in conformity with the provisions of the Charter and the General Assembly resolutions which complement it.\n120.\tThis is because the events that have occurred in the course of this year, and the key role played by the population, have confirmed the need to take the latter into account if the process of decolonization is to be continued. In a word, we are trying to ensure the population's protection so that they can freely exercise their right to self-determination, since it would be absurd if, by a mistaken assessment of the elements involved, we were to give paramount importance to the desires of third parties over the true interests of the indigenous population, which, in all circumstances, are protected by the universal right of dependent peoples to determine their own fate.\n121.\tThese remarks would have been unnecessary had the decolonization of the Sahara not given rise to so much misunderstanding. Hence a slight clarification is necessary here in order to shed some light on the confusion created. Yet the facts could not be simpler.\n122.\tSpain settled in Western Sahara without requiring the agreement of anyone but the indigenous population, which was organized in its own autonomous, traditional institutions that were not dependent on any State sovereignty whatsoever. The independence of the population was an indisputable fact and its acceptance of the administering Power's rule confirmed the exclusive nature of the latter's presence in the Territory. Thus the establishment of Spain's authority over the Sahara created solely and exclusively a relationship between Spain and the said population. Hence in the exercise of that authority Spain was not called upon to solve any problems with foreign State authorities, and no so-called rights of third parties over the Territory disturbed the normal development of those relations. Consequently, when the time for decolonization came, we felt that nothing should stand between the administering Power and the population.\n123.\tThe fact that Spain, as a Member of the United Nations, has complied with the procedures set forth in the Charter regarding Non-Self-Governing Territories and with the relevant resolutions on Western Sahara, does not alter this context. I do not overlook the fact that, within this context, some countries have been termed \\\"interested parties\\\". This term has been applied exclusively in relation to the holding of the referendum in order to ensure the fulfilment of the principle of self-determination, but it can in no way affect the relationship between the administering Power and the population. On the contrary, out of a desire to uphold the principle of self-determination, it serves as a further guarantee rather than as an obstacle.\n124.\tNow, the efforts of certain \\\"interested parties\\\", which at first appeared directed towards giving impetus to decolonization through self-determination, as we might have concluded from the communiques of the tripartite conferences of the Maghreb countries, finally became a series of claims. This change in position became most obvious when on 20 August 1974 the Spanish Government informed the Secretary-General of its decision to apply self-determination to the Territory by holding a referendum in the first six months of 1975. That was promptly followed by Morocco's attempts to invalidate that decision, or at least to delay its fulfillment. That was the purpose of submitting the question of the decolonization of Western Sahara to the International Court of Justice for adjudication, as though this were a dispute among States, whereas all that was at stake was the ending of the Territory's dependent status. When that attempt failed, Morocco proposed that the Assembly should request that the International Court of Justice to hand down an advisory opinion and postpone the referendum, and that proposal was adopted as resolution 3292 (XXIX).\n125.\tAlthough this placed further responsibilities upon the administering Power, Spain did not hesitate to put before the International Court of Justice the documentation it had available, and made the situation in that Territory, in all its historical vicissitudes, perfectly clear to the Court. Actually the requested advisory opinion was unnecessary, because the formula for decolonization through self-determination had already been set forth in all the relevant resolutions of this General Assembly, including that resolution in which the advisory opinion was requested. Therefore, the Court could not ignore such a fundamental factor. Nevertheless, if that consultation of the International Court of Justice had been intended only to postpone self-determination, the matter would not warrant any comments from me, because at least the Assembly would have further elements on which to base its judgment, since it would then have the advisory opinion from the supreme legal body of the United Nations.\n126.\tBut succeeding events did not go smoothly. While on the one hand self-determination had been postponed pending the advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice, on the other hand peace in the Sahara was being upset by repeated acts of violence and harassment tolerated from abroad, and thus an insecurity was created that was incompatible with the obligation incumbent on each and every Member of the United Nations to maintain peace, in particular on the neighboring States calling themselves \\\"interested parties\\\".\n127.\tBut it was precisely because of the risks flowing from outside actions and the additional responsibilities that were then heaped on the administering Power that the Spanish Government was forced to make a statement and to inform the Secretary-General of its contents on 23 May last. In an effort to avoid creating a power vacuum, and in order not to jeopardize the decolonization process, Spain pointed out that, if the situation continued to deteriorate, it reserved its right to take whatever measures might be required in this Organization and, if necessary, to terminate its presence in the Territory. At the same time, it urged the neighboring countries to assume their responsibilities for the maintenance of peace in order to allow an orderly process of decolonization to take place. Accordingly, we invited them to a conference which, if not convened by the administering Power, could be held under the auspices of the United Nations and thus be a positive step towards a regional agreement aimed at facilitating decolonization.\n128.\tThe Spanish Government, by agreeing to let the referendum take place under the auspices of the Organization as originally planned, and by trying to hold, under the same auspices, a quadripartite meeting to maintain peace in the Sahara and to facilitate the decolonization process through dialog among the interested parties, has given repeated proof of its willingness to co-operate actively with the United Nations in the fulfillment of one of its noblest tasks, the emancipation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories. Further proof of that good will lies in the support and assistance given the International Court of Justice by us in the fulfillment of the requests of the General Assembly and the facilities given the United Nations Visiting Mission to carry out its own tasks in the Territory.\n129.\tThese are clear proofs of the nature of our conduct, which is intended only to give back to the Saharan people the trust that they had placed in Spain. Regardless of the results of this referendum of self- determination, the Saharan people themselves, and only they, can decide on that matter, because the idea of subjecting them to an imposed solution would, if carried out, create a very dangerous uncertainty for the entire future of decolonization.\n130.\tBe that as it may, on behalf of the Spanish Government I must declare that my country will continue to shoulder its responsibilities as the administering Power until the process of decolonization is concluded, so long as other States, and particularly the neighboring States, respect the peaceful evolution of that process and do not allow the premises on which the process rests to be upset, because they have been set up in accordance with the provisions of the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly. If any alteration in the situation takes place that might threaten peace and increase our responsibilities, the Spanish Government reserves its right to draw the attention of the Security Council to the necessary measures that should be adopted to maintain peace and also to undertake whatever necessary action might be called for to finalize the process of decolonization. This reservation is intended only to confront neighboring or interested States With their responsibility and to re-establish the principle of equality in the fulfillment of those obligations which the Charter has made incumbent upon all.\n131.\tTo this end the positions adopted by the countries neighbors of Western Sahara regarding the decolonization of the Territory positions which at times coincide and at other times contradict one another far from being incompatible with respect for the rights of the people of Western Sahara, should be harmonized so that they can lead to the achievement of a positive agreement, in order that decolonization can be carried out in such a way that the prosperity of the region will be strengthened and peace and security assured. In drawing inspiration from this objective, Spain advocates consultations and a search for understanding with the neighboring countries.\n132.\tBut decolonization of the Sahara is being unduly delayed. I should like to take the liberty of reminding the Assembly that the Government of Spain communicated to the Secretary-General its desire to hold a referendum for self-determination as urged by the resolutions of the General Assembly during the first six months of this year. The incidents to which I have referred have made it impossible for the administering Power to complete the decolonization of the Territory as planned. My Government considers it to be imperative not only for the truth and respect of this Organization for the principles of the Charter, but for the peace and security of the entire region that this process of decolonization be allowed to be concluded as soon as possible. We trust that the General Assembly at this session will adopt a resolution setting a time-limit as soon as possible.\n133.\tGibraltar has not as yet been decolonized, despite the last resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its last session [resolution 3286 (XXIX)], which once again urged the United Kingdom and Spain to conclude their pending negotiations. The negotiations have not progressed, however, in such a way as to allow us to report any satisfactory results to the Organization.\n134.\tThe position of the United Kingdom not to go ahead with the pending negotiations rests on the argument that the preamble of the law approved by Parliament granting a Constitution to Gibraltar makes it impossible for it to negotiate on the return of the Rock of Gibraltar until the acquiescence of the inhabitants has been obtained. But the United Kingdom seems to have overlooked the fact that the resolutions are not addressed to the United Kingdom Government or to any of the other organs comprising the British State, but are addressed by the United Nations to the United Kingdom as an international subject, considered as a whole, having international relations and being a Member of this Organization. The attitude adopted by Englishmen in positions of responsibility implies that they are disregarding the fact that the internal structure of the State must not prevent compliance with its international obligations, because the way in which the United Kingdom determines its actions is irrelevant to third parties.\n135.\tBut to accept this argument, which is the only reason that is adduced to block the negotiations, would mean that the inhabitants of Gibraltar are to be allowed to play a role beyond that agreed upon by the parties at the time of the cession.\n136.\tBut Her Majesty's Government acquired ownership of Gibraltar under article X of the Treaty of Utrecht, the only instrument upon which it can base its presence on that segment of Spanish territory. The international development of the fortress carried out by the occupying Power to serve its military and commercial requirements, allowing the establishment of an artificial population, has not altered the relationship between the giver and the receiver, particularly if we take into account the fact that sovereignty was transmitted under specific limitations regarding communications, the origin of the residents, the import of goods and the presence of certain vessels in the harbor.\n137.\tFurthermore, the main limitation agreed to concerning the powers transferred to the United Kingdom was the condition accepted by the British Crown that Spain would always enjoy preferential rights in the case that the British Sovereign decided to give away, sell or in any way change the ownership of the Rock. In other words, the United Kingdom has no right to give up Gibraltar or to transfer its sovereign powers without giving Spain the opportunity to exercise its option.\n138.\tIf we were to accept the role that the inhabitants of the Rock are being given, the Treaty would be breached, since the population is being granted powers of decision which restrict the freedom of action on the part of the British and presupposes a transfer of sovereignty. Therefore, either the law approving the Constitution of Gibraltar is irrelevant, since it is in violation of a previous international treaty or, if not, it reflects the true will of the United Kingdom that it has decided to transfer its sovereignty over Gibraltar. In the latter case my Government should be given its preferential right to recover the territory, as was recognized in the Treaty of Utrecht.\n139.\tThis shows what the end result would be if an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament were allowed to prevail, a law governing the sovereign powers of Her Majesty's Government adopted without consulting the inhabitants of Gibraltar, and one which can therefore be abrogated in the same way, without the inhabitants having the slightest right to raise legal obstacles. The granting of a charter of this nature cannot be claimed to be an exception, and if this happens, the Spanish Government will take it that it is being faced with an evasive action the sole purpose of which is to avoid considering the substance of the matter.\n140.\tHowever, I must recall that these substantive legal considerations do not stop my Government, as they did not stop the General Assembly, from bearing clearly in mind the fact that the process of decolonization of Gibraltar contains two very distinct elements: the territorial integrity of Spain, which must be safe-guarded, and thus the spirit and letter of the Treaty of Utrecht would be respected, and the interests of a population which, even though alien to the territorial problem, must nevertheless be protected. The Spanish Government has always understood this to be the case and has at all times been ready, and is ready, to offer the most generous conditions.\n141.\tFrom this standpoint, a number of conversations have been held between officials of the two Governments, and in the past few days I myself had a talk with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Her Majesty's Government. I should very much wish to be able to inform this Assembly next year of the development of negotiations that will fulfill the provisions of resolution 3286 (XXIX) and of other concordant resolutions and contribute to the solution of a problem which is extremely grave and distressing, even though very old. But I do sincerely believe that the example that the two Governments can give by solving this dispute through mutual agreement would be a true contribution to the spirit of peace which should govern our work,\n142.\tAs I indicated at the beginning of my statement, one of the major events of 1975 was the holding in Helsinki of the final phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, a matter to which my Government attaches the greatest importance and which opens the door to confidence and trust, if conduct is in keeping with promises, and will allow a closer and more peaceful interrelationship among the States of Europe as well as deeper and wider contacts across our continent, thus giving a dynamic meaning to detente.\n143.\tSecurity in Europe, based on a military balance, was given a new impetus in Helsinki aimed at consolidating it in accordance with the 10 principles approved, respect for which implies recognition of the existing situation. We have tried to normalize relations among the participating States and thus allow an increasing co-operation as a result of that recognition.\n144.\tFurthermore, the Conference also concerned itself with negotiations on the limitation of strategic weapons on a world-wide scale and those relating mutual and balanced reduction of forces in Europe, in order that political detente might be complemented by military detente aimed at putting a stop to the arms race and laying the bases of a possible progressive disarmament. If these efforts prove successful we might achieve one of the greatest objectives of our Organization.\n145.\tThe Conference dealt almost exclusively with the political balance because there was a military balance already and that balance was present throughout its work, based on the prevailing pluralism. However, certain groups and tendencies, counting on a blind eye being turned, have tried to condition the future of other countries through ideological offensives that are nothing more than interference in the domestic affairs of those States. It would be vain to try to disguise that danger since the polemics to which these offensives give rise make it more obvious every day.\n146.\tI think that this extreme position warrants some comment because the so-called decalog of Helsinki has been called the continuation of the Principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respect for the fundamental rights of States contained in that Charter. But we cannot adduce some principles while overlooking others or apply them out of context; nor can we expect a national interpretation of an international rule to serve as a criterion for some to impose their own views on others, thus violating the very structure of the international society composed as it is of equally sovereign, independent States. Along this correct line of conduct I can from this rostrum state the active willingness of the Spanish Government to put into practice all that the Final Act of the Conference embodies and contains.\n147.\tBut, as of this moment, we must watch carefully to see how the rules of the Conference are going to be applied by the participants. We will have to assess how the parties are complying with the contents of the Final Act and thus avoiding tensions which are no less dangerous to the maintenance of peace simply because they are of ideological origin. I believe that this clarification is of major importance because, on the pretext of so-called political doctrine, in the course of history not a few interventions in some States have been perpetrated by others. And now under its umbrella certain interventions are being planned, designed to impose a policy of preponderance by one State over another, that the circumstances of our period cannot accept. The principle of noninterference set forth in the Decalogue of Helsinki, which is the expression of one of the fundamental aspects of the independence enjoyed by all sovereign States, must serve as a block to such efforts.\n148.\tThis forum, whose principal duty is to maintain peace, is undoubtedly the most appropriate place to draw attention to this new type of threat to understanding and concord among nations which must primarily be based on mutual respect for their national entity and the political solutions that each has decided upon to safeguard it. Only a mutual tolerance and universal pluralism can lead to true peace and security for all.\n149.\tTo return to detente and in so far as it means peaceful coexistence, since it implies a more advanced stage of possibilities of understanding and dialog among the different systems, we must stress the present international situation and its positive and promising aspects. But it would be erroneous to overlook the fact that detente understood as the expression of balance among different systems has been unable to avoid and at times has even permitted local conflicts. Nor at the price of detente can we give tacit or explicit agreement to a distribution of zones of influence that would take into account only the security needs of the main protagonists at the expense of the vital interests of the smaller States. That is why the Final Act of the Conference sets forth the major requirement of respect for the security of all participating States.\n150.\tWith reference to the same geographical area, we must stress the way in which the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, in the course of its negotiations and in its Final Act, stressed the fact that there can be no security in Europe without security in the Mediterranean and that the process of improvement of security cannot be limited to Europe but must be extended to other parts of the world and in particular to the Mediterranean region.\n151.\tTo include in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe views and talks on the Mediterranean is no whim nor does it imply a concession. The Mediterranean region is deeply embedded in the life, history, culture and events of Europe, and it is in that sea where very often the very fate of the most important European matters have been decided.\n152.\tThe security of the Mediterranean therefore meets the same motivations as those of Europe and is based upon the same premises. But because of the conditions of the region and the heterogeneity of the political situation that exists there it may be more difficult, particularly in regard to a common interest such as that of the maintenance of peace. And so it is important that it be discussed at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe because the neighboring States which are not European are equally concerned with the sea being safeguarded from any possibility of confrontation and conflict.\n153.\tThe interests of all the coastal States require foreign Powers to stay away from the region and not air their own problems within the Mediterranean, thus maintaining the security necessary to preserve peace in the region. This is a great task because this means of communication through which the East and West meet has in the past been most vulnerable to confrontations. To counteract that constant danger is the work of all the parties concerned, since their mutual and general understanding would contribute in no small measure to preventing localized conflicts from taking place in the Mediterranean and thus disturbing the peaceful daily life of all the coastal States.\n154.\tSpain has therefore advocated the maintenance and widening of the contacts and dialogs started at Helsinki and in Geneva in order to contribute to peace, to reduce the armed forces in the region, to strengthen security, to ease tensions and to widen the scope of co-operation. To achieve that goal, we welcome the initiatives of the Mediterranean States and are ready to co-operate actively in the achievement of these purposes. This would mean that we should consider, among other possibilities, the holding of a conference on security and co-operation in the Mediterranean.\n155.\tThe United Nations can make a considerable contribution along these lines and should therefore encourage any peaceful activity conducive to the creation of a feeling of solidarity among the coastal States. The Intergovernmental Conference for the Preservation of the Environment in the Mediterranean moved along these lines when it was held in Barcelona this year, and served to prepare for the diplomatic conference which will also be held in the near future under the auspices of the relevant United Nations Program. But to its technical aspects there is added a no less significant political aspect because the will to work together presupposes the conviction we will act in common in order to evade the new dangers brought by the development of technology. That will create an attitude of solidarity which, in itself, constitutes a stabilizing factor that will effectively assist in maintaining peace in the region.\n156.\tYear after year, the representatives of Spain have reaffirmed from this rostrum the long-standing and constant friendship between our country and the Arab nations, the result of the historical coincidence of our civilizations and of the continued existence of a dialog born of a true spirit of co-operation far removed from selfish interests.\n157.\tThat affinity led Spain to advocate at all times anything that might contribute to a peaceful, just and lasting solution to the situation in the Middle East which, bearing in mind the legitimate interests and rights of the Palestinian peoples and of the countries of the region, will keep away from it any threats of tension and conflict and thus ensure peace.\n158.\tNor can we overlook the fact that in the decolonization of the Western Sahara the future of a people who are part of the Arab nation is at stake; they are linked to it by ties of blood, religion and culture. Respect and support by sister nations of the right of the Saharans to determine their own future, will attest to that true solidarity of the Arab nation in which Western Sahara will achieve its vocation and take its proper place.\n159.\tThus, in this statement I arrive at the world of Latin America to which we are tied by bonds of such a special nature flowing from a common origin, tradition and culture which have always led to privileged treatment among ourselves, and on which our foreign policy is predicated.\n160.\tWe are convinced that this common heritage, of high and positive value, offers wide scope for joint action in all aspects of international law and international life, whose increasing interdependence, today more than ever, calls for the concerting of individual and collective efforts. The countries of Latin America have understood matters thus and have set in motion a number of regional efforts that Spain is observing very carefully, ready as it always is to co-operate with these peoples in the problems of development.\n161.\tConsistent with this, the Spanish Government has maintained an open and active policy of cooperation on an economic level with Latin America, both bilaterally and multi nationally, a co-operation that involves the supply of human, technical and financial resources. The Latin American peoples can be assured that in Spain they will always find a neighbor and companion in the noble and difficult task of development to which they are now devoted.\n162.\tThe strict application by my country of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and our conviction that ideological plurality must not be an insurmountable obstacle to the peaceful coexistence of peoples make co-operation all the more effective and easier.\n163.\tTherefore, Spain, as a European nation, also adds its own unwavering commitment to the Latin American continent as we stressed at Helsinki when we reminded our sister republics on the other side of the Atlantic and, recalling their existence, stated to them that we would always bear them in mind when the time comes to extend the benefits that European co-operation and security may bring.\n164.\tIn the last 30 years the United Nations has done great work in the maintenance of peace. There have been many flaws; there have been many difficulties through which the Organization has had to pass, but the best guarantee that we have overcome these is its continued existence and its remarkable capacity to undertake new tasks and to adapt itself to an ever-changing world. Many of the hopes expressed in the Charter, such as freedom, security and the satisfaction of the material and spiritual needs of individuals and of peoples, are as yet still to be achieved.\n165.\tFortunately, the principles and basic concepts contained in the Charter are also gaining ground daily in the minds of peoples and of their leaders. As the Secretary-General, in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [Al 100011Add J], pointed out, although there is still some old and lasting mistrust and concern, we do possess the encouraging hope that the United Nations will be able to take the decisive step towards the achievement of true cooperation among its Members which will allow it, with equity and justice, to solve the many problems con-fronting it. In a world in which to the dangerous accumulation of warlike instruments is now added the threat of economic chaos, solidarity is necessary in order, in due course, to solve the problems raised by the fulfillment of the legitimate aspirations of all peoples to international social justice.\n166.\tSpain has a universalism calling which is embedded in its history as well as in the thinking of its men, and it is ready to continue to co-operate in this great international undertaking and, through this Organization, we hope to advance along the road to co-operation and peace."

        "file_text": "130.\t Mr. President, allow me first of all to address to you the warmest congratulations of my delegation on the responsible mission the General Assembly has unanimously entrusted to you by electing you to the presidency of its thirtieth session. This choice is a proof of the esteem which the States Members of our Organization have for you. It is also the expression of a tribute they have sought through you to pay to the dynamic and constructive policies of your country in favor of international co-operation. At the same time, for us it constitutes the guarantee that our deliberations will take place in the best possible conditions of effectiveness because of your talent and your competence, and in particular because of the political open-mindedness that has always characterized your actions.\n131.\tMy congratulations also go to your predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika. to whom it is a great pleasure for me to pay a tribute for the actions he undertook in order to ensure the success of our work during the last regular and special sessions.\n132.\tI hope the Secretary-General will be kind enough to accept our great appreciation of and our gratitude for the tireless action he has undertaken to ensure the triumph of the principles of the United Nations in order to promote lasting peace throughout the world.\n133.\tWe extend a warm welcome to the new Members, whose admission to our Organization is the result of the long struggle they have courageously and heroically waged against colonialism. It is a matter of great satisfaction for us to welcome the delegations of the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. My country intends to develop with those fraternal States the most extensive co-operation and the closest relations possible.\n134.\tIn the past year progress has been achieved in the establishment of a new era of peace in the world. 1 would refer first and foremost to the restoration of peace in South-Bast Asia, thanks to which the peoples of Viet Nam and Cambodia will finally be able to devote themselves to achieving the exalting work of national reconstruction. My country, which is fully aware of the long suffering which has been endured by these peoples, will continue to give them all necessary support in their development and reconstruction efforts.\n135.\tThe African continent has also scored new successes on the path to liberation through the accession of new countries to independence and national sovereignty.\n136.\tThe Conference cm Security and Co-operation in Europe, held at Helsinki last July, represents a step towards the strengthening of peace throughout the world. Its effects, however, will not make themselves fully felt in international relations unless the States signing the Final Act resolve to apply the principles adopted, not only in their mutual relations, but also in the relations which they entertain with the rest of the world.\n137.\tIn the Middle East, praiseworthy efforts have been made to restore peace. But we must confess that peace is still a long way off because the real problems have not been tackled, particularly the question of recognizing the inalienable rights, of the Palestinian people.\n138.\tThe situation is equally disquieting in Africa and, although colonialism has given ground, foreign domination persists over vast areas of territory, and racism remains one of the fundamental principles of the governments of certain States.\n139.\tIn the field of economic and social development, we believe that the efforts made by the international community to establish a new economic order, and the results obtained, particularly during the seventh special session of the General Assembly, constitute an important step towards the establishment of this new international economic order.\n140.\tThe seventh special session of the General Assembly has just concluded its work in an atmosphere of mutual understanding which, we venture to hope, will be a red-letter day in the history of relations among peoples. As a result, the sterility of a series of monologues has given way to the fruitful exchange of a genuinely constructive dialog.\n141.\tThus, new prospects are now opening up before mankind of banishing confrontations from the international scene and devoting ourselves to broader cooperation in all fields of economic and social activity. This is the only way to achieve progressive elimination of the injustices and the inequalities which have hitherto hampered the advent of an equitable economic order that would guarantee peoples throughout the world an era of progress, peace and prosperity.\n142.\tThis special session has thus made it possible to presage the advent of a new international economic order by means of the collective definition of specific steps all aimed at bringing about an economic institutional restructuring of international life, in order to ensure stable and equitable incomes for the developing countries, to safeguard and improve the terms of trade, to stimulate the transfer of science and technology, to stem inflation, and to inject a new morality into the international monetary system.\n143.\tConsequently, it is important that the dynamic process born of the spirit of the seventh special session, as well as the political will and desire for co-operation and understanding which was characteristic of its work, should be channeled towards serving the interests and the welfare of our peoples, by means of our continuing and persistent efforts.\n144.\tDefinition of this new co-operation and strategy, it must be noted, was possible only because of the new spirit of mutual understanding and of compromise which allowed us to arrive at a broad consensus. We hardly need to stress that it cannot be implemented without other meetings to discuss formulas which will make it possible to reconcile differing viewpoints and which will help to concert interests that can hardly be regarded as conflicting.\n145.\tMorocco, while affirming its total adherence to the principles contained in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, hopes, in the spirit of constructive dialog which now prevails among the members of the international community, that the misgivings expressed by certain developed countries in connexion with that Charter will be dispelled, so that the principles contained therein can be implemented in the interests of all parties.\n146.\tThe situation in the Middle East is still fraught with increasingly serious threats to world peace, despite the progress which has been recently accomplished. Israel continues to occupy vast territories belonging to three States Members of our Organization, despite the unanimous condemnation of the international community which was reflected in the numerous resolutions adopted by both regional organizations and international bodies, and in particular by the United Nations. In spite of universal disapproval, Israel continues its murderous raids against Arab countries and does not balk at using the most destructive type of weapons even against civilian populations,\n147.\tWhile our Organization has been equal to its responsibilities in condemning such criminal acts, we see with indignation that the resolutions adopted in this connexion have remained ineffectual, and have merely been added to the many previous resolutions that have been passed since 1948.\n148.\tThe occupation of the holy city of Jerusalem, the east bank of the Jordan, the Golan Heights, and the major part of the Sinai peninsula constitutes a telling illustration of Israel's policies of annexation and expansionism.\n149.\tMorocco supports all the efforts which are being made to achieve a global, just and lasting solution to the Middle East problem. We would reiterate that such a solution cannot consist only of the total evacuation of the occupied territories and the holy city of Jerusalem, but necessarily implies the unequivocal recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people.\n150.\tRecent initiatives in the Middle East undoubtedly introduce a new element into the efforts made to bring about the evacuation of occupied Arab territories. But we are disturbed to see that, despite long and arduous negotiations, and despite the good faith and positive attitude of the victim of the aggression, Israel continues to occupy approximately 90 per cent of the Sinai,\n151.\tAnd if such a limited result has required eight years of difficult and lengthy negotiations from the mission of Mr. Jarring, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, right up to the numerous trips made by Mr. Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, this would seem to indicate that the Middle East will continue under the threat of an explosive situation, endangering international peace and security in a way involving incalculable political, economic, and human consequences.\n152.\tWe must, therefore, remain vigilant. This is the price of peace. It is our duty to give full effect to the resolutions adopted by our Organization.\n153.\tMorocco and the international community cannot be indifferent to the tragedy of the Palestinian people, who, for approximately 30 years now, have been victims of international Zionism and who live scattered throughout the world. Israel stops at nothing in its attempts to destroy that people both physically and politically. But the determination of our Palestinian brothers to recover their national rights, the heroism and the abnegation they have displayed, have led to a world-wide awareness of the realities of the Palestine situation.\n154.\tResolution 3237 (XXIX) in which the General Assembly called upon the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] to participate in all its work and at all international conferences held under its aegis, and General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX) reaffirming the inalienable right of the Palestinian people in Palestine, including their right to independence and sovereignty, are both of profound political significance. They have made it possible for the Palestinian question to be transferred from the realm of charitable or humanitarian considerations to the realm to which it really belongs, that of an acute political problem which threatens international peace and security and requires of us an urgent solution.\n155.\tMorocco, faithful to the resolution of the seventh Conference of Arab Heads of State or Government, held at Rabat in October 1974, would here solemnly restate its view that there can be no global and final solution to the question of the Middle East unless an independent Palestinian national authority is set up under the aegis of the PLO.\n156.\tThe tragedy which has been visited upon our brothers in Lebanon is only a consequence of the pernicious and diabolical Israeli designs to disrupt the unity of the Lebanese nation and to sow hatred and discord among the citizens of the same country. That is why Israel is seeking to destroy the structures of the Lebanese State, since it symbolizes understanding and harmonious and peaceful coexistence among communities professing different creeds. In so doing, the Zionist State is attempting to give the impression that even the concept of coexistence in Palestine would lack realism and objectivity. Thus, the covert action and treacherous maneuvers which\nave been instigated by Israel tn Lebanon are quite definitely further proof of the unsavory role played y Israel in the Middle East.\n157.\tThe Israeli-Arab conflict, unfortunately, is not the only source of tension in the Mediterranean. The situation in Cyprus continues to divide two communities which common sense and mutual interests would prompt to a peaceful and harmonious coexistence. Morocco expresses the hope that the inter- communal talks, initiated under the auspices of the Secretary-General, may continue until a just and final solution to this painful conflict can be found.\n158.\tActing on the premise that security in Europe and the restoration of peace in the Mediterranean are indivisible, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe sought, to a certain point, to take due account of the concerns expressed by the non- participating Mediterranean countries.\n159.\tWe regret, however, that the Conference did not include the coastal Mediterranean countries, which, quite obviously, are vitally concerned by most of the problems which it discussed.\n160.\tNevertheless, we took note of the fact that the participant Stales proclaimed their intention to maintain and to broaden the dialog which has been started with the other coastal countries in order to contribute to peace, to the reduction of armed forces in the area, and to the broadening of co-operation. Thus, the Conference recognized that the cultural and economic ties and the imperative need for security on both sides of the Mediterranean legitimized the interest of Morocco and other coastal countries in security and the development of good relations throughout the region.\n161.\tThe changes occurring in Portugal have brought about a noteworthy acceleration of the process of decolonization in Africa. But it is intolerable that other Territories are still subject to colonialism or still endure the odious system of racism and apartheid. The continuation of this situation involves the grave risks of tension and conflict in our continent and constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.\n162.\tThe Kingdom of Morocco is resolved to pursue its action in order to bring about the total liberation of Africa and to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination from that continent. I should like here to express our regret that a number of countries continue to co-operate with racist regimes, thus helping to consolidate their economies and their capacity to repress indigenous populations.\n163.\tIn referring to the problems of our continent, I should like to express the deep distress which we experience in learning each day of the events which afflict Angola at a time when it is on the eve of its accession to independence. My country urgently appeals to the national movements, each one of which is aware of the patriotic spirit and sacrifices made during their liberation struggle, to put an end to their internecine quarrels.\n164.\tThe time has come for all to tum this gloomy page of history marked by fratricidal struggle and to turn boldly towards the future and fully shoulder the new responsibilities incumbent upon them in order to build a stable State with a prosperous economy for the benefit of their peoples. The Kingdom of Morocco is fully prepared to make its contribution to the effort of national reconstruction which will have to be immediately undertaken in Angola.\n165.\tI referred just now to Territories still under colonial domination. The Western Sahara is precisely a part of those Territories,\n166.\tSince its partial decolonization in 1956, the Kingdom of Morocco has constantly worked beside all the liberation movements which are struggling against colonialism and has been actively involved in the work of the liberation committee of the Organization of African Unity [OAU\\.\n167.\tMay 1 recall that the OAU has had fresh life breathed into it since the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU held at Rabat from 12 to 15 June 1972; furthermore, it has now become commonplace to speak of the \\\"spirit of Rabat\\\".\n168.\tFaithful as it is to the same policy. Morocco is supporting the efforts of the third-world countries to strengthen their sovereignty and to defend their integrity against any attempts at disintegration or divisiveness.\n169.\tThis policy must be seen as part and parcel of the principles and declarations of our Organization. The principles, of national unity and territorial integrity are an integral part of the binding law which is the very foundation of the actions of the United Nations and the agencies affiliated with it. This, in particular, makes it possible for us to thwart all maneuvers aimed at perpetuating direct or indirect domination on the part of the colonial Powers.\n170.\tThe peoples of Zaire, Nigeria and Indonesia were able to triumph precisely over these maneuvers by seeking, through struggle and great sacrifice, to ensure their right to national unity and territorial integrity. In so doing they received the effective support of both the OAU and our Organization.\n171.\tIn these circumstances, Morocco can justifiably request the support of the international community to help it achieve its own territorial integrity in the context of the application of these self-same principles.\n172.\tIn this connexion, we are indeed grateful to those States which unequivocally supported the just claims of Morocco in connexion with its Territories in the north still under Spanish domination: the towns of Ceuta and Melilla, the Jaafarines Islands and the Rocks of Velez and Alhoceima.\n173.\tWe would express our thanks to the Islamic Conference, the OAU and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries held at Lima from 25 to 30 August 1975, which, in the course of this year, have given their unanimous and complete support to the just claims of my country.\n174.\tThe Political Declaration of Lima, which defined the strategy to strengthen international peace and security and to intensify solidarity and mutual assistance among non-aligned countries, states:\n\\\"Furthermore, considering the repressive acts committed by the Spanish authorities in the towns of Ceuta and Melilla, on the Jaafarines Islands and on the Rocks of Alhoceima and Velez under the Moroccan jurisdiction, the non-aligned countries express their full support for the claims of the Kingdom of Morocco to recover its territorial integrity over its towns, islands and enclaves and request Spain to enter into direct negotiations with Morocco to arrange for their immediate restitution.\\\" All0217 and Corr.l, annex, para. 43.]\n175.\tThe Government of His Majesty the King of Morocco reaffirms its rights of sovereignty over those Territories and, strengthened by the support of the overwhelming majority of the States Members of our Organization, declares itself prepared immediately to undertake negotiations with the Spanish Government. Spain cannot reject this dialog, because it is precisely the same process which it is advocating to settle the question of Gibraltar.\n176.\tFor 10 years now the General Assembly has had before it the question of the decolonization of Western Sahara. Morocco, while supporting the initiatives taken by our Organization to bring about true decolonization, has constantly maintained that Western Sahara is a fundamental part of the Moroccan nation. For its part, the administering Power has remained heedless of all the resolutions which have been passed previously and has obstinately aimed at a thorough distortion of the necessary conditions for their implementation. All the delays that have occurred in the process of decolonization are therefore ascribable to Spain.\n177.\tIn fact, far from promoting the liberation of the colonized peoples, Spain has endeavored to condition them by resorting particularly to the classic procedure of so-called representative assemblies. At the same time it has stepped up its military and economic control It has endeavored to turn the referendum into a tool which it can fashion according to its whim and which it can use when and how it chooses in order to elicit a predetermined response. Of course, this so-called process of decolonization, which has furthermore been constantly deferred, has involved no negotiations with Morocco or Mauritania, parties directly concerned, and the United Nations itself has not been able to intervene, unless it be to give its blessing to decisions taken by the administering Power. It is this situation which the Moroccan and Mauritanian Governments, with the support of other Governments, forcefully denounced during the last session of the General Assembly.\n178.\tIn view of the specific character of Western Sahara, the General Assembly was induced during its last session to seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on certain legal aspects of the problem [resolution 3292 (XXIX)]. It will be up to our Assembly, in the light of the advisory opinion that will be handed down, to advocate specific political measures, while at the same time, however, respecting the fundamental right to territorial integrity of both Morocco and Mauritania.\n179.\tHis Majesty the King of Morocco was moved, furthermore, just before the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, to recall vividly how Morocco unanimously views the problem of the decolonization of Western Sahara. Spanish colonization did not involve an empty space which the colonizer settled or organized in any way. That colonization subjugated peoples who already had a political and social organization of a type which undoubtedly was appropriate to the region and the era in question and whose existence could in no wise be challenged. In other words, Western Sahara was never a terra nullius. Furthermore, the entire political and social organization which antedated the Spanish colonization showed that it was Moroccan soil that the colonizer had usurped. In point of fact, the geographical, ethnic and cultural unity of the liberated part of Morocco and that part of it still under Spanish domination is crystal clear. The same Teknas tribes live in both parts and have always been subject to Moroccan political and administrative organization. That organization itself acquired distinctive features by being exercised over widely scattered populations, who lived a nomadic life over vast expanses of desert.\n180.\tMorocco is convinced that it has given the International Court of Justice clear evidence of the numerous ties which unite it with Western Sahara, despite the very difficult technical circumstances which it had to cope with. There can be no doubt that one of the effects of colonization is the confiscation of history. The negligent or willful destruction of documents, their absorption into the archives of the administering Power, which, when it has to, produces only those which are favorable to it, undoubtedly do not help to serve the cause of those States which have been frustrated and are demanding compensation for that frustration.\n181.\tMorocco, however, co-operated fully with the International Court of Justice in the performance ot its mission. On the other hand, it was with some regret that we viewed the negative attitude of the administering Power, which endeavored to convince the Court not to give the General Assembly the assistance it had requested of it. It would be tedious to recall here how, by turns, the Spanish Government first sought to persuade the Court that the Assembly had submitted to it for its opinion a Spanish-Moroccan dispute, in other words a territorial dispute, and then argued that what was before the Court was purely academic and without interest, These technical legal points need not have been recalled here if, behind them, we- did not glimpse the constant desire of using all means to reduce the process of decolonization to a sort of authoritarian monologue in which the administering Power itself asks the questions and gives the answers, seeks for no negotiation and brooks no discussion.\n182.\tIt is in the same spirit that, at the time when the case was being reviewed by the Court, the Spanish Government threatened to shed forthwith its responsibilities in Western Sahara, taking as a pretext a deterioration of the situation in the Territory. In this connexion it outlined certain prospects which quite clearly boiled down to a direct and arbitrary institution of a political authority in Western Sahara, a classic and convenient procedure whereby it could appear to give the Impression of withdrawing while still remaining present through intermediaries.\n183.\tIt is in the same way that Spain has systematically refused for many years to receive the Visiting Mission that the General Assembly decided should be sent to Western Sahara, It was only this year that that Mission was finally able to discharge its functions and to visit the Territory. Thus, the Assembly is now furnished with and will shortly have before it the report of the Mission [AII0023, chap. XIII, annex], whose work we cannot over-praise for its moral integrity and its fidelity.\n184.\tI should now particularly like to explain the state of mind in which the Moroccan Government will take up the discussion of the problem of the decolonization of Western Sahara.\n185.\tNeedless to say, Morocco considers that this decolonization involves not only areas bordering on its own territory. We would reaffirm that it is not only a question, as in the case of any process of. decolonization, of rendering justice to the people who have been colonized themselves, but also, by the same token, of rendering justice to a nation which has been mutilated by the colonizers. The opinion of the Inter-national Court of Justice will indicate under what juridical heading we will have to place Western Sahara's ties with Morocco and Mauritania. But, over and above all categories and concepts, there is one certainty which every Moroccan, whatever be his station or his opinion, bears in his heart, and that is that there cannot be any true decolonization of the territory and population of Western Sahara as long as the rift created by the colonization persists.\n186.\tI hardly need to remind this Assembly to what extent the new international law, the international law characterized by the liberation of colonized peoples, is inspired by a sense of national unity, and how often, in connexion with the question of respect for territorial integrity, the United Nations has paid a tribute to national unity, Nothing would be more unfair or more injurious to understanding among nations than to carry out a process of decolonization without taking, first and foremost, due account of this desire to reunite what has been separated and to put together what has been broken into pieces.\n187.\tOf course, at this stage of our discussion Morocco does not intend to submit any detailed procedure to the General Assembly. There will be adequate time to do so when our work has taken on a more technical turn, particularly in the Fourth Committee. For the time being, we cannot but ask the Assembly to pay due attention to two essential facts.\n188.\tThe first is that the process of decolonization of Western Sahara, as, furthermore, is demonstrated in the general terms of resolution 1514 (XV), is not something which can be decided by a sort of automatic machinery. We are faced here with a specific problem, in connexion with which all the necessary elements must be weighed and which cannot be fitted into a strait-jacket.\n189.\tThe second fact is that of the hope which my country cherishes. Few peoples have paid as heavy a price under colonization as the Moroccan people. For Morocco, colonization took the most cynical forms of division and mutilation, the very negation of national identity. The continuous struggle of the Moroccan people thus made it possible, in 1956, for an end to be put to the dual French and Spanish Protectorate, for us to recover the zone of Tangier, which had been placed under an international statute, and, finally, by means of direct negotiations with Spain, to obtain the restoration of the Saharan provinces of Tarfaya in 1958 and Ifni in January 1969.\n190.\tIt is therefore with patience, and also, at the same time, with full confidence in the work of liberation and justice pursued by the United Nations, that Morocco has awaited the completion of its territorial integrity.\n191.\tHow great would be our disappointment were the Organization to embark on a course likely to lead to a rejection of its national unity. That is a disappointment we shall not have to suffer. The work of liberation and the work of justice are one and the same.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, let me express, at the outset of my remarks, the pleasure and confidence that the Government of Canada derives from the fact that you have been elected to preside over this session of the General Assembly. This session marks the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, and its proceedings could not be entrusted lo more capable hands. We know that you will bring to the deliberations of this global Organization the judgment and wisdom which the councils of Europe have been for so long the beneficiaries.\n2.\tWe are pleased to welcome among us the delegations from Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and Mozambique following the accession of those States to membership in the United Nations. Their presence here represents a further important step by this Organization on the road towards universality of membership,\n3.\tYou are, Mr. President, taking office at a time when our Organization is at a decisive juncture in international affairs. Increasingly, our preoccupations are with global economic and social disparities and opportunities. These are also political questions of grave concern comparable, and indeed related in scope and importance, to those of international peace and security.\n4.\tLast week, at our seventh special session on these very issues, we at last made some headway towards the reduction of these disparities. We agreed on steps necessary to move towards a new international economic order. We were able to agree because the time was ripe indeed overripe to move forward in a creative way on these complex issues.\n5.\tWe must now commit our attention and energies to sustaining this will and to implementing the decisions that we have taken to reform our world economic system to reflect our interdependence. We must recognize, too, our respective peoples' need to be brought into these efforts. We have given undertakings on their behalf, undertakings to provide those of the world's peoples who constitute a majority those who are in want their full measure of social and economic justice.\n6.\tI think we all appreciate the urgency of this funda-mental task; otherwise, we would not have achieved the remarkable degree of co-operation which characterized our intense and most serious efforts during the special session. It is important that we pursue our objective and we have only just begun in the same spirit of co-operation and mutual respect. This is the most effective way for our Organization to work. This is also the most effective way to ensure that our peoples retain their confidence in our Organization's ability to solve our urgent and overriding problems.\n7.\tWe know clearly that there is a need to enhance the role and capacity of the United Nations in the economic and social fields and thus bring them into a better and more balanced relationship with the political objectives and functions of the Organization.\n8.\tAt its seventh special session the General Assembly established an Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System to initiate a restructuring process of this very kind. One of the main documents before it will be the report of the Group of Experts on the Structure of the United Nations System, entitled A New United Nations Structure for Global Economic Co-operation.' The experts have correctly identified the main weaknesses of the United Nations system and have made a number of recommendations and suggestions which would improve the balance between the functional, sectoral and political elements in the system.\n9.\tI should like to commend to the new intergovernmental committee as well the report of a group of experts convened by the member States of the Commonwealth entitled, \\\"Towards a New International Economic Order\\\", which has been circulated as a United Nations document.\n10.\tConvinced as we are that the United Nations must be made more responsive to the needs and concerns of its Members, my Government intends to play an active and constructive part in the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization so that it may carry forward its Programs in working towards a new economic order.\n11.\tThe building of a new international economic order is but one of the many important preoccupations of the international community at the present time.\nPopulation, food, human settlements and the law of the sea are other global problems that demand the attention of the United Nations. Of these many global problems, I should like now to speak about the law of the sea, in which Canada plays a particular role.\n12.\tOne of the most important but least recognized functions of the United Nations is the regular and persistent efforts it makes to contribute to a stable world order through the progressive development of international law. The law of the sea is a dynamic example.\n13.\tWe are developing new rules which reflect the growing awareness of the interdependence of nations and the need for preservation of the marine environment and the conservation of its resources. I have no hesitation in affirming the view of the Canadian Government that the viability of an increasingly interdependent world order rests on the creation of an international economic system which provides a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities to all people. This principle must be reflected in the new law of the sea.\n14.\tThe role of the United Nations is central to the process of developing a new body of international law which will reflect broad recognition that the oceans of the world, which cover 70 per cent of the earth's surface, are vital to man's survival. Binding legal rules must be established. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has already achieved broad agreement on revolutionary new legal concepts, such as the economic zone and the common heritage of mankind, concepts which must form the basis of the constitution of the seas. The new law must lay down duties to go hand in hand with every new right recognized. It must be based on principles of equity rather than power.\n15.\tThe task is a formidable one and may prove to be beyond the reach of the United Nations. I think not. What is clear, however, is that without the United Nations the task would be impossible and the world would be involved in a series of conflicting claims and counter-claims which could produce serious threats to peace.\n16.\tMy Government is now preparing for the crucial fourth round of negotiations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea beginning here in New York next March. We do so knowing that to reach final agreement all participants must act responsibly, flexibly and, above all, with a real sense of urgency.\n17.\tNo Government is more committed than my own to achieving agreement on a viable and balanced global regime for the seas. But I would be less than candid if I did not state clearly that the Canadian Government, like many other Governments, cannot be expected to wait indefinitely for agreement. I hope our actions have demonstrated that the Canadian Government is conscious of its responsibilities to the international community. But the Canadian Government is also conscious of its responsibilities to the Canadian people. The economic and social survival of whole communities in certain coastal areas of Canada depends on the successful outcome of the Conference or, failing such success, some alternative course of action. It is because of these national and international responsibilities that my Government is now engaged, as a matter of the utmost priority, in a series of talks with countries fishing off our coasts to prepare the way for an extension of our fisheries jurisdiction based upon the consensus emerging at the Conference.\n18.\tI wish to reiterate the faith of the Canadian Government in the United Nations and the opportunity it offers to negotiate multilateral solutions to the complex problems of the law of the sea. A multilateral agreement would be of lasting benefit to this and future generations. Only if the multilateral approach fails and at a certain point further delay or procrastination is failure will my Government and, I assume, other Governments resort to other solutions to protect fundamental national interests. The Governments and peoples of the world are not prepared to wait much longer for the results of the Conference. We must act quickly and in concert. If we do and I am convinced we can we shall achieve what the Secretary- General has rightly called \\\"one of the most important conventions ever devised by the international community\\\".\n19.\tIn 1945 the founders of the United Nations, profoundly influenced by the holocaust of war, were determined that the central task of the international Organization would be the maintenance of international peace and security. They devised so they believed a system for the settlement of disputes between nations without recourse to the use of force. Thirty years later this fundamental problem still faces the United Nations. Two crucial aspects of this problem are disarmament and peace-keeping. These aspects of the problem were the principal themes of my address to the Assembly last year, but such is their importance that I make no apology for reverting to them.\n20.\tFew issues before this Assembly give rise to aspirations so great or frustrations so deep as the question of disarmament. We aspire to agreements that will check the use of force, reduce tensions and free resources for productive social and economic purposes. But our hopes are frustrated by the relentless drive towards new heights of destructive power. Nuclear weapons exist in the tens of thousands and we are faced with the frightening possibility that they will spread to more countries. The advanced countries continue to spend enormous amounts of money on armaments of all kinds, and the military expenditures of some developing countries are rapidly increasing.\n21.\tIs it any wonder that ordinary people everywhere, with deep unease and impatience, await real progress towards disarmament?\n22.\tThe Strategic Arms Limitation Talks have been of major importance in promoting a climate of strategic stability and political detente. But they have not halted the competition in nuclear armaments. Nor have they achieved steps of actual nuclear disarmament.\n23.\tThe problems involved are infinitely complex, but the need for solutions is pressing. We urge the United States and the Soviet Union to conclude their present negotiations and to proceed without delay to achieving steps of nuclear disarmament. We also urge the nuclear-weapons Powers to re-examine the technical and political obstacles to an agreement to end nuclear-weapons testing.\n24.\tEfforts to curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons must be accompanied by efforts to ensure that the further dissemination of nuclear technology is devoted solely to peaceful purposes. The Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons reaffirmed the Treaty's vital role as the basic instrument of the non- proliferation system. It made clear that all parties, both nuclear-weapons States and non-nuclear-weapons States, must meet their obligations fully under the Treaty. This is essential if the dangers of proliferation are to be averted.\n25.\tThe Review Conference also reaffirmed the role of the Treaty as the basis for wider co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Canada will fulfill its obligations under the Treaty to facilitate, to the extent it is able, international co-operation in the exchange of nuclear technology and materials for peaceful purposes, particularly between the advanced and developing countries. The need for such co-operation has clearly been increased by the change in world energy costs.\n26.\tHowever, I would at the same time stress that we have an obligation to ensure that the co-operation we enter into does not contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons or to the manufacture of nuclear explosive devices for whatever purposes.\n27.\tPreoccupation with the dangers of nuclear weapons must not blind us to the growing threat from use of conventional force. Urgent and closer attention must now be given to the search for arms control and the reduction of forces in order to promote regional stability and mutual security. Now that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has been concluded, we look for substantial progress from the negotiations in Vienna on the reduction of forces in Central Europe.\n28.\tThe basic responsibility for reducing the dangers and burdens of armaments rests primarily with the major military Powers. But we must recognize the various constraints under which they operate if we wish effective arms limitation and disarmament agreements. Advances in military technology often complicate efforts to find the technical and military basis for agreement and satisfactory means of verifying commitments. Agreements must promote or be compatible with the security interests of participating States. Disarmament negotiations are unlikely to succeed unless political conditions are conducive to progress.\n29.\tBut that is no argument for inaction in this Assembly. It is no argument for accepting the present and totally unsatisfactory rate of progress in achieving disarmament measures. The General Assembly must continue as the forum of international concern and as a spur to action in the field of disarmament.\n30.\tIf our anxiety about the prospects for progress in disarmament continues unrelieved, we can draw some comfort from the recent movement towards peaceful settlement in the Middle East. No one who has the interests of world security at heart can fail to be encouraged by the statesmanlike conduct of the leaders of Egypt and Israel, which produced the new interim Sinai agreement. We also recognize the dedication of the United States Secretary of State, whose tireless efforts have once again contributed towards a positive result. It is a fragile beginning, to be sure. By itself, it does little to settle the underlying issues; and these issues must be resolved if peace and security are to come to the Middle East. But we see in the agreement grounds for hope. We see the agreement as the first stage in a series of interlocking negotiations and agreements which would involve all the parties to the dispute and embrace all the fundamental issues, difficult though this will be. The end would be a just settlement which would enable the destructive passions of the past to be overcome and permit all peoples in the area to live as neighbors in peace and security.\n31.\tFor all those concerned about United Nations peace-keeping there is another reason for drawing satisfaction from the Sinai agreement. Peace-keeping is one of the few useful instruments that the international community has developed to help promote peaceful solutions to disputes. It is designed to assist the parties to a dispute to draw back from conflict when they recognize that this is in their best interests and to help create circumstances in which their differences can be settled by negotiation.\n32.\tBut all too often peace-keeping reduces the incentives of the disputants to move beyond the mere cessation of hostilities to a serious search for a political settlement. Consequently skeptics charge that United Nations peace-keeping does little more than perpetuate an uneasy status quo.\n33.\tIf peace-keeping is to be truly effective it must be accompanied by a parallel effort on the political level, especially by the parties most directly concerned, to convert the temporary peace that a peacekeeping force is asked to maintain, into something more durable.\n34.\tSince the initial cease-fire agreement in the fall of 1973, the United Nations Emergency Force [UNEF] has fulfilled its task of providing a buffer between the disputants and of helping to produce a period of relative calm in which negotiations could be pursued. The parties concerned took full advantage of the peace-keeping operation: they negotiated and reached a new interim agreement. The significance of this for peace-keeping is that UNEF has not merely perpetuated the status quo\\ it will now go on to make the new agreement effective and to provide the basis for further steps in peace-keeping. In short, UNEF is doing the job for which it is intended, that is, helping to create the circumstances for a search, at the political level, for a solution to the Middle East problem.\n35.\tThe United Nations Disengagement Observer Force has also played its part in helping to create an atmosphere in which further negotiations can take place.\n36.\tThe question of Cyprus is once again before us at the thirtieth session. The problems are complex and will engage the attention of all delegations. Here again, the effectiveness of the peace-keeping force which has been carrying on its task on the ground in conditions of great difficulty will depend essentially on the co-operation and will of the parties directly concerned.\n37.\tPeace-keeping can only continue, of course, if it has the full support of all Member States, including their practical support in the form of prompt payment of peace-keeping assessments and contributions. Without the necessary financial resources, neither the United Nations nor individual force contributors can be expected to carry the responsibilities they have been asked to assume.\n38.\tI should like to comment now on one particular problem affecting the management of the affairs of our evolving Organization. Efforts have been made over the years to treat technical problems and political issues separately. The specialized agencies and technical conferences have been mainly devoted to their own immediate concerns, while political issues have been discussed primarily in those organs with the competence to deal with such matters the Security Council and the General Assembly.\n39.\tWe well recognize that, even in technical conferences, Member States must take account of political realities, and that in some cases the line of separation between the political and technical cannot always be too rigidly drawn, But we shall do a serious disservice to our system of co-operation within the United Nations system if we fail to distinguish in a clear and unmistakable manner between, on the one hand, the authority and competence of the Security Council and the General Assembly in those political fields prescribed by the Charter, and, on the other, the competence and authority of technical conferences in their respective fields.\n40.\tIn the meantime, it is the hope of my Government that in the spirit of co-operation that has so happily characterized the deliberations of the seventh special session, we shall all voluntarily refrain from the introduction of unrelated political considerations into the proceedings of the specialized agencies as well as the organs that have been assigned specific responsibility for implementing the decisions of the special session. We should allow these bodies to get on with their technical work. That would surely be in the best interests of each United Nations Member and of the Organization as a whole.\n41.\tThe celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations prompts all of us to reflect upon the place of this Organization in the life of the international community. Its critics have been many and persistent; its supporters sometimes wavering. But, whatever its short-comings over the years, we must recognize the simple fact that, in our quest for peace and security and our search for solutions to the great economic and social issues of our time, this universal forum is irreplaceable, and is essential to each of the Governments and peoples we represent.\n\\\"It is widely acknowledged that in our present world there is no rational alternative in international relations to the principles and procedures of the United Nations. Discussion and compromise are the only known alternatives to oppression, conflict and bloodshed. Unilateral and bilateral diplomacy are no longer enough and must be supplemented by collective action and multilateral diplomacy. All this has been acknowledged in principle by\nGovernments of Member States through their adherence to the Charter. As each day passes, (he force of circumstances also compels the Governments of the world to recognize their increasing interdependence. This too has been acknowledged in recent activities at the United Nations and is the clear theme of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly.\\\" [Aj100011Add. I, Sect. XXL]\nI would also conclude by saying that it is also the clear theme of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "78.\t  It gives me great pleasure, Sir, to express my warmest congratulations on your election as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. I join my colleagues in extending congratulations and appreciation to both you and your capable predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, as well as to the Secretary- General, Dr. Kurt Waldheim. In this we are prompted by our regard and esteem for any effort exerted to promote the march of mankind towards a better future in which peace, security and prosperity will prevail.\n179.\tIn the mean time, may I express, in the name of the State of Qatar, its Emir, Government and people, a warm welcome and heartiest congratulations to the Member States which have recently joined the world Organization, thus assuming their rightful place in our midst. We welcome their contributions to the attainment of the lofty ideals and aspirations of the world community.\n180.\tWe come to this session filled with the ambition to achieve the fruitful results which are anxiously anticipated by the peoples of the world. It is hoped that the spirit of detente and conciliation will prevail as a means of solving world problems. However, if we take an objective view of whatever has happened and is happening in the world, we see an inconsistency, and we perceive a tremendous discrepancy between reality and hope. Whereas the Charter of the United Nations sets out for the international Organization the task of maintaining world peace and security and establishing a world in which peace and stability prevail, we see how far from reality these ideals and hopes are.\n181.\tProceeding from this point, we realize that important issues are involved in the establishment of world peace, and we perceive the dangers which pose a challenge to the Charter and to the determination of peoples to attain security, liberation and independence.\n182.\tIt is clear therefore that we cannot talk about detente and respect for the Charter of the United Nations and peoples' right to self-determination without touching on what is happening in the Arab region, which, as an inevitable result of being permanently subject to Zionist aggression, is threatened with an explosion its own explosion and that of world peace. This aggression is, in its reality and quintessence, aggression against the Charter of the United Nations and in defiance of its resolutions, resulting in the dissipation of hopes pinned on the United Nations.\n183.\tI need not go again into the details of the Middle East crisis, particularly the Palestinian issue, and notably the question of Jerusalem and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. In spite of all resolutions adopted by the United Nations the Palestinian Arab people continue to live as strangers in their own homeland, deprived of all their rights.\n184.\tI should like to commend the tremendous efforts of the Arab countries efforts which have been consistently declared in all Arab conferences and statements and in those of friendly and well-meaning States in their unified pursuit of a just and permanent peace in the region. All these efforts were based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\n185.\tIn this regard, it is important to assert a fact which will remain fundamental in spite of all attempts to obscure it: that the issue of Palestine, its people, land and destiny is the pivotal point and the essence of the Middle East crisis. All efforts to settle this crisis without a just and permanent solution to the Palestinian question are merely an attempt to defer the explosion rather than eliminate its origins and causes.\n186.\tThe basic role of the United Nations is to maintain world peace and security. In order that this role may remain valid the United Nations will have to take such necessary measures as will ensure that Israel will be obliged to respect and implement the United Nations resolutions which call for the withdrawal of its forces from all Ihe occupied Arab territories and the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. This people, whom you have recognized and admitted into this world Organization as represented by the PLO as an observer, is among us here, under the roof of the United Nations, and yet it is still a victim of extermination inside and outside the Arab land occupied by Israel.\n187.\tIt is only logical that Israel should be committed to respect the resolutions and principles of the United Nations, because these have been endorsed by the entire world. In the event of Israel's failure to respond, it is equally logical that the United Nations should assume its responsibilities, as set out in the Charter, by adopting economic and diplomatic sanctions against Israel for its intransigence and arrogance,\n188.\tThe escalating danger of a military confrontation in the Middle East requires that the situation be treated with decisiveness. This fact has prompted the State of Qatar to support the resolution adopted at the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East [resolution 3263 (XXIXJ], a resolution which Israel is still determined to ignore, overlook and defy.\n189.\tFrom the very beginning Qatar has also supported the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, a Declaration no less important to us than our stated desire to preserve the security of the Gulf area.\n190.\tHere I would like to emphasize my Government's profound interest in the question of the Gulfs security. In this, my Government is no exception to other neighboring States in the Gulf area. This is due to the vital and direct impact of this issue on peace and development at present and in the future, not only on the regional level but also on the international level.\n191.\tWe hope that the proposals with respect to the Middle East, the Indian Ocean and the Gulf regions will be viewed with complete understanding and respect on the part of all present: understanding and respect which we would like to be the prevailing spirit in dealing with the problems of raw materials and development, and the establishment of a new world economic and social order firmly based on respect for the principles of justice, the equal sovereignty of all States and the right of each State to complete and permanent sovereignty over its natural resources, in positive and dose international co-operation.\n192.\tProceeding from its faith in the effectiveness and advantages of international co-operation in furthering human progress towards a better world, the State of Qatar endeavors, under the guidance of His Highness the Ruler, to build up its own potential as part of a development process carried out jointly with other sister Arab States. In the mean time, the State of Qatar participates in development activities in Asia and Africa, thus affirming its profound and sincere faith in the effectiveness of co-operation among all countries of the world in the interest of development and progress, and in helping developing countries, especially those whose economies suffer under difficult conditions.\n193.\tThe State of Qatar is also anxious to co nsolidate its relations with the third world countries, especially in Africa, to participate in their issues and problems and to support African peoples struggling for their freedom and independence, so that they may attain their aspirations to human dignity and freedom.\n194.\tWe view with optimism the concern of the United Nations with the development projects and plans of the underdeveloped nations, and this at the same time gives us a sense of international responsibility. Seeing with profound dismay that many peoples are victims of disease, hunger and illiteracy, the State of Qatar considers that all States, especially the developed ones, have a cultural and humanitarian obligation to them. The minimum commitments adopted by the industrialized countries have not yet been met by many of them and the State of Qatar hopes that this will no longer be delayed or neglected.\n195.\tThe Slate of Qatar further hopes that the mayor Powers and the developed industrialized countries will exert greater efforts to check the wave of inflation and the rise in the prices of industrial commodities and foodstuffs. Some people may hold the oil- producing countries responsible for inflation. However, we would ask them to answer an important question: Was inflation not in existence before the price of petroleum was raised','\n196.\tMy Government hopes that the dialog between the petroleum-producing and petroleum- consuming nations and the developing ones will produce an understanding and agreement on such matters as raw materials, energy and development, so that the whole world will adopt a new economic order in which the interests of all will be upheld and future challenges faced objectively with the positive- ness that would stem from international co-operation.\n197.\tSeveral international conferences have been held, under the aegis of the United Nations, on development and food questions. They are of great significance to us, and we attach special importance to the success of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which we hope will produce new international provisions and regulations that are more consistent with the spirit of the present era, in which developing countries comprise the majority of the world's population.\n198.\tWe all find ourselves at each session of the General Assembly the focus of the world's attention and the custodians of its expectations and hopes that our deliberations will lead to significant accomplishments. We should not only make decisions, but also translate those decisions into action for the sake of the freedom, the prosperity and the dignity of mankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, let me say how pleased we are that our deliberations this year take place under the presidency of the Prime Minister of Luxembourg. His contribution to European co-operation, his diplomatic skills,\n' his devotion to democracy, give us confidence that this thirtieth session will be marked by a constructive and creative spirit.\n63.\tI want also to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General, whose fairness, leadership and tireless efforts are dedicated to carrying this Organization forward into a new era of co-operation for world peace.\n64.\tThis century has seen war and cataclysm on an unprecedented scale. It has witnessed the breakdown of established patterns of order and practices of international conduct. It has suffered global economic depression and cycles of famine. It has experienced the birth of thermonuclear weapons, and the proliferation of armaments around the planet.\n65.\tBut this century has also seen the triumph of the principle of self-determination and national independence. A truly global community has begun to evolve, and this development is reflected in a multitude of institutions of international co-operation. We have shaped new methods of peaceful settlement and of arms limitation, and new institutions to promote economic development and to combat hunger and disease world-wide.\n66.\tAs we deliberate the future, an event of potentially vast implications has just been achieved in this Organization: the unanimous agreement produced by the seventh special session of the General Assembly on measures to improve the economic condition of mankind [resolution 3362 (S-VII)].\n67.\tDespite differences of ideology and of approaches to economic development, the nations assembled here began the move towards the recognition that our interdependence spells either common progress or common disaster; that in our age no nation or group of nations can achieve its aims by pressure or by confrontation and that the attempt to do so would damage everyone. They agreed to transcend the stereotypes of the past in the search for a co-operative future. The seventh special session forged a sense of common purpose based on the equality and co-operation of States. Now we must dedicate ourselves to the implementation of this consensus.\n68.\tLet us carry forward the spirit of conciliation into the deliberaDigitiZed by Dag HammarSkjoid LibraryLet us address the issues of world peace the foundation of all we do on this planet with this same consciousness of our common destiny. It is our duty to avoid empty slogans and endless recrimination.\n69.\tOnly in a structure of co-operation can disputes be settled and clashes contained. Only in an atmosphere of conciliation can the insecurity of nations, out of which so much conflict arises, be eased, and habits of compromise and accommodation be nurtured. Social progress, justice and human rights can thrive only in an atmosphere of reduced international tension.\n70.\tThe United States stands ready to dedicate itself to co-operative efforts to harmonize the different perspectives of the world community in creating a new sense of security and well-being. We do so, not out of fear, for we are better able to sustain ourselves in situations of confrontation than most other nations. Nor do we do so out of a sense of guilt, for we believe that on the whole we have used our power for constructive ends.\n71.\tWe affirm our common destiny because of our recognition of global interdependence and because global peace requires it. Indeed there is no realistic alternative to shared responsibility in dealing with the international agenda of peace, security, economic well-being and justice.\n72.\tLet me set forth the views of the United States on the work we face in each of these areas.\n73.\tOur first and transcendent concern is for peace in the world. Peace is never automatic. It is more than the absence of war. And it is inseparable from security, A world in which the survival of nations is at the mercy of a few would spell oppression and injustice and fear. There can be no security without equilibrium and no safety without restraint.\n74.\tOnly when the rights of nations are respected, when accommodation supplants force, can man's energies be devoted to the realization of his deepest aspirations.\n75.\tThe United States will pursue the cause of peace with patience and an attitude of conciliation in many spheres. We shall nurture and deepen the ties of co-operation with our friends and allies. We shall strive to improve relations with countries of different ideology or political conviction. We shall always stand ready to assist in the settlement of regional disputes. We shall intensify our efforts to halt the spiral of nuclear armaments. We shall strive to improve man's economic and social condition and to strengthen the collaboration between developed and developing nations. And we shall struggle for the realization of fundamental human rights.\n76.\tAmerica's close ties with the industrial democracies of North America, Western Europe and Japan have been the corner-stone of world stability and peace for three decades. Today, looking beyond immediate security and defence, we are working together on a range of new issues. Through our consultations, we have begun joint efforts to ease inter-national tensions; to co-ordinate our national policies for economic recovery; to work together on common challenges such as energy and the environment; and to address the great issues that concern the developing countries.\n77.\tIn the same spirit, the United States has opened a new dialog with its neighbors in Central and Latin America. We have taken important steps towards resolving major political problems; we have begun close consultations for co-operation in promoting economic and social development. Alliance relations in the Western Hemisphere have a long history and great promise for the future. With imagination and dedication, we can make inter-American co-operation on the tasks of development an example to and a pillar of the global community.\n78.\tPeace, to be secure, must place on a more durable and reliable basis the relations between the nations possessing the means to destroy our planet.\n79.\tIn recent years, the bipolar confrontation of the last generation has given way to the beginning of dialog and an easing of direct conflict. In this body, of all organizations, there is surely an appreciation of the global importance of lessened tension between the nuclear super-Powers. All nations have a stake in its success. When weapons of mass destruction can span continents in minutes, nuclear conflict threatens the survival of all mankind.\n80.\tWe recognize that the suspicion and rivalry of a generation will not be swept away with a document or a conference. Real ideological and political differences exist. We shall firmly defend our vital interests and those of our friends. But we shall also never lose sight of the fact that in our age peace is a practical necessity and a moral imperative. We shall pursue the relaxation of tensions on the basis of strict reciprocity. We know the difference between posturing and policy; we will not encourage the belief that anyone can benefit from artificial tensions. We are deeply conscious that we owe it to future generations not to be swayed by momentary passions.\n81.\tThe state of United States-Soviet relations today and just a decade ago presents a dramatic contrast. The world is no longer continually shaken by chronic and bitter confrontations. Periodic consultations including those held at the highest level encourage restraint and amplify areas of mutual interest. The forthcoming meeting between the President of the United States, Mr. Ford, and the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr. Brezhnev, should strengthen this process.\n82.\tPrinciples of mutual restraint have been enunciated at various summit meetings; they were reaffirmed by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe two months ago. These principles provide a standard of behavior by which our actions will be tested. If they are observed as we insist and if neither side seeks unilateral advantage, the specter of general war will be lifted not only from our own peoples but from all nations. There can be no more important task before us.\n83.\tWe have likewise pursued more constructive and beneficial relationships with the countries of Eastern Europe. The United States has many traditional and deep-rooted bonds of friendship with the proud peoples of that region. We see widening possibilities for practical co-operation as the barriers between East and West in Europe diminish.\n\n84.\tThere is no relationship to which the United States assigns greater significance than its new ties with the People's Republic of China. We believe that the well-being and progress of a quarter of humanity is an important element in global stability. The hostility of decades between our two nations has been replaced by a relationship of mutual respect which is now a durable feature of the world scene. It serves not only the interest of our two countries but also the broader interests of peace and stability in Asia and around the world. President Ford plans to visit the People's Republic of China later this year to confirm the vitality of our relationship and to advance the ties between us on the basis of the strict implementation of the Shanghai Communique. We take seriously the process of normalizing our relationship. We are dedicated to pursuing it.\n85.\tThe world community must find a way to contain or resolve regional conflicts before they spread into global confrontation. Nowhere has the danger been greater than in the Middle East. Nowhere has the need for persistent and imaginative negotiation between suspicious rivals been more evident. Nowhere is there greater promise of moving from perennial crisis towards peace. Nowhere has the Security Council established a clearer framework than in its resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\n86.\tThe road towards a lasting peace stretches long and hard before us. The Middle East has seen more than its share of dashed hopes and disappointment. But the conclusion of the recent Sinai agreement1 marks a major step forward. It is the first agreement in the long and tragic history of the Arab-Israeli conflict which is not the immediate consequence of hostilities. It could mark a turning-point.\n87.\tThe agreement deserves the support of all the countries assembled here because every nation here has an interest in progress towards peace in the Middle East. It is another step in the process launched by Security Council resolution 338 (1973). The alternative was a continuing stalemate which would have led over time to another war creating a serious threat to world peace and the prospect of global economic confrontations.\n88.\tNeither fear of the future nor pride should obscure the fact that an unusual opportunity for further progress on all issues now exists. But opportunities must be seized or they will disappear. I want to emphasize that the United States did not help negotiate this agreement in order to put an end to the process of peace, but to give it new impetus.\n89.\tPresident Ford has stated that we will not accept stalemate or stagnation in the Middle East. That was true before the Sinai agreement was signed; it remains true today. The objective of our policy is not merely to create another temporary truce but to sustain the momentum of negotiations. The United States is determined to take every feasible step to help promote further practical progress towards final peace.\n90.\tAs a first step, it is essential that the Sinai agreement be carried out impeccably, within the terms and the time-frame that are stipulated.\n91.\tIn the improved atmosphere thus created, the United States stands ready to participate in any promising initiative towards peace at the request of the parties concerned.\n92.\tWe have made clear that we are prepared to make a serious effort to encourage negotiations between Syria and Israel.\n93.\tWe also intend to consult over the coming weeks with all concerned regarding the reopening of the Geneva Conference which met at an early crucial phase. As co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference together with the Soviet Union, our two countries have special responsibilities in this regard.\n94.\tWe are prepared also to explore possibilities for perhaps a more informal multilateral meeting to assess conditions and to discuss the future.\n95.\tThe United States seeks no special benefit; we do not attempt to exclude any country. We will cooperate with any nation that is willing to make a contribution. We have no preference for any particular procedure. We will support whatever process seems most promising. Our approach will continue to be both flexible and determined.\n96.\tThe search for final peace must be conducted on a wide basis. We are in frequent touch with Governments in the Middle East. We have begun discussions with the Soviet Union with a view to assessing the current situation and weighing possible diplomatic approaches to bring about a just and durable peace in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). While we have had important differences with the Soviet Union, our two countries have held parallel views that the situation in the Middle East poses grave dangers and that partial steps must be part of and contribute to progress towards a comprehensive settlement.\n97.\tThe role of the world Organization remains essential. If this Organization had no other accomplishment than its effective peace-keeping role in this troubled area, it would have well justified itself. These soldiers of peace, wearing the blue beret of the United Nations, as members of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine, the United Nations Emergency Force, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force have become indispensable to the maintenance of the two 1974 disengagement accords as well as the Sinai agreement. I want to take this occasion to salute the Secretary- General, Mr. Waldheim, and his staff, and General Siilasvuo, the Chief Coordinator of the United Nations peace-keeping missions in the Middle East, and all the men and women from many countries who have served in these forces which have no enemy.\n98.\tThe deliberations of this Assembly regarding the Middle East also play a central role. They can encourage progress or exacerbate tensions. Procedural decisions can be based on the recognition that dialog requires universality of membership, or they can fuel a futile, self-defeating effort to discriminate in violation of the Charter against a Member State whose participation is vital for a solution.\n99.\tThe Middle East will continue to be an area of anguish, turmoil, and peril until a just and durable peace is achieved. Such a peace must meet the principal concerns and interests of all in the area; among and security and the legitimate interests of the Palestinians.\n100.\tIn the Middle East today here is a yearning for peace surpassing any known for three decades. Let us not doom the region to another generation of futile struggle. Instead, let the world community seize the historic opportunity before it. The suffering of all the peoples of the Middle East cry out for it; the hopes and interests of all the world's peoples demand it. The United States promises its full dedication to further progress towards peace.\n101.\tThe contribution of the United Nations to the process of peace is essential in Cyprus as well. The Secretary-General has the responsibilities of organizing the peace-keeping forces on the island and of facilitating the talks between the leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities.\n102.\tStrict maintenance of the cease-fire is imperative. For this we look to the restraint of the parties and the efficacy of the United Nations peace-keeping forces.\n103.\tWe know that the world community shares our sense of urgency that the negotiating process be resumed and that the parties demonstrate flexibility and statesmanship. The status quo on the island must not become permanent; a rapid and equitable solution is essential. The Secretary-General has worked tirelessly and imaginatively under the most difficult circumstances to narrow the differences. He deserves the full support of the parties and of every nation here.\n104.\tThe details of a Cyprus settlement are for the two communities themselves to decide. However, in keeping with United Nations resolutions which the United States has fully supported, the following principles are believed by my Government to be essential:\n(a)\tA settlement must preserve the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. It must ensure that both the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities can live in freedom and have a large voice in their own affairs.\n(b)\tThe present dividing lines cannot be permanent. There must be movement from these lines to agreed territorial arrangements which reflect the economic requirements of the Greek Cypriot community and take account of its self-respect.\n(t ) There must be provision for the withdrawal of foreign military forces other than those present under the authority of international agreements.\n(id) There must be security for all Cypriots; the needs and wishes of the refugees who have been the principal victims and whose tragic plight touches us all must be dealt with speedily and with compassion.\n105.\tAnother area where this Organization will be called upon to take responsible actions is the Korean peninsula. This requires, above all, maintenance of the armistice, pending agreement by all of the parties most directly concerned to replace it with a new arrangement. The existing Armistice Agreement is the only legal instrument committing the parties to maintain the peace. It is a carefully designed structure for monitoring and policing the military demarcation line.\n106.\tThe United Nations Commander-in-Chief is a signatory to that Agreement. The armistice machinery functions daily. None of the signatories has repudiated it. Nor could they do so without serious risks to the peace of the world.\n107.\tSince 1972, South and North Korea have pledged themselves to enter into a dialog and to seek unification without resort to arms. This Assembly in 1973 and 1974 encouraged this process first in a consensus supporting talks between the two sides, then in a resolution [resolution 3333 (XXIX)] which looked towards termination of the United Nations Command. The United States agrees that 20 years after the end of the Korean war it is timely to terminate the United Nations Command. We have, in fact, sponsored a draft resolution to that effect which is now before you.\n108.\tIt would be foolhardy, however, to terminate the United Nations Command without new arrangements to preserve the integrity of the Armistice Agreement. In the interest of peace, the United States cannot accept any solution which fails to provide for the continuing validity of the Armistice Agreement.\n109.\tThe Republic of Korea and the United States have stated their general readiness to meet with representatives of the other side and with other members of the Security Council to discuss the termination of the United Nations Command while preserving the Armistice Agreement.\n110.\tToday I can be more specific. The United States and the Republic of Korea, looking forward to the time when a lasting solution of the Korean problem can be achieved, are herewith proposing to the parties to the Armistice Agreement the convening of a conference to discuss ways to preserve it. At such a meeting we would also be prepared to explore other measures to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula, including the possibility of a larger conference to negotiate a more fundamental arrangement.\n111.\tIt would be in keeping with this spirit of dialog for this body to open its doors to full membership for the two Korean Governments. The United States supports the dual entry of both South and North Korea into the United Nations without prejudice to their eventual reunification. For our part, if North Korea and its allies would move to improve their relations with the Republic of Korea we would be prepared to take similar reciprocal action. It goes without saying that no proposal for security arrangements on the Korean peninsula which attempts to exclude the Republic of Korea from the discussions can be accepted by the United States.\n112.\tThe United Nations can contribute significantly to the process of peace on the Korean peninsula by supporting a responsible approach.\n113.\tOver the past year the United States has followed carefully and with great sympathy the efforts to reach peaceful settlements in southern Africa.\n114.\tWe welcome the statesmanlike efforts of both black and white African leader: who are seeking to prevent violence and bloodshed and to promote a negotiated settlement in Rhodesia. The differences between the two communities in that country, while substantial, have been narrowed in the last decade. Both sides in Rhodesia, and Rhodesia's neighbors,\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjold Library\nwar. The United States will support all efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement.\n115.\tIn underlining our goal of peaceful change for southern Africa, I want to emphasize the importance of an early settlement in Namibia. My Government's opposition to South Africa's continuing occupation of Namibia and our rejection of South Africa's apartheid system are well known. The United States has consistently conveyed our position on this subject to South Africa. We will continue to do so.\n116.\tWe believe that the people of Namibia should be given the opportunity, within a short time, to express their views on the political future and constitutional structure of their country, freely and under United Nations supervision.\n117.\tPeace in the world will be fragile and tenuous without a curb and, eventually, an end to the arms race. This is why the United States has embarked, with the Soviet Union, upon the difficult and complex negotiation to limit strategic arms. Our objectives are to prevent unchecked destabilizing competition in strategic armaments; to achieve reduction of these arms; to lessen further the likelihood of hasty decisions in times of crisis; and to ease the economic burden of the nuclear arms race.\n118.\tThe Vladivostok accord of last autumn marked a major step towards achieving these goals. When this agreement in principle is translated into a treaty, agreed ceilings will be placed on strategic force levels for a 10-year period. This unprecedented step will slow the pace of new arms programs, especially those driven by fear of major deployments by the other side.\n119.\tThe United States is actively engaged in other amis control negotiations. Together with the Soviet Union, we have made progress towards establishing a regime for peaceful nuclear explosions, and we have agreed to set a threshold on the underground testing of nuclear weapons. These are significant steps towards a. verifiable comprehensive test ban.\n120.\tIn addition, the United States and the Soviet Union have presented to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament identical drafts of a convention on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques [A/10027, annex II, documents CCDI47I and CCD/472]. Misuse of this knowledge might open new avenues of military competition and wreak untold and irreversible harm upon all humanity. We urge the Conference to complete its consideration rapidly.\n121.\tAnother urgent task is a substantia] reduction in the high levels of military forces now confronting each other in various parts of the world. The United States believes that the time has come to give new impetus to the negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions in central Europe. The significance of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe depends to an important extent on whether we can achieve progress in this area. An agreement that enhances mutual security in central Europe is feasible and essential. We will work towards that goal.\n122.\tThe world faces a paradox with respect to the proliferation of nuclear energy. Men have fashioned from the atom weapons which can in minuter end the civilization of centuries. Simultaneously, the atom is fast becoming a more and more essential source of energy. It is clear that the cost and eventual scarcity of oil and other fossil fuels will increasingly spread nuclear power around the world in the decades ahead.\n123.\tBut the spreading of nuclear power poses starkly the danger of proliferating nuclear weapons capabilities and the related risks of the theft of nuclear materials, blackmail by terrorists, accidents or the injection of the nuclear threat into regional political conflicts. Now is the time to act. If we fail to restrain nuclear proliferation, future generations will live on a planet shadowed by nuclear catastrophe.\n124.\tOver the past year the United States has repeatedly urged new efforts among the supplier States to strengthen and standardize safeguards and controls on the export of nuclear materials. We must not allow these safeguards to be eroded by commercial competition. We must ensure the broad availability of peaceful nuclear energy under safe, economical and reliable conditions.\n125.\tThe United States has intensified its efforts within the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA ] and with other nations to broaden and strengthen international standards and safeguards, and has proposed an international convention setting standards to protect the physical security of nuclear materials in use, storage and transfer.\n126.\tThe United States continues to urge the widest possible adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] and the associated safeguard measures of the IAEA.\n127.\tThe greatest single danger of unrestrained nuclear proliferation resides in the spread, under national control, of reprocessing facilities for the atomic materials in nuclear power plants. The United States therefore proposes, as a major step to reinforce all other measures, the establishment of multinational regional nuclear fuel-cycle centers. These centers would serve energy needs on a commercially sound basis and encourage regional energy co-operation. Their existence would reduce the incentive for small and inefficient reprocessing facilities, limit the possibility of diverting peaceful nuclear materials to national military use, and create a better framework for applying effective international safeguards.\n128.\tWe urge that groups of nations begin now to explore this concept and that all States support the work of the IAEA in this field.\n129.\tIn the last two years the world community has been reminded dramatically to what extent economic relations are an essential foundation of the economic order. It would be one of history's most tragic ironies if, at a time when .. i are putting behind us the tensions of the cold war, we were to enter a new period of conflict between North and South, rich and poor. At the recently concluded seventh special session, the United States called for an end to the sterile confrontations of the past. We stated that, when the ancient dream of mankind, a world without poverty, becomes a possibility, our moral convictions also make it a duty. And we emphasized that only co-operation, not extortion, can achieve gives us ground for hope that, at least for the immediate future, a choice has been made to turn away from confrontation towards co-operation. The United States is proud to support the final document [resolution 3362 (S-VII)], which is the product of the arduous effort and dedication of so many in this chamber.\n130.\tThe United States considers the achievements of the seventh special session a beginning, not an end. As recommended in the final report, we must now move forward in available forums to give reality and content to the objectives on which we have agreed. In the difficult negotiations ahead my Government will participate energetically, in a co-operative and conciliatory spirit.\n131.\tBeyond peace, security and prosperity lies a deeper universal aspiration to dignity and equal opportunity. Mankind will never be spared all the tragedies inherent in the cycle of life and death. But we do have it in our power to eliminate or to ease the burden of social tragedy and of organized injustice.\n132.\tThe United States has traditionally been an advocate of extending the reach of international law in international affairs. We have offered our help to the victims of disease and natural disaster. There is no longer any dispute that international human rights are on the agenda of international diplomacy.\n133.\tThe reach of international law must extend to the last frontiers of our planet, the oceans. They are the common heritage of mankind, but they can turn into arenas of conflict unless governed by law. They hold untapped sources of energy, minerals and proteins; their environmental integrity is crucial to our survival.\n134.\tThe United States welcomes the United Nations mandate for a comprehensive treaty governing the use of the oceans and their resources. Last month at Montreal I set forth our approach to this negotiation and urged that next year's session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea move matters to a rapid and successful conclusion. No international negotiation is more vital for long-term political and economic stability and the prosperity of our globe.\n135.\tInternational law must also come to grips with international terrorism. Innumerable innocent lives have been lost as a consequence of the lack of internationally accepted standards specifically designed to avert unlawful and dangerous interference with civil aviation. The hijacking of aircraft, the kidnapping and murder of innocent civilian victims for presumed political gain remain a plague on civilized man. This remains one of the under-developed areas of international law which merits the most urgent attention of this Organization.\n136.\tCompassion for our fellow men requires also that we mobilize international resources to combat the age-old scourges of mankind: disease, famine and natural disaster.\n137.\tThe great human rights must be recognized, respected and given reality in the affairs of nations. The earliest United Nations declarations and the recent Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe leave no doubt that these are matters of international concern. The United States will support these principles. Throughout the world, in all continents, violations of human rights must be opposed whether they are inflicted by one race upon another or upon members of the same race. Human rights must be cherished regardless of race, sex or religion. There can be no double standard.\n138.\tThe United Nations Commission on Human Rights has taken its first steps against gross violations of human rights where serious and reliable allegations are submitted by individuals. We support those steps. The organized concern of the world community can be a potent weapon in the war against degradation of human values.\n139.\tOne of the most persistent and serious problems is torture, a practice which all nations should abhor. It is an absolute debasement of the function of government with  its overwhelming power is used not for people's welfare but as an instrument of their suffering.\n140.\tThe United States urges this Assembly to adopt the draft Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, recommended for adoption by the Assembly by the Fifth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, held at Geneva recently.4 In addition, we propose that this General Assembly establish a group of experts, to be appointed by the Secretary-General, to study the nature and extent of torture in the world today and to report back to the next session of our Assembly.\n141.\tThis Organization was created in the belief that the universality of the human race can be reflected in the conduct of international affairs. This Chamber symbolizes the hope that mankind places in the force of nations working together in the common interest, with reason, responsibility and mutual respect.\n142.\tThe problems we face are complex and perilous. The sterile slogans of yesterday, the solutions of the past, the dwelling upon old resentments, can only widen the gaps between us and allow the dangers to peace and the well-being of our peoples to fester and to grow.\n143.\tWe have it in our power to prove to future generations that the last quarter of the twentieth century was not an era of violence and conflict, but one of the creative epochs of world history.\n144.\tMy country's history tells us that it is possible to fashion unity while cherishing diversity; that common action is possible despite the variety of races, interests and beliefs we see here in this Chamber. Progress and peace and justice are attainable.\n145.\tSo we say to all peoples and all Governments: let us fashion together a new world order. Let its arrangements be just. Let the new nations help shape it and feel it is theirs. Let the old nations use their strengths and skills for the benefit of all mankind. Let us all work together to enrich the spirit and to ennoble mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\n68.\t  The delegation of Guatemala wishes to congratulate the President and at the same time to express its pleasure on his well-deserved election to the lofty post of the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. His recognized qualities as an experienced statesman, his broad knowledge of international relations and, particularly, his distinguished gifts as a jurist and his balanced and wise judgment which have proved so valuable in the process of integration which has taken place among the countries of the European Economic Community [EEC] are a guarantee that the decisions to be adopted in this solemn forum will always be imbued with the greatest fairness and the strictest justice and, above all, will serve the lofty purposes of our world Organization. Those purposes must take precedence over secondary political considerations which sometimes divert our debates from the primary objectives of the Charter the maintenance of international peace and security the promotion of friendship and co-operation among the peoples of the world and, above all, the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and in accordance with the principles of justice and the provisions of international law, and the prevention of situations which may endanger world peace.\n69 Guatemala, one of the 51 nations which signed the Charter in San Francisco at a time when the gunfire of the Second World War had not yet died away and when mankind was anxious to ensure for future generations lasting peace based on respect for law and fundamental human freedoms, wishes to pay a tribute to our Organization on its thirtieth anniversary and derives great hope from the significant fact that the number of peace-loving States which today make up our Organization has risen to 141, with the inclusion of the new Members which we are most pleased to welcome to this Assembly-Cape Verde, Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe. The delegation of Guatemala wishes to extend to them its brotherly greetings of welcome and pledges its broadest co-operation in any endeavor designed to achieve our common objectives in this universal forum.\n70.\tThe faith which the great majority of nations have placed in the effectiveness of the world Organization in its fundamental task of protecting mankind from the scourge of war compels us to strengthen its foundations and to promote international co-operation in the fight against another equally damaging scourge, namely, under-development, as well as against other ominous dangers which threaten mankind, such as the proliferation of nuclear arms, the growing pollution of the environment, the shortage of food, and social discontent, which in an increasingly interdependent world are creating the enormous economic and technological gap which divides the developed from the under-developed countries.\n71.\tUnfortunately, in the 30 years of the life of our international Organization dark storm clouds of war have not disappeared from the world horizon. Nor can it be claimed that within the Organization total harmony prevails among its Members, for they are today divided into powerful, opposing and combative political blocs.\n72.\tGuatemala, however, maintains its firm hope that, in this new stage upon which we have embarked, we shall strengthen and completely fulfill the purposes and principles of the Charter and that the peaceful solutions provided by international law to solve disputes among States will allow us to prevent confrontations arising from the injustices and inequities inflicted upon countries solely by the use of force.\n73.\tForemost among the problems which most poison relations among peoples are without doubt those which entail the infringement of territorial integrity, since territory is one of the fundamental elements of any State and all nations consider it a sacred and inviolable heritage for which they have always been ready to shed their blood. For this reason, a just solution of territorial conflicts by the diplomatic and judicial means provided for under international law is one of the imperatives of peaceful coexistence among States.\n74.\tNegotiation and mediation have demonstrated their effectiveness as a means of achieving detente in international situations which have become explosive.\n75.\tRecent experience has shown that perseverance, mutual understanding and goodwill between the parties can bring them \\\"step by step\\\" towards a possible honorable settlement of their disputes. We cannot fail to express our satisfaction at the preliminary agreement between Egypt and Israel, the product of patient and tenacious negotiation, and the world is anxiously hoping that this preliminary step will gradually lead to a settlement in the Middle East in peace based on justice and human brotherhood.\n76.\tThe delegation of Guatemala also hopes that by means of negotiation solutions will be found for other conflicts which are damaging friendly relations between neighboring countries or frustrating the desire for the peaceful reunification of divided nations, as in the case of the two Koreas, or which are endangering the territorial integrity and sovereignty of countries like Cyprus. We firmly hope that through negotiations and other peaceful means just solutions for the problems created by the continued existence of foreign enclaves, which infringe the territorial integrity and sovereignty of States, will also be found. The unresolved disputes which have persisted for many years over the occupied territories of the Malvinas Islands, Gibraltar, the Panama Canal and the Guatemalan territory of Belize, usurped by the United Kingdom, are sources of discontent which cast a shadow over relations among States and interfere with the harmony which is essential to peace.\n77.\tEver since Guatemala became a Member of the United Nations it has been explaining at this rostrum to the conscience of the world that for more than a century and a half we have been making claims against the United Kingdom for the return of the Territory of Belize, over which my country possesses sovereign rights because it is an integral part of our national territory and with it forms a continuous and indivisible unit, the historic ties of which go back to times before Columbus when Guatemala and Belize were part of the ancient Mayan Empire. These ties were maintained throughout the period of Spanish colonial domination and continue to exist today in spite of the territorial usurpations of the last century.\n78.\tAlready in the sixteenth century under Spanish domination Belize formed part of the political entity of Guatemala and it was not until the middle of the seventeenth century that for the first time bands of buccaneers descended upon its coast and, in the intermittent periods of peace between Spain and England, engaged in the cutting of log-wood, which at that time was widely used in British industry. This anomalous situation was regularized by peace treaties between the two Powers in 1783 and 1786, whereby Spain authorized the presence of British subjects in the area of Belize for the sole purpose of cutting timber and building houses within an area of approximately 2,581 square miles, over which Great Britain expressly recognized in these treaties the full sovereignty exercised by Spain.\n79.\tIn 1821 Guatemala won its independence from Spain and on the basis of the principle uti possidetis, which is the rule generally applied in the countries of America and, more recently, by the new African States, the territory of the State of Guatemala was the same as it had been under Spanish sovereignty within the administrative limits existing at the time of the proclamation of independence.\n80.\tShortly after becoming a sovereign State Guatemala began to pursue its claim against Great Britain, whose subjects not only continued to exploit the concessions granted by Spain, but were penetrating further into neighboring Central American territories. It took the combined efforts of the Central American States, acting jointly both diplomatically and militarily, to recover their sovereignty over the Bahfa Islands and the Mosquitia Settlements in Nicaragua and Honduras, to defend Nicaragua against the raids of filibusters and slavers, and to protect Central American sovereignty over the islands and waters of the Gulf of Fonseca. After repeated attempts to prevail upon Great Britain to put an end to its increasing incursions into Guatemalan territory, in 1859 Guatemala and Great Britain signed a Convention which, although it contained the word \\\"limits\\\" in its title, actually entailed the ceding of territory under coercion\ncovering a total area of 8,598 square miles, the equivalent of 23,000 square kilometers. Great Britain had previously possessed no rights over three quarters of that area.\n81.\tThis Convention cannot but remind us of the notorious \\\"trinket treaties\\\" imposed by the colonialist Powers in various parts of the world in circumstances of glaring inequality because of the weakness of the other contracting party.\n82.\tNevertheless, the British Government never discharged its sole obligation contracted under the 1859 Convention, in spite of the continuous claims submitted by my country, claims which today still remain frustrated. The obstinate refusal to fulfill this obligation and the rejection of several proposals of the Government of Guatemala that the case be taken to arbitration and that an international judicial solution be sought was the reason why the Congress of Guatemala in 1946 declared the 1859 Convention invalid because of the failure of Great Britain to fulfill the compensatory obligation it had contracted, and that is why in 1963 the Government of Guatemala broke off diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom. As a consequence of this situation, the parties never reached agreement on the demarcation of the territory in dispute, which remains un-demarcated today.\n83.\tAt all international meetings, delegations of my country have explicitly and repeatedly raised the matter of this dispute and have made it clear that the rights of the Guatemalan nation over its Territory of Belize cannot be relinquished. When, in San Francisco, we signed the Charter of the United Nations in 1945, Guatemala accepted all the principles and obligations of the Charter, including that of the self-determination of peoples, a principle upon which our very existence as a sovereign State is based. However, we were compelled to place on record the dispute over the Territory of Belize which we have always considered to be an integral part of our own national territory and, as such, falling outside the principle of self-determination. For the same reason, we opposed the idea that Belize might be placed under the International Trusteeship System, and on 26 May 1945 the representative of Guatemala entered a reservation to this effect, which appeared in the report of the Rapporteur of the Fourth Committee of the Second Commission, and thus constitutes an official document of the San Francisco Conference. It reads as follows:\n\\\"The delegation of Guatemala enters an express reservation to sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 3, section B, of the trusteeship system to the effect that this system cannot apply to territories belonging to the Republic of Guatemala even though such territories may be the subject of claim or disputes or at present in the possession of another State.\\\"\nThe delegation of Guatemala has frequently made reference to this reservation in the General Assembly and in its Committees.\n84.\tMy country has energetically and invariably supported the process of decolonization set in motion by the United Nations as one of its primary purposes, a process which has promoted the birth of many independent States seated in this Assembly today. The records of our sessions and the votes of Guatemala in favor of all efforts to accelerate this process of\ndecolonization bear witness to our support and, significantly, it was to the representative of Guatemala that the honor fell to be elected to the presidency of the Trusteeship Council in 1958.\n85.\tGuatemala was one of the 89 countries which voted in favor of the historic resolution 1514 (XV), the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to\n. Colonial Countries and Peoples. In so doing, we placed unequivocally on record that the resolution, in accordance with the provision of paragraph 6 of the Declaration, was not applicable to the long-standing dispute over Belize, since it categorically states that\n\\\"Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\\\"\n86.\tThe existence of similar situations in other parts of the world was the reason why the 43 sponsors of the draft resolution considered it indispensable through that paragraph to safeguard the cardinal principle of territorial integrity, in order to protect countries against any attempt at dismemberment or secession which might invoke the inapplicable principle of self-determination.\n87.\tAt the memorable meeting on 14 December 1960, Mr. Palar of Indonesia explained that his delegation was one of the sponsors of paragraph 6 and that he considered that the situation of the Territory which the Guatemalan delegation had in mind has been taken into consideration in our paragraph 6.' At that time, Indonesia was submitting its claim to West Irian, which it rightly considered an integral part of its own territory and which it subsequently recovered. 1 would remind the Assembly, too, that the enclave of Goa was brought under the sovereignty of India, which considered Goa to be an integral part of its own territory with the implicit acquiescence of the United Nations.\n88.\tThe delegations of Afghanistan, Iran and Jordan, among others, also expressed their agreement with the position taken by Guatemala in the discussion of the final text of resolution 1514 (XV), and on that occasion Mr. Rahnema of Iran emphatically reaffirmed the contents of paragraph 6 of the Declaration quoted earlier. At the same time, he quite rightly added that the Balkanization of countries is a stratagem of neocolonialism which applies, for the purposes of domination, the well-known maxim of \\\"divide and conquer\\\".\n89.\tIn this regard, the Latin American diplomat Mr. Leopoldo Benites, later to become President of the General Assembly, stated:\n\\\"My delegation . . . condemns any attempt to disrupt the national unity or territorial integrity of a country as being contrary to the principles of the Charter and to the foundations of law and peaceful coexistence\\\".3\n90.\tMy delegation felt it necessary to summarize on this occasion the roots of its continuing dispute with the United Kingdom over the territory of Belize and the reasons why we come to this world forum every year to reiterate the still outstanding claim which is an affront to the dignity of all Guatemalans.\n<>l. Since a considerable number of new Slates have joined our Organization and many of them are unaware of the grounds for our claim, and since this Assembly has witnessed some demagogic attempts here to present our case as. an expansionist adventure or as a curious form of neocolonialism something which is repugnant to the democratic spirit of the Guatemalan people we feel obliged to make it absolutely clear and explicit that Guatemala remains unwavering in its demand that the United Kingdom desist from its illegal occupation of the Guatemalan Territory of Belize, and that my Government reiterates its conviction that this dispute can be resolved only by the legal and diplomatic means provided for under international law a view which we hope is shared by the Government of the United Kingdom, with whose representative;, my Government has been negotiating for more than 12 years, in am attempt to find a formula for a settlement.\n92.\tThe justice of Guatemala's claim has won the support of the States of Latin America, as embodied in many declarations and resolutions, including those approved by the Second, Third and Fourth Meetings of Consultation of the Foreign Ministers, of the American Republics and in other organs and committee* of the Organization of American States |CA<!.V].\n93.\tThe sister Republics of Central America have also expressed their solidarity with Guatemala in important regional documents, including the Declaration of Antigua, signed in August 1955. in which they proclaimed their rejection of the survival of colonialism in America and made it clear that the Territory of Belize was an integral part of Guatemala and. hence, of Central America and that action designed to recover that Territory was of concern to all Slates signing that Declaration; the Declaration of Panama of 1962; and more recently the Declaration of Guayana. Venezuela, signed in December 1^74 by that country and the six Central American Governments, fn this very Assembly of the United Nations, at the seventh session. Mr. Urquia of HI Salvador made the following slate-merit at (he meeting held on 10 December\n\\\"Paragraph 3 of the report of the Fourth Committee [Ai22cJ6\\ refers to a reservation made by the representative of Guatemala in regard to Belize Territory. On behalf of the delegation of my country and of three other Central American delegations, I take the liberty or making the following statement concerning thai reservation. The delegations of Costa Rica, HI Salvador. Honduras and Nicaragua, considering that the sister Republic of Guatemala has during the present session of the General Assembly declared that it reserves its sovereign rights over Belize Territory, and considering that this is a problem which directly affects the geographical unity of Central America, wish lo record their support of the reservation made by the Guatemalan delegation.\\\"\n94. The Government of my country has repeatedly\nattempted to seek a judicial solution to the dispute\nover Belize. hut its arbitration proposals were rejected\nby the United Kingdom in 1980 and in 1937 and l be idea of taking the case to the International fours of Justice came to nothing because the parties failed u* agree on the procedure to he followed.\n95. In order to break this deadlock., the Government of Guatemala and the United Kingdom embarked on a phase of negotiations which began in 195? and which with some interruptions, has continued up to the present day. These negotiations have been exploring various formulas for a settlement which, apart from the territorial dispute itself, take careful account of a very important element namely, the people of Belize whose interests warrant our total respect and whose friendship and co-operation we deem indispensable to the process of integration of two territories which constitute a single geographic entity. The mutual gravitation of both population groups, and their complementary interests indicate that be only viable path for their future development lies through economic and political integration. The Central American States themselves are making major efforts to achieve that kind of integration through a gradual and progressive process in which our people* have placed all their hopes of achieving the full development of the region and of overcoming the nationalistic quarrels which still create ill will among sister nations.\n96, Guatemala is not indifferent to the fact that the local population of Belize has been growing because of migrations front different sources and because of other demographic factors and that the present population density is five inhabitant's per square kilometer.\n97. Guatemala is mindful of the interests of these people, who have been acquiring an identity of their own. for in the negotiations over the last 18 years the formulas for resolving the dispute have been aimed at reconciling the rights claimed by Guatemala with the interest of the people of Belize. In this spirit, in 1957, the representatives of the United People's Party of Belize held talks with representatives of the Government of Guatemala to discuss the possibility of a federative association with the latter. Hit these efforts were frustrated by the action of the United Kingdom Government, which do not view with favor the prospect of Belize's ceasing to be one of its possessions. In 1963 negotiations, were resumed with the United Kingdom through the good offices of the United States and later the case was submitted for mediation lo that CJovernmeni, Unfortunately, however, no formula acceptable to the parties was found.\n98. Despite the failure of the effort* made so far, the parties to the dispute have not slackened their efforts to find a negotiated mIuimw. Talks have continued until recently, as our Organization has been officially informed, between Guatemala and the United Kingdom with the participation of representatives of the people of Belize. My Government continues to trust that these negotiations will lead finally to a just and equitable solution which will reconcile the interests involved and put .in end to the dispute, thus avoiding the engendering of hostility stemming from the resentment caused by unilateral solutions those which are imposed by force,\n99. The self determination of peoples is a cardinal principle of the United Nations which has been applied to deliver subject nations from the state of bondage in which they were held b the colonial Powers. However, this principle can never be applied, in accordance with United Nations law itself. in the case of territories which are an integral part of a Slate and which have been forcibly occupied by another State,\nwhich has settled them with outsiders who have subjugated or supplanted the indigenous population, because this would lead to an encouragement of dismemberment of territories which belong to one nation but have been usurped by another.\n100.\tThese situations of force which keep a stranglehold on the national territories of States can only be settled peacefully and permanently through the legal means provided for under international law. This is the path chosen by the people and Government of Guatemala, which we hope will lead to a settlement of its century-old claim against the United Kingdom in regard to the territory of Belize, on a basis of justice and equity, so as to avoid the friction resulting from the indignation of a people in the light of a stubborn refusal to recognize its lawful rights over its territorial integrity and the indivisibility of its sovereignty.\n101.\tWe are an Organization of sovereign States which have declared their acceptance of the purposes and principles of the Charter. We belong to the Organization on equal terms, and this applies both to those nations which for several generations have enjoyed full international representation and to nations which have recently entered the international scene. We are a free association established for the purpose of achieving the peace and justice to which we aspire through law through law which teaches us that there is only one justice, which admits of no nuances. What is just for one must be just for others. What is unjust for one is unjust for all. This is something to ponder on, to determine and to agree on our responsibility as independent, sovereign States, if we wish to strengthen the legal principles which are essential to an organized international community.\n102.\tOn 24 October next we shall be celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations. Guatemala, together with 50 other nations, has been a Member of the Organization since its foundation and has taken part in all the sessions of the General Assembly and in the international conferences it has convened. We have made our contribution to different bodies, and distinguished Guatemalans have held important posts. In 1968, the General Assembly elected a Guatemalan, Emilio Arenales Catalan, as its President. Our participation in the work of the United Nations has been in keeping with the principles and purposes of the Charter, which should be interpreted fully and not partially, completely and not in a fragmented fashion, even-handedly and not tendentiously. There is but one law and it applies to everyone, because any kind of opportunistic interpretation which grants rights to some while they are denied to others, offends our sense of equity and justice. Guatemala believes that the Charter and the resolutions to which we have voluntarily adhered should be interpreted as a whole and in a spirit of total equality. These are the conditions for good faith in the fulfillment of obligations entered into and are the means to guarantee the application of international law and justice which are the very foundations of stable and lasting peace.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\n154.  We have done a fair job in the past few weeks. The resolution adopted by the General Assembly on the report of theAd Hoc Committee of the Seventh Special Session [resolution 3362 (S-VIJ)] can make history. To help it to do so we shall have to do an equally fair job at this thirtieth session. It was a rocky road to the resolution, yet we traversed it. The political framework needed for implementing it is the challenge before us now. To meet it, we have to keep the spirit of the seventh special session that helped rich and poor see the oneness of the world. An era of international detente is the answer to the challenge. This does not necessarily mean replacing the detente between the United States and the USSR but perhaps helping it to serve better the purposes of the much more necessary approaching universal detente. What we have achieved during the seventh special session removes a great many difficulties in international economic relations. It does not do the whole job, nor can it do anything without a strong political will to prop it up. There will have to be skillful pipers to turn to living reality the thoughts contained in the resolution. Without the political will, the old order will linger on, although its somewhat elusive end is in sight.\n155.\tIt is good that Mr. Thorn will be guiding the deliberations of this session. His skills are beyond doubt. He comes from a country that is the center of the endeavors to unite the Western world and we attach high hopes to his experience in that field, which should guide us towards universal detente for which I am hoping.\n156.\tThe agenda before us at this session covers almost all the subjects of political crises with which we have been grappling for over 30 years: disarmament, the banning of nuclear tests, ideological stances, armed alliances, local conflicts and great Powers, Palestine, the Middle East, South African apartheid, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola, nuclear weapons. We are familiar with the entire list. To hope that these problems will be cleared out of the way at this single session is too much. These are urgent problems, crucial problems. All one can hope for is that we may temper our individual positions with concessions to others, although not on matters of principle relating to war, peace and freedom. My logic in this is that these are not new crises; they have been with us for a long time; it is only recently that they have been submerged by the social and economic disorders of this age. Now that the surface of those socioeconomic problems has been scratched as a result of the deliberations during the seventh special session, the political issues are laid bare before us. They constitute a danger to the results of a document, produced during sleepless nights, which promises much. Politics are all-pervading. There is no way of subduing them. There is more than one way of living with their vagaries. Without a consensus problems are likely to block the road to universal detente and our resolution will remain a dead letter.\n157.\tMembers will appreciate that for me, coming from where I do, questions of freedom in Africa and in the Arab world are uppermost in my mind. With Mozambique here in the world community after a valiant struggle of a dozen years, Angola should not be long in coming. It will have to be left alone, though.\nThe fight that is going on there would not have taken so long had it not been for Powers outside Africa. The bullets fired are not African bullets, nor are they provided by Africans. They are sold or given away by those who make them, not for the sake of goodness, but for ulterior motives. Angola has become a latter-day Congo because it is as wealthy. Outside Powers are unable to let it be. It is coveted by many. The streets of Luanda are cluttered with many a corpse like that of Lumumba. I hope I am not being too much of a visionary if I say that the whites in the area, led by South Africa and abetted by like-minded whites outside the continent, are trying to prevent an inevitable eventuality: independence.\n158.\tBut why? This is why. In a decade or less there will be a closely knit number of nations, or even a \\\"United States\\\", composed of Mozambique, Malawi, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia, Angola and, certainly, Zimbabwe a formidable menace to South African whites, who, if they fear Namibia's independence so much, may well look on such a combination of black States to the north with trepidation. It is not visionary what I see; it is possible, given the historical background of the area and the quality of the leaders there, most of whom are embattled patriots who have come to realize the extent of their interdependence during the fight for freedom.\n159.\tSouth Africa will perhaps take longer to emerge from bondage, but this does not apply to Zimbabwe. In a few weeks the whites will have lived through 10 years of fearful independence tense living. It is not for nothing that Mr. Smith and his party are mobilizing massively nowadays. All non-African males between 25 and 40 are being called up for two months a year. The non-belligerent noises they have been making do not tally with this preparedness for fight. They do not mean to give anything away. Africans whom they call \\\"moderates\\\" would do well not to heed linguistic conciliation. President Kaunda of Zambia is not one given to hollow talk. When he tells the world that a Zambian officer and 11 Zimbabwe nationalists were killed on 7 September by the intrigues of the agents of Mr. Smith, the world must believe him. What the United Nations can do is not much, but it has not managed to do even that fully. I refer to our failure in restraining Member States which do not abide by the resolutions adopted regarding sanctions. President Kaunda said that, and we must believe him.\n160.\tHowever, help seems to be coming from a familiar corner: white settlers who never tire of telling the world that they are the custodians of Christian civilization are up against the church. This is the writing on the wall. The part played by young churchmen in Mozambique is still vivid in the memories of all. What sounded like a minor voice in the beginning has built up to a crescendo in Zimbabwe. The whole Roman Catholic Church is not mincing its words against the settler regime. Let us celebrate some of the names of those brave men by way of recognizing the good in an area wallowing in evil: Monsignor Donald Lamont of Umtali; Mr. Aloysius Haene of Gwelo; Mr. Patrick Chakaipa, Bishop of Salisbury; Monsignor Adolph Schmitt of Bulawayo; the Most Reverend Francis Markall, Archbishop of Salisbury.\n161.\tIt is these men who are the true custodians of Christian faith, not the pretenders who say it is they\nwho are. These men signed a message the other day against settlement and read it in their respective churches. They also got it published as an advertisement in the newspapers. The Anglican Bishop of Mashonoland declared his revulsion at the insensitive disregard for job opportunities for blacks. These gentle souls ape brothers of those who disgraced the Lisbon dictators by revealing everything about Wiriyamu. Is it too much to think that the Church's coming in as vigorously as it is doing at the moment is likely to shorten the days of the agony of the fighters ?\n162.\tAt this session we shall discuss ideas for bringing the United Nations to meet needs that have been growing for over 30 years. Those who would rather keep it ticking on the way it did and does are no fools. They are big enough to know. They know as well as we do that the United Nations is not an island insulated from changes in world politics, social attitudes, economic relationships and the rest. They are not newcomers to the world stage. As a matter of fact, they have had a hand in creating the free climate of opinion and action that now prevails. We know it well. Without their work to rid us of serfdom we would not have been here.\n163.\tThe moral and practical help of the socialist countries can be denied only by those of us who do not know our contemporary history, or those who stand to gain from discarding that factor in the matrix of facts of our progress to freedom. When I say that these friends must reconsider their position vis-a-vis the restructuring of the United Nations, I say it advisedly, and mean it. My message to them is this: having done what you did for liberating Asian and African countries, carry on; give liberation a content. Without giving a hand to a new United Nations you will not be as helpful to the developing countries as you were in the 1950s and 1960s. I will go further. The reforms proposed are within the context of the Charter. To be better able to reformulate social and economic international relationships in the 1970s.\n164.\tThe United Nations came into being to give the powerful all the advantages of power, The proposals do not minimize that power. The changes take stock of the countries that wield power. None of their suggestions aim at the roots of the Charter. The proposals aim at meeting the challenges of the day within the framework of the Charter. They are not meant to reduce us all to dwarfs. We in the third world recognize that some of us are not giants. This is a fact of life. My appeal to the traditionalists, who would rather preserve the 30-year-old ideals, is that 30 years ago there was one kind of world, but today there is another. It is said that the poorer nations need the United Nations more than do the richer ones. This is a fallacy. Both groups need it and need it to be an effective Organization.\n165.\tSudan believes that the United Nations has done a great job in its time. But time does not stop. The United Nations has to change and reflect the new times. Sudan would prefer radical changes for instance, doing away with the veto in the Security Council. It was a disgrace that some Powers got together and gave South Africa the support it needed to go on with its follies. And it was also a disgrace that the Security Council did nothing against Israel.\n166.\tOur feeling is that those who stand against change will never serve the cause of justice and freedom.\n167.\tAn able and effective United Nations will help us to move steadily towards giving a little more now to the men and women to whom we said, during our days of struggle for independence, that we would give dignity. You cannot eat or drink dignity. The whirlwind of change in our countries must be complemented by a social and economic upsurge equal to what we promised our compatriots.\n168.\tGiving teeth to the United Nations without tampering with the position of the able and mighty is certainly bound to usher in international detente. Along with my colleagues from the Arab world and the African world, I crave for a more effective United Nations, which will aim at allaying the fears of men and women still risking their very lives in the search to realize their potentialities, in the search for freedom.\n169.\tHow can the Palestinian people restore their faith in man if they do not advance from the previous session, which gave them a window on the world, to something more tangible? Every man, woman and child appreciates the place given to the Palestinians in the world community last year. Unless the Palestinian people go forward from there, their cynicism will continue. And how can one blame them for that? Those of them who do not see much in the second Sinai military disengagement agreement have been poring over the calendar of war and peace in the area. They have come up with staggering facts that they are spreading far and wide in the Middle East. This is a sample of what they are saying despondently: it has taken the Israelis eight years to withdraw 10 miles from Sinai; now they want five more years to withdraw 20 miles. The calculation they have been making leads to a despairing conclusion: if this rate is going to set the standard, it will take the Israelis 50 years to hand over Sinai. And they go on: it is now four years since the Rogers Plan, which Egypt accepted in the face of great odds, and two years since the October war. One tends to share their gloom.\n170.\tThe Israeli authorities are still talking of an \\\"interim agreement\\\" with Egypt, and a close look at the term \\\"interim\\\" reveals that this means eight years. Nothing seems to make headway. The most recent political move seems to be stuck. Egypt has gone as far as a country can go, braving the wrath of many leaders and peoples, though it is not entirely alone. A few leaders thought that President El-Sadat of Egypt was affording the area yet another chance by showing dangerous resilience. At the moment, those few leaders who went along with him are wondering.\n171.\tOn the one hand there are the Palestinians and the Arab peoples who never thought that President El-Sadat would gain much by being wise and peaceful. On the other hand there is the United States of America, which is considering arms sales to Israel to the tune of $2,000 million a year for a period of 10 years. To make this cynicism palatable the United States is talking of lifting the embargo on arms to Egypt which has been imposed for two decades. And it declares that there is no commitment in this connexion.\n172.\tAnd, of course, there is Israel, which will not sign the agreement until the United States does what\nit says. What is an impasse if this is not one? The United States is fumbling and faltering because it has moved a long way from the principles that have guided it throughout its history. It is busy importing ideas from the European political scene of a century ago, sometimes even more than a century ago. Those ideas or modes of behavior fitted those times, those peoples and that world. The United States has to rediscover its own conscience. In the case of Palestine, President Woodrow Wilson must have been heartbroken at the turn events took when the Ottoman Empire was broken up after the First World War. It all went against his convictions. He said: \\\"Peoples are not to be bandied about from one sovereignty to another by an international conference or an understanding between rivals and antagonists.\\\" Outraged by the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916 and the Balfour Declaration of 1917, Wilson tried to put justice and high principles into a political life of treachery and double dealing.\n173.\tThat is a part of the American tradition which has been abandoned completely. The opposite is now the case. Today the United States is trading territory that does not belong to it for money and arms. But even that is not working. Look where it stands with the Sinai disengagement of troops. In the face of the United States' unqualified support for Israel our Organization is paralyzed. But it will not be so much longer. The vote which brought the Palestinian people into the community of nations last year is but the beginning of further steps towards affirming the Palestinian entity. Ultimately Palestine will be recognized by both the United States and Israel.\n174.\tI have taken so much of your time in speaking about Palestine and the Middle East because they are the focal-points of danger which should be the subject of our attention during this session.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t Permit me to take this opportunity, when the People's Republic of Mozambique is for the first time participating in the general debate, to express my appreciation of the way in which you. Mr. President, are conducting the work of this historic thirtieth session. Your guidance of our deliberations further serves to give us, as new Members. a clear manifestation of the value and dimension of Ibis Organization.\n2.\tWe are proud that your predecessor, our brother Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika. the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, has effectively helped to create conditions for the success of our current session. I should like to record my country's admiration of the brilliant way in which he led the discussions on the delicate and crucial problems dealt with during the twenty-ninth session. We also pay him a tribute for the exemplary way in which he conducted the deliberations of the seventh special session. Through his talented leadership Mr. Bouteflika was able to bring harmony among the Members of the United Nations, which resulted in a greater understanding among the nations of the world on the vital necessity of creating a new international economic order.\n3.\tMy delegation is grateful to the speakers who have very kindly expressed, and those who will be expressing in their speeches on behalf of their Governments and peoples, solidarity with our country.\nThey do so also in the full knowledge that their victory is a victory for the international community At this juncture we should like also to reiterate our determination to contribute to the strengthening of the principles and purposes of the United Nations.\n4.\tFor centuries our people in various ways ceaselessly fought the brutal system of domination, exploitation and humiliation to which they were being subjected by the vicious Portuguese Fascist colonial regime. The situation after the Second World War became more favorable to the liberation struggle of the peoples of the world. The defeat of Nazism, the growth and strengthening of the socialist system, the uprising of the Algerian people and the successive independence of African and Asian countries was an important catalyst for the cause of our liberation.\n5.\tBelieving in the possibility of attaining independence by peaceful means, we initially tried to establish contacts with the colonial Power, but the intransigence and refusal of that Power to start any dialog with us to this effect, while it vainly clung to the outmoded arguments on its vaunted historic mission for the dissemination and expansion of Christian and Western values, effectively ruled out peaceful struggle as a means of regaining our independence.\n6.\tThe systematic refusal of the Portuguese colonial regime to implement the historic resolution 1514 (XV), which recognizes the right of the people under colonial domination to self-determination and independence, reinforced our conviction that peaceful means could never in such circumstances lead us to our objectives. Therefore we had no alternative but to mobilize our people for an armed struggle for national liberation.\n7.\tSimultaneous with our conviction that the only means to liberate our homeland from the colonial yoke was armed struggle was our recognition that this could be obtained only through national unity. Thus the Frente de Libertafao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] was born. FRELIMO represents the only organization in our country that has been able to mobilize, unite and organize the masses for the same cause. By establishing a correct political line, FRELIMO created a platform on which such unity was forged.\n8.\tIn fact, defining clearly the desired aim the defense of the interests of the exploited masses and correctly identifying the oppressive colonial system as the enemy which had to be fought, FRELIMO was able to engage all our people in the ideals of national liberation and independence. Armed with these instruments, the Mozambican people were able to advance decisively to victory, despite the difficult conditions of the armed struggle, the brutal Fascist repression, massacres, bombing, war crimes and concentration camps, and despite the growing involvement of monopolistic interest which transformed the colonial war into an imperialist war.\n9.\tWe were able to gain the international solidarity of world progressive forces fighting for the same cause. In the forefront of this movement of solidarity were the national liberation movements, the African and the socialist countries, representing our strategic rear, and the democratic and progressive forces from the capitalist countries. All these were, indeed, our allies in the common struggle.\n10.\tHere we want to pay a tribute to Africa, and particularly to the brotherly peoples of the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia, who never hesitated to make any sacrifice in support of our cause.\n11.\tToday, after the conquest of our national independence, we have before us another battle to fight, the battle of national reconstruction and economic independence. We have inherited a difficult situation which resulted not only from the long years of colonial domination, exploitation and plunder, but also from the imperialist war of aggression imposed upon our people. Preoccupied only with the defense of the interests of the minority of exploiters, the colonial system conceived State machinery geared to the defense of such interests. All economic, social and cultural structures were organized to serve the minority to the detriment of the overwhelming majority.\n12.\tAs a result of the colonial war of aggression, the indiscriminate bombing of the population, villages and plantations, and massacres, we inherited a grave situation, economically and socially.\n13.\tIn the sphere of health, our people reflect the neglect and undernourishment to which the lack of a health policy and the effects of an economy based on mono-culture condemned them. In some regions, until then occupied by the enemy, the people had never seen or heard of a doctor, and in others the ratio of medical services was about 1 doctor to 1 million inhabitants.\n14.\tIn the field of education, to mention only the basic elements, we have the shameful rate of over 90 per cent illiteracy. In the social sphere, mainly in the urban zones, we find the degrading vices left by capitalism and colonialism, namely, alcoholism, drug addiction and prostitution.\n15.\tOne and a half million Mozambicans languishing in concentration camps need to be integrated into the new society which we are now building. About 100,000 refugees, who fled to the neighboring countries from colonial repression, wish to return to their country. Then there are thousands of Mozambicans who are the survivors of massacres and bombings: widows, orphans and those crippled in the war.\n16.\tThe economic situation of our country is precarious, owing to the colonial plunder of our country's natural resources as well as to imperialist monopolies, unequal exchange conditions in international markets, compulsory dependence on a few countries for our external trade, poor diversification of export products and excessive dependence on imports. This situation, during the colonial system, was coupled with economic sabotage and the smuggling of capital out of the country, which caused serious problems and a deficit in the balance of payments.\n17.\tTherefore, as we now rise to confront the new battle, we do so against the background of this serious\neconomic and social situation which we have inherited from colonialism. The Mozambican people, tempered by the liberation struggle and inspired by the experience of the new society which even before independence they were constructing in the regions liberated by the people's struggle, are totally engaged in national reconstruction and in the creation of a new mentality as the foundation of a new society, free of exploitation. Consequently, an important fact in the new struggle is the extraordinarily creative potential of our people, organized, mobilized and armed with FRELIMO's correct political line.\n18.\tWe have set as a matter of priority the destruction of the colonial state machinery, an instrument for the domination by the exploiting class, and its replacement by a state machinery which will truly serve the masses. The new organs will be different from the former, not only as regards their objectives, but also in their methods and composition. We have turned our attention to the immediate needs of the people: fighting famine, disease, illiteracy and moral and material corruption. In order to give concrete form to the principles for which we are fighting and which are incorporated in our Constitution, we are gradually creating conditions for the establishment of democratic and people's power. The land, the natural ground and subsoil resources and all health and educational systems and institutions have been placed under the control of the people's State.\n19.\tConsidering agriculture to be a decisive factor in our economy, the majority of our people are collectively engaged in it, organizing and depending mainly on their own efforts.\n20.\tIn this new stage of our struggle, we count on the support and solidarity of international progressive forces, which have always been on our side.\n21.\tWe want to reiterate within this Organization our appreciation of the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 3340 (XXIX), which calls on the economically developed countries and on other Member States to carry out, in collaboration with the legitimate representatives of the countries still under Portuguese domination, concrete Programs and projects of economic, technical and financial assistance to be granted when such countries achieve independence. This resolution has already started to yield fruit. In this context, we should like to stress the action already carried out by the various United Nations organizations, including the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Program and the United Nations Children's Fund. The support already received from these organizations can be considered significant, particularly because they meet the most immediate priorities in the fight against famine, disease, illiteracy and social evils in general. In expressing our appreciation of the assistance, rendered thus far, we are confident of the continued support of the United Nations family of organizations as we confront the many challenges before us. In this respect I should like to stress briefly the importance of Habitat: United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, to be held next year at Vancouver. It is our hope that when the international community, at the Conference, discusses the various facets and aspects of human settlements land,\nslums, housing, rural and urban development it wtll also seriously consider the problems of those rural and urban settlements that were subjected to destruction by colonial wars for over 10 years.\n22.\tThe People's Republic of Mozambique, which in its own Constitution recognizes the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States established by General Assembly resolution 3281 (XXIX), maintains that only with the establishment of friendly relations between nations and the creation of international economic relations based on equality and mutual respect can international peace and security be maintained. Thus there is an urgent need to change the current world economic system, based on dependency on a few powerful nations and on the tyranny of a small group of nations, as well as on forms of colonialist, imperialist and neo-colonialist domination. We shall follow all steps taken with a view to strengthening mutual co-operation on an industrial, scientific and technological level between the developed and the developing countries. And, recognizing that co-operation with and aid from the developed countries is not the only alternative open to the developing countries, we believe that the strengthening of co-operation between the developing countries should be a means through which those countries could increase their strength in a dialog with the developed countries.\n23.\tWe support the steps stipulated in the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its seventh special session [resolution 3362 (S-Vll)], believing that all States Members of this Organization will adopt them as guidelines in their approach to and policies on international economic relations.\n24.\tWe have stated that this session is a historic one. In fact, the session is being held when a great number of countries of the world are regaining their dignity, freedom and national independence and are actively participating with other peoples in the solution of the problems that affect the international community. The Comoros and Papua New Guinea became free and independent countries, while the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, and the People's Republic of Mozambique are still the focus of interest and acclamation following their admission to the United Nations. We wish to congratulate the people and Government of Papua New Guinea, and we look forward to welcoming them soon to the United Nations. My delegation warmly and fraternally greets the people of Cambodia and the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, which, through a heroic and selfless struggle ably led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, were able to reconquer their freedom and independence, dignity and peace which had, for five years, been usurped by imperialism.\n25.\tMy delegation equally salutes the people of Laos and supports them in their efforts for the consolidation of their independence and national reconstruction without foreign interference.\n26.\tWe have always considered our struggle in the general context of that of the peoples who are fighting against colonial and imperialist domination, as well as in that of the struggle of mankind for the construction of ajust society guided by the principles of national independence, justice and equality. That is why, notwithstanding the distance that separates us physically our struggle has always been linked with that of the heroic peoples of Viet Nam, Korea and all other peoples who fight for their freedom in Africa and Latin America.\n27.\tMy delegation wishes to extend fraternal revolutionary and militant greetings of solidarity 'to the brave people of the Republic of South Viet Nam and the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam on their glorious victories over the brutal aggression and systematic violation of their human rights perpetrated by imperialist forces headed by the United States of America. Their victory was a great contribution to the liberation of mankind.\n28.\tOur victory in Mozambique in the struggle against Portuguese colonialism backed by international imperialism would not have been achieved so soon had it not benefited from the Vietnamese people's struggle. We are eagerly looking forward to the day when we shall benefit within the United Nations from the Vietnamese people's talents, dedication and creative force for world peace, justice and progress. We vehemently condemn the abuse of the rights conferred on the United States in its repeated exercise of its right of veto to prevent the admission of the Republic of South Viet Nam and of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam to the United Nations. This shows clearly that the peace achieved in Viet Nam does not please the United States. To speak of peace and co-operation while refusing to admit the two Vietnamese States to the United Nations is a flagrant contradiction.\n29.\tThe United States arguments did not and cannot convince any well-meaning person. To compare the problem of Korea with that of Viet Nam is an attempt to establish a parallel between two objectively distinct realities. We are sure that this is done not with any intention of defending the interests of the Korean people but only to safeguard the United States' own interests. We feel that such an attitude is highly immoral and is an insult to both the Korean and the Vietnamese peoples, [n invoking arguments to the effect that the admission of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam is backed by ideological reasons is tantamount to absurdly affirming that all Member States which support the immediate admission of the two Vietnamese States have the same ideology. We are certain that, despite the psychological war that the United States continues to wage against them in the halls of the United Nations, our Vietnamese brothers will continue to enjoy the respect and co-operation of all peoples of the world and will soon be able to exercise their right in the United Nations, a right which is given them not by anybody but by the principles incorporated in the very Charter of the United Nations and which they have reconquered through innumerable sacrifices of thousands of their children.\n30 The question of Korea has been dragging on for many long years now, and the division of Korea nas been causing considerable moral and material damage to the Korean people. The imperialists who promo e this situation, have been inhumanly benefiting; from it, without taking into consideration the supreme interests of the Korean nation. 31. This question has been debated seriously by the United Nations. Various opinions have been expresseu\nto demonstrate how inconsistent with and contrary to the United Nations Charter and the spirit of human rights is the continuation of this problem. Honest suggestions have been offered for its solution. Consequently, in 1973 the General Assembly at its twenty-eighth session adopted the text of a consensus on this question.1 The spirit of this consensus was to facilitate the solution of the Korean problem by the Korean people themselves. In the same spirit, my delegation wishes to reaffirm the stand adopted by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries held at Lima, a stand which was also backed by my country as an active member of this movement. We support the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea, without any foreign interference. My delegation is of the view that the dissolution of the United Nations Command in South Korea is urgent. It calls attention to the danger that will prevail if the dissolution of this Command is not accompanied by the withdrawal of United States troops. No pretext can justify the provocative permanence of such troops oh Korean soil.\n32.\tLikewise, my country considers that it is high time peace was established in Korea and that the dubious military armistice was replaced by a firm peace accord capable of creating and strengthening confidence in both parts for rapid, peaceful reunification.\n33.\tThe Mozambican people have defined their armed struggle as a contribution to the cause of international peace because it aimed precisely at the destruction of the causes of wars colonial and other international wars namely, the domination of some countries by others. Thus our struggle could not be circumscribed within the limited scope of Mozambique. This is why we say \\\"a luta continiia\\\". We cannot feel completely free while a single country is still subjugated.\n34.\tOne of the places in which such subjugation prevails is the Middle East. The delicate situation there is causing us concern, and it is with uneasiness that we follow the day-to-day events in the region. Hundreds of thousands of the inhabitants of the area are subjected to indescribable suffering due to endless wars, and the situation has been seriously affecting international peace and stability, robbing the world community of the attention it would otherwise devote to the progress of mankind and the construction of a better world.\n35.\tHaving scrupulously analyzed this problem, we have grasped its complexity, but we nevertheless feel it is not beyond solution. We conclude that an overall and final solution is most urgent in an area whose inhabitants have known no peace for the last 27 years or more. But in order that a satisfactory and final solution may be found Israel must recognize the reality of the injustice it has been perpetrating against its Arab neighbors, particularly against the Palestinian people. Israel must be prepared to rectify the state of affairs that prevails in the area as a result of its injustice, so that it may start a new chapter in its relations with its neighbors. Israel must, first of all and without delay, evacuate the Arab territories it occupied in June 1967 and the territory allocated to the Palestinian State by the plan of partition of Palestine included in the resolution adopted on 29 November 1947 by the General Assembly [resolution 181 (II)], by virtue\nof which the State of Israel itself came into being. Only by acting thus will Israel be able to live in peace. But as long as Israel does not take any step to this effect it will be vain to expect the Palestinian people and the Arab countries not to resist the occupation of their territories, for occupation and oppression, no matter by whom, only give rise to resistance. This has often been eloquently proved by history. And, if we seriously believe that Israel favors the establishment of a genuine peace in the Middle East based on a just and constructive solution to the Palestine Arab problem, my delegation would like to submit that no just and constructive solution to the Palestine problem can be found without taking into consideration the right of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland, Palestine, and to recover their property; their right to self-determination without any foreign intervention; their right to sovereignty over their territory; and their right to establish their independent national authority.\n36.\tIn this context, my delegation finds it opportune to reiterate that, as a fact recognized by the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity [OAJJ], the non-aligned movement, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization and other international organizations, the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people with whom a settlement of this problem can and should be negotiated is the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n37.\tAnother country of the Middle East whose situation is a source of legitimate preoccupation is Cyprus. We consider that in Cyprus, as in many other parts of the world, tension and conflict are provoked mainly by the interference of foreign forces in the country's internal affairs. Such being the case, it is essential and indispensable for the normalization of the situation in Cyprus that all foreign forces respect General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) and Security Council resolutions 365 (1974) and 367 (1975) and cease to interfere in the internal affairs of the island. The Cypriot community must be free to decide its own destiny and preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its country, as well as its non-alignment. For this, it is necessary that all foreign forces leave the island, in order to create a suitable atmosphere for the normalization of the situation there.\n38.\tLet me now turn to the situation in southern Africa. In Rhodesia, in South Africa and in Namibia we are witnessing the heavily disguised maneuvers of the Fascists and racists to maintain the peoples of those territories in perpetual slavery.\n39.\tIn the Republic of South Africa itself enormous human suffering is being inflicted by a minority on the masses in that country. Prisons are appallingly crowded, political prisoners are languishing in many gaols under a brutal torture system, and there are many other forms of inhuman treatment.\n40.\tRealizing that the policy of bantustans is insufficient to contain the tide of nationalism, the South African regime is organizing new types of concentration camps into which it intends to throw its opponents. Lately, repression against its own citizens has been intensified to a level so far unknown in that country. Practices such as those adopted in South Africa take on the form of colonialism and nazism. Many Western countries cannot escape responsibility for this situation, for they actively support the apartheid regime in one way or another.\n41.\tSuch countries continue to give their contributions and arms to South Africa. In recent times attempts have been made by those countries to rationalize their collusion with the apartheid regime by pretending to argue that there has been a change within South Africa.\n42.\tThose arguments are nothing more than maneuvers calculated to perpetuate white supremacy over the people of South Africa. For in South Africa there is no change. The apartheid system is still there and in fact the regime has intensified its repression. We would like to reaffirm here that there can be no real change so long as the Vorster regime continues to perpetuate its apartheid policies while maintaining an intransigent attitude towards the liberation movement which is the authentic representative of the interests of the South African people.\n43.\tWe should like thus to express our militant solidarity with the people of South Africa, led by their national liberation movement, in their courageous struggle against apartheid. We appeal to all the peoples of the world to support the efforts made by the liberation movement. We appeal also to those countries which continue to collaborate with the South African minority regime immediately to cease all co-operation  military, financial or any other until the rights of the majority of the people have been restored.\n44.\tIn Zimbabwe, 10 years after the unilateral declaration of independence, the yoke of colonialism and racism is becoming more and more savagely oppressive. People are being forced out of their ancestral lands in order to give way to foreign settlers. Whole populations are being moved at gunpoint from a vast area bordering Mozambique without even minimal consideration for their belongings and human rights. Their houses are being burnt out and their cattle indiscriminately slaughtered. Arbitrary arrests and hangings of political prisoners are a common occurrence.\n45.\tIn their repression of Zimbabweans, the Ian Smith forces did not hesitate to violate our frontiers, hence compelling us to an armed confrontation. The illegal Smith regime acts with an obstinacy identical to that of the Portuguese colonialists. Thus the Smith regime, through brutal repression and other desperate maneuvers, attempts to prevent its own total collapse. Consequently the people of Zimbabwe have decided to continue their struggle, including armed struggle, against the minority and illegal regime of Ian Smith,\n46.\tThe People's Republic of Mozambique will unreservedly support the efforts of the people of Zimbabwe led by the African National Council of Zimbabwe for their own liberation. It is the people of Zimbabwe who will liberate themselves. The people of Mozambique are confident that all peace-loving peoples will lend the necessary support to that combat which is imposed on the Zimbabweans by the minor' ity and racist regime of Ian Smith. The Smith regime\nmust be compelled to accept a Government of the majority represented by the Council.\n47.\tWe appeal to all Member States to impose a complete and total boycott on Rhodesia. For our\npart, FRELIMO and the People's Republic of Mozambique are ready to assume all responsibility in conformity with their international duty.\n48.\tThe situation in both South Africa and Rhodesia constitutes not only a violation of the fundamental principles of human rights and of the United Nations Charter but also a threat to peace and international security. With regard to our country, I must say it is a constant menace to the independence and the freedom that our people has just regained after 10 years of untold sacrifice.\n49.\tThe question of Namibia is as old as the United Nations itself. No progress is being made. On the contrary, South Africa is extending its apartheid policy to that international Territory. Military bases are being built; repression is growing day by day. People are being herded into the so-called bantustan concentration camps. United Nations resolutions are, with great contempt, being thrown into the dustbin. Machinations are frantically being resorted to in order to hoodwink the world into believing that South Africa is at last willing to settle the problem by staging the so-called \\\"constitutional talks\\\" with a few tribal chiefs who are nothing more than South African stooges. The real solution to the Namibian problem will be found in the recognition of the South West Africa People's Organization [.SWAPO] as the only legitimate representative of the Namibian people and the initiation of serious negotiations with that Organization with a view to granting Namibia independence while scrupulously preserving its territorial integrity. If this course of action is not taken, those who are prone to defend their petty short-time interests may, in the end, lose everything, including racial harmony. We sincerely believe that time is fast running out. We call upon those Member States who constantly style themselves the champions of freedom to reexamine their positions and help the United Nations  and themselves for that matter to solve the Namibia problem and thus regain their prestige as well. We call upon all Member States to help SWAPO materially, politically and morally to wage its struggle by all possible means.\n50.\tThe Portuguese colonial empire is nearing its end, permitting new independent and sovereign countries to be born. We anxiously look forward to the independence on 11 November of another Territory under Portuguese administration. We salute the brotherly people of Angola led by the Movimento Popular de Liberta?ao de Angola [MPLA ] for having firmly fought Portuguese colonialism for a real unity of the Angolan people based on the interests of the masses.\n51.\tToday MPLA is preparing the people for the defense of the gains of the liberation struggle and for national reconstruction. However, we see imperialist maneuvers, aimed at dividing the country, delaying the proclamation of independence and creating an atmosphere of instability in an attempt to justify an intervention by international forces.\n52.\tWe see the appearance of puppet organizations and armed groups against MPLA and the people. South African troops invaded Angolan territory, occupying parts of the Cunene province. Only MPLA organized the people against this aggression by South African mercenaries and troops. My delegation, on behalf of the people of Mozambique, vehemently condemns the invasion of Angola by South African troops, rejects all intervention by international forces, and firmly supports the territorial integrity of Angola against any attempt to divide it.\n53.\tAnother Territory under Portuguese administration is East Timor, where the situation causes us considerable concern. In that Territory the Frente Revolucionaria de Timor Leste Independente [FRETILIN], the only nationalist organization supported by the people, defends and represents their interests. It is so organized that it is capable of leading the country to independence and of guaranteeing its unity with a view to national reconstruction.\n54.\tMeanwhile marginal forces, with foreign backing, are trying to hamper the process of decolonization in the Territory, provoking an atmosphere of unrest and perpetrating aggression against the people. Supported by the masses, FRETILIN has been able to stop the attempts by those puppet forces to create chaos and entirely control the Territory of East Timor.\n55.\tThe People's Republic of Mozambique, which considers that the people of East Timor should be free to choose their own destiny, condemns the interference by certain Powers which are trying to impose themselves on that Territory and not hesitating to resort to military intervention and to moving troops and fleets in an attempt to intimidate the people. We consider that it is with FRETILIN, which effectively controls the Territory and is incontestably supported by the people, that Portugal should negotiate the modalities for the decolonization of the Territory.\n56.\tConnected with the question of southern Africa is the problem of the growing tension in the Indian Ocean. We consider that the continuation of such a situation constitutes another threat to our independence. The rivalry of the big Powers which compete with each other over the control and domination of that region is manifested by the growing introduction of nuclear armaments into it.\n57.\tThe principle of general and complete disarmament, which the People's Republic of Mozambique defends, is a principle that must be not only recognized but also applied. The creation of a climate of security in Europe and co-operation between the nuclear Powers to that effect are steps capable of promoting greater security in the world. But the mere establishment of security between the European States or between the big Powers is not sufficient to guarantee international peace. It is necessary to ensure that hotbeds of tension are in fact eliminated and not transferred to new zones.\n58.\tIn this connexion, the President of the People's Republic of Mozambique, Samora Moises Machel, in a message sent to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, held at Helsinki, said:\n\\\"The Mozambican people, who were forced to wage a liberation war to put an end to the colonial and imperialist war of aggression, attach the greatest value to the fight for peace, security and co-operation between nations. It is our conviction that detente in Europe would be a real contribution for the peoples of Europe to realize their aspirations to peace and economic, cultural and social emancipation. We wish that the success of your Conference\nalso signifies a greater vigilance and firm struggle against the attempts of imperialism to transfer geographically the zones of tension. The People's Republic of Mozambique, which is situated on one of the margins of the Indian Ocean and is directly interested in maintaining this ocean as a zone of peace, considers it its duty imposed by the fight for the preservation of international security to draw the attention of the Conference on European Security to the great dangers and threats to international peace and security created by the installation by some countries participating in the Conference of bases of aggression in the Indian Ocean zone, namely in Diego Garcia and in the Comoro islands, against the interests and the will expressed by the peoples of the respective countries and of all the African continent.\\\"\n59.\tOur preoccupation with maintaining the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace is not subjective. It reflects our awareness that tension threatens our own national independence and international peace; therefore we are of the view that the Indian Ocean should constitute a denuclearized zone, free of military and naval bases and fleets, and that the safety of its maritime routes should fall under the responsibility of the coastal States directly interested.\n60.\tThis year concerted action on a world scale has been initiated for the emancipation of women. It is a happy coincidence that this International Women's Year is also the year in which we and other peoples have regained our liberty, dignity and independence, thus opening wider perspectives for the liberation of humanity as a whole. The liberation of humanity from various forms of domination, oppression and exploitation naturally cannot be achieved if women, who constitute more than half of the world's population, do not attain their full liberation. That is why the People's Republic of Mozambique rejoices at the results achieved at the World Conference of the International Women's Year held in Mexico, at which the World Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Women's Year was devised.\n61.\tIn Mozambique women always suffered from colonial and capitalist domination and also from the weight of retrograde tradition. From the very beginning of our struggle, FRELIMO recognized that the oppression to which the Mozambican women were being subjected was a result of the antagonistic contradiction between the Mozambicans both men and women on the one hand and the social order on the other. In that way we engaged all our people in the common struggle against the old social order,\n62.\tThe Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace, 1975,1 indicates the aspects to which Governments should pay more attention with a view to increasing the role which should be played by women in society. We, for our part, have already, during the armed struggle, encouraged more and more the participation of women at all levels, side by side with men, and Mozambican women actively participated in the struggle. In the army and during the battles our women proved themselves capable of carrying out the missions entrusted to them. In the fields of health and education their role has been indispensable.\n63.\tWhile increasing their degree of literacy and culture, we continued to extend women's participation in all spheres, including the taking and carrying out of political decisions. During the stage of armed struggle the FRELIMO Central Committee, wishing to make better use of the capacity and talent already demonstrated by women, deemed it necessary to create an instrument that could rationalize, organize and direct their efforts in the various fields of national activity. Thus in 1973 the Organization of Mozambican Women was created. We therefore believe that to some extent we are already engaged in working towards the objectives indicated by the Mexico Declaration.\n64.\tOur Constitution has stipulated equality between men and women in rights and duties in the political, economic, social and cultural fields and affirmed that women's emancipation constitutes one of the essential tasks of the people's State. We are certain that with those foundations we shall realize most of the aims set for the decade.\n65.\tBefore concluding I should like to put on record our satisfaction at the achievements of the United Nations during the 30 years of its existence and to express our confidence that the spirit of conciliation, harmony and co-operation achieved today will be maintained and developed towards the attainment of the goals of the Charter.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\n103 My delegation takes its place on this rostrum rather late in the day, when the representatives who have spoken before me have congratulated the President and eulogized his past and present achievements. However, permit me to add the voice of Botswana to the chorus of those who have\npreceded me. This is no conventional exercise, for the almost unanimous election of the President is sterling proof of the high esteem in which this body holds him and the confidence we repose in his leadership. We have no doubt that the thirtieth session, under his guidance, will bring additional laurels to his crown. His election is a credit to him personally and a tribute to his country, Luxembourg.\n104.\tThe President inherits the mantle of office from Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria. My delegation cannot proceed to refer to the substantive issues before us without first expressing its appreciation of, and congratulating him on, a job well done during the twenty-ninth session. Through Mr. Bouteflika's patience, level-headed and pragmatic assessment of the mood of the time, he also steered the seventh special session skilfully to a successful conclusion, bringing hope to the hearts of millions of people in the third world. But it is only a hope and we exhort the President to carry on the work so well begun in order that our aspirations might be realized and the economic and social advancement of all peoples might be promoted.\n105.\tOne of the major preoccupations over the past several years has been the growing gap in living standards between the developed and the developing nations. It has become imperative to establish the basis for a more just system of international economic relations among the nations of the world irrespective of their economic and social systems, and on the basis of equality. The seventh special session, which concluded its work a little more than a fortnight ago, addressed itself to this very problem. It is not my intention on this occasion to go into the substantive issues. My delegation welcomes the spirit of conciliation and co-operation manifested at that session which enabled us to conclude our negotiations and unanimously adopt a Program on development and international economic co-operation. What now remains to be done is for all countries to commit themselves to the adoption and implementation of a world plan of action. Since our ultimate objective is to establish a new international economic order, we regard what has been done at the seventh special session as a vital step towards that objective.\n106.\tOn 16 September the United Nations admitted three new nations to its membership: Cape Verde, Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe. Two years ago, and for many years before that, in the face ot formidable odds such as an organized Portuguese army backed up by a long-established colonial attitude and military experience, a determined unrelenting over lordship, weapons furnished by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Western sympathies which were averse, as always, to violence against oppression while professing keen opposition to injustice and inequality it would have been considered near madness to predict the realities of today. Anyone who did so would have been charged with incitement ot the local population who, so the world is often told, are happy in their humble place, were it not for misguided agitators and accused of interfering in the internal affairs of a Member State. It is not my intention to open old wounds. I am moved by the thought and knowledge of what the people of the countries we have\nadmitted to membership at this session have had to endure and what many other people in different parts of the world are suffering and under what pretext they are made to suffer. Today the entire Assembly rejoices, and very few of us- stop to reflect on the unnecessary and wanton loss of life which preceded these nations' presence in the United Nations. Very few reflect on the individual role they have played in obstructing the way and prolonging the suffering of oppressed peoples through alliances, political attitudes and the promotion of their individual economic interests when problems of decolonization come before this forum.\n107.\tThe regaining of their national independence after many years of colonial domination and their unhindered exercise of self-determination are what the people of Cape Verde, Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe have always wished for themselves. They do not love war, but they resorted to wars of liberation and a violent struggle for freedom when the inhumanity of colonialism, which desensitizes all human feelings, proved intractable and determined to remain for ever and to ride them into the ground. It is to be hoped that, even in those areas of the world where colonialism, discrimination and apartheid are still rampant, we shall one day be privileged to sit side by side with their national delegations.\n108.\tIt is my pleasant duty as the leader of my country's delegation to congratulate the new Members on their regained independence and on their admission to the community of nations. We are confident that, as they assume their rightful place here, they will contribute in no small measure to the implementation of the ideals and objectives of the United Nations and uphold the principles of its Charter.\n109.\tIn the past year we have witnessed significant and welcome changes in the revolutionary rebirth of nations not only in Africa but also in Asia. In IndoChina we have seen the valiant people of Viet Nam and Cambodia reassert their right to redefine the national boundaries of their lawful territories and, in keeping with the principle of self-determination, decide on the future political direction of their people. We are disappointed that the applications for membership in the United Nations by the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam have met with opposition and we hope, none the less, that the United States will reconsider its position. We look forward to the day when all the independent nations of Indo-China will take their place in this Assembly. The revolutionary wars of liberation in Indo-China have ended and it is our hope that a period of lasting peace will follow. It is our hope, further, that in the peace that follows, the great Power blocs of the world will reconsider their relationships with the small nations and work for a humane and peaceful international order based on respect for and understanding of the rights of all nations, on justice and on co-operation for the benefit of all mankind and in order to promote a common endeavor to find solutions to the political and economic problems which still confront us. My Government believes that the relaxation of tension between the world Powers will become a dynamic process during which the security of all nations will be guaranteed. We believe that this process could constitute a reaffirmation of an abiding commitment towards achieving the desired results in the area of disarmament and respect for nuclear-free zones\n110.\tMy Government believes that, with the end of the war in Indo-China and as a result of the lesson taught by that revolution, cases of direct and indirect foreign intervention in the internal affairs of other States could be abandoned. The outcome of the recent Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, held at Helsinki, encourages us to believe that this can be achieved. What remains to be done is' further to decrease areas of confrontation and to increase areas of co-operation and mutual trust among nations.\n111.\tThe question of Korea is once again on the agenda of the current session. The text which represents the consensus of the members of the General Assembly was adopted on 28 November 1973.5 jt urges both North and South Korea to continue dialog to expedite the peaceful reunification of Korea, has not been fully implemented. Consequently my delegation would like once again to call for the dissolution of the United Nations Command and the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in Korea. We see the removal of the Command and the troops as an essential step in the search for peace in the peninsula.\n112.\tMy preceding remarks were a general commentary on the changing world situation. I should like now to refer to some issues in more specific terms.\n113.\tIn the Middle East, the roots of political tension and armed conflict in other words, the issues concerning occupied lands and the deprivation of a people's rights have been known for a long time now. What has remained elusive in the subregion is peace.\n114.\tFrom the outset I should like to state that Botswana has never questioned the existence of any State in the region. For this reason my Government continues to consider that Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) provide a useful framework for peace in the area. However, the prolonged tension in the Middle East leads my Government to the view that, if Israel wishes to ensure the durability for its own independence and future, it should withdraw from all occupied Arab lands and thus further demonstrate also that it accepts the legitimacy of the national rights of the Palestinian people. My Government supported the granting of observer status in the United Nations to the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO\\ because we believe that organization is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We believe that the strong and active participation of that organization in the current search for a formula for peace is essential, and we hope that the parties concerned will take into account the basic interests of the Palestinians in order to ensure permanent peace in the Middle East.\n115.\tMy Government is pleased that some of the parties concerned have since our last session already made some progress in identifying areas in which interim accords are possible. We welcome this development and hope that its momentum will be sustained, so that further relaxation of tension will create favorable conditions for a permanent settlement.\n116.\tWe therefore commend Egypt for its magnanimity and the United States for its efforts in the search for peace in the area. The recent accords between\nEgypt and Israel may seem minimal, but we regard them as a step forward for the Middle East as they set the pattern for further negotiations and for the settlement of the problem by peaceful means.\n117.\tThe volatile disposition of the political conflicts of the Middle East subregion prompts us to see merit in extending the presence and operations of the United Nations peace-keeping forces in that region. For, even allowing for the important role played by bilateral diplomacy in the Arab-Israeli conflict and in the unfortunate Cyprus situation, we cannot help but concede the useful results obtained through the interposition of the United Nations peace-keeping forces in bringing about the disengagement of opposing armies.\n118.\tThe desperate situation in Cyprus, which is as much a question of national independence as it is a humanitarian one, is equally of concern to the United Nations. It remains the hope of my Government that the parties concerned in the Cyprus situation will, in consultation and co-operation with this Organization, ensure that the aspirations of the people of Cyprus as a whole are respected and that Cyprus will re-emerge as a sovereign and independent Republic. This presupposes the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the island. We hope that the relaxation of political tension in Europe will provide further encouragement for a determined willingness to solve this problem.\n119.\tI fully agree with the remarks of the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization when he observed of the Middle East situation that:\n\\\"In attempting to achieve solutions of problems which threaten international peace and security there can be no place for despair, however great the frustration, and, in view of the alternatives, there can be no excuse for giving up the struggle.\\\" [A/10001 lAdcl.l, sect. XI.}\n120.\tWhile we rejoice at the attainment of independence by the new African nations, we are deeply concerned at the turn of events in Angola. Internecine strife has overtaken orderly progress towards independence. Arms continue to flow into that African country, not for liberation, but for self-destruction. We regret the plight of the refugees. Under such difficult circumstances, my delegation strongly calls for non-interference in Angola's affairs. We in the United Nations should speak up, as it appears to us that the Angolan people are not being given the opportunity to settle their own differences by peaceful negotiations. It is our duty also to exhort our fellow men to place their national freedom, their independence and their self-fulfillment before their individual political ambitions. We believe that our brothers in Angola will heed our pleas for an amicable solution to their problem. After they have fought so bravely for independence it would be ironical if that independence were to be postponed on account of their own actions. We urge the Portuguese Government not to use these temporary setbacks as a reason for delaying what they, too, have accepted as the fundamental rights of the Angolan people.\n121.\tFor almost one year now determined and sustained efforts have been made to break the impasse\n385\nand stalemate in Rhodesia through the Lusaka talks aimed at creating a peaceful atmosphere for a meaningful dialog between the Zimbabwe nationalists and the Smith regime to achieve majority rule and independence for the country. With every moon that has waxed and waned since then, prospects for an early solution to the problem have swelled and ebbed like lunar tides. As I address this Assembly the Rhodesia talks have entered one of their deepest troughs. This was not unexpected, for the Smith regime, with the reins of power in its hands, has consistently resisted any move to normalize conditions in Rhodesia to enable the African National Council and all its members to conduct their negotiations in the best atmosphere possible. Not all detainees were released; arrests and hangings continued; members of the ANC executive outside Zimbabwe were denied entry, diplomatic immunities and free political activity in the country, despite the concession by ANC to hold meetings in Zimbabwe at the insistence of the minority regime.\n122.\tWe remain optimistic, even in the face of such adversity, that the changed circumstances in southern Africa such as the collapse of the Portuguese empire, the withdrawal of South African forces from Rhodesia, and the determined resolve of the people of Zimbabwe will compel Smith to face up to the realities of the times and that majority rule will come to Zimbabwe in his lifetime. As members of the OAU we fully support the Lusaka Manifesto and the Dar es Salaam Declaration.7 Bostwana will continue to work tirelessly for the unity of the African National Council in order to deny Ian Smith the subversive strategy of driving wedges between its components and sowing seeds of disruptive dissension among them all to his advantage.\n123.\tThe Balkanization of Namibia into bantustans is a fact which gives us reason for concern. The South African Government has repeatedly stated that the people of the Territory will themselves decide on their future. We meet today long after the Security Council May deadline has passed, yet the only change is what the South African Government refers to as the constitutional conference in Namibia: the said conference has not in any way minimized our opposition to the Balkanization of the Territory into bantustans nor has it dispelled our fears that the continued refusal by the South African Government to involve the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and the United Nations in any talks on the future of Namibia creating unrest and insecurity in the Territory. A constitution which recognizes \\\"particular circumstances\\\" of population groups while pledging to serve \\\"the interests of South West Africa in its entirety\\\" admits the absence of unity as it envisages a confederation of ethnic States. We recognize SWAPO as the authentic representative of the people of Namibia, the party which regards Namibia as a unitary State and is, like us, opposed to the extension of the bantustan concept to this Trust Territory. We consider it vital therefore that even at this late hour the South African Government lift banning orders and release SWAPO leaders from detention in order for them to\nparticipate fully in political activities leading to the independence of Namibia.\n124.\tSouth Africa continues as an apartheid State, We in Africa accept South Africa as a sovereign and independent State, but we condemn its policy of apartheid, the religion or article of faith which does not accord the African the same human dignity and fundamental rights as the European. We object to a philosophy and system of government which is based on the maintenance of white minority privilege and black majority exploitation and oppression. We deprecate a form of government which perpetuates white supremacy and minority rule, denying the black majority full participation in the government of its own country.\n125.\tIt is noteworthy that there are in that country some white South Africans whose conscience is still alive and who, at the risk of being charged under any of the punitive laws of that country, have the courage to bear witness to the abhorrent nature of the system. I can do no better than quote what Mr. Beyers Naude, the Director of the Christian Institute, said at his trial in Pretoria in November 1973:\n\\\"If we, as the white population, do not take seriously the legitimate claims and aspirations of the black population, then it would necessarily lead to estrangement, to bitterness and to a polarization between white and black which can lead to conflict . which can possibly result in violence in our country.\\\"\n126.\tHuman relations in South Africa have reached the stage of bitterness and polarization and there are examples of conflicts and periodic flashes of violence. But the problem of not taking seriously the legitimate claims and aspirations of the black population remains.\n127.\tFate and history have placed the white people of South Africa in Africa. They have much to be thankful for and it is but a short step for them to identify themselves with Africa, to fulfill the obligations which such identification entails and places on all of us, and thus to become accepted as full members of the African family. Instead, the white man in South Africa has, for three centuries and a quarter, refused and continues to refuse to admit to himself, privately or publicly, that he is not a European but a South African. South Africa employs every legal device to repel the inevitability of its future character, that of a land where Dutch sailors and settlers, reinforced numerically by French Huguenots, were brought face to face with African people and where the population projections indicate that by the end of the century there will be only 7 million whites out of a total population of 50 million.\n128.\tSouth Africa is striving hard, through discriminatory legislation, to stem the evolutionary process of nation-building and to bolster a social structure which is doomed to collapse under the weight of its own laws. It works hard to protect its language and its vaunted culture, both of which are distinctively South African. It is trying hard to maintain a petite Europe in Africa through the suppression of African aspirations by all the paraphernalia of apartheid, behind which it hopes to sustain the outmoded concept of racial purity and preserve intact its Western European ancestry.\n129.\tThe establishment of bantustans, which are, after all, glorified native reserves, and their pseudo-independence are further steps in South Africa's segregationist apartheid policy designed to preclude the sharing of power with Africans. Bantustans are denounced by the black South Africans themselves except for the Transkei, as the independence they proffer is seen as, in the words of Gatsha Buthelezi, for instance \\\"... pseudo-independence that will make us poor cousins on whom white South Africa can fob off crumbs of charity, making us their economic vassals forever.\\\"\n130.\tThe Balkanization of South Africa into bantustans is based on the inequitable allocation of land, whereby 75 per cent of the population, or almost 18 million people, are allotted about 13 per cent of the land land which on account of over-population, over stalking and consequent overgrazing, is denuded and degraded and is continuing to deteriorate while 20 per cent of the population owns 87 per cent of this piece of African soil.\n131.\tBantustans spell perpetual tutelage and arrested political and economic development. It is inconceivable that South Africa, with its abhorrence of socialism, would allow the so-called \\\"homelands\\\" the free choice of their foreign policy, their military alliances and self-determination without interference or obstruction. On the economic front, too, the border industries, established to serve the white South African economy through cheap and abundant black labor, will stifle economic development in the so-called \\\"homelands\\\". Bantustans enhance and enshrine racial inequalities and ethnic isolation and heighten ethnic antipathies.\n132.\tThe bantustan philosophy is a contradiction of the historical constitutional development of the South African State itself, which developed from independent Boer Republics and British provinces to Union, and from Union to one independent, sovereign Republic of South Africa outside the Commonwealth.\n133.\tThe appropriate question to ask is, Why this politically retrograde step from unification to fragmentation? The reason is simply to prevent the full development and expression of African nationalism and to lead it into the blind alley of the bantustans and to make way for unfettered white supremacy. Even though the South African Prime Minister has played a positive role in the search for a peaceful solution in Rhodesia, he continues to deny the South African black people, in their own land, the rights which people from outside the country, if they are white, get so easily. He also continues to refuse to dismantle the apartheid apparatus or even to show a goodwill gesture by freeing the political prisoners who are now languishing in South African prisons.\n134.\tFor Botswana and for Africa it is not possible to have detente or unconditional dialog with South Africa as long as the prevailing conditions remain.\n135.\tIt is unthinkable that independent Africa can coexist with the inhumanity of apartheid or arrogate to itself the role of engaging in dialog on behalf of the nationalist leaders of the black South Africans who are languishing in Robben Island or some maximum-security State prison, or have been rendered stateless by the harshness of the conditions beyond their control. Any \\\"dialog\\\" about the situation in\nSouth Africa must be held between the South African regime and the African nationalist leaders who are the authentic representatives of the Africans, and not with any foreign Government or the South African Government-appointed tribal chiefs.\n136.\tMy delegation appeals to this Organization, and particularly to the friends and allies of South Africa in the Western world, to do everything possible, by precept and persuasion, to make South Africa appreciate that it is an African country, that its destiny is inextricably bound with the claims and legitimate aspirations, the dignity and the great future, of that great continent and its peoples. Yet, what we are asking for is human equality, majority rule, justice and human dignity for all.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "177.\t  Regular sessions of the General Assembly are nothing exceptional because we have become accustomed to them. But the present session should be of particular importance because it is without doubt the session of hope hope for the third world in particular and hope for mankind in general.\n178.\tIt is for me a pleasant task to convey to Mr. Thorn, on behalf of the delegation of Gabon, my warm and sincere congratulations upon his election to the presidency of the thirtieth regular session of the General Assembly. I know that the President is not here at this time, but I am sure that he will hear my voice. We who speak the French language have particular reason to be pleased at his election because he is the son of a country in which the sixth biennial congress of French-speaking peoples has just been celebrated, under the chairmanship of one of the most eminent scholars of the French language, President\nSenghor of Senegal. My delegation is firmly convinced that as a result of his broad experience of international questions, his outstanding competence, his proven level-headedness and his sense of humanity/ the work of this anniversary session will be crowned with success outstanding success.\n179.\tThe delegation of Gabon would like to pay a particular tribute to the former President, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, that son of Africa, who guided the debates of the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session with a talent and an ability which will assure him of a place of honor in the annals of the United Nations.\n180.\tGabon, through me, pays a solemn tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his tireless efforts to give to our Organization its full meaning and purpose. 1 should like to assure him that my country will continue to give him its support.\n181.\tOn behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, it is with deep feeling that I welcome the presence here of countries which, thanks to their determination to become free, have at last been able to join the family of the United Nations. I am speaking of the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the People's Republic of Mozambique. I should like to tell them that in the past Gabon was with them in their struggle towards the sunlight of freedom; today Gabon is with them still as we sing deep our hearts the alleluia of victory; and tomorrow there is no doubt that Gabon will stand by them, through the vicissitudes of their growth in the name of solidarity, that is of African solidarity.\n182.\tMy delegation would like to congratulate the country of Vasco da Gama which, after having so long refused to heed the voice of reason, has finally espoused the cause of truth and bowed to the inevitable course of history. We hope that Portugal will recover its former stability, so that it may fully assume its moral obligations towards its former overseas possessions, which today are on the threshold of their inter-national existence.\n183.\tThe United Nations has already been in existence for 30 years, and during that 30-year period it has not ceased to grow or to play the humanitarian and universal role which makes it a haven of peace and the hope of nations. The lengthy agenda of this session is a tangible proof of the vitality of our Organization.\n184.\tThe guns have been silenced in Cambodia, the guns have been silenced in Viet Nam and the entire international community cannot but rejoice.\n185.\tThe situation in the Near East continues to concern us. However, it can be said that the interim Egyptian-Israeli Agreement marks a step which gives us a glimpse of hope. But the Palestinian problem remains unsolved. In fact, the Palestinians must no longer be considered refugees. And when it is possible for them to return to their homeland, when they themselves are able to set up their own institutions, then mankind will have made a great stride towards the strengthening of universal peace.\n186.\tMy delegation does not believe that the United Nations has the right to stray from the principle of universality. All States must be admitted once all the conditions of admission have been fulfilled. It is in this context that at the appropriate time Gabon will support all initiatives concerning the admission of any country as a full State Member of our Organization.\n187.\tWhile the military situation has improved in South-East Asia, there are in that region some hotbeds of tension which must be contained. We refer here to the situation in the Korean peninsula.\n188.\tGabon believes that only dialog between the two parties can establish peace in that country, arbitrarily divided by the accident of history. Because of its desire to work for that purpose my country thought fit to establish an embassy in Pyongyang and another in Seoul.\n189.\tWe believe that the United Nations should take all the measures necessary to ensure the implementation of the mandate of maintaining the peace that has been entrusted to it.\n190.\tThe great Powers also have the duty of encouraging the process of reunification in order that the people of Korea, once again united, may be able, like a 11 the other peoples of the world, to play its full part within our Organization.\n191.\tThe thorny problem of Cyprus is of concern to us. Our Organization should be able to play a decisive role in that problem, in the well-understood interest of the two communities involved. For its part, Gabon will do everything it can do to make its modest contribution to the achievement of that aim.\n192.\tSeveral delegations have raised here the problem of Spanish Sahara. I too must briefly refer to it.\n193.\tI think that everyone agrees that the term \\\"Spanish Sahara\\\" is not a felicitous one. That is why, on behalf of my delegation, I express the hope and I request that \\\"Spanish Sahara\\\" will be called \\\"African Sahara\\\". I request also that the historic context of this African Sahara should be taken into account. I do not wish to dwell on this point, because I think the problem will be discussed in detail in the appropriate bodies of our Organization.\n194.\tWith regard to Angola, we hope that the three liberation movements will reach an understanding so that the date of 11 November 1975 set for the accession to independence of that country, which is one of the flowers of the African continent, may be met.\n195.\tAs far as Cabinda is concerned, we must recall that Gabon, which has always advocated the right of peoples to self-determination, voted in favor of resolution 1514 (XV). It is because of that sacrosanct principle that Gabon believes that the people of Cabinda must freely exercise its right to determine the future of its territory.\n196.\tThe international conscience remains concerned about the situation in southern Africa.\n197.\tIndeed, the constitutional conference on the future of Rhodesia a conference the convening of which we always supported is still at an impasse. The hopes raised by the meeting in Victoria were quickly dashed. We dare to hope that Great Britain, which is still the administering Power for Rhodesia, will assume its responsibilities in order that a solution may be found to this problem which constitutes a challenge to world opinion.\n198.\tWith regard to South Africa, Gabon has an unequivocal position. No dialog with the Pretoria authorities should be undertaken from abroad. During the Assembly of Heads of State and Government held recently at Kampala, the President of the Republic of Gabon said: \\\"If there is to be a dialog, it must be undertaken in the first place between the whites and the blacks of South Africa. How could it be otherwise?\\\" Although the word \\\"dialog\\\" is inscribed in letters of gold in the motto of our political party, the Democratic Party of Gabon, we in Gabon feel that no dialog with Pretoria should take place in the absence of those who struggle every day in South Africa against arbitrariness, humiliation and spoliation.\n199.\tAgain quoting the President of the Republic of Gabon, we say that \\\"dialog must take place with persons who are capable of engaging in a dialog\\\". By refusing systematically to engage in a dialog with the representatives of the liberation movements of Zimbabwe, the Pretoria authorities have clearly shown that they are not in favor of dialog.\n200.\tThat refusal to engage in a dialog is also blatant proof of the obstinate intention of the South African authorities not to put into effect our Organization's resolutions on Namibia. Under its mandate over Namibia, the United Nations must commit itself more than ever to lead that Territory to independence.\n201.\tFormerly one prepared for war in order to make peace, but today one prepares for war in order to make war. That is why Gabon, which wants mankind to survive, is in favor of disarmament by the great Powers, because universal peace depends on them.\n202.\tMy country warmly welcomed the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, held at Helsinki. We hope that the agreement signed at the conclusion of that historic Conference will not remain a simple pious wish but will become a moral code for ever committing the conscience of the signatories, small and large.\n203.\tThe seventh special session, which concluded its work three weeks ago, envisaged a redefinition of the relationships that must from now on exist among States in the spheres of trade and international cooperation. That means that the countries producing raw materials must themselves establish the prices of those raw materials, just as the developed countries establish the prices of their manufactured goods. It is inconceivable that the prices of raw materials should be established outside the countries producing them.\n204.\tThis is why Gabon has always proposed, together with other countries, the setting up of regional or interregional groups of countries producers of raw materials with a view to fight have witnessed so far in the field of international trade.\n205.\t more efficiently this absurd and obsolete trend which weGabon, which belongs to OPEC and, more recently, to the organization of countries producers and exporters of timber, whose headquarters is established in Libreville, has already chosen its road and will not admit of any other.\n206.\tI said that countries producers of raw materials must be the masters and the only ones to establish prices. Along the same line of thinking, we in Gabon think that the coastal countries should have sovereignty over the replenishable and non-replenishable resources of the sea. We consider that this exclusive sovereignty must be exercised taking into account the principle which has always governed the relations of good-neighborliness which we have maintained with non-coastal African countries, and also taking into account the relations based on co-operation which we have always maintained with the developed countries in this specific area.\n207.\tThe United Nations cannot, and should not, be the scene for negative confrontation. It should always be the laboratory of universal peace and the sanctuary of international conciliation.\n208.\tA country of balance and measure, a country aspiring to peace, a country opened wide to the world, Gabon, under the impulse of the President of its Republic, practices an open diplomacy. This practice, has two essential objectives: direct contact in order to get to know one another, and discussion aimed at overcoming difficulties.\n209.\tIn following this road, Gabon remains faithful to the ideals of our Organization of which it is a Member, rot through necessity, but by conviction. Gabon today affirms its will to contribute to the effectiveness of the Organization so that we may be able to concretize daily its basic ideal, which is the construction of a world where there is peace, justice and brotherhood."

        "file_text": "1.\t  I should like, at the outset, to offer my sincere congratulations to Mr. Thorn on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session, and to express my full confidence in his ability to conduct the work of the session successfully, due to his distinctive qualification and wide experience.\n2.\tI should not fail on this occasion to commend the efforts of his predecessor, the President of the last session and of the seventh special session, my colleague Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, for the ability and wisdom he showed in the conduct of the work of the two sessions, which produced constructive and desired results, despite the challenges and difficulties which emerged.\n3.\tOn the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the international Organization, it is proper that we pause a little to reflect on the work done and achievements made by it in some fields, and the difficulties faced and obstacles encountered in other fields.\n4.\tThe United Nations made commendable efforts during the last three decades to maintain world peace and security, and was able, by its intervention at the proper time, to contain local and regional disputes and to prevent them from causing destructive world wars, as used to happen in the years preceding its establishment. The Organization has become a world assembly for the exchange of views and for cooperation and the coordination of efforts for the building\n5.\tEvery year the Organization gives one proof after another of its universality and durability against challenges and obstacles. It was only a few days ago that three African States joined the membership of the Organization, thus trebling the number of its founding Members. I should like, on this occasion, to convey the congratulations of my Government to the People's Republic of Mozambique, the People's Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the Republic of Cape Verde on their admission to membership in this Organization. At f same time, I should like to express the regret of my delegation over the fact that the Republic of South Viet Nam and the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam have not been admitted to the membership of the Organization, although they are possessed of all the necessary legal and political conditions.\n6.\tThis year the world has seen in all fields developments which augur well for the future of this world. In the spring of this year calm and peace returned to IndoChina after it had been the scene of destructive wars lasting many years. Tension has thereby disappeared from the zone of SouthEast Asia.\n7.\tIn the field of decolonization, some nations have acquired their independence and have rid themselves of the detested yoke of colonialism, which has become incompatible with the civilization of this age. The peoples of Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe, Cape Verde and Papua New Guinea have at last obtained their independence through their continuous struggle and their determination to prove their existence so that they may like their places among the nations. In this respect our Organization has done its duty through the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the support of peace-loving States in speeding up decolonization in all parts of the world.\n8.\tHere reference should be made to the understanding and cooperation shown by some Governments in relinquishing their outmoded colonialist policy, particularly the new Government of Portugal, which has taken daring steps to abandon its old imperialist policy and to replace it by a policy of mutual cooperation with its former colonies. The adoption of such a policy by the Government of Portugal is not only a fulfillment of its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, but also a benefit to Portugal in that it is thereby freed from imperialistic ideas and fanaticism. The way has thus been opened for cooperation in mutual respect with all peoples.\n9.\tWe hope that States which still cling to the policy of colonialism will understand the exigencies of this \nage and, following the example of the new Portuguese Government, will take similar measures to grant the peoples still under their domination the right to self determination in accordance with the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and the {Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)].\n10.\tWhile the process of decolonization is being accelerated, peoples in other parts of Africa are still struggling for their elementary human rights. In South Africa the racist Government of that country still applies a policy of racial discrimination, although that policy has been condemned and denounced by this Organization. We regret that some important Member States still continue to violate the resolutions of the United Nations by supplying the racist Government of South Africa with military and financial aid, thereby encouraging that Government not only to persist in that racial policy but also to threaten neighboring African States and in turn to expose international peace and security to danger.\n11.\tWe believe all peace-loving nations should work to thwart all plans for the perpetuation of apartheid in South Africa so that tension may disappear from that part of the world. We hope that a complete blockade on the supply of arms and military equipment to South Africa will be imposed and that the military cooperation that still exists between some States and the Government of South Africa will cease.\n12.\tThe Members of this Organization are bound to do their utmost to terminate the colonialism of South Africa in Namibia by frustrating its plans to partition that country for the purpose of perpetuating its rule there and exploiting the natural resources of Namibia. We appreciate all the efforts that have been made by the United Nations Council for Namibia, which substantially contribute towards the attainment of independence by the people of Namibia.\n13.\tIn southern Rhodesia, the minority Government still continues to persecute the overwhelming majority of the people despite the efforts and continuous appeals to give them the opportunity to participate in the administration of their country in accordance with the principle of majority rule. From the recent declarations of Mr. Ian Smith it appears there is no hope that that will materialize in the near future. Therefore this Organization should increase its efforts to impress upon the minority Government of Southern Rhodesia the need to understand the international conditions of the present age.\n14.\tWhile we are talking of colonialism in Africa, we must refer to Spanish colonialism in Sakiet El Hamra and Rio de Oro. Continuation of Spanish rule in that area is contrary to the purposes of the United Nations and the principles set forth in the Charter. Therefore we insist that Spanish rule in those regions should be terminated so that existing tension in the area may disappear and the way may be paved for the settlement of the differences existing between Spain and its neighbors in Africa. Friendly relations between the Arab people and the Spanish people go back hundreds of years. Both the Arab and the Spanish peoples participated in the building of a civilization whose legacy and heritage exist to this day. Friendly relations are still maintained between the two nations, and we are confident that they will survive through time and that anything that may disturb them will vanish.\n15.\tDetente in the world is a subject of interest to all Members of this Organization. We have noted with interest that the great Powers have ir. recent years acted in that direction. The spirit of understanding and cooperation that has prevailed in the relations between the great Powers will greatly contribute to stability and the maintenance of peace and security in the world. We welcome the successive agreements between the two great Powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, on the limitation of nuclear weapons, as a step towards total disarmament, which is the goal of all peace-loving States.\n16.\tWe consider that the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, signed by both the Eastern and the Western European States at Helsinki on 1 August, is a major step towards international peace and security. But we believe that the peace and security the European States seek will be incomplete if peace does not prevail in other parts of the world. We therefore hope that the measure of agreement reached will not be to the detriment of small States and the States of the third world. We support any agreement for peace which promotes progress and prosperity in the world. Therefore, the understanding reached between the European States, and particularly between the two great Powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, should lead to the solving of the principal problems of the world in cooperation with this Organization. The most important of these problems are decolonization, racism, finding a just solution to the question of the Palestinian people in the Middle East, and the withdrawal of Israel from occupied Arab lands, in addition to the economic problems of the world. If we want to see detente have fruitful results, it should extend to all parts of the world.\n17.\tThe detente States seek will be incomplete if rapid steps are not taken towards effecting disarmament. Disarmament in all its forms is one of the objectives for which this Organization is working. While the two great Powers are working for the reduction of their armaments, small States are trying hard to increase and develop their armaments, and are competing for the possession of nuclear weapons, so that some parts of the world are threatened with the introduction of nuclear arms. The most important of such regions are the Middle East and SouthEast Asia. All States of the Middle East except Israel have supported the resolution on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East [resolution 3263 (XXIX)].\n18.\tIt has been understood from various sources that Israel is attempting to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East. As a result, other States of the area will be compelled to procure such weapons in self-defense. We appeal to this Organization and to world public opinion to thwart the attempts of Israel to manufacture or to possess such weapons, so that the Middle East area may be saved from destruction.\n19.\tThe great economic problems facing our world today are inseparable from political matters. Political stability facilitates the solution of international economic problems. Last year this Organization was able, after intensive discussion between the industrialized\nStates and the States of the third world, to declare a new international economic order. At the seventh special session on development and international economic cooperation, this Organization succeeded, as a result of serious consultations and talks between the industrialized States and the developing countries, lasting two weeks, in laying down the practical bases and rules for the new international economic order [see resolution 3362 (SVII)].\n20.\tDuring that session, the developing countries by their unity were able to put their economic problems within an international framework, taking into consideration the circumstances of the industrialized States. This approach paved the way to the adoption of the new economic order to which we all aspire.\n21.\tThe industrialized States were also able to realize that economic stability and progress cannot be maintained without the existence of a spirit of cooperation with the developing States, which are in most cases the exporters of raw materials. This fact requires an understanding on their part of the circumstances of their less fortunate partners. In fact, it was this attitude which paved the way for the confirmation of the broad outlines of the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (SVI) and 3202 (SVI)], and also the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)].\n22.\tIn this connexion, I should mention that the resolutions of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of NonAligned Countries, held at Lima from 25 to 30 August 1975, had a great effect in laying the foundations of understanding and cooperation for the definition of the interests of the States of the third world and their realization in a factual and practical way.\n23.\tIt has become clear that this Organization has proved to be the only instrument of understanding and cooperation for the solution of the economic, social and political problems facing the world, provided that Member States have a true intention and desire to cooperate and are prepared to avoid egoism and national fanaticism. The importance of this Organization in creating an atmosphere of cooperation and understanding among States on many occasions has become evident, particularly during the seventh special session, as I mentioned before.\n24.\tThe United Nations has in recent years established Programs for development, food, population and the regulation of the exploitation of the resources of the high seas. Many conferences have been convened under the auspices of the United Nations, including the World Conference of the International Women's Year, held this year, which adopted important resolutions to establish the equal rights of women and men, and to eliminate the causes of injustice and deprivation to which half the population of the world is exposed. The World Food Conference, held last year at Rome, set up Programs for assistance to developing countries in satisfying their needs for food, and to enable them to increase the production of their food resources and to develop their food Programs.\n25.\tThis year also the third session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was held at Geneva to pursue the attempt to lay down an acceptable world order for the exploitation of national maritime resources, the regulation of international navigation and the exploitation of the resources of the high seas for the benefit and welfare of mankind. Although the Conference at that session did not reach a comprehensive and acceptable agreement in that respect, because of the great number of subjects involved, their diversity and the divergent views of States as to their details, yet it is hoped that participating States will continue their efforts before and during the next session to narrow their differences and to agree on a general order of the seas for the benefit of all.\n26.\tIn the pursuit of that goal, the Chairmen of the three Main Committees, by direction of the Conference and its President, compiled three consolidated texts to serve as a basis for discussions in the forthcoming session which the Conference recommended should be held next spring in New York. It is believed that this step will be useful in helping to limit the discussions to the basic texts, which may be amended or replaced by more acceptable ones. We hope that the Conference will succeed in laying down a general and comprehensive agreement on the law of the sea within a short time, so that the causes of conflict among States in this respect may be eliminated and world economic stability strengthened.\n27.\tOn the other hand, the United Nations has faced many difficulties in other fields owing to the failure of some of its Members to implement its resolutions, and the nonexistence of an efficient system or a genuine desire on the part of some interested States to enforce the will of the international Organization. This Organization has adopted many resolutions on many matters important to the family of nations. If all Member States had endeavored to implement such resolutions, the world would not have been exposed to crises, and would have lived in progress and affluence.\n28.\tThis Organization has adopted resolutions on disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the questions of the Middle East and Palestine, in addition to many other resolutions in the political and social fields. Such resolutions were adopted by great majorities, but the minority, which can play an effective part in solving many of the problems involved, was not prepared in many cases to enforce them. Therefore, most of those resolutions will be merely kept in the archives of the United Nations.\n29.\tThe United Nations is the greatest international institution which can substantially contribute to the maintenance of peace and security in the world. This Organization has proved in the last 30 years that it can stand up to international challenges. It has been able to adapt itself to changes in international relations. Nevertheless, its ability to implement its resolutions is limited. We believe that 30 years after the establishment of this Organization, a review should be made of its system and some amendments introduced, so as to adapt it to the changes that have occurred in the world and the developments that have taken place in international relations in recent years. We think that the report made by the Group of Experts on the Structure of the United Nations system may be a first step towards the introduction of the necessary changes in the system of the United Nations. I should like on this occasion to express my compliments and appreciation to the Group of Experts for the efforts they expended in preparing that text.\n30.\tIt appears to us that the amendment of the Charter of the United Nations will not by itself be sufficient to introduce the necessary reforms in the system of the international Organization, unless it is accompanied by the intention and determination of all nations to enforce the resolutions of the majority in accordance with the Charter and the exigencies of international democracy. The strength of the Organization is derived from the will of its Members. Without solidarity in the enforcement of such international will, many of the resolutions of the United Nations will remain ineffective, and the temporary solutions applied, particularly in respect of the maintenance of world peace and security, will develop in the course of time into intractable problems threatening the existence of the United Nations itself and world peace in general. This statement applies in particular to the questions of the Middle East and of Palestine.\n31.\tThe question of the Middle East is one of the most important and complex problems facing our Organization. The Organization has great responsibility in this matter. This problem emerged when this Organization adopted the resolution on the partition of Palestine [resolution 181 (II)]. When Israel was admitted to this Organization in accordance with resolution 273 (III) of 11 May 1949, it undertook to permit the refugees to return to their homes, to compensate them for the losses they suffered, and not to establish in Palestine a racist State for the Jews only to the exclusion of all others. As Israel persists in refusing to carry out such undertakings, the Organization should apply against it the provisions of the Charter, particularly those of Chapters II and VII.\n32.\tSince that time, the Middle East has seen no peace or stability. Israel was created after the Second World War, immediately after the withdrawal of Western colonialism from the Middle East. Colonialism started thereafter to collapse in many parts of the world. But the Middle East has been afflicted with something more disastrous, namely, settler colonialism, which is considered to be one of the supreme cases of injustice in history, where the land of a people was usurped and they were exiled from it by brute force at the hands of foreign invaders who have come to establish a racist regime supported by colonialism. Israel, by its continuous aggression against the neighboring Arab States, has impeded progress in the area. The policy adopted by Israel in the Middle East is the greatest threat to peace and security in the area. The continuous wars waged by Israel against the neighboring Arab countries have almost led to a major world war. The danger of war still persists as long as Israel continues its aggressive policy in the area.\n33.\tIsrael has since its establishment in the area expelled the Arabs of Palestine, destroyed their homes, wiped out their villages and destroyed the heritage left to them by their ancestors. Israel has tried to wipe out Palestine and the Palestinian people, but it will never succeed. The Palestinian people have decided to survive and have shown their determination to pursue their struggle for the recovery of their lawful rights in Palestine. These rights have been confirmed by this Organization itself many times ever since Israel was created.\n34.\tWe are aware of the increasing support given to the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], which is the lawful representative of the people of Palestine, by various States in the world.\n35.\tIf the world did not believe in the justice of the cause of the Palestinian people, it would not have supported and recognized them as a people who have as many rights as any other people in the world to live in their land with dignity and within secure boundaries, as other peoples demand.\n36.\tThe question of Palestine has taken on great dimensions on the international level through its lawful representative, the PLO. This organization has been given observer status in the United Nations and in many of its specialized agencies, and has become a full-fledged member of the nonaligned movement. This has been a victory not only of the Palestinian people, but of all peoples who struggle for their lawful rights in freedom and self-determination.\n37.\tThe States which support Israel and supply it with military and financial aid bear a great responsibility for the tension existing in the Middle East. The aid which Israel receives consolidates its existence in the occupied Arab territories and strengthens its determination to ignore the lawful rights of the Palestinian people. This leads to the continuation of the state of tension in the Middle East.\n38.\tIn the view of my Government, the solution of the Palestine question is not confined to the contracting of bilateral agreements in 'he occupied territories. The core of the problem is the question of Palestine, the question of the Palestinian people and their entity and right in their land and heritage. The occupation of parts of neighboring Arab territory is merely the result of Israel's expansionist policy in the area. And the solution of this problem lies in the complete withdrawal of Israel from the Arab lands occupied since 1967, the return of the Palestinian people to their homes and the granting to them of the right of selfdetermination, as any other people in the world.\n39.\tMy Government welcomes all efforts made and steps taken to find a peaceful solution to the problem of the Middle East, provided that this leads to the solution of the Palestinian question and to giving the Palestinian people their lawful rights. Any step taken without considering the question of the Palestinian people is doomed to failure, and will never lead to the restoration of peace and stability in the Middle East area.\n40.\tTherefore, we hope that this Organization will play an effective role in the implementation of resolutions adopted to bring about a just and permanent peace in the Middle East, and particularly the enforcement of General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX), which reasserts the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination, to national independence and sovereignty, and to return to their homes and property from which they were displaced and uprooted.\n41.\tWhile speaking of the problem of the Middle East, reference should be made to the problem of Cyprus, which is a part of the Middle East. The question of Cyprus is of special importance, because it lies in the Middle East area, where tension prevails. Cyprus is an active member of the nonaligned movement and has done its utmost to preserve its sovereignty and independence and to avoid military alliances and blocs, and has succeeded in this policy.\n42.\tOur position regarding this island agrees completely with the resolutions adopted by the nonaligned group, which aims in substance at preserving the independence, unity and complete sovereignty of Cyprus and its continued membership in the non aligned movement, so that it may continue to contribute to the work of the movement. We believe that this Organization should pursue its efforts to reduce tension in the island of Cyprus and narrow the differences between the two conflicting communities in Cyprus.\n43.\tI should like to offer my compliments and appreciation to the SecretaryGeneral, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, on the efforts he has made and is still making for the continuation of the talks between the Turkish and Greek communities in Cyprus leading to a solution acceptable to both parties. I should also like to commend the great and laudable efforts he has made and is still making to enhance the prestige of the United Nations and to ensure its continued existence.\n44.\tOn this occasion, I should like to point out that we were honored to receive the SecretaryGeneral in Bahrain last February. He was warmly welcomed by the Government and people in recognition of his unique personality. It was a good opportunity for us to meet him and exchange views with him on international problems in general, and on the vital questions facing the United Nations in particular.\n45.\tFinally, I am pleased to commend the attitude of fruitful and constructive cooperation prevailing in our region in the Gulf, from which all traces of conflict and confrontation vanish. The greatest step that has been taken in the region this year is the liquidation of the differences between two neighboring States, Iraq and Iran. We welcome here the efforts made to create an atmosphere of confidence and cooperation in the region.\n46.\tI hope that the spirit of understanding, not that of confrontation, will prevail among all the States of the world, and that we shall build a humane and civilized society where justice and love prevail, and in which the generations live in security, peace and prosperity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I should like first of all to extend heartfelt greetings, on behalf of the delegation of Paraguay, to the President of this session of the General Assembly. We wish to congratulate him warmly on his election and to express our conviction that his wisdom and high sense of equity, as well as his devotion to the cause of the international community, are guarantees that we shall achieve excellent results that will be a credit to this world body and to his great country.\n2.\tSecondly, we should like to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General for his unfailing dedication to the cause of international peace and security and the unstinting efforts he is making towards the achievement of that goal.\n3.\tWe wish to welcome cordially the newly admitted Members of the United Nations, the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, and to offer our best wishes for the prosperity of those friendly nations.\n4.\tParaguay is aware of the full meaning of the principle of the universality of the United Nations. It understands that principle to mean the concerted goodwill of all the nations in their constant quest for the attainment of lofty objectives serving peace, security, justice and development.\n5.\tParaguay wishes to express its confidence that this gathering of ail the nations within this Organization will be not an assembly of rivalry and obdurate confrontation but a forum where negotiation and honest dialog will lead to the solutions demanded by the world, leaving aside all considerations based on regional groupings, political ideologies or petty selfishness.\n6.\tWe have repeatedly stated from this rostrum that Paraguay attends these world assemblies with great expectations and gives its friendly support to all efforts towards ennobling justice, comforting peace and the encouragement of man in every corner of the globe.\n7.\tBut we have also said that it is not enough merely to preach peace: we must make peace a fact and bring it down from the lofty place of intangible, charismatic values to the plane of fraternal dialog and harmonious and civilized coexistence.\n8.\tThe kind of peace that Paraguay aspires to is a peace founded on the dignity and freedom of man, a peace based on the economic well-being of all nations; a peace based on strict compliance with the pledges given by peoples and Governments; a peace that will not silence the right that man has, simply because he is a man, to dissent and express the reasons for his personal dissent.\n9.\tPeace is not the mere absence of armed confrontation. Peace is not, and cannot be, merely silence where before there was the rattling of sabres, loss of life and open confrontation. Peace must necessarily be the strengthening of order in justice and mutual respect. Peace must be respect for the fundamental human freedoms, as well as the freedoms of the groups that man has created for his own ends and for the achievement of his own dignity.\n10.\tOne cannot speak of peace when international agreements become dead letters. One cannot speak of true peace when we see entire peoples subjected by the force of weapons to warlike domination, a domination very often obtained with the support of the concealed or open intervention of neighboring countries, and it does not matter whether that intervention is camouflaged by other names or titles.\n11.\tWe can speak of true peace when in international arenas and forums we seek to judge all situations with a strict sense of justice. That sense of justice and moderation is to be found above all in the minds and hearts of men, and only long after that in the facts of everyday life.\n12.\tIt is in that sense of moderation, balance and equity in our judgment of all conflicts anywhere in the world that we shall gain the triumph of the United Nations and of mankind.\n13.\tThe kind of peace that Paraguay seeks is based on the attainment of the supreme values, without which there can be nothing that is firm and definite in the coexistence of peoples, Governments and systems. These supreme values are the only goals that can ennoble the work of this Organization and make this body a serious forum worthy of respect and an invincible force for the triumph of the universal community.\n14.\tWhen all the Members of the United Nations truly share those views, to their fullest extent, regardless of the cost or sacrifice, then we shall be building a better world for future generations. We shall in fact be working for the strengthening of a wide international order which will truly allow for unity and coexistence. We shall be strengthening creative peace, the source of all good and all beauty, far removed from domination and hegemony on the part of sectors or groups with their own interests, ambitions and desires for economic, political, territorial or merely ideological conquest.\n15.\tWe pay small service to the new international order that we should all aspire to and work for when we sacrifice the true dimension of spiritual values to specific considerations of whatever kind, considerations that are always transitory and changing.\n16.\tNor do we believe in the magic effect of words which are used so much that they sound empty or arouse the suspicions of the peoples.\n17.\tMuch has been said about detente, but the clouds of preparation for war keep on advancing, casting fear into the hearts of men. Much has been said about detente, but each day we read in the press about the tremendous increase in the trade in weapons, weapons designed solely for conflict, mourning and death. Much has been said about detente, but in international bodies petty and subjective interests are hampering the establishment of a better and more just world order.\n18.\tIn the name of detente the sacrifice of the autonomy of entire nations has been accepted as a fait accompli. There are those who are unmoved by war, waged by any and all means, against peoples that deserve a better life, and with no consideration for the views of their national majorities.\n19.\tThere is not nor will there ever be true detente so long as in the mass media and even in international bodies there are calls for verbal or ideological violence, appeals to the dangerous posture of claiming to be the universal and sole possessor of the truth at all times and on all questions.\n20.\tPeace is the reflection of the minds of men and nations. Let us disarm minds and thereby eliminate possible hotbeds of war and violence. If we do not loyally serve a philosophy of peace and tolerance, we shall not be serving the cause of peace and justice, or the cause of the consolidation of a more just and prosperous and happier world.\n21.\tAnything that we say about peace, troubled states of mind or hatred contributes in no .small measure to the efforts which must be made to achieve a new international economic order, the new economic order which is the very pivot of any progress in the future.\n22.\tThe developing nations cannot continue to wait indefinitely for a new, equitable order at the international level. National frustration, the frustration of three quarters of mankind, may take us to incredible depths. This is the hour of truth, of peoples and of justice for all; it is the hour of the elimination of unjust situations of privilege, although this may lead to diminished consumption in the developed countries.\n23.\tNeither the Declaration nor the program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202\n(S-VI)], nor the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] will make progress without the sincere desire of the industrialized countries, with their economies of abundance, for general prosperity and to help the less privileged nations achieve development.\n24.\tThere is urgent need for negotiation and agreement, freely accepted, to become a reality in this quest for a new international economic order.\n25.\tAfter a very brief respite, once again the troublesome situation of the developing, commodity-producing countries is before us, and now there are further disturbing aspects. The problem has become more acute and obscure since, as well as the classical parameters of development and under-development, there is now galloping inflation in the industrialized countries and economic recession and stagnation in the strongest economies.\n26.\tThe present period is fraught with great dangers which stem from possible hotbeds of international warfare and the dangerous economic situation confronting the world, which have their roots in the irrevocable quest for the well-being of the majority of its peoples.\n27.\tThe time has come for serene reflection and for a spirit of understanding of the needs of the majority of the nations. The time has come for comprehensive negotiations, undertaken in a spirit of solidarity. The time has come for deeds, not words, which are gone with the wind or which peoples no longer believe. The time has come to narrow the differences imposed by the location of natural resources or the geographical location of countries.\n28.\tThe gulf which divides the industrialized nations from the developing countries must be narrowed, not only for the benefit of the more needy nations, but also in the interests of the wealthy economies which will necessarily see their exports reduced in a world where the buyers suffer serious balance-of-payments deficits.\n29.\tThe problems of hunger, food, shortage, housing and education crises, lack of opportunities for the majority, health, social security and land reform are challenges to mankind and to the survival of the world itself; challenges that cannot be met without the sincere desire of the industrialized countries, regardless of their name or social or political position, to make true sacrifices for the benefit of the developing countries.\n30.\tParaguay wishes to repeat what it has always stated in this Assembly. We fully appreciate the part played by the United Nations in the field of the development of peoples. There may be doubts about the United Nations capacity to find permanent solutions at the political level. In the political field progress is elusive, difficult, slow and conflicting. But no one can deny that the United Nations, through all its agencies, is doing very laudable work in promoting the development of nations. Permit us to express here Paraguay's gratitude for the work of the experts in our Organization and for the co-operation our country has always received from the United Nations.\n31.\tThe United Nations still has before it the serious situation which has been created for the oil-importing\ncountries. Producer countries have every right to protect their interests and to obtain legitimate compensation for this non-renewable natural resource. But, in the light of the new increase in the price of oil, we are faced with today's harsh reality of countries which, for that reason, are suffering and will suffer greater difficulties in their economies. The drama of the developing oil-importing countries becomes much greater when we consider the frustrations that accompany that drama: abortive development efforts, pitiless cuts in the ability to create new infrastructure, precarious conditions as regards imports of essentials for their own collective development, the maintenance of the sources of work and the basic needs of their populations.\n32.\tParaguay hopes that the United Nations will be in the forefront of the search for equitable solutions to those terrible collective difficulties.\n33.\tThere will be neither peace nor justice among nations without the resurgence of a healthy economy in which prosperity is not the privilege of a few compared to the painful situation of the many. And may we add that that privilege may stem from the greater integral development of countries or the exploitation of natural resources vital for the technological world of today.\n34.\tAs has been rightly stated by the constitutional President of Paraguay:\n\\\"In the present international economic situation we must place every emphasis on the need to maintain peace among nations, on friendly relations, co-operation and unity, while tightening the bonds which, however far apart we may be, bring us closer, to the common sentiment of loyalty to the principles of civilization and culture.\\\"\n35.\tParaguay, a land-locked country, followed the work of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea with an open mind, jealous of its rights but hoping for the negotiations to continue linked as they are to development issues.\n36.\tSo far the reality has been far from encouraging. Despite the request made by the President of the Conference, countries still make unilateral declarations concerning the extension of their territorial jurisdiction, thus placing even more obstacles in the path ot future meetings.\n37.\tParaguay reaffirms what it stated publicly on 17 April 1971 at San Jose, Costa Rica, at the first regular session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States through its Foreign Minister, Raul Sapena Pastor:\n\\\"The Republic of Paraguay is a land-locked country which geographical and historical circumstances have deprived of the enormous advantage of having a sea-coast. However, Paraguay has the right to enjoy the freedom of the free sea, unrestricted navigation, fishery resources, the wealth underneath it and the air space above it To the extent that the coastal States arbitrarily increase their sovereignty by extending their territorial sea they are also arbitrarily limiting the right of the Republic of Paraguay and all other land-locked\nStates.\\\"\n38.\tParaguay nurtures the hope that a permanent peace will soon be instituted in the Near East through compliance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We believe that the latest agreement on the Sinai is an important preliminary step along the thorny road to sure peace. It is a step that we hope will be repeated in other areas of conflict. We would say the same with regard to the Cyprus problem, which still today represents a challenge to the prestige of the United Nations.\n39.\tParaguay has always supported a process of gradual decolonization. In this regard it would favor the free self-determination of the Saharan people and the disappearance of the colonial enclaves of Gibraltar, Belize and the Malvinas.\n40.\tParaguay shares the understandable concern of our countries about the need to achieve agreement on the delicate problem of the Panama Canal and also understands that the persistence of that problem decidedly affects relations in the hemisphere. For this reason, my Government wishes to co-operate in whatever manner it deems fit in seeking out the means that will ensure honorable and satisfactory settlement, for the Latin American community, which, at all times, seeks to defend its own sovereignty and security.\n41.\tParaguay has also always supported the admission of new Members to the Organization, thus making it a universal body without discrimination or selectivity.\n42.\tIt is therefore difficult for us to understand that the doors should have been closed on the admission of South Korea to the international community. If thus far only one of the two parts into which the peninsula has been divided has applied for admission into the United Nations, what valid reason could there have been to close that door on it? So doing has not furthered the universality of the United Nations. It is possible that the admission of one of the two Koreas would have speed up the entry of the other. It is difficult to believe that the presence of the two Koreas in the United Nations would make dialog between them difficult or hamper the process of peaceful reunification. The entry of the two Koreas would always represent a commitment in the right direction and along the right lines, as well as a commitment to peaceful action to achieve that end.\n43\tThere must be no forced or capricious discrimination. We must apply to all these situations the sound principle of non-interference in internal affairs.\n44\tThe people of the two Koreas alone can legitimately decide what they want for themselves, and Sen only by means of the free and democratic consultation of their peoples with no totalitarian groups claiming for themselves the representation of their people.\n45\tIt is unbelievable that some countries that at one point in history hindered entry of the Republic of Viet Nam should now have become its champions. Those countries refused then to support its admission because South Viet Nam had a multi-party and representative regime as opposed to that of North Viet NamNow Sin the south, too a totalitarian system has been established with a single, all powerful party they do not object in any way to its admission, although Viet Nam, the country, is divided. Nothing has been\nsaid of reunification, which it is sought to impose as an absolute prerequisite in the case of the two Koreas. And yet the unification of Viet Nam would eventually be easy to achieve in view of the existence of two Governments of similar social, political and economic structure, with the same ideology and the same place in the international sphere.\n46.\tWithin the framework of the international balance of power, shutting out South Korea logically led to blocking the way for the two Viet Nams. Thus some Governments do not apply a broad and just yardstick of universality, but rather follow a strictly discriminatory line.\n47.\tUnderlying all, these strictly sectarian an ideological criteria prevail. They were unblushingly voiced when the matter was brought before the Security Council. There, speakers indulged in the use of partisan epithets and! terms Chat revealed their bias and their discrimination.\n48.\tLet us consider these facts in the light of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The ink with which that document was signed is still fresh. And yet the everyday reality is far from the spirit according to which Governments should not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries so as to seek points of agreement rather than differences that draw us apart or bring us into confrontation.\n49.\tTerrorism and subversion still undermine the essential pillars of civilization. My country has denounced this state of affairs From this rostrum on repeated occasions. The international community has not given this painful human and ethical problem the attention it deserves, especially since terrorism and subversion are clearly connected with certain countries or transnational groups which overtly or covertly support, stimulate and sustain them.\n50.\tNo one is free from the ominous threat of crimes of terrorism, not even those who protect the terrorists and favor them for reasons of political convenience or ideological favoritism.\n51.\tThe time has come to make a clear stand at the international level so that planned terrorism and violence do not find in universal forums the kind of tolerance that, in the last analysis, weakens the rule of law, of what is right, decent, ethical and at the base of alt civilized society.\n52.\tInternational Women's Year was an outstanding event for the United Nations. In the wonderful history of Paraguay, women have occupied a place of honor in the hearts of successive generations. Women have always shown their greatness in love, in peace, in work and in the terrible days of pitiless war. As mothers, wives, indomitable fighters, men's companions at all times, as agriculturists, farmers, social workers and teachers, they built up a nation. And later, after the storm of the national holocaust, they built it anew. In my country, women enjoy full political and civil rights. The World Conference of the International Women's Year, which should have been a highly specialized event, fell short of expectations because of exaggerated and meaningless politicization.\n53. Paraguay lives at peace with itself and with all the peoples of the earth. Its Government and people aspire\nonly to peace, order, and justice, and to true democracy through egalitarian education and through free and open elections.\n54.\tThis month there will be municipal elections held throughout the country in which the Government party and the opposition parties will participate, some with open lists in order to win over those not already committed to the party concerned.\n55.\tThe people of Paraguay looks to the future with great faith, placing its hopes in the fruitful labor and lasting peace that the republican and democratic institutions have given it under its great leader and patriot, General Alfredo Stroessner.\n56.\tThe efforts made by Paraguay towards its growth and development are reflected in the fact that the national expenditure budget in 1975 is 26 times higher than in 1954, when the policy of monetary stability, still in force, was first introduced.\n57.\tThe constant growth of hydroelectric power has made possible the progressive electrification of, and hence the modernization of. the whole country. Much is being done to bring in capital which mobilizes natural resources without selling out to anyone. A comprehensive program of land reform is being carried out based on the real well-being of the rural people. Major hydroelectric undertakings which we have established jointly with Argentina and Brazil, known to all the world, are going steadily ahead. Paraguay is already exporting electric power. A well-ordered economy, built on freedom, with the State intervening fully to serve its free citizens, is a strong backing for investment and productive work.\n58.\tIn Paraguay today there is no room for unhappy strife between brothers. Its people has realized that the path of peace and civic tolerance is the only path to a promising future.\n59.\tParaguay, an exporter of raw materials, still believes, with sincere faith in man and in the United Nations, that prosperous and powerful countries will understand their rote in the changing world of today.\n60.\tWe still believe that peace means not simply the absence of armed conflict, but a realistic attitude on the part of highly industrialized countries in cooperating to ensure the growth and well-being of all peoples and justice in international trade; in the promotion of development; in meeting the basic needs of the country; in solving monetary problems with the participation of all; in technology, which should be open to all nations; or in the establishment of a new international economic order based on equitable treatment between unequal countries.\n61.\tThese achievements will narrow the gap which today separates the rich from the developing countries. They will lay the foundations for that better world to which we all aspire, of peace, plenty and freedom. There can be no freedom without peace, and without freedom man's daily bread is bitter and peace is a mere fiction, while peace with bread but without freedom reduces man's dignity and turns peoples into mere flocks of sheep.\n62.\tParaguay wishes to repeat what it stated two years ago: we want this to be a dynamic Organization above the emptiness of verbalism, something\nfar more than a simple forum. We want an entity of solidarity, where the powerful countries will help the progress of the world and all its peoples, where the same light will shine on all men, in all latitudes, where there are no longer some privileged countries and others that are consigned to oblivion, where there is no foreign intervention, no economic dependence or exploitation, no military or ideological subjection.1"

        "file_text": "93.\t Mr. President, in the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is chairman of the delegation of Thailand, it is my privilege to extend to you on his behalf as well as that of my delegation the warmest congratulations on your election to the office of President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. Your deep knowledge and wide experience of international politics and your commitment to international cooperation should bring about harmony and success in our deliberations.\n94.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, for the valuable work he performed during his presidency of the twenty-ninth and the seventh special sessions of the General Assembly.\n95.\tThe thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations is marked by the consensus reached at the seventh special session devoted to development and international economic cooperation. Although the decisions made at the special session are not instant solutions to the major economic problems in the world and there still exist some fundamental differences, both in substance and in approach, between the rich and the poor countries, it is none the less evident that the General Assembly at that session made some progress in arriving at concrete measures in selected areas of international economic cooperation. It is the view of my delegation that the most significant achievement at that session is the fact that a spirit of reconciliation and cooperation prevailed throughout our long and laborious negotiations. It should, therefore, be in the interest of all countries to try to strengthen this spirit of cooperation and move forward with a view to reaching further agreements and consensus.\n96.\tThe seventh special session was not an end in itself but constitutes yet another important step forward in the ongoing process which began with the adoption of the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (SVI) and 3202 (SVI)] at this historic sixth special session, and the adoption of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States at the twenty-ninth session [resolution 3281 (XXIX)]. It is by no means an easy task to redress the economic disparity between developed and developing countries and to restructure a new interdependent world to ensure the orderly and well balanced social and economic growth of the international economic community. But the recently concluded session provided a forum for genuine and constructive dialog which inevitably will help to convince the industrialized nations of the futility of prolonged confrontation. At the same time, we in the third world have also become less strident in our rhetoric and more realistic and unified in our approach. We indeed made collective efforts to urge the rich nations to accept the comprehensive and rational objectives of the new international economic order, as well as its validity and practicability.\n97.\tMy delegation stated in the general debate of the seventh special session that \\\"interdependence\\\" implies collective responsibility, with each partner bearing a responsibility commensurate with its increasing capability and requirements for economic and social development. This, in the opinion of my delegation, holds true particularly in the case of the developing countries. Thailand is an agricultural country with 80 per cent of its people engaging in farming and rice cultivation. In the last few decades, the Thai Government has intensified its efforts to promote industrialization, but the fact remains that exports of food grains and other agricultural products constitute more than half of our total foreign exchange earnings. Trade in food grains and agricultural products, therefore, is a matter not merely of vital interest to my country but indeed one of survival. My delegation is therefore pleased to note that these factors have been taken into consideration in the decisions taken at the seventh special session. It is our sincere hope that future arrangements for world food security and supply will continue to take into full account the legitimate interests of the food exporting developing countries, particularly in the determination of the criteria for the allocation of reserve holdings in the world food reserve system, as well as in efforts to increase food and agricultural production and to have a greater share in the world trade in these products.\n98.\tThailand has always been conscious of its responsibility to the international community in the area of multilateral and bilateral food aid. Although the volume of our production of and trade in food grains amounts to a small percentage of those of the developed countries, the Thai Government has consistently contributed to the United Nations Children's Fund and the World Food Program. We have also given special consideration to the neighboring countries and have taken every possible opportunity to come to their assistance in times of natural disaster and emergency.\n99.\tThe conciliatory atmosphere which permeated the seventh special session and produced partial results will be put to further tests in such forthcoming international meetings as the Paris conference on energy, raw materials and development and the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and in the implementation of resolution 3362 (SVII). The future will depend on the extent to which participating States, developed and developing, are able to reconcile their outstanding differences and to generate political will and moral determination to agree on the necessary collective and individual action.\n100.\tAt the Paris conference, SouthEast Asia, a major center for the supply of energy and raw materials, should also, in our view, be adequately represented.\n101.\tSignificant developments have also taken place in the field of international peace and security. The Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, signed by 35 Governments at Helsinki, may be viewed as a positive step towards the reduction of tension and the improvement of relations among the most powerful States. The recent agreement on disengagement in the Sinai is of limited scope. And yet its conclusion helps to maintain the momentum of negotiations and, we hope, may lead to an overall and lasting settlement of the Middle East problem and a just resolution of the Palestinian question. The Palestinians, as a party directly concerned, are as much entitled to their homeland as the Israelis are to theirs. My Government also reaffirms its strong opposition to the continued occupation of Arab territories by the Israeli forces and to any measure taken by Israel to change the status of Jerusalem.\n102.\tThe question of Cyprus, unfortunately, continues to be high on the United Nations agenda of unresolved conflicts. It is the hope of the Thai delegation that, through the good offices of the Secretary General, some significant advance will soon be made towards a solution satisfactory to the two communities, while the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the country itself will be fully respected.\n103.\tEvents of more dramatic dimensions occurred in our part of the world. After more than two decades of war in IndoChina, fighting was finally brought to an end. With its cessation, there came also a sigh of relief from all sides and a desire to start anew. We in Thailand are not oblivious to this important development in our region.\n104.\tWithin Thailand itself, there have been in the past two years momentous changes which have led to the rebirth of democracy and the proclamation of a constitution guaranteeing full freedom of expression and other civil liberties. Since February of this year, Thailand has had a civilian government, which is responsible to the fully elected House of Representatives. The present democratic system in my country takes fully into account the views and Opinions of all the Thai people, regardless of their political ideology or social orientation. In this process, a reasonable degree of flexibility has replaced the outmoded rigidity and has enabled us to face the new realities in the area with candor and confidence.\n105.\tIn this connexion, I should like to quote certain parts of the speech made by the Prime Minister of Thailand, M. R. Kukrit Pramoj, at the Foreign Correspondents Association of SouthEast Asia in Singapore on 25 July 1975:\n\\\"It is rational not to fear change, for change is in the nature of all things. However, in international relations such change, if it is to he in a positive direction, cannot be carried out by one side alone without a commensurate change by the other. If we have learned at all from our history, then all of us, especially in IndoChina and SouthEast Asia, must realize that we have no real alternative but to learn to live with and to adjust to one another in the spirit of tolerance, mutual confidence and trust.\n\\\"You can see that this is the trend all over the world; peoples and nations are reaching out, or trying to reach out, to mend the fences, to settle the differences that at one point in time had the fervor of a struggle between good and evil. Reality dictates that we must think anew because the times are new. We must dis-enthrall ourselves from old prejudices and evolve a policy which is rational for our own time.\n\\\"Meanwhile, for Thailand, we have maintained, and will continue to maintain, our opposition to any nation, large or small, that seeks to impose its will and domination over ourselves or others. We stand for mutual respect of each country's national identity and its choice of political, economic and social systems, free from external interference in any manner or form. This is the cardinal principle that must govern all interState relations involving Thailand.\\\"\n106.\tThailand has demonstrated its goodwill and willingness to assume friendly and meaningful relations and to live in peace and amity with the countries of IndoChina, on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and noninterference in each other's internal affairs. We are gratified that we have received a positive response from all concerned. It is our conviction that mutual trust and confidence can be rebuilt, and our common desire to usher in a new era of peace, progress and security can soon be translated into reality.\n107.\tOne aftermath of the war in IndoChina which constitutes an acute problem for Thailand is the influx of displaced persons from the three IndoChina States into my country. Today, about 45,000 displaced persons from Kampuchea, Laos and Viet Nam are seeking temporary shelter in our territory, and this creates vast problems for Thailand. It has proved an extremely heavy burden in both costs and administration for the Thai Government, which has made every effort to provide care and maintenance for them.\n108.\tIn this regard, I should like to take this opportunity to reassure the Assembly that the Thai Government's purpose in extending temporary shelter and assistance to these displaced persons is solely humanitarian, and that it seeks neither to protect nor to assist these displaced persons for political reasons or other selfish ends. Our authorities did not seek them out, nor did we encourage them to come, but none the less they came to Thailand of their own free will. All we are doing at present is to alleviate the human suffering and hardship arising from this influx of refugees. It is our hope that this emergency situation is of a temporary nature, and the Thai Government, I can assure you, is prepared to assist these people eventually to return to their homeland.\n109.\tIn this connexion, my Government wishes to place on record its deep appreciation to Prince\nSadruddin Aga Khan, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, for his concrete response to our appeal for additional assistance. The High Commissioner paid an official visit to Thailand during September this year which enabled him to gain an insight into the immensity of the problem of displaced persons now faced by the Thai Government. In accordance with our humanitarian aim, we have asked the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to supervise the efforts to alleviate the hardships of those displaced persons in Thailand. The High Commissioner's Office has now launched an urgent appeal for a fund of $12.4 million for the various projects to be implemented in Thailand, with assistance and full cooperation from the Thai authorities.\n110.\tMy Government, therefore, wishes to take this opportunity to make an appeal to all members of the international community for generous contributions to the fund so as to enable the High Commissioner to carry out the activities in an urgent and effective manner. I also wish to thank the Government of Japan for its prompt and substantial contribution to this fund.\n111.\tWith the passing of hostilities in IndoChina, it is now time to rebuild and rehabilitate the nations that have long been ravaged by the war. Thailand stands ready to cooperate with those countries and peoples in their constructive and productive endeavors.\n112.\tWhile a realistic assessment of the SouthEast Asian scene can bring forth a ray of light and optimism, the developments in the Korean peninsula offer little hope for concrete and decisive measures to remove tensions and prevent armed conflict in that area.\n113.\tAlthough 30 years have elapsed since Korea was divided into the North and the South, and 22 years since the establishment of the armistice, the reunification of Korea has not yet been achieved. It is, therefore, necessary that measures to accelerate its peaceful reunification be taken by all the parties directly concerned. When the joint communique was issued on 4 July 1972,3 it was generally anticipated that the dialog between the North and the South would result in some concrete progress towards the attainment of the goal of peaceful reunification of the country. Such, however, was not the case. My delegation would like to urge both parties to continue and intensify the dialog and to observe the principles of the North South joint communique.\n114.\tIt appears to my delegation that, so long as mutual distrust and hostility continue to exist, it will be difficult to resolve the issue of United Nations military presence in Korea. Irrespective of any Government's views on the United Nations military involvement in Korea, the fact remains that only the Security Council has the authority to decide on the question of the dissolution of the United Nations Command. To facilitate such dissolution, it is incumbent upon all parties directly concerned to enter into negotiations with a view to concluding an alternative agreement to replace the military Armistice Agreement in Korea. Pending such substitute agreement, it is doubtful that any discussions or resolutions here would have practical effects upon the question of the United Nations Command or the peaceful reunification of Korea.\n115.\tIt cannot be denied that one of the mqjor achievements of the United Nations since it came into existence is in the field of decolonization. The vast expansion of the United Nations membership is a living proof of the central role played by the Organization itself. This year, my delegation is happy to see an orderly and peaceful movement towards the full independence of three former Portuguese colonial Territories on the continent of Africa. The Thai Government welcomes their independence and joins others in greeting the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe on their membership in the United Nations.\n116.\tWe should also like to congratulate Papua New Guinea on the attainment of independence and in anticipation of its admission to the world Organization.\n117.\tIt is our fervent hope that the Republic of South Viet Nam and the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam will soon take their rightful places among us here.\n118.\tMy delegation is seriously concerned over the recent developments in Angola. However, we should like to express our hope that the efforts to settle the differences between the three liberation movements will be successful so that their long struggle for independence can happily be concluded.\n119.\tVery little progress has been made in the case of southern Africa. The adamant stand taken by the illegal minority regime in Southern Rhodesia is the major obstacle preventing the fulfillment of the legitimate aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe. The situation in Namibia, in which the United Nations has long been directly involved, has shown no sign of improvement. It seems that all the initiatives and efforts made towards the achievement of self-determination and independence have been frustrated by both Southern Rhodesia and South Africa, whose authorities continue to adhere to the inhumane practice of apartheid.\n120.\tEver since the formation of the League of Nations the international community has had before it the question of world disarmament. Some important agreements on arms control and limitation have been concluded. But the solution to the problem of real disarmament measures remains as elusive as ever. The arms race in both nuclear and conventional weapons goes on unabated. In fact, while we all subscribe to the principle of disarmament and proclaim our sincerity in adopting disarmament measures, global expenditures on armaments are approaching $300,000 million a year. Is it any wonder that all over the world there should be a grave shortage of funds for development purposes?\n121.\tThe SecretaryGeneral, in his very candid and lucid introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [AllOOOilAdd.l], has posed some very interesting and pertinent questions about the future role of the United Nations in disarmament. Year after year the First Committee allocates some 50 meetings to the general debate and the adoption of numerous resolutions, some of which are of no practical value. Perhaps it is high time that we devoted more time to the basic review of disarmament and to the question of structures and procedures of the United Nations negotiating machinery.\n122.\tMy Government, together with the Governments of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore, is now actively engaged in discussions on measures leading to the creation of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in SouthEast Asia. This objective, as propounded by the Kuala Lumpur Declaration of 1971,4 is in line with our common desire to minimize bigPower rivalry in our region. In our view, the Declaration will pave the way to the establishment of a climate of regional harmony and cooperation, which will strengthen our efforts, individual and collective, to construct a peaceful and stable region. We believe that this worthy effort on the part of the five members of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations deserves understanding and support and the participation of all the major Powers, as well as those within the region.\n123.\tThere have been many changes in the world in the past 30 years. The political map of 1975 reflects the complexity of the political issues of our time. Military pacts have lost their effectiveness, political walls have crumbled, realignments and new orientations have come into play. A new international economic order is being devised. Interdependence and cooperation appear to be the key words for the solution of such global problems as the environment, the law of the sea and the population explosion. Also, the women of the world have become more assertive of their rights and have deservedly assumed their roles in the affairs of the world, especially in the realm of economic and social development. All are welcome changes, proving that the peoples of the world are no longer prisoners of the very rigid ideas and convictions of the past. Perhaps a further evidence may be our willingness to examine the United Nations Charter, which, after all, does not even reflect the authorship of half of the present United Nations Members.\n124.\tThe Organization itself is also prepared to examine and review the economic and social structure of the present United Nations system. The question is not whether some restructuring of the system is called for, but how the restructuring should be undertaken in order effectively to meet the new challenges and requirements of the next decades. The actions and measures we may agree upon to correct the present system and capacity should improve our ability to cope with present and future world problems. Towards this end, we must all strive together.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n84.\t Mr. President, it is my privilege to convey to you and, through you, to the representatives assembled here, the greetings of my Sovereign, His Majesty King Birenda Bir Bikram Shah Deva, and his best wishes for the success of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n85.\tI should like to convey, on behalf of my delegation, our sincere congratulations to you on your unanimous election to the high office of the presidency of this General Assembly. My delegation pledges to you, Mr. President, its fullest co-operation and support in the discharge of your heavy responsibilities.\n86.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation of the services rendered by the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Foreign Minister of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria.\n87.\tMy delegation feels that there have been some positive developments this year in the field of international relationship. Many international initiatives have been carried out with a view to finding out solutions to some of the very important and outstanding problems of the world, the most important of which is the recently concluded seventh special session of the General Assembly, which considered the problem of development and international economic co-operation. The session convincingly proved that it is co-operation along with political will, and not confrontation, which is essential for alleviating the constantly deteriorating international economic situation.\n88.\tThe policy of detente has continued to be the main feature of international relations, with a promise for co-operation among major Powers.\n89.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, held at Helsinki, ended successfully with the signing of a Final Act by 35 nations, which is a genuine example of determination on the part of European countries to try to solve their problems peacefully among themselves and to live in an atmosphere of cooperation. We believe that the Conference will help further the cause of detente and brighten the prospect of peace in Europe. My Government has welcomed the Final Act of the Conference and has expressed its hope that the process of detente would be extended to all parts of the world.\n90.\tAmong the various existing crisis spots in the world, the hotbed of war in the Middle East, by its dimensions and possible consequences for international peace and security, must be viewed as the most dangerous source of tension in the world today. Nepal has always been in favor of the peaceful settlement of international disputes. We continue to believe that the various relevant resolutions, including Security Council resolution 242 (1967), still provide a viable framework for the just and durable solution of the Middle East situation. Nepal's sincere desire to contribute to the peaceful settlement of disputes was amply demonstrated by its participation in the United Nations Emergency Force with a contingent of the Royal Nepalese Army.\n\n91.\tNepal believes that the recently concluded Sinai agreement on disengagement, in so far as? stimulates and accelerates the reaching of a lasting just and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East crisis could constitute a significant step in the process of seeking peace for this dangerous hotbed of war wisdom and statesmanship shown by the leaders of both the countries in reaching this agreement is no doubt admirable. My delegation, however is of the\nrecognition of the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine is an essential element for the settlement of the Middle East question.\n92.\tIn South-East Asia, the problems of Viet Nam and Cambodia have now come to an end. And having victoriously freed themselves from foreign intervention and domination, these countries are now engaged in the task of national reconstruction. We believe that assistance and co-operation from the United Nations and its other specialized agencies will be able to contribute to their task of national recovery and reconstruction.\n93.\tMy delegation expresses its conviction that the establishment of peace in Indo-China will lead to the stabilization of the situation in the broader area and to the assertion of principles of non-alignment. Similarly, we also hope that the efforts of the countries of south Asia towards seeking solutions for outstanding problems and the initiated process of normalization of mutual relations between the countries of this region will be continued.\n94.\tThe problem of Korea, which is still unresolved, is a source of tension. No permanent peace in the region is possible unless this question is settled to the satisfaction of both parties. We note that Members are taking this up as a matter of urgent attention of this session. My country hopes that both North and South Korea will reopen their dialog in the spirit of the joint communique of 4 July 19723 with a view to achieving the peaceful reunification of Korea. At the same time, the deliberations of this Assembly should contribute towards the creation of an atmosphere conducive to the aforementioned objective. Nepal will support any moves which will lead towards this goal.\n95.\tCyprus has been a scene of disturbance to peace and security in the area. There is a pressing need for an agreed settlement of the Cyprus question. My country appreciates the personal initiatives taken by the Secretary-General in trying to find a solution to this complex problem through arrangements of various inter-communal consultations and negotiations between the parties under the auspices of the United Nations. We hope that the Cyprus question will be settled within the framework of respect for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non- alignment of the Republic of Cyprus through the full implementation of the United Nations resolutions.\n96.\tIn addition, my delegation wishes to express its grave concern at the continuing tense situation brought about by the arms race. There is, therefore, an urgent need that more concrete international measures be taken in the field of disarmament. There have been certain encouraging initiatives and developments in re-\nslowyearS in thiS field but progress has been extremely\n97.\tNepal has always supported all moves and inter-national initiatives which aim at contributing directly or indirectly to the objective of disarmament. It has always raised its voice against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and all kinds of nuclear tests, in whatever form or environment they may be carried out.\n98.\tNepal, being a peace-loving nation, is deeply committed to the cause of peace through disarmament. The General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session adopted almost 20 resolutions on various aspects of disarmament ranging from the creation of nuclear- free zones and the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace to the regulation of peaceful nuclear explosions and the convening of a world disarmament conference. All of those resolutions were supported by Nepal.\n99.\tThere have been two major events this year in the field of disarmament. Three depositary Powers  the United States, the United Kingdom and the USSR simultaneously deposited in March 1975 their instruments of ratification, which made possible the immediate entry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI), annex]. This Convention, which has been ratified by 40 nations, is the first real disarmament measure, since it calls for the destruction of stockpiles. The same kind of convention on chemical weapons has not yet, unfortunately, followed that course.\n100.\tThe second important event has been the convening of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held at Geneva in May of this year, in which my country had the privilege to participate as one of the few countries of Asia which is a party to the non-proliferation Treaty. Though the Conference could not reach any agreement, it adopted a Final Declaration [AjC.ll 1068, annex I], presented by the President of the Conference, which I think is quite significant.\n101.\tAt that Review Conference, Nepal laid stress on the importance of the strengthening of the security system of non-nuclear-weapon States and the promotion of international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear technology. It emphasized the urgent need to conclude a comprehensive test-ban treaty, covering underground explosives, because, in our view, it is an important step towards nuclear disarmament. We have, however, made our viewpoints clear on the necessity to make an exemption under the comprehensive test-ban treaty for peaceful nuclear explosions under the supervision and control of an international body possibly the International Atomic Energy Agency so that the legitimate concerns of these States that have seen the great potential benefits in peaceful nuclear explosions may be adequately met.\n102. We are of the opinion that there should be a sufficient guarantee of security of non-nuclear-weapon States against the threat and use of nuclear weapons. We believe that it is the responsibility of the nuclear-weapon States to meet this obligation because it ultimately lies in a pledge by nuclear-weapon States not to use nuclear weapons against the non-nuclear- weapon States and against one another. We hope that some definite progress can be achieved in the foregoing areas by the time another review conference takes place, in 1980.\n103.\tThe ultimate objective of all these efforts and initiatives should be general and complete disarmament, because it is only through general and complete disarmament that international peace and security, which is one of the main objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, can be achieved. We have therefore been in favor of the convening of a world disarmament conference in which all nations, whether big or small, developed or developing, nuclear or non-nuclear, could participate. It is a matter of regret that the Ad Hoc Committee established by resolution 3183 (XXVIII) has not yet been able to reach a consensus on such a vital question, but we hope that the Committee will be able to convince all the countries concerned, so that a constructive world public opinion can be formed towards the pursuance of this sacred goal.\n104.\tIn the field of decolonization, there have been a number of welcome developments in Africa. With the exception of Angola, where the transition to independence has been marred by internal dissension, all the former Portuguese colonial Territories, such as Mozambique and the islands of Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe, have achieved their independence. We very much hope that Angolan leaders too will be able to reconcile their differences peacefully through negotiations and facilitate an early transition to full- fledged independence and thus help complete the decolonization process of all the former Portuguese colonial Territories.\n105.\tThe constant refusal of the white minority regime of Southern Rhodesia to accept the just \\\"one man, one vote\\\" principle has been preventing the fulfillment of the aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe. It has denied the right of self-determination, freedom and independence to the people of Zimbabwe and has been consolidating its racist regime in total disregard of world public opinion; and in defiance of all the United Nations decisions.\n106.\tMy delegation notes with concern the continuation of the racist regime in South Africa, which, because of its aggressive character, constitutes a source of danger to peace and security in the world. It has illegally continued to occupy the United Nations Territory of Namibia against the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice.4 The decision of the General Assembly last year barring the delegation of South Africa from taking part in its work was designed to convince the racist Government of South Africa that its inhuman policy of apartheid was unacceptable to the international community. And yet South Africa has not only continued to deny the fundamental rights of human freedom and adamantly to pursue its racist policy of suppression of its people, in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but also has been making a mockery of all United Nations decisions. More concrete international action should be taken to put an end to this deplorable situation for ever in South Africa.\n107.\tMy delegation would like to congratulate Mozambique, Cape Verde, and Sao Tome and Principe on their achievement of independence. We welcome them into this comity of nations as new Members of this Organization. We hope that their admission to the United Nations will add to the strength of the Organization in dealing with the issues facing the world community today.\n108.\tThere is an urgent need of international cooperation and understanding among nations, not only for the maintenance of peace and international security, but also for the solution of many social and economic problems of the world. The initiative of the United Nations in this respect could prove very useful and effective.\n109.\tThe past year has seen the continuation of a series of United Nations conferences on global problems, including population, food, the law of the sea, industrialization, the World Conference of the International Women's Year, and so on. My country participated in all those conferences.\n110.\tAs we are one of the least developed among the developing countries whose economy is based on agriculture, the conferences on problems of food and population were vital to us. The Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization [UNIDO], held at Lima from 12 to 26 March 1975, was also significant for us because we look to the prospect of industrialization for our rapid economic development. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was of great importance to us because of our land-locked character and also because of the fact that the right of free and unrestricted access to and from the sea would not only promote economic development by facilitating trade and industrialization but would also help us partake of the sea resources. The World Conference of the International Women's Year sought a new and comprehensive approach to the solution of the problems that women face in their respective societies. All those conferences except the one on the law of the sea  have come out with comprehensive plans of action and various recommendations.\n111.\tThe third session of the Conference on the Law of the Sea recently held at Geneva could not reach a consensus, but the informal single negotiating text brought out by it will serve as a basis for the forthcoming conference, to be held in March here in New York. As the decision of that conference affects all nations, land-locked and coastal, it is hoped that the final convention will incorporate in it all reasonable concerns and claims of different interest groups.\n112.\tThe present international situation is characterized by persistently deteriorating economic conditions in spite of the efforts made through international organizations. Given the complex and wide nature of the issues and problems involved, the real danger of economic turmoil without precedent is imminent, unless a more concerted and realistic approach in searching for solutions to all these problems is adopted.\n113.\tThe turning-point in the present international economic activities was the sixth special session of the General Assembly, which adopted the Declaration and the program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and3202 (S-VI)] and set in motion a process in international relations. The Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, as approved by the twenty- ninth session of the General Assembly, was also a recommendation of the sixth special session. All those efforts made in long and arduous consultations and negotiations among nations will not bear any fruit unless all nations concerned show a spirit of co-operation and willingness.\n114.\tThe recently concluded seventh special session, which had development and international economic co-operation as its theme, has amply demonstrated the seriousness and magnitude of the problem. It was encouraging to see that all nations, developed and developing, in spite of their differences, were willing to make efforts in trying to find a solution acceptable to all. The session has further proved that the interests of the developed and the developing countries cannot be isolated from each other and that there exists inter-dependence between the prosperity of the developed countries and the economic progress of the developing nations.\n115.\tIt is a recognized fact that the economic progress of the developing countries depends primarily on the co-operation and understanding of the developed countries. The developing countries will never be able to prosper until the artificial restrictions of tariff and non-tariff barriers to the export of their primary goods are eliminated and an effective arrangement of international stocking and price stabilization and indexation has evolved, until the transfer of real resources from developed to developing countries is ensured and until a change in the present international monetary system is effected. The efforts of the seventh special session in these directions should be continuously pursued in order to bring about a speedy recovery from present economic ills and promote a healthy growth under a new atmosphere of international economic relationship.\n116.\tIt is regrettable to note that the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product envisaged to be forthcoming from industrial nations as their official development assistance to the developing countries, as set forth in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], has not so far been achieved. It would have substantially increased the amount of aid for the developing countries and greatly contributed to their economic uplift. It was against that background that during the seventh special session [2334th meeting, para. 123] I made an appeal to the effect that development aid should no longer be viewed as an act of generosity on the part of the donor countries but should be treated as an obligation towards the economic development of the developing countries. With this in view, I suggested and I repeat here that this should be devised and developed as a concept of a sort of \\\"international taxation\\\" whereby the developed countries would have a sense of obligation to contribute to a certain extent to the development of developing countries.\n117.\tA challenge to all the international efforts and initiatives for economic development is posed by the economic situation of the least developed among the developing countries. My country, which is a mountainous agricultural country, falls within this category. The situation is further aggravated by its land-locked character. The land-locked countries are facing a double burden in their development efforts as the problem of heavy and additional transport costs, among many others, makes their development more expensive and, at the same time, offsets whatever meager benefit they may get from their development.\n118.\tIt is therefore essential that adequate measures are taken for the economic uplift of these countries before their conditions deteriorate further, so that the objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade may be achieved and the ever-widening economic disparity between nations be narrowed.\n119.\tIt is a matter of great satisfaction that the international community, both within and outside the United Nations, has started to give recognition to the needs and aspirations of the least developed and land-locked countries. The Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, adopted by the twenty- ninth session last year, recognizes the free access to and from the sea by land-locked countries as one of the fundamental principles of international economic relations.\n120.\tThe recommendations of the Conference of the Developing Countries on Raw Materials held at Dakar in February of this year certainly emphasized the need to grant favorable terms of trade to the least developed countries, recognized the right of landlocked countries to free access to and from the sea and urged the adoption of special measures to offset the disadvantages of their geographical position, including the establishment of a special fund for relieving the burden of their additional transportation costs. The UNCTAD Intergovernmental Group on the Transfer of Technology has also recently come out with some suggestions for special measures in favor of those countries, The Second General Conference of UNIDO this year also adopted a resolution urging special measures for the industrialization of the least developed and land-locked countries [see AH0112, para. 287].\n121.\tMention may also be made of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of No n-Aligned Countries, held at Lima in August, which adopted an Economic Declaration containing provisions for special measures in favor of the land-locked and the least developed countries [jee AH0217 and Corr.I, annex, p. 34].\n122.\tAt the seventh special session, the General Assembly, on taking note in resolution 3362 (S-VII) of the special problems of those countries, recommended a series of measures in their favor, It also recommended that developed and developing countries in a position to do so should undertake special measures to assist in the structural transformation of the economies of the least developed and the land-locked developing countries.\n123.\tIn the field of the transfer of resources, developed countries are called upon to include in their terms and conditions of assistance a preponderant grant element for the least developed and the [and-locked developing countries.\n124.\tRegarding industrialization, the Assembly at its seventh special session emphasized that special attention should be paid to the problems of the least developed and the land-locked developing countries in order to enable them to play their due role in the world economy as warranted by their human and material resources.\n125.\tAt that special session the Assembly also recommended transmission to this regular session of the report of the Secretary-General regarding special measures in favor of the land-locked developing countries with a view to the immediate establishment of a special fund to offset the additional transportation costs of those countries. My delegation strongly urges that at this session we consider this urgent question and decide to establish such a fund, which should go a long way towards relieving the hardship of the land-locked developing countries*\n126.\tSince it represents one of the least developed and land-locked countries, my delegation is aware that all these proposals are very, very important. Further effective international actions should, however, be taken for the speedy implementation of all these proposals so that the aspirations of those nations may soon be realized.\n127.\tAt a time when the present international economic crisis is causing additional hardship through the spiraling rising prices of all imports, the scarcity of necessary developmental goods, monetary instability and all adverse balances of payment, which are in turn causing the speedy depletion of the financial resources at our disposal, we are left with no alternative but to look towards international assistance and co-operation. The program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the special measures contained therein, adopted in favor of the most seriously affected countries, are of immense importance to a country such as ours. But, to our great concern and disappointment, my country has not so far been included in the list of those countries, despite the fact that we fulfill all the criteria laid for such inclusion. I have already appealed to this body, during the recently\n* concluded special session [25.M/it meeting, ptira, 7J6], and I now repeat my appeal that Nepal be included in the list of most seriously affected countries.\n128.\tMy sovereign, His Majesty King Birendra, recently said that Nepal's quest for peace stems from our basic belief in the inseparability of peace and economic prospects. In that sense Nepal believes there is no alternative to the world Organization, not only because it has successfully survived for 30 years and has been largely instrumental in the maintenance of peace and security by sparing mankind from a third global war, but also because it has increasingly been making remarkable strides towards the solution of economic, social and various other problems of a global nature, such as those of trade, economic development, the environment, food, population and the sea, which certainly require global solutions,\n129.\tNepal's faith in the United Nations and its dedication to the principles of its Charter are total and complete. We shall always endeavor to our utmost and contribute to our maximum capacity in order to ensure that this international arsenal of peace is further strengthened and preserved for the welfare and prosperity of mankind as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "69.\t Mr. President, as 1 come to this rostrum with the signal honor of addressing once again our Assembly, a keen feeling of pride prompts me first and foremost to turn my thoughts to your predecessor. The twenty-ninth session and the seventh special session of the General Assembly owe their success to the dynamic action of Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria. Thanks to his great experience in international affairs, his shrewdness as a diplomat, his complete and constant commitment to the just cause of the oppressed peoples of the world, he helped us move towards the attainment of some of the ideals in our Charter. He deserves the appreciation and the congratulations of the international community for his services to our Organization.\n70.\tMr. President, your election as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly is a tribute by the international community not only to your continent, with its old and noble civilization, but also to your country, Luxembourg, with which Cameroon maintains excellent relations of friendship and cooperation. We are confident that, thanks to your outstanding qualities and your great experience as a statesman, thanks to your devotion to the ideals or peace, freedom of peoples and equality among all men, and thanks also to the assistance of all those who are by your side, particularly the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly, to whom we would extend this tribute, our deliberations will be conducted successfully. I hope you will not find it embarrassing, Mr. President, if, on this occasion, I yield to the temptation to refer to the great warmth and consistent sympathy that you\nhave always shown with regard to Africa which accounts for your now widely known nickname, \\\"Gaston the African\\\", given you in the European Common Market back in the days of Yaounde I and Yaounde II. It is therefore a pleasant duty for me to offer you the hearty congratulations of the people and Government of Cameroon, of its President, El Hadj Ahmadou Ahidjo, and of my delegation, which here and now pledges to you its steadfast co-operation.\n71.\tMay I also tell you, Mr. President, how very much we have admired all that has been done during the past year by Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our Secretary-General, to ensure that the United Nations establishes a presence wherever its prestige may make for any substantial progress in efforts to further peace and co-operation throughout the world. May I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to his integrity, his courage and his devotion, and once again to express our complete trust in him.\n72.\tThe present session of the General Assembly is being held at a juncture in international political life that is encouraging to those peoples of the world that are sincerely devoted to peace and freedom. To be sure, antagonisms and frustrations that are capable of seriously disturbing the peace still exist here and there, and the Secretary-General, in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, quite correctly points out that \\\"the hard world of politics and human affairs is not so easily diverted into the calm and peaceful channels of idealism and common sense\\\" [Al10001IAdd.1, sect. XXI],\n73.\tBut we cannot fail to note with satisfaction that, after having marked time to some extent during the 1960s, when colonialism was dealt one of history's severest blows, the process of the liberation of peoples has been definitely speed up during the past two years. Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, Papua New Guinea, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Angola all of these are names that call forth the hope of all men of goodwill committed to the struggle for human dignity, names that cause the backward-looking colonists and the imperialists thirsting for oppression to shudder.\n\n74\tIs it not a sign of the times that this process of liberation should be thriving at the time when our Organization is reaching its maturity? This Organization, after all, was born 30 years ago out of the determination of independent States to found a new international order based on respect for human dignity, on fraternal dialog and on co-operation among all peoples, bare equal and masters of their own fate.\n75\tAnd here we would offer our warmest welcome to the delegations of certain of those countries that are seated here for the first time in this gathering as representatives of sovereign States. Their presence among us is clear proof that ours is a rapidly changing world and that we are moving inevitably toward that universality that is the goal of the United Nations.\n76. The march of peoples to freedom is irresistible All States are aware of this, and in any case, those that pretend to forget this fact are in for a rude awakening.\n77.\tLess than a year ago no one could foresee with any certainty that the peoples of Indo-China were so close to complete liberation. In that connexion, welcoming as we do the return of peace to that peninsula, my delegation firmly believes that it is high time the courageous people of Viet Nam recovered its rightful place in the concert of nations, so that, with the assistance of the international community, it may bind up its wounds, rebuild its country in peace and without interference, and contribute actively to the settlement of the burning problems confronting mankind today.\n78.\tRespecting Korea, the Government and people of Cameroon know from their own experience the price of national unity. For that reason, Cameroon, which maintains relations of friendship and co-operation with both Korean States, must pursue its efforts to contribute to the best of its ability to the independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean homeland. In that connexion, we find it difficult to condone the maintenance, in one part of that country, of foreign troops, who in any case will never respect what for us is the sacred principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.\n79.\tThat same principle of non-interference determines our position in the distressing matter of Cyprus. If the two communities, which, though of different origins, are nevertheless bound together by the same national destiny, had been able to enter into a brotherly dialog, free from all intervention from outside, the island of Cyprus would have been spared much suffering. We are grateful to the Secretary-General for his unceasing efforts to encourage the return of peace to the island and to safeguard the independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment policy of that country, in conformity with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council of our Organization.\n80.\tMay I now turn to the problems of Africa, a continent which, more than any other, has had to suffer oppression, a continent which is a constant source of concern to my Government. The 12 months that have passed since the last regular session of the General Assembly have indeed resulted in great upheavals on our continent. Despite the desperate maneuvering of certain backward-looking colonialists, Mozambique, Cape Verde, and Sao Tome and Principe have now all achieved full sovereignty. It is above all to the liberation movements of these brother countries that we owe our heartiest congratulations, for not only have they brought down a colonial system which for centuries was particularly oppressive, but they have shown also that freedom is indivisible, since by their sacrifices they have made it possible for the Portuguese people themselves to throw off the dictatorial yoke.\n81.\tWe know, however, that the struggle is not over. Great watchfulness must be the order of the day while the independence of the young States is put on a firm basis. The subversive schemes of the enemies of Africa, who kindle the flames of hatred and discord in Angola, must be exposed and combated. Our Angolan brothers, we are convinced, will heed the urgent appeal that we are making to them to lay down their arms arms provided by interventionist forces in all quarters to stop killing each other, and to resolve\nto put an end to the quarrels that discredit them and make Africa the laughing-stock of its enemies. We call upon all Members of this Assembly to refrain from encouraging in any way this fratricidal war, and to cease interfering in the internal affairs of Angola,\n82.\tWe take this opportunity to congratulate the new Portugal for having kept the commitments on decolonization which it made to the international community. We would remind it, however, that until powers are transferred to the representatives of the Angolan people, it retains its responsibilities for the security and territorial integrity of that country.\n83.\tFinally, we welcome the understanding, the restraint, and the sense of responsibility shown by all brother countries directly involved in the question of the so-called Spanish Sahara in the search for a just and equitable solution.\n84.\tTurning to the Comoros, without wanting to minimize the difficulties and unpredictable events which accompany any effort at decolonization, we earnestly hope that that archipelago in the Indian Ocean, which has been declared a zone of peace by our Organization, will soon attain its independence, unity and sovereignty.\n85.\tOur sadness is great as we turn our eyes to the bastions of domination strengthened by racism and apartheid which continue to exist in Azania, Zimbabwe, and the international Territory of Namibia.\n86.\tNeed I remind you of the position of Cameroon on this subject? In accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations and with the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, the racist clique must put an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia. Powers must immediately be transferred to the genuine representatives of the Namibian people, who have been fighting for years under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization. The United Nations must continue to seek ways and means of safeguarding the territorial integrity of Namibia and of preventing the plundering of its wealth.\n87.\tWe condemn the triple vetoes cast in October 1974 and June 1975, which only serve to encourage the racist South African forces to continue to defy the international community and to take a scornful attitude towards the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and by the Security Council.\n88.\tIn Zimbabwe, the responsibilities of the administering Power remain. It is up to the administering Power to use all means, including force, to make the racist white minority, which has usurped power in Salisbury, come to its senses.\n89.\tWe pledge our complete support to the liberation movements of Zimbabwe, which have established a united front to lead their people in a fight which must inevitably lead to an early victory.\n90.\tAlready, the racists are panicking. For some time now we have seen them engage in feverish activities whose obvious purpose is to divide Africa and to delay the advent of their defeat.\n91.\tNeed I repeat that if they wish to enter into a dialog, they know who are the right people to talk to, namely, the liberation movements recognized by\nthe Organization of African Unity, which are the only authentic representatives of their people.\n92.\tCameroon will not spare any effort in its commitment to the total liberation of Africa. With all other peoples devoted to peace, justice and liberty, we will pursue the fight on all fronts.\n93.\tFreedom is man's most prized possession, next to life itself. But it is not granted as life is; it is a delicious fruit which the peoples of the world may taste only after a long and bitter combat.\n94.\tThat, then, is the meaning of the ordeal in the Middle East, where a State Member of this Organization has seized the territories of others by force, reducing millions of persons to the status of wandering and stateless refugees.\n95.\tThe non-use of force in the settlement of international disputes is recognized by the Charter and international law, and is a principle which the Government of Cameroon holds dear.\n96.\tThat, and not some tendentious interpretation by those who care little for our dignity, explains our attitude towards Israel and our actions in the United Nations and other international organizations aimed at forcing that country to withdraw from occupied Arab territories and to respect the undeniable rights of the Palestinian people.\n97.\tIt is our hope that present efforts in the Middle East will accelerate the process of establishing a just and lasting peace, safeguarding the interests of all the parties concerned in the area in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.\n98.\tToday's world, for a number of years now, has been going through a social and economic crisis which it will be able to overcome only if all nations dispassionately act together in an appropriate framework such as this Organization.\n99.\tBeyond question, the present crisis is the result of the selfishness of the strong, who would exploit the weak instead of agreeing to promote mutual development, with complete respect for the interests of every nation and for the special identity and dignity of each nation.\n100.\tIt is the plight of today's world that the progress of science and technology has made it possible for a privileged minority to monopolize most of the common resources of mankind, while three quarters of the human race continue to endure the harsh yoke of poverty and to feed on the most illusory hopes.\n101.\tThat excessive egoism has often been seen in the various gatherings convened by the United Nations and its specialized agencies over the years.\n102.\tWe are thinking above all of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, to which Cameroon attaches considerable importance. Although our geographical position in relation to the ocean spaces is not particularly advantageous, we share with other developing countries a deep concern arising from our fears of seeing the common heritage of mankind exploited in the interests of the same privileged minority.\n103.\tThe resources of the world have brought about the prosperity of the human race, but not without confrontation and war. We must not allow a new torm\nof domination to emerge in the ocean spaces which would destroy everything that our generation has done to bring about global development and international peace,\n104.\tNations must take this opportunity to purify their own special interests by bringing them within the general framework of interdependence and understanding among peoples, in order to exclude new causes of hostility from a world already beset by so many economic, social and political tensions.\n105.\tWe believe that the unified texts submitted by the President of the Conference and by the chairmen of the three committees of the Conference represent a useful basis for negotiations. The Conference should give them serious consideration at the next session as it might thus be able to emerge from the impasse imposed on it by those who are well content with the status quo.\n106.\tMy country will tenaciously pursue its efforts at bringing about a joint action both at the regional level and with other nations of the world, with a view to preparing a new form of the law of the sea based on justice and on the developmental requirements of all States.\n107.\tIt is not my intention here to dwell on the many other gatherings held over the past 12 months which have made it possible for the countries of the third world to determine the appropriate objectives and methods of action for resolving the problems pertaining to their development. At the seventh special session we have just considered in detail the impact of the international economic situation on the countries of the third world.\n108.\tCameroon, of course, has not waited until now to denounce the vices of a selfish economic and commercial system. We have always denounced, among other things, the constant deterioration in terms of trade, which is a major cause of the growing gap between the rich and poor nations.\n109.\tThat is why Cameroon will do what it can to support and foster any action which would translate into action the measures adopted at the sixth and seventh special sessions relating to the establishment of a new international economic order, in the hope that the objectives of the Charter of the Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] will be achieved.\n110.\tWe hope that the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation, proposed by the French Head of State, will produce effective solutions not only to the problems of energy but to the whole range of problems relating to raw materials, bearing in mind the interests of the developing countries.\n111\tIt is high time that the developed countries understood that their delay in satisfying the just grievances of the developing countries is inconsistent with the need for detente, much more obvious today than ever before in a world exhausted by decades of confrontations of all kinds.\n112\tAt the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe we perceived a few rays of hope inasmuch as the strengthening of detente in that part of the world which had seen the origin of two world wars \nmight well serve the cause of development of the countries of the third world.\n113.\tNevertheless, we cannot fail to note that sources of tension continue, particularly in certain countries of the third world, and none can predict that they will not lead to a widespread conflict. Our concern is the more justified, because notwithstanding the partial agreements concluded among the major military Powers, the arms race is continuing unabated.\n114.\tReductions in the stockpile of weapons, announced from time to time, are nothing but propaganda, for in the East as in the West armament policies are today essentially qualitative in nature. We all know that there is no area where research is more dedicated to greater accuracy, power and invulnerability than in this area. In the East and in the West technology is flourishing and enjoys high political priority. That applies to all areas of destruction strategic nuclear weapons, tactical nuclear weapons, conventional weapons, chemical weapons, psychological warfare and applies also to outer space, to the Earth and to the oceans.\n115.\tOnce again I must state the belief of the Government of Cameroon that the old adage he who wants peace, prepares for war should be considered out of date today.\n116.\tWe favor general and complete disarmament under the auspices of the international community as a whole. We firmly support the proposal immediately to put an end to nuclear and thermonuclear tests, to conclude a treaty banning those tests and to convert to peaceful purposes of economic, social and cultural development the factories in which those weapons are manufactured. We support equally firmly the plan to have a world-wide disarmament conference which would make it possible for all States to reach appropriate decisions on problems which are crucial for their survival.\n117.\tIt is a fallacy to claim that the means for massive destruction with which some States are equipping themselves will never be used except for purposes of mutual intimidation. The well-being of mankind has hardly ever required that it live constantly under the sword of Damocles.\n118.\tThe liberation of the oppressed peoples of the world is nigh. Many nations, which only yesterday were fighting on the battlefield, are today working together to build a new world, to build the foundations of tomorrow's civilization, where the principle that \\\"might makes right\\\" will yield to the rule of law. We must move towards detente; co-operation must be strengthened and made a reality a concrete reality for the well-being of the entire world. That presupposes that our resolutions and recommendations, our agreements and treaties, will emerge from the comfortable surroundings of idle diplomacy and filter through to the roots of a rising generation. That also presupposes a new ethic in international relations where national selfishness will give way to a more universal sense of human solidarity.\n119.\tIt is to be hoped that the need for such a civilization will be felt increasingly by those institutions whose task it is to train the principal protagonists in international life, and that we will see the emergence of training centers and research centers for diplomatic\nand international questions which will go beyond the narrow framework of States and that applies both to recruitment and to the orientation of the training courses.\n120.\tI have just stated the position of my Government on the fundamental problems which confront us today. The international situation, as we are well aware, is depressing in a number of areas, but there are signs that the clouds are breaking up. We have noted with pleasure that here and there in the world there is a growing awareness of the need to establish a new international order.\n121.\tMay that political will, which emerged in the course of the seventh special session of the General Assembly, also guide the deliberations of our present session, so that our determination to build a world of peace and justice may lead to effective and humane action, bringing about solidarity and interdependence and uniting the peoples of the world.\n122.\tThe United Nations is an ideal place for this growing awareness to be expressed. We welcome this now as we are celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of our Organization. Cameroon remains convinced that at the present time the role of our Organization is irreplaceable as an instrument for maintaining peace and international security and as an ideal center where new international relations, just and in accordance with the aspirations of the entire world, may be established.\n123.\tOf course, its structures are hardly perfect. We believe that the jurisdiction of its various bodies and the way in which political authority has been distributed, should be altered, taking into account on the one hand changes which have taken place in the United Nations and the specialized agencies since its Charter was drafted, and on the other hand the admission of a large number of new Members which for the most part are countries of the third world.\n124.\tWe also reaffirm our loyalty to the movement of the non-aligned countries. I would even say that that loyalty is the corner-stone of our foreign policy because, as was recently stated by the Head of State of Cameroon, El Hadj Ahmadou Ahidjo, non-alignment, which used to consist in a dexterous form of co-operation aimed at establishing an uncertain equilibrium between two different approaches to the world, appears today as a way of asserting our personality in the international arena, a way of asserting our determination to be independent in other words, a way of asserting our own free will in international relations.\n125.\tNo aspect of our policy of non-alignment, however, should be seen as negative or as an expression of a desire to remain in isolation. To us, non-alignment means, first and foremost, non-interference in the internal affairs of others. Non-alignment, to us, also means the renunciation of the use or the threat of the use of force in the settlement of international conflicts. Non-alignment, to us, means also a state of constant vigilance in the face of all organized powers, present or future, without any prejudice against any of them. It also means that we are constantly prepared to extend a friendly hand of loyal co-operation, while never sacrificing any of our vital interests.\n126.\tLastly, non-alignment, to us, also means tolerance and peaceful even dynamic coexistence among States with different political, social or economic regimes, working together to promote a world of peoples that are equal, that are freed from domination and fear, and that respect each other.\n127.\tIn other words, non-alignment, for us, is not the opposite of international co-operation, but its complement. We believe in the solidarity and interdependence of mankind; we believe that mankind may be compared to a chain, whose strength depends on the strength of its weakest link. International co-operation, consequently, is absolutely essential for the survival of mankind and must be extended both vertically and horizontally.\n128.\tIn the wake of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Lima, the results of which were a useful contribution to the settlement of the vital problems of the world's peoples, and at a time when Cameroon is assuming important responsibilities as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, and now that the seventh special session of the Assembly devoted to development and international co-operation has just established the basis for constructive and promising dialog between developed and developing countries in order resolutely to attack the problem of orderly development for one and all, I am pleased to reaffirm the determination of my Government to do its utmost to promote, not a bipolar world based on the constant confrontation of ideologies and interests, but a multipolar world more open to a universal civilization that alone can provide an effective and humane response to the burning problems confronting today's world.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "117.\t It is for me a source of great pleasure to extend to the President, on behalf of the Liberian delegation, sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirtieth regular session of the General Assembly. Luxembourg, as a founding Member of this global Organization for peace, has been fully engaged in the unceasing international effort to translate the ideals of the Charter into living reality within the framework of a world community exposed to the constancy, inevitability and necessity of change. From an extraordinarily brilliant and remarkable career, he brings to this high office a wealth of experience and an accumulation of knowledge not easily matched. As he discharges his responsibilities, he can be assured of the full support of the Liberian delegation.\n118.\tPermit me to take this opportunity also to extend to his distinguished predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria, an outstanding son of Africa, heartfelt appreciation for the very able and highly effective manner in which he presided over the work of the twenty-ninth regular session as well as the seventh special session.\n119.\tWe commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the very efficient manner in which he continues to conduct the affairs of the Secretariat and his untiring efforts in the interest of international peace and security and the promotion of multilateral co-operation.\n120.\tAfter a protracted period of bitter and self- sacrificial struggle for emancipation from the yoke of colonialist domination, Liberia is once again overjoyed and proud to welcome into the United Nations and into the comity of free nations another group of African States, this time the State of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the People's Republic of Mozambique. As the earlier victories over colonialism and oppression were valuable assets to these new Member States during their struggle, so their victories can only serve to reinforce the will and harden the resolve of those of our common human family still subjected to the indignities of colonialism, racist minority rule and apartheid.\n121.\tIn welcoming these three new States into the United Nations we look forward to the complete liquidation of Portuguese colonialism in Africa with the impending independence of Angola later this year. We sincerely hope and trust that, in the supreme interest of the great nation of Angola which must have its independence fully restored, the political leaders of that territory will, in the sacred African tradition, resolve their differences and not allow the disruptive influence of external forces to continue to undermine the noble objectives of self-determination and independence.\n122.\tWe are gathered here at this regular session, which significantly marks the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of our great Organization, to deliberate on the agenda items before us, and profoundly to ponder the crises which beset our world as well as to formulate in togetherness solutions for the serious attitudinal and structural ills of contemporary international society. For in the end, whether we discuss a particular political problem in a given region of the world, or whether we address ourselves to the problems of human welfare poverty, population, food, fuel, status of women, natural resources, industrialization, environment and better trade and monetary arrangements a sine qua non for genuine progress in all of these and other areas is national recognition of the changing realities and necessities of international relations, national willingness to respond to these changes and a collective preparedness to readjust international machinery for the implementation of the genuine collective will.\n123.\tThe Secretary-General with perspicacity and perceptiveness diagnosed the source, or, shall I say, sources, of the problems which confront the international community when he observed in the introduction to his annual report that:\n\\\"The evolution of the post-war world including the introduction of nuclear weapons, the establishment of regional military pacts, the accelerated pace of decolonization, the extraordinary advances of applied science and technology, dramatic increases in population and the emergence of a large group of independent developing nations has created a new geopolitical structure in the past 30 years. Thus the basis of power, both political and economic, in the world as a whole, has changed radically in a way which could not be foreseen at San Francisco.\\\" [AjlOOOljAdd.l, sect. /.]\n124.\tIn measured response to this development there is a need, an urgent need, that we readjust our attitudes towards one another as free, sovereign and independent States if we are fully to comprehend the magnitude of our problems and carry out a timely revision of our structures for co-operation as we seek genuine collective solutions in a continuing and unaltered commitment to the high and lofty principles enshrined in that great Charter for peace and hope of the United Nations.\n125.\tBecause political independence is meaningless without economic emancipation, the developing countries have sought to complement the East-West contacts and consultations with an authentic and realistic North-South dialog in order to make of the United Nations not only an organ for international peace and security, but also the guardian against the horrors of a peace void of hope. For we have come to realize, in today's world, that the victory of peace is truly won, in the last analysis, by a victory for international progress.\n126.\tMeanwhile, encroaching upon that path to progress is the unsettling mass of stagnant export markets and declining terms of trade. Bearing heavily upon our peoples and nations are the cumulative weights of gross undervaluation of human and natural resources down throughout the centuries, of mounting inflation and lingering recession, of excessive debt obligations, and of abysmal smallness of capital transfers to our developing economies. Most regrettably upon this our one world has been placed the burdens of egotistical concepts and inadequate institutions.\n127.\tAt the United Nations today we are being challenged anew to refine that strategy and activate that blue-print for the total liberation of mankind. Too long have our development plans been suddenly short-circuited. Too long have our economies been managed from afar. Too long has the cruelty of starvation been inflicted upon helpless peoples. Too long have the destructive forces of grinding poverty shattered for us the prospect of a future hopeful and wholesome.\n128.\tThe Liberian delegation is heartened to discern that the burden of the centuries can truly be shared in the future. It can be shared through a collective preparedness to translate the limited, yet unanimous, agreements of the seventh special session into courses of action designed to create an international economic order characterized by greater equity and justice. It can be collectively borne by more meaningful multilateral trade and capital transfer arrangements. It can be shared if determined steps are taken in today's world to bring modern technology to subsistence agriculture and urban environment. And it can be shared by a determined will of interdependent reliance or creative co-alliance among all nations creative, not in the sense of group enhancement; creative, not in the mood of growing apprehension. For the world may quite too easily pass from national awareness into a new era of regional or group provincialism. What we truly need instead are adequate mechanisms which would structure the dynamics of the global purse and institutions, so that they responsively and effectively link those who achieve with those who are deprived, across the human family.\n129.\tThus we are of the view that the future task of development can be made a lot easier if a common code of conduct were to govern the behavior of transnational corporations and if a multilateral approach were adopted to enhance agricultural production and other collective ventures for increased food supplies and worth-while development projects. We sincerely hope that we have reached the beginning of this collective approach in the decisions of the seventh special session. We believe that co-operation among third-world nations would both motivate and ensure co-operation between developed and developing nations to restructure the institutions and revise the modalities for that inevitably better world of tomorrow.\n130.\tAnd so let us with courage and resoluteness move ahead to implement the decisions at which we in solidarity arrived during the recent special session, making certain that they do not remain only a part of the massive accumulation of stored-away United Nations documents, but instead aid the growing accumulation of international goodwill, understanding and co-operation.\n131.\tMy Government stands ever ready to make its contribution towards helping to ensure that the spirit of mutual accommodation that has characterized our dialog so far will be sustained in continuing negotiations as we move towards realization of the new international economic order.\n132.\tPeace and security have always been related to the economic and social advancement of any people, whether they be assembled in a national State or form a part of the world community. And so if we speak with a degree of optimism about prospects for improving the world's economic situation we must do so not without a full appreciation of the interacting political forces of the day and time in which we live.\n133.\tThe contemporary international scene reveals that the process of detente, as recently manifested at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe held at Helsinki, happily bears out for all humanity the comforting assurance that tension among the major Powers will continue to be eased and the likelihood of nuclear confrontation will be considerably lessened. Consistent with this development, we consider the two proposals made by the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, this morning before this Assembly [2357th meeting], which have just been referred to by Mr. Callaghan, the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, one banning the further development and manufacture of new types and systems of armaments of mass destruction and the second concerning the cessation of nuclear and thermonuclear tests and conclusion of a treaty designed to achieve a comprehensive test ban, as both most constructive and timely, warranting the support of all States Members of this Organization and, indeed, of peace-loving peoples the world over. The spirit of those proposals would appear to be compatible with the United States views on disarmament and nuclear proliferation as expressed by Mr. Kissinger, United States Secretary of State, when he addressed this Assembly yesterday [.2355th meeting].\n134.\tWhile we welcome all genuine efforts to promote international entente, we believe that there should be an extension of this process to other troubled centres of our one world. For while the origin of the last global conflict was in Europe and there lingers on a preoccupation with European or Western security, there is the very real possibility that in view of the proliferation of nuclear and conventional weapons and the continuing and festering tensions, notably in the Middle East and southern Africa, a conflict of global proportions could easily begin in these and other areas if selective detente does not yield to a veritable global relaxation of tension.\n135.\tLiberia welcomes the significant and positive changes that have taken place since the last session and has been heartened by the humane responsiveness to the challenges of constructive change in our world society reflective of the realities of shifting power relationships. The President of Liberia, Mr. William 128\nR. Tolbert Jr., echoed this encouraging development when he recently declared that:\n\\\"In this imbalanced world, a new socio-political force is constantly and progressively gaining ground at every turn. Whether it is Cambodia in the Far East, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe in Africa, Cuba in the Americas or Portugal in Europe, there is emerging a trend which augurs well for world peace and may God grant that this be brought about at no distant time.\\\"\n136.\tInitiatives to move from a \\\"no war, no peace\\\" situation in the Middle East fall naturally into this catalogue of welcome developments. As we have indicated in the past, we repeat today that Liberia can only support a policy in that troubled region designed to bring lasting, not ephemeral, peace, ensuring for all of the peoples of the area, including both the Palestinians and the Israelis, their right to justice, security and a national State.\n137.\tExclusive reliance on force of arms and posture of intransigence in negotiation cannot be the way to achieve this objective. Since 1948 we have all seen the tragic demonstration of the failure of this approach. Instead, no effort must be spared to replace reliance on force by genuine negotiation with a view to replacing the climate of fear, mistrust and hatred by tolerance, understanding and co-operation.\n138.\tTo state it succinctly, Liberia supports the view that two essential conditions for a lasting and durable peace in the Middle East are Israeli withdrawal from all territories acquired since June 1967 and the exercise by the Palestinian people of all their national rights.\n139.\tConsistent with our overriding interest in peace in this region, we applaud the untiring efforts of all the parties and those who have contributed to the recent Sinai interim agreement. While, understandably, the agreement so painfully achieved is indeed very limited when set alongside the monumental problems of Palestinian rights, illegal territorial occupation and Israeli security, we believe that it embodies the potential for effectively forging ahead to immediate and broader diplomatic initiatives in the interest of a just, lasting and enduring peace.\n140.\tBut as we celebrate these happy, even if limited, achievements and look with eager anticipation to other victories of human liberty and fulfillment, we are still faced with forces bent on subverting international goodwill and endangering world peace and security. Such is the case with southern Africa and other pockets of colonialism and oppression. Let me share with you some thoughts of my President, Mr. Tolbert, on the problem of southern Africa:\n\\\"... We have drawn a line between the present situation as it exists and the future conditions that will prevail there. The difference is that while the existing state of affairs can and will be changed, racial equality, social justice and African majority rule are inevitable for the future in southern Africa as elsewhere on the continent.\\\"\nThe President went on to say:\n\\\"Whether we communicate directly with the South African Government in an effort to occasion an immediate peaceful change; or whether we consistently and unrelentingly give moral and material assistance to African liberation movements, or whether we join in concerted action at the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, we remain adamant in our determination to work positively for the total and absolute liberation of the whole of Africa.\\\"\n141.\tWith respect to Namibia, Liberia has always maintained and continues to stand resolute on its contention that the people of that international Territory must, without compromise, attain their inalienable rights to self-determination, independence and territorial integrity. As I had cause to indicate before the Security Council in early June, when the question of Namibia was being debated, my Government continues to hold the view that there must be democratic elections in Namibia under the auspices of the United Nations with little delay, and the world community must with greater effectiveness concertedly exert efforts to ensure that the Government of South Africa withdraws from Namibia, granting unto the people of that Territory their legitimate right independently to determine their own future,\n142.\tA constitutional settlement in Zimbabwe continues to remain illusory, primarily because the norms of injustice and oppression in that Territory have not yet ceded place to civility and reason. Based on the Dares Salaam Declaration on Southern Africa, Liberia's policy is highly supportive of negotiations with no compromise whatsoever on the principle of majority rule. In order that the negotiations result in meaningful agreement, all leaders of the African National Congress, the legitimate representatives of the great Zimbabwean people, must take part free from any molestation.\n143.\tWe applaud the laudable contributions already made by Zambian President, Mr. Kenneth Kaunda, and other African leaders in helping to pave the way towards a negotiated settlement. We want to entertain the hope that the rebel leader Ian Smith will before long recognize that the solution to the problem of Zimbabwe can be none other than an acceptance of the principle of majority rule and the establishment of a truly multiracial society.\n144.\tLiberia will continue to struggle until the inhuman system of apartheid in South Africa is completely relegated to the past, the dustbin of history, where it rightfully belongs. For Liberia, bantustans are no homelands for Africans; their homeland can consist of nothing less than free and equitable access to the entire territory of South Africa determined on the basis of democratic principles in an atmosphere where the master-servant attitude of yesteryear is completely destroyed and replaced by a more sane attitude of tolerance and respect for fundamental human rights.\n145.\tWhile Liberia has welcomed the rather halting efforts at negotiation and conciliation in certain parts of the region of southern Africa, we wish to make it unmistakably clear that we do not believe that the African majorities of this area will at any time be lulled into a situation of interminable negotiations. Their objectives of self-determination and independence with the destruction of all systems of racism and oppression remain firm as they retain the option\nOf resorting to the armed struggle to restore their inalienable and imprescriptable rights.\n146.\tLiberia continues to give a literal interpretation to General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) which makes all dependent Territories authentic candidates for independence. As we welcome the State of Papua New Guinea into the society of free nations, we appeal especially to States Members of this Organization which still fall into the categories of colonial Powers or Administering Authorities in this most enlightened age of human civilization to hasten the process of their withdrawal so that the blessings of freedom may at last come to the entire family of man.\n147.\tAt the onset of this intervention, I spoke of certain attitudinal and structural ills which plague our world community and which demand a sense of urgency if we were truly to overcome the crises of our time. Observations were made of the radical changes in the basis of power since the creation of the United Nations which led to the diffusion of political power in the decades of the 1950s and the 1960s, and are now being, we hope, accompanied by a diffusion of economic power. These developments leave international relations unsettled, but we are not thereby faced with difficulties devoid of opportunities.\n148.\tThus, in the midst of our political and economic crises, we are being challenged, all of us challenged, to renew our commitments to those immutable and timeless principles of the Charter of the United Nations. This challenge does not alone require working for active peace and security, but also avoidance of the prospects of a peace that knows no hope; this challenge does not only demand seriously working towards narrowing the gap between the endowed and the deprived, so that we do not solely succeed in avoiding a global holocaust as indeed we have since 1945 but also that we, with that rare combination of realism and justice, may move towards the elimination of the hotbeds of tension in the Middle East, in southern Africa, in Cyprus, in the Korean peninsula and in other parts of our one world.\n149.\tDuring this thirtieth anniversary of the founding of this great Organization, we, the peoples of the United Nations, are called upon to do no less if we must continue to consider ourselves as rational beings capable of managing our affairs and regulating our destiny, rather than leaving all either in dangerous, short-sighted and superstitious resignation to chance or to an unrepresentative consensus, whatever its source.\n150.\tWe therefore appeal to all the politically powerful, both old and new, as well as the politically weak; the economically privileged, both old and new, as well as the economically disadvantaged to spare no effort in enhancing and strengthening the growing disposition at conciliation, consultation and collaboration, and to work actively for the early birth of a genuine world community in which we can all practice tolerance and live co-operatively together in peace with one another as good neighbors. Because our fate on this planet is intertwined and interlinked in an infinite number of ways, we have no viable alternative to this course of action.\n151.\tIn like words as those just spoken by Mr. Callaghan, I, too, feel confident that mankind will rise to this challenge.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t Thirty years ago, when the Second World War, the most devastating and bloody war in the history of mankind, came to an end, the United Nations was created.\n2.\tThe further the years recede into the past, the more vividly human memory grasps the grandeur of the victory over fascism, which immensely influenced the entire ensuing international development, the entire shape of the present-day world. The alliance of peoples worked out in the struggle against fascism convincingly demonstrated the possibility not only of coexistence but also of co-operation among States with different social systems in the interest of strengthening peace and international security. This experience acquires special significance in our own time, when a historical turn is taking place from the period of the \\\"cold war\\\" towards the relaxation of tensions and to ever more stable peaceful coexistence.\n3.\tChanges in the balance of forces in the world arena have led to important shifts in favor of peace and have in many ways determined the development of mankind on the path of progress. Possibilities for reactionary imperialist circles to carry on their aggressive policy with impunity have been significantly reduced. It has become possible to prevent a world war because peoples and the Governments expressing their will fight actively for peace.\n4.\tIn recent years the political atmosphere has improved considerably. Detente is ever more notice-'\nbeyond the confines of the European continent. Even now they are exerting a positive influence on the entire international situation, and the fundamental principles of the Final Act can also be successfully applied to other continents.\n10.\tIt has already been justly said here that the main task now is to translate into deeds the understandings reached and to make further progress towards the consolidation of peace and co-operation.\n11.\tOf great importance in the strengthening of peace and in the improvement of the international atmosphere was the ending of the war in Indo-China, whose peoples defended their sovereignty and national independence in a long, difficult struggle against the forces of aggression and colonialism.\n12.\tWith a profound sense of fraternal solidarity we warmly welcome on behalf of the Ukrainian people the representatives of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam the entire heroic Vietnamese people and we express our deep regret over the fact that the position of the United States has thus far prevented both Vietnamese States from being admitted to the United Nations. The Ukrainian SSR most emphatically supports the applications of the Governments of both Vietnamese States for admission to the United Nations. Their admission to this world Organization would serve its interests and would make an important contribution to the cause of deepening detente, strengthening inter-national peace and security and broadening cooperation among peoples.\n13.\tWhile taking note of the substantive positive changes that have occurred in the international situation, one should not forget that the stockpiling and modernization of both conventional and strategic weapons goes on unabated in the world. The destructive capability of the latter long ago surpassed all the limits of reality. To deprive a potential adversary of his life more than once is senseless, yet the arms race, spurred on by those who profit from the manufacture of weapons, continues.\n14.\tThe arms race not only hinders peaceful development; it poisons the international atmosphere. It is the arms race which now constitutes the main danger to the cause of international peace and security.\n15.\tThe various \\\"theories\\\" about the \\\"acceptability\\\" of nuclear conflicts, of \\\"nuclear deterrents\\\", of \\\"nuclear first-strike capability\\\" etc., have a direct relation to the arms race and the growing military expenditures. The inhuman thesis to the effect that \\\"nuclear war is not so bad\\\", that each generation allegedly should have \\\"its own war\\\", has also been circulated, and recently even from this rostrum the representative of one country, in his wishful thinking, gloomily asserted that a nuclear war is just around the corner. All this is nothing more than inculcating the idea of the un-avoidability of wars, both nuclear and non-nuclear.\n16.\tIt is regrettable that a State Member of the United Nations, and furthermore a permanent member of the Security Council, should use the lofty rostrum of the United Nations for the irresponsible dissemination of ideas which are in flagrant contradiction to the generally recognized purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Instead of making his contribution to the common cause of the struggle for the strengthening of international peace and security, the representative of that Power strives to increase tension and to sow animosity and hatred among States. In fact, he virtually instigates new military conflicts.\n17.\tIf one discards the verbal chaff from the statement of the representative of China, it can easily be seen that he comes out against peaceful coexistence, the relaxation of tension, disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons for all time. In other words, the Maoists are against the consolidation of international peace and security; they are against the achievement of the main objective of the United Nations, which is \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\". Their vicious anti-Sovietism, although disguised, in several cases, in pseudo-revolutionary phraseology, only emphasizes the proximity of their positions to those of the most reactionary imperialist and revenge-seeking circles and their collusion with those circles.\n18.\tThe new-born apologists of war, the enemies of detente, fiercely resist the positive processes now taking place in international relations. It is our universal duty to isolate these enemies of peace rather than to allow them to return mankind to the dangerous times of the \\\"cold war\\\".\n19.\tIndeed, while, thanks to the efforts of peace- loving countries primarily those of the socialist community it has been possible to avert a world nuclear war, so-called local wars using conventional weapons have repeatedly broken out in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Millions of human beings have perished in these wars which have been unleashed as a result of the unwillingness of reactionary forces to reconcile themselves to the liberation of peoples. To prevent imperialists from unleashing wars and military conflicts is the most important task confronting the United Nations and all of peace-loving mankind. If that task is fulfilled, the elimination of wars from the life of society will become a complete reality.\n20.\tThe primary requirement of our time indeed the imperative need of our time is to seek a reduction and then the cessation of the arms race, in order to advance along the road to general and complete disarmament.\n21.\tAs a result of the efforts of many States, important agreements have recently been achieved which have led to a considerable reduction in nuclear tests, to the prohibition of the proliferation of nuclear weap-ons, to the ban on the placement of those weapons in outer space, on the sea-bed or the ocean floor, and \u2022 to the prohibition of the development, manufacture or stockpiling of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons.\n22.\tAs at the beginning of the \\\"nuclear era\\\" three or four decades ago, mankind is now on the threshold of new, even greater scientific achievements, the results of which can also be used for military purposes. What happened to discoveries in the nuclear field may happen again to possible discoveries in other fields of scientific and technological progress if measures to prevent this are not taken now. As Leonid 1. Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, stressed:\n\\\"The level of present-day science and technology is such that there arises a serious danger of the development of still more frightful weapons than nuclear arms. Human reason and conscience dictate the need for erecting an insurmountable barrier to the development of such weapons.\\\"\nThat is precisely why we welcome and fully support the new significant initiative of the Soviet Government regarding the conclusion of an agreement on the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and of new systems based on such weapons.\n23.\tEach year, the persistent voice of the over-whelming majority of States is heard from this rostrum calling for and demanding the immediate cessation of nuclear testing. Another proposal of the Soviet Union submitted at the current session also fully corresponds to these appeals: the proposal for the conclusion of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear tests [see A/10241, annex]. It appears to us that attitudes towards this proposal will serve as a reliable criterion in determining who genuinely supports real measures to curb the arms race and who opposes them. We are convinced that the adoption of the proposals of the Soviet Union will bring mankind considerably closer to the solution of the most important question of our day: the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons and then their removal from the arsenals of all States.\n24.\tIt is more than high time that the comprehensive prohibition of chemical weapons one of the various types of weapons of mass destruction should be taken as a measure of practical disarmament. The United Nations must once again come out in favor of solving the problem of the prohibition of chemical weapons in the nearest future.\n25.\tTaking into account the scope of the arms race and the importance for the present and the future of mankind of curbing this dangerous process, it is necessary for the energetic efforts of the countries of the socialist community aimed at the solution of the disarmament problem to be adequately supported by the efforts of all States Members of the United Nations. Abundant opportunities for this will be provided by a world disarmament conference. However, the preparatory work for the conference should be stepped up since, owing to the resistance of one or two coun-tries, this work has been proceeding at a slow pace.\n26.\tThe implementation of the decisions of the Gen-eral Assembly relating to the non-use of force, the prohibition for all time of the use of nuclear weapons and the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council still retains all its importance.\n27.\tAfter the elimination of the hotbed of military conflict in Indo-China, the Middle East remains the most explosive area. The United Nations has repeat-edly examined the situation in that area and today everybody, or perhaps almost everybody, agrees that to achieve a final settlement of this problem it is necessary to liberate all Arab lands seized by Israel in 1967, to secure the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including their right to the establishment of their own State, and to guarantee the rights of all countries of the Middle East to independent existence and development.\n28.\tThe Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East is the proper body for a comprehensive examination of the ways to settle this problem. What is hindering that settlement? First of all, it is the aggressive policy of Israel, supported by its patrons, which cherish the quite groundless hope that the problem of the Middle East can be settled at the expense of the legitimate rights and interests of the Arab peoples. This explains the delaying tactics in the resumption of the work of the Geneva Peace Conference and the desire to postpone to the Greek Calends a comprehensive settlement and to replace it by so-called partial measures.\n29.\tThe speediest possible resumption of the work of the Geneva Peace Conference certainly a conference which should be seriously prepared and in which the representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization [.PLO] should participate is the surest way to a settlement. That Conference, I would note in passing, could not only examine this problem in its entirety, but could also take decisions on partial measures which, of course, should be implemented in conjunction with the general settlement and within its framework. In this way, and only in this way, can the establishment of a durable peace in the Middle East be promoted.\n30.\tIt is necessary to eliminate the dangerous hotbed of tension in Cyprus. The successful completion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, to whose documents the signatures of Cyprus and other countries whose interests are directly affected by the developments in Cyprus are affixed, provides a favorable political climate for the peaceful solution of the Cyprus problem. It is essential that there be full compliance with the relevant United Nations resolutions on Cyprus, which guarantee its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.\n31.\tTension still prevails on the Korean peninsula. The cessation of interference by imperialist forces in the internal affairs of Korea, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territory of South Korea and the prompt conversion of the armistice into a lasting peace are the key to the solution of the question of the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. It is exactly to this end that the draft resolution one of the sponsors of which is the Ukrainian SSR on the creation of favorable conditions for converting the armistice to a durable peace in Korea and accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea [A/10191 and Add.1-3, annex] is aimed.\n32.\tDuring the years of political independence the developing countries have scored certain successes in their economic development. However, their economic situation remains difficult. That is due to a considerable degree to their unequal and dependent position in the world capitalist economy. It is precisely the developing countries which are most sensitive to the consequences of the profound crises in the capitalist economy. That is why the question of the developing countries gaining full economic independence and equality in international economic relations is so urgent.\n33.\tThe recent seventh special session of the General Assembly on the question of development and international economic co-operation was a new step along the road to the achievement of those aims. The Ukrainian SSR, like the other socialist countries, fully endorsed the progressive decisions taken at that session directed at the elimination of unequal treatment for the developing countries in the world capitalist economy. It is important to note that the decisions of the seventh special session emphasized the significance of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)]. As is known, as a result of the will of the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations, important political provisions are set out in these documents, emphasizing the close relationship between the problems of strengthening peace, international security, disarmament, and social and economic development. It is difficult to hope, without securing the necessary political conditions, that a successful solution of the important economic problems facing all countries in the world, including the developing countries, can be achieved.\n34.\tToday, as 30 years ago, the main task of the United Nations consists in safeguarding a durable peace and consolidating international security. The road towards a durable peace and the progress of mankind can be sought through detente and disarmament, which provide the necessary conditions for the solution of the problems of development. The consolidation of peace on earth will create favorable opportunities for bringing about economic and social progress for all peoples.\n35.\tIn 1975 approximately 30 million people still remain under the yoke of colonial and racist regimes. This means that the resolute struggle for the complete eradication of colonialism and apartheid from our planet must be carried through to its conclusion. Now that we have witnessed the collapse of the Portuguese colonial empire, the United Nations must ensure the adoption of measures for granting independence without delay to the peoples of all the remaining colonial territories. That would be a worthy crowning of United Nations endeavors which began 15 years ago with the adoption, on the initiative of the Soviet Union, of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)].\n36.\tIt is known that the United Nations has pro-claimed this year as International Women's Year. In our opinion, the United Nations and its organs should deal even more actively with the question of securing equality for women, who make up half of mankind, and especially with the question of guaranteeing them equal political and economic rights with men and promoting their wider participation in the struggle for peace, international co-operation and progressive economic development. This was also confirmed by the World Conference of the International Women's Year, held in Mexico under the auspices of the United Nations.\n37. Our delegation considers it necessary to stress that one of the most important human rights is the right of every person to live in peace and security.\n38.\tBesides this, the most urgent question for the working people of a great many countries is the effective guaranteeing of the right to work, to education and to medical care and other social and economic rights. Indeed, it is a fact that the continuing crisis shaking the capitalist economy results in growing unemployment on a massive scale in some countries constant price increases, increasingly meager opportunities for education and inadequate medical care due to sinking living standards. Hushing up or ignoring the importance of human rights in these fields, which are of vital importance to millions of people, may create a somewhat distorted picture of the state of affairs with regard to the safeguarding of human rights in the contemporary world.\n39.\tWe believe that the safeguarding of human rights means, first of all, a resolute struggle against racism, fascism, and similar ideologies and practices inspired by the hatred of one's fellow men. And the United Nations, which is called upon \\\"to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person\\\", cannot pass over the flagrant violations of human rights being committed by the fascist junta in Chile. We voice our solidarity with the Chilean people in their struggle for the restoration of democratic rights and freedoms, and demand the immediate release of Luis Corvalan and other democrats languishing in the prisons of the junta.\n40.\tThe United Nations faces major and responsible tasks, and today as never before it has real opportunities to solve the problems on its agenda on condition, of course, that its Charter, the corner-stone of the United Nations, remains inviolable. The United Nations has lived through the years and has been strengthened thanks to the fact that as an international organization it favors the consolidation of peace and international security.\n41.\tThe thirtieth session of the General Assembly will come to an end, and the last quarter of the twentieth century will commence. May the resolutions which the General Assembly will adopt at its current session contribute to the solution of the problems facing the international community in a period when the restructuring of relations among States on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for the rights of all peoples to free and independent development is under way.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1. It is for me a great privilege to represent Laos at the thirtieth session of the General Assembly, a country which is undergoing a profound historic evolution towards genuine peace, independence, democracy, neutrality and prosperity, and to speak from this rostrum for the entire Laotian people.\n2.\tI should like to convey my most cordial greetings to Mr. Gaston Thorn on his election as President of this thirtieth session of the General Assembly. I should like warmly to congratulate Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the representative of the glorious People's Democratic Republic of Algeria and President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, who has tirelessly and effectively worked for world peace, social progress, the democratization of international relations and the cause of the third world, which includes three fourths of the States and two thirds of the population of the globe.\n3.\tI am also pleased to congratulate warmly Mr. Kurt Waldheim for his efforts to implement the ideals of the United Nations.\n4.\tThe United Nations this year has admitted to membership the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, and the People's Republic of Mozambique, which we should like to congratulate cordially. However, the delegation of Laos profoundly regrets not to be able to convey the same cordial congratulations to those delegations which, according to international law, are entitled to be in our midst: the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and Republic of South Viet Nam. These delegations are unfairly kept outside by the United States which, once more abusing its veto power, has prevented their admission to the United Nations.\n5.\tWe are convinced that the vast majority of representatives here present will express their view on this action by the United States, which once more has shown its contempt for the right of peoples to self-determination and the goals of the United Nations, particularly the principle of universality.\n6.\tThe world is a \\\"planetary village\\\". Each great world event has unavoidable international repercussions in various countries. Thus, the delegation of Laos would like to sketch a few characteristics of the present world situation.\n7.\tThe inexorable decline of American imperialism is the turning-point of the present situation in a world already fraught with decisive events. It is indeed a decline, an irreversible decline, whatever may be said by American officials, a decline which cause the whole imperialist system to be mired more deeply in a new general crisis.\n8.\tThis decline, however, is not without its dangerous convulsions or its perfidious attempts to adapt to new world realities.\n9.\tAs we witness imperialism sink into decadence, we see the socialist countries flourishing through vast and stable economic development, a constant improvement in the standard of living of their populations and an increasing support for the national liberation movements and peoples struggling for their independence, peace, democracy and social progress in the world. Despite the difficulties which socialist States have to resolve by the suffering they have undergone and have overcome, they are sharing the force and the vitality of socialism.\n10.\tThe third world continues to be the relentless battlefield of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America, who are politically aware and united throughout the world, resolutely joining in a common front against imperialism and neo-colonialism for their liberation, for their national independence, for sovereignty over their economy, for the realization of democracy and for social progress.\n11.\tNational liberation movements have increased in number and have obtained or are obtaining many great victories. In this connexion we welcome the internationally significant historic victories of the Vietnamese and Khmer peoples. These victories are also the victories of the Lao people. This triple victory points to a striking truth: today a small, sparsely populated country, determined in its struggle to win, united on a just political path and firmly supported by all peace- and justice-loving peoples, is in a position to vanquish aggression by any kind of imperialism, however powerful, including the leader of imperialism  American imperialism. This solidarity makes the victories of the three peoples of Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos also the victory of the forces of the world struggling for independence, peace and social progress.\n12.\tThe victories of the peoples of Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos, and the success of their national liberation movements, opens up a new era, an era of destruction of colonialism, neo-colonialism and an era where peoples are the masters of their own destinies.\n13.\tThis era, when peoples are becoming masters of their own destinies, is also noticeable in Western capitalist countries. Equally obvious is the struggle of the workers and democratic forces against capitalism particularly in Portugal a struggle which is expanding and finding deeper roots in a manner hitherto unheard of. This struggle is so powerful that it can strike successful blows against imperialism.\n14.\tIn the present international situation, when socialist States have obtained striking successes, the world of the courageous and victorious struggle for national independence and freedom, the relentless movement of workers in the capitalist countries have forced imperialism to give way. Extremely important changes are taking place. These are favorable to peoples all over the world who are fighting for peace, national independence and social progress. Imperialism and neo-colonialism, obstinate by their very nature, have not renounced their goal of aggression, domination and exploitation. The peoples of the world are watchful in order to unmask the evil plots of imperialism.\n15.\tThe Lao people are proud to have contributed to this new world, through 30 years of long and hard struggle. To recover their fundamental national rights and to establish a veritable peace, they had, within a single generation, to defeat the old French colonialism and conquer American neo-colonialism. That great and heroic victory of the Lao people led to the Vientiane Agreement of 1973, which stipulates respect for the national fundamental rights of Laos, the withdrawal of American military personnel and the cessation of foreign interference in the internal affairs of Laos.\n16.\tTo establish their national independence and democracy, to implement the Vientiane Agreement, the peoples continue their mass political struggle which will end in victory, signifying a radical change in the situation of the country. The instruments of war and exploitation of neo-colonialism have been dismantled. The rightist reactionaries, the lackeys of imperialism, have fled abroad; a popular revolutionary administration prevails throughout the country. At last the patriotic peace-loving forces and supporters of national concord, along with the Lao people, have become masters of their country's destiny. The unification of Laos is coming true, which is the first and necessary stage in the construction of an independent, peaceful, democratic, neutral, unified and prosperous Laos.\n17.\tThis victory over American interference in Laos opens a new era of independence, democracy and prosperity for the Lao people, and is a victory heretofore unknown in the annals of the struggle of the Lao people against foreign aggression. This victory is an active contribution to the struggle for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress in South-East Asia and in the entire world.\n18.\tHowever, this victory of the Lao people is inseparable from the militant efforts, in all areas, made by all peoples of the world working for peace,\nindependence, democracy and social progress. May we then, from this rostrum, on behalf of the Lao people, voice our deep gratitude to those peoples who, we are certain, after having given their invaluable support and generous aid to the Lao people in their patriotic war, will continue to accord them the same assistance and support in their efforts for the strengthening of peace and for national reconstruction.\n19.\tThe foreign policy of Laos, within the present world situation and the internal situation in Laos, is based on a watchful awareness and safeguarding of its hard-won independence; it represents a tireless effort in the cause of peace and a constant search for neutrality and for the building of a prosperous economy.\n20.\tThe scrupulous protection of the fundamental rights of each people seems to us an appropriate means to establish peace among nations. This is implemented, on the one hand, by a struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism and, on the other hand, by active support for the national liberation struggle; for peace; for the social progress of all peoples of the world through the establishment and development of friendly relations with all countries, regardless of their political system, on the basis of mutual respect; and for independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, excluding any foreign interference in internal affairs, and based on equality and mutual advantage in trade relations and economic cooperator.\n21.\tThis is also particularly true of our relations with our sister countries of Viet Nam and Cambodia, with which we are always united in the struggle against the common enemy. Laos will continue to increase its solidarity and constantly develop co-operation with Viet Nam and Cambodia, and assist them in the protection of their national independence and in the building of each of those countries according to their specific capacities and needs. Thus we warmly support the candidacies of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam, and we will work for their admission to the United Nations until our efforts are successful.\n22.\tWe are pleased to lend our active support to the legitimate efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to secure the withdrawal of all foreign troops  American troops in particular from South Korea. The Lao people whole-heartedly approve of the struggle of the Korean people to secure the peaceful reunification of their country and to become masters of their own destiny.\n23.\tSimilarly, Laos will also broaden friendly relations and step up co-operation with the socialist countries, which provide a solid and firm support to the national liberation movements and to peoples struggling for their national independence. Our relations with the peoples of South-East Asia, and particularly with our neighbors, will also be intensified. Laos fully supports the present struggle of the peoples of that region against United States imperialism in an effort to put an end to its policy of intervention and aggression, to dismantle its military bases and to bring about the withdrawal of all its military personnel.\n24.\tAs for the Governments of the South-East Asian countries, Laos is ready to establish with them normal relations based on the strict respect for the\nfive principles of peaceful coexistence. It is through the strict application of those principles that we have defined relations between Laos and Thailand. Now, inasmuch as former Thai Governments were notorious accomplices of the United States in its aggression against Laos, they should bear the heavy burden of responsibility emerging therefrom. At present, in view of the new situation, and in the interest of the peoples of both countries and of peace in the region, Laos is ready to improve its good-neighborly relations with Thailand, But it is essential that the Thai Government put an end to its interference in the internal affairs of Laos, that it stop entertaining on Thai territory reactionaries from the Lao extreme right, and that it reject the use of Thai territory by United States imperialism for aggression against Laos and other countries in the region.\n25.\tLaos fully espouses the cause of the non-aligned countries and will bend every effort to step up its militant solidarity with them in the courageous battle against colonialism and neo-colonialism and in the bitter struggle to conquer and defend their national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and their natural resources. Laos reaffirms its full and firm support for the resolutions contained in the Lima program for Mutual Assistance and Solidarity [see A/10217 and Corr.l, annex], and we are pleased to note that the vast family of non-aligned countries has again shown its great solidarity in the work of the seventh special session of the General Assembly on development and international economic cooperation.\n26.\tThose countries, we are convinced, will manifest the same solidarity on the Middle East question. The Palestinian people, a people that has been forced out of its national homeland, are struggling tirelessly to recover their fundamental national rights. Laos would request the General Assembly to make every effort to ensure the implementation of United Nations resolutions by the State of Israel, which is an aggressor against the Arab peoples. Laos will continue to lend unstinting support to the Palestinian and other Arab peoples in their struggle against the Israeli invaders supported by the American imperialists.\n27.\tSimilarly, it will maintain its vigorous support of the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe and other countries of southern Africa struggling for their self-determination. Laos severely and categorically condemns, in all its forms and manifestations, the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination pursued by the Pretoria regime. We also reject with equal vigor the illegal regime of Ian Smith, which, defying international public opinion, makes a mockery of the rights and aspirations of the majority of the Rhodesian people.\n28.\tLaos is ready to establish and develop friendly relations with all Western countries without exception, as long as they respect our fundamental national rights and sincerely wish to help us develop our economy, preserve our independence, and allow us to determine our own destiny. As for the United States, it must bear responsibility for the war of aggression that it conducted for long years in Laos. However since we wish to live in peace and harmony with all nations, the Lao Government envisages establishing friendly relations with the United States on a new basis.\n29.\tThe Government of the United States should act on its statement that it wants to participate in the healing of the wounds of war. It should renounce its policy of interference in the internal affairs of Laos. Laos would like to avail itself of this opportunity to send its sincere greetings to the progressive people of the United States, who supported the people of Laos in their long and heroic struggle.\n30.\tLaos is on the road towards a new chapter in its history, towards the consolidation of its independence, towards realizing the deep-seated aspirations of national liberation of its people and the building up of its national economy.\n31.\tThanks to the historic victory of the Lao people and strengthened by the impartial assistance and the devoted support of the socialist countries, the non-aligned countries and other peoples of the world, Laos is convinced of its ability fully to achieve the goals it has set. It will not fail to make its contribution to the cause of peace and independence of all the peoples of the world.\n32.\tWe express our best wishes for the success of the work of this session of the General Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In the year that has elapsed since the last regular session he has continued his complex activities to ensure that our Organization was really able to play the role assigned to it by the States in solving international problems. His initiatives and the action he has undertaken fully justify the esteem and confidence which we have placed in him in electing him to this high position.\n4.\tThis session of the General Assembly is being held three decades after the flames of the Second World War, in which the United Nations was forged, were extinguished. During that time the world has witnessed many alterations and profound revolutionary changes both socially and nationally. Instead of stagnating after 1945, international life underwent a tumultuous development because of the will of the peoples of the entire world, freed from the dark shadows of fascism, to forge for themselves a dignified, free 'ind prosperous life.\n5.\tThe triumph of revolutionary struggle in the post-war period and the beginning of the building of socialism in a series of countries in Europe, Asia, and America have transformed socialism into a major world economic and political force. In our times the socialist countries exercise increasing influence on contemporary social development and on the course of international life as a whole. New States choose to take the course of socialist development.\n6.\tDozens of States have acceded to independence and, after being liberated from foreign domination, are now resolutely committed to the struggle to ensure their economic, social and national development, free from dependence of any kind. Only a few days ago our Organization welcomed to its ranks three new States, namely, the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. I take this opportunity, on behalf of the Romanian Government and people, of extending to the Governments and peoples of those countries a warm welcome to the United Nations, and expressing our desire to develop the best possible relations of friendship and co-operation with them.\n7.\tParallel to those revolutionary processes which I mentioned earlier, the world is at present witnessing one of the most profound scientific and technological revolutions in its history. Science, technology and culture are developing at high speed. Man is penetrating ever more deeply into the secrets of nature and is mastering them.\n8.\tAll these phenomena have not failed to exercise a powerful influence on international life. A qualitatively new element is that the relations of subordination have become obsolete. Peoples are determined to become the masters of their destiny and their national wealth and to put an end to the old policy of inequality, domination and diktat and to develop in an atmosphere of peace, security and co-operation. The events of the last year have clearly shown that this is so.\n9.\tThe historic victories won by the peoples of Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos against foreign intervention once again confirm a historic truth. They bear witness to the fact that, when a people is determined to defend its independence and its sovereignty, its dignity and its national entity at the cost of the greatest sacrifices, there is no force in the world which can bar the road to total victory for their just cause.\n10.\tPolitical reassessments, the process of disintegration of military pacts and groups in South-East Asia are affirmations of the tendency of peoples to act independently on the international scene, drawing their inspiration from their fundamental interests and freeing themselves from foreign trusteeships.\u2003\n11.\tIn Europe, the friendly Portuguese people have done away with Fascist dictatorship and have embarked upon the path of democratic development of their country. This has at the same time created better conditions for the peoples in African territories under Portuguese domination to accede to independence.\n12.\tOn the Latin American continent changes have occurred, the expression of which on the external level consists in the increasingly more obvious option of many countries to promote new relationships based on the right of each people freely to establish its domestic and foreign policy, to be the only master of its national wealth and to use it for the benefit of its own development. That option has also been expressed in the rejection of the old policy of discrimination against socialist Cuba. That is a new recognition of the fact that ultimately nothing and no one can prevent a people from choosing the system most suitable to it and following the course of social and political development which it considers best designed to serve its aspirations and interests.\n13.\tWherever we cast our glance on the map of the world, we see that by their struggle peoples are bringing about the collapse of the imperialist policy of force and diktat. On every continent, social forces of unprecedented power rise to establish new democratic and equitable relations in international life.\n14.\tThe small and medium-sized States, the developing countries and the non-aligned countries at present play an increasingly important role in the revolutionary transformation of the world and in the struggle for progress. Those countries are determined to contribute to building a better and more just world because they themselves have been compelled to wage long and hard struggles to become masters of their own destiny. Historic realities have led those countries to be attached to the new policy of independence and equality and to oppose the policy and practices of imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism, so as to establish new relations among States and a new political and economic order which will ensure the free development of each nation.\n15.\tThe Romanian people entertain feelings of under-standing and affinity for, and shows active solidarity with, the endeavors of the States that have embarked upon the path of independent development. This attitude is also based on the fact that socialist Romania, itself a developing country, must solve many of the problems with which above-mentioned countries are also faced.\n16.\tThat explains Romania's presence at the Lima Conference of Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries. In our opinion, the participation of a country in the meetings of the non-aligned countries must not be considered from the point of view of its belonging to military and political groups, but in the light of its foreign policy, its contribution to * rapprochement among nations and to the strengthening of a positive process of international understanding and detente.\n17.\tThat also explains why Romania is actively involved in the activities of the group of developing countries, the Group of 77, including the recent seventh special session of the General Assembly devoted to problems of development and international economic co-operation. For our part, we consider that the results of the session were positive and have in a certain sense marked a new milestone, because we have gone from the stage of confrontation and opposi-tion between industrially developed and developing States to the stage of starting a dialog. It is important that the progress made should yield results and be continued through implementation of the measures provided for in the resolution adopted by consensus. New measures should be added to secure the liquidation of the present situation in which a great part of mankind does not enjoy even the most elementary living standards.\n18.\tRomania stands resolutely in favor of establishing a new international economic order that will lead to the eradication of under-development and to a relative balance in the level of development of all nations, opening the way for the well-being and happiness of all peoples of the world. As we see it, detente cannot coexist with under-development. One cannot speak of genuine detente and peace as long as the world remains divided into the rich and the poor. We feel that detente, international peace and security are indissolubly linked to the establishment of a new economic order and to the development of all nations.\n19.\tAs the President of the Republic of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu emphasized:\n\\\"Romania, which is engaged in a vast social work in developing the forces of production and the national wealth, of promoting science, art and culture and on this basis of raising the material and spiritual living standards of the whole people, is at the same time pursuing a sustained and energetic international activity for the furtherance of new democratic principles in relations among States, for the broad development of multilateral co-operation among nations and for the establishment of a new international economic and political order in the world. Our country is determined in the future further to expand co-operation with all States of the world irrespective of their social order, and to participate most actively in international life, making its contribution to the settlement, in the spirit of peace and progress, of all contemporary economic and political issues and to the consolidation and continuation of the process of detente which is taking shape today in the world\\\".\n20.\tThe great changes which have occurred in con-temporary international life, the determination of peoples to be the masters of their own destinies, made it possible for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to achieve positive results from its work. The successful conclusion of the work of the Conference of historic importance in the political life of the European continent marks a new spirit in international relations, laying the foundations for a broad and profound process of establishing security in Europe, with favorable consequences for the whole world.\n21.\tThe Socialist Republic of Romania and President Nicolae Ceaugescu himself participated actively in the convening, preparation and holding of the Conference and contributed consistently to the preparation of documents in order to ensure that they would be as clear as possible and would entail genuine commitments, to the assertion of new concepts and principles in international life, and to the promotion of democratic procedures to ensure equality among States. We are pleased that those endeavors, combined with those of other States, have proved fruitful. Thanks to careful work, conducted on new and democratic bases in a spirit of equality, receptivity and mutual esteem, it was possible to achieve generally acceptable results which were crystallized in the Final Act signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975 by the Heads of State and Government participating in the Conference.\n22.\tThat great inter-European meeting was an expression of the ardent desire of the European peoples to start a new era in the political life of the continent, establish a climate of understanding and fruitful co-operation among all nations based on equal rights, respect for national independence and sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, the sharing of benefits and the renunciation of force and the threat of force in relations among States.\n23.\tFor Romania, these principles are not abstract concepts, but the legal framework of certain practical realities. They are the only ones that can today provide the opportunity for peaceful co-operation among States. Unless they are respected it is impossible to attain a better and more just world in which every people will be able to enjoy the benefits of contemporary civilization and no one will have to live in subjection and insecurity.\n24.\tIt is now essential to implement resolutely the principles and standards contained in the Final Act. Taking into account the interests of all European peoples and the cause of peace, it is necessary that the slightest infringement of the jointly adopted principles and standards be considered as a lack of goodwill and as action which may endanger security, co-operation and peace in Europe.\n25.\tWe appreciate the agreements reached in connexion with the development of economic, scientific and technological relations, the expansion of cultural interchanges, the improvement of the dissemination of information through the press and other means, the development of human contacts and the settlement of humanitarian issues. The practical implementation of all these agreements will doubtless serve the cause of rapprochement and friendship among peoples.\n26.\tWe must not harbor the illusion that at the conclusion of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe we had completely met the wishes of the peoples and their concern for peace and security. The Helsinki stage does not represent the end of the process of establishing security in Europe. Rather, it is a premise, a starting-point for further great and sustained efforts aimed at the effective settlement of the complex problems which remain unsolved and at the creation of a united Europe, based on independent nations, animated by a spirit of peaceful cooperation and equal rights, irrespective of their social order or territorial extent.\n27.\tIn speaking of the necessity to pursue and intensify efforts aimed at building European security, we are thinking above all of the extraordinary concentration of military forces and armaments, including nuclear weapons, in Europe at the present time. There can be no real and lasting peace and security in Europe without resolute disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament. We cannot conceive of a Europe of confidence and peaceful co-operation built in the shadow of nuclear weapons. This is tantamount to saying that the political and military aspects of security are inseparable.\n28.\tFrom this point of view, the measures inscribed in the Final Act, though undoubtedly significant, are limited and insufficient. They must be accompanied by energetic disarmament measures, by determined actions by all States aimed at the liquidation of military bases, the withdrawal behind their national borders of nuclear weapons and foreign troops on the territories of other States, and the reduction of national armies, armaments and military expenditures. Increase of confidence and co-operation should lead to the liquidation of opposing military blocs, the simultaneous abolition of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty alliance, which are not and cannot be permanent but which are the product of certain historical circumstance which we wish to leave behind us.\n29.\tWe, as representatives of our Governments, have an opportunity, as regards our own peoples and the peoples of the entire world, to do our utmost to ensure conditions of real peace and progress for mankind. Neither in Europe nor in the world as a whole can we attain that objective unless we embark on a policy of effective disarmament.\n30.\tWe cannot help noticing, with great concern, that in recent years the arms race has reached unprecedented proportions. While, year by year, in the United Nations, in the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and in other international forums, disarmament is discussed, the arms race continues to increase, to swallow up vast material and human resources and to monopolize a vast potential of scientific research and production. The technological arms race is intensifying. Military expenditure has continuously increased, amounting to the exorbitant figure of some $300,000 million in 1974. Undoubtedly, the increase in armament production, the stockpiling of ever new weapons of mass destruction, the rise in military expenditures, have particularly serious consequences for the economic and social life of nations and for the peace and security of all peoples.\n31.\tIn spite of the efforts made by numerous States, Romania being one of them, the situation of the disarm-ament negotiations is still critical and their practical results are insignificant. The agreements achieved so far are of small importance, and they do not represent effective disarmament measures; they deal with peripheral problems, and not with the real priority problems on which depend the effective halting of armaments, above all nuclear weapons.\n32.\tA radical change in the approach to disarmament problems is both necessary and urgent. It is high time for us to move on from words and sterile talks to deeds, to the adoption of practical measures. To this end we consider it necessary to agree on a program of measures designed to mobilize the political will of all States in order to achieve real disarmament and to provide a forward plan and a coherent approach for negotiations and efforts in this field.\n33.\tRomania, like other countries, believes that, nuclear disarmament must be given the highest priority. On the agenda of the present session there are several proposals on adopting nuclear disarmament measures. Romania will state its views on these proposals in the course of the debate. We must say, however, that we are concerned about the weakening of interest in the outlawing of nuclear weapons. More than five years have elapsed since the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] was adopted, but one can see that, in fact, a proliferation of nuclear armaments has occurred. If we really wish to remove the danger of a thermonuclear war, we must press on resolutely and without delay to the banning of the use of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, to the cessation of nuclear weapons production, to the withdrawal of nuclear armaments from the territories of other States, and, of course, to the destruction of all nuclear arsenals. As long as such steps are not taken and there are not sufficient guarantees of security, no State can be prevented from taking the measures it considers necessary for its own defense, including the production of nuclear weapons.\n34.\tA first step in the direction of disarmament would be a pledge by the nuclear countries never, in any circumstances, to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against the States which have renounced the option of acquiring or producing such armaments.\n35.\tClosely connected with the non-utilization of nuclear weapons is the making of certain zones in different parts of the world nuclear-weapon free zones, in conjunction with the granting of appropriate safeguards by the nuclear Powers. Romania has supported all efforts for the creation of such zones or regions, including the Balkans, being convinced that such measures contribute to the lessening of the nuclear danger.\n36.\tCertainly, nuclear disarmament measures should not iimit in any way the utilization of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. On the contrary, it is necessary to ensure for all States unrestricted right and opportunities to benefit fully from nuclear science gains with a view to their peaceful development within a system which has to be set up on the basis of equality and non-discrimination.\n37.\tAs a forum of a universal character, the United Nations has special tasks and responsibilities in channelling all energies and efforts of States towards the adoption of real and effective measures of disarmament, in guiding and controlling negotiations in all disarmament forums. We believe it would be really useful to convene a special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of having a full debate on the situation of armaments and the principles governing disarmament, and to make recommendations aimed at the conclusion of specific agreements.\n38.\tThese problems are vital and burning issues. They are of equal concern to all nations, great or small. Hence international public opinion must be informed about the activities taking place in the sphere of disarmament. Disarmament directly concerns the peoples themselves, and they have the right to know what is being done in that field in order to be able to express their opinions on what measures should be taken.\n39.\tThese are the cogent reasons which have led the Government of Romania to attach increased importance to the disarmament debates of this session, and it will make its position known in due course.\n40.\tThe consolidation of a new path towards detente in international life, as a result of the people's struggle, is indissolubly linked with the extinction of the hotbeds of conflict and tension which still exist in different areas of the world, with refraining from military confrontation, and with the settlement of controversial issues by political means.\n41.\tWe are particularly worried by the continued tension in the Middle East, which is a permanent danger not only for peace in that area but also for the peace of the whole world. The Government of Romania has always been in favor of a political settlement of the situation in the Middle East, and has made consistent efforts to contribute to such a settlement.\n42.\tWe have welcomed the agreements reached in 1974 on disengagement in the Sinai on the Golan Heights. We also regard as useful the recent Egyptian- Israeli agreement on the disengagement of military forces in Sinai. We regard it as a continuation of the previous agreement which may pave the way for other steps towards the full settlement of the conflict. We feel that new and steady efforts are necessary in order to reach such a solution both in Sinai and Golan, as well as on the West Bank. We reaffirm our conviction that there will be no peace in the Middle East until Israel withdraws its troops from the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war; until the problem of the Palestinian people is solved by the restoration of their legitimate rights, including the establishment of an independent Palestinian State; and until the right of all States of the region to existence, territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence is recognized.\n43.\tIn a region close by\u2014Cyprus\u2014a situation of tension persists, which is a matter of grave concern. We are vitally interested in seeing peace established there as soon as possible by means of a negotiated solution of the dispute on the basis of respect for the integrity, sovereignty and independence of the State of Cyprus, and by ensuring peaceful co-operation between the two communities on the island.\n44.\tIn present conditions it is imperative for all States directly involved in disputes, as well as for other States and international public opinion, to redouble their efforts so that progress can be made towards negotiated settlement for the elimination of all hotbeds of tension which endanger the peace and security of peoples.\n45.\tA high degree of responsibility in this respect devolves also on the United Nations, which has to act with greater effectiveness for the promotion of co-operation and understanding among nations against any act in disregard of international law, or interference in. the affairs of other peoples, and for the liquidation of sources of dispute in international life.\n46.\tAs is known, the Romanian Government has consistently paid special attention to the activities of the United Nations and to its ability to contribute to building a just and better world. The evolution of the United Nations towards universality in the sense of the inclusion of all States an evolution we have welcomed and wish to be complete coincides with the ever-clearer awareness that the problems of the present-day world, in order to be solved in the interest of peace and co-operation, require the active participation of all States, which is yet another aspect of universality. And it is precisely the United Nations which offers the most suitable framework for this.\n47.\tAt this time I wish to reiterate the firm support of the Romanian Government for the applications for membership in the United Nations of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam. We express the hope that, in accordance with the recent resolution adopted by the General Assembly [resolution 3366 (XXX)] on the initiative of a great number of countries, including Romania, the Security Council will proceed to the immediate reconsideration in a favorable light of the requests of those two countries.\n48.\tAs emphasized by the President of the Socialist Republic of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu,\n\\\"The United Nations and other international bodies must play a greater role in the settlement of the complex problems raised by contemporary international life. Starting from the realities of the present-day world and from the shifts in the world balance of power, these bodies have to ensure broad participation by all peoples in the settlement of international problems and in the struggle for security and peace to uphold the principles of international law in relations among States.\\\"\n49.\tIn the course of its existence the United Nations has had numerous achievements and made positive contributions to the development of understanding and co-operation among States. It is through the United Nations that a strong impetus has been given to the process of codification of the rules and principles of contemporary international law, to the promotion of legality, justice and equity in relations among States. Particularly in the past few years, more frequent recourse has been had to its machinery and authority, which has had a favorable effect upon the course of some situations of tension and conflict. Under the aegis of the United Nations too, the international community has dealt with the cardinal problem of development in its various aspects and has crystallized a generally acceptable concept regarding the establishment of a new international economic order. It is through the United Nations that real support has been given to the process of liquidating colonialism, that the legitimacy of the national liberation struggle has been sanctioned, and that international recognition has been granted to the liberation movements. Yet the efforts of our Organization must not flag until colonialism and racism, which still persist in Africa, particularly in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, have been completely eradicated.\n50.\tWhile mentioning these achievements, it must also be stated that, with respect to some of the important problems and conflicts that have occurred in post-war relations, the United Nations has adopted wrong decisions which have tarnished its prestige and have had negative consequences for international life. The outcome of one such decision is included today as an item on the agenda of the General As-sembly. I am referring to the involvement of the United Nations in Korea, an anachronism of which our Organization should rid itself as soon as possible. The Romanian Government considers it the duty of the United Nations to contribute to the encouragement of the positive processes stemming from the political initiatives and steady efforts of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea. Consequently, we believe it necessary to abolish the United Nations Command without delay and to put an end to the presence, under the flag of the United Nations, of all foreign troops in South Korea, thus creating favorable conditions for turning the armistice into a lasting peace in Korea and for accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.\n51.\tIt is also fitting to mention that some provisions of the Charter and many resolutions adopted by the United Nations have remained a dead letter. In spite of the authority conferred upon it by the Charter, the United Nations has been unable to prevent conflict, bloodshed and war, and, in many cases, owing both to objective and subjective circumstances has taken no action whatsoever. With the passing of the years the working system of the United Nations has become cumbersome; the Organization has created a complicated apparatus with overlapping and parallel structures which prevent it from giving its prompt and effective consideration to the most urgent problems of the international community. All too often, the United Nations has been justly criticized for an overabundance of talk to the detriment of concentrated efforts at concrete and effective solutions.\n52.\tIt must be recognized that the United Nations has not kept pace with the profound changes in the world, does not live up to the hopes of all peoples and why not say its needs imposed by the dynamic changes in international life. The fact is that the United Nations does not yet exercise a decisive influence on international relations.\n53.\tTaking account of those facts, the changes that have taken place in the world and the complexity and interdependence of contemporary phenomena which make multilateral co-operation among States a primary prerequisite for the progress of mankind, the Romanian Government in 1972 took the initiative of proposing for inclusion in the agenda an item especially devoted to strengthening the role of the United Nations in international life. The debates on this item, as well as the resolutions adopted by consensus the result of the co-operation of a large number of States demonstrated the necessity and the possibility of transforming the United Nations into a vigorous Organization capable of supporting with all its authority the independence and sovereignty of States and the right of each people to decide its own destiny and to make a greater contribution to the consolidation of peace and security.\n54.\tWe believe that to achieve that end the Organization must act with determination to establish relations among States on new bases and, strengthened by its achievements in the process of building a new system of rules and principles to govern international relations, raise this process to a higher level. That can be done by working out a universal code of conduct covering all the fundamental rights and duties of States. Such a code of conduct, accompanied by the solemn commitment of each State fully and strictly to abide by the rules and principles embodied in it, would suitably complement the United Nations Charter and would be of inestimable importance for the cause of peace, security and international co-operation.\n55.\tIt is in the same spirit that we consider that political and organizational measures should be taken within the United Nations so that it may play an active rote and take the initiative in preventing and settling situations of conflict, resolving by peaceful means differences among States and, in general, effectively tackling, with the participation of all States, the urgent problems of under-development, the establishment of a new international economic order, disarmament and the immediate liquidation of the last remnants of colonialism and racism.\n56.\tThe strengthening of the United Nations also requires measures designed to increase the authority and competence of the General Assembly, which is its principal and most representative body, especially with respect to the problems of peace and international security, t would also be desirable to establish democratic working procedures and mechanisms to supervise more closely the implementation of the resolutions adopted, to create conditions for the broad participation on an equal footing of all Member States in all the activities of the Organization, to abolish obsolete and anachronistic provisions and to adjust the work of the Organization to the requirements of the present-day world.\n57.\tThe Romanian Government considers that the process that has been started for the improvement of the working system of the Organization and its adjustment to the requirements of the new realities of international life must be resolutely pursued by uniting all efforts to that end within the United Nations. The Romanian Government intends at this session to present its position and contribute actively to its efforts. I am empowered to state that Romania will work energetically, in close co-operation with other Member States, for the development and strengthening of the role of the United Nations in international affairs so that the activity of the Organization may become more effective and contribute more substantially to the settlement of the problems confronting all mankind.\n58.\tThirty years ago mankind, which had barely emerged from the most, deadly and both materially and spiritually destructive war in its history, fixed its hopes that there would never be another war and that peace and co-operation would be established on the United Nations.\n59.\tSo far, there has not been another world war, but the prerequisites for it have not yet been wholly eliminated. So far, the peoples have proved they can co-operate, but real and lasting co-operation has not yet been established. Mankind can and must get through this critical stage. Let us do everything to ensure that in the coming years, in the quarter-century which remains before we reach the end of the twentieth century, we may fulfil the sacred trust left us by previous generations and meet the consistent demand of present generations by bringing about the absolute necessity of the future: peace and co-operation among nations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t Mr. President, permit me to extend to you first of all the warm congratulations of the delegation of Dahomey on your election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. I should like to express to you the satisfaction felt by Dahomey at seeing you conducting our proceedings this year. Your election is a tribute to your eminence, your statesmanlike qualities and your personal merits. Your election is also a tribute to your country, Luxembourg, a small State certainly but privileged by its geographical position, and a country with which 46 African, Caribbean and Pacific States enjoy cordial relations of co-operation within the framework of the European Economic Community. My delegation is convinced that under your wise and far-sighted leadership our work is assured of success.\n2.\tMr. President, you succeed in office a worthy son of Africa, brother Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, to whom I should like to express the satisfaction and admiration of my delegation at the masterful way in which he conducted the proceedings of the twenty-ninth session, the coolness and perspicacity with which he tackled and solved some extremely delicate problems with which he was confronted and the important decisions he took, which will certainly find a place in the history of our Organization. The results of the seventh special session of our Assembly, which are a matter of continuing gratification to many people, would not have been achieved without the courage and the tireless efforts of our brother Bouteflika to prevail upon the Members of our Organization to transcend recrimination, antagonisms and sterile confrontation in order to work together within the context of the interdependence of nations to establish the new international economic order based on justice and equity so ardently desired by our whole community.\n3.\tI would also (ike to add to the compliments paid to you, Sir, and your predecessor the sincere appreciation of the delegation of Dahomey of the effective, positive and sustained work of our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in the service of the noble objectives of international peace and security, which are the very foundation of our Charter. The degree of progress achieved in the negotiations, through him, between the two Cypriot communities constitutes, in the view of my delegation, compelling proof that our Secretary-General can do even better and find for the urgent problems of the day reasonable and just solutions which are acceptable to all parties, if only he is given the confidence and disinterested cooperation of all, and particularly the great Powers.\n4.\tDahomey warmly welcomes the delegations of the fraternal countries of Sao Tome and Principe, Cape. Verde and Mozambique, which were admitted to membership by the General Assembly just a few days ago, and would like to assure the representatives of these three new States of its active solidarity and fraternal co-operation.\n5.\tAt a time when the work of the thirtieth session is beginning, it is striking that weapons are almost completely silent in most of the areas of tension which have always been the subject of the serious and constant concern of our Organization. We can take pride in this favorable augury, although the situation results not from the actions of the world community but from the political will and determination of the countries directly concerned and also, of course, the goodwill of the super-Powers.\n6.\tThus, in South-East Asia calm has been restored to the region without the United Nations having been able to contribute in any way at all. My delegation, in any case, cannot refrain from expressing its keen satisfaction at seeing today the place of Cambodia occupied by the worthy and authentic representatives of the Cambodian people. It is distressing to recall that one year ago the General Assembly, as the result of maneuvering within its ranks, refused to heed the voice of reason used by a certain number of States, including Dahomey, when they called for the expulsion from this Hall of the envoys of the Lon Nol clique and the restoration to the representatives of the Government of National Union of Cambodia of their lawful rights in the United Nations, In so doing, our Assembly missed one of the rare opportunities to solve this delicate problem by peaceful means on the basis of the principles of respect for sovereignty and nonintervention in the internal affairs of a State. Our Assembly was once again misled by delaying tactics and slanderous and false information, as has so often happened in the history of our Organization. The well- known majority, which I have no need to describe, caused us to lose by far the best diplomatic battle, but in the field the people of Cambodia, united and exasperated by the obstinacy of a super-Power which wished to keep in place and maintain at any price the\nA/PV.2361\ntraitor Lon Nol and his clique, succeeded in liberating its country from foreign domination by force of arms. The severe defeat inflicted by a people of the third world on the most important military power will go down in the annals of colonial and imperialist history. This is a lesson to which thought should be given by those who have eyes but cannot see, ears but cannot hear, intelligence but cannot understand the situation of other people. The victory of Cambodia eloquently demonstrates that no military power, no matter how great and mighty it may be, can succeed in stifling for ever the legitimate aspirations of a people to freedom, dignity and independence.\n7.\tThe people of Dahomey express their deepest respect before the tomb of all the valiant Cambodian fighters who gave their lives for the liberation of Cambodia from foreign domination, increasing the prestige of the colonial peoples and the peoples of the third world in general by the glory they bestowed on the people of Cambodia. To our valiant colleagues, the authentic representatives of the people of Cambodia, Dahomey pays a warm tribute and extends its good wishes in welcoming them back to our Assembly.\n8.\tIn South Viet Nam, too, we have had a striking demonstration of what a people determined to free itself from the colonial yoke and foreign domination can do. The people of Viet Nam, in revolt, added another chapter to the book started by their brothers in Cambodia when, under the leadership of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam, it inflicted a severe and painful defeat on the Thieu clique and their imperialist masters by dismantling in a few days the whole system installed artificially to maintain in power a group of men in the pay of foreigners and thrown out by the people of Viet Nam. Here again, freedom was bought at the price of the blood of brave fighters, this time of South Viet Nam. To them, the Revolutionary Government of Dahomey wishes eternal glory.\n9.\tThus in Cambodia and South Viet Nam, as indeed in North Viet Nam, the peoples' will triumphed over military power. Those countries now enjoy domestic peace and are slowly but surely staunching the wounds of war by adopting the course of development they have set for themselves and not the one dictated from outside.\n10.\tIf Dahomey and friendly countries have grounds for gratification at seeing among us here in our Assembly the worthy and authentic sons of Cambodia, for whom it was a question of the restoration of their lawful rights, on the other hand we have reasons for disgust in the light of the fate of the valiant people of the two Viet Nams and their respective Governments when we see that it required nothing more than the will of a single great Power to prevent the admission of the two Vietnamese Governments as full Members of our Organization. It is unjust that the veto of one super-Power sufficed to cancel out the positive vote of the overwhelming majority of the members of the Security Council. This is an inadmissible and intolerable practice in 1975, at a time when our Organization is moving gradually towards the target of universality which it has set itself. My delegation, which supported the inclusion on the agenda of the Assembly of the item on the admission of the two Viet Nams [item 22], hopes that the almost unanimous will of our General Assembly will be given due weight by the Security Council when it comes to reconsider the matter. The Security Council must take more account of the realities of 1975, rather than the situation which, although understandable in 1945, does not make much sense today. My delegation continues to insist that it is not right that the peoples of North and South Viet Nam be kept much longer outside our Organization. This is not the time to prefer dreams to reality,\n11.\tTherefore my delegation reaffirms what it said last year, that the Charter must be revised and, above all, the right of veto in the Security Council must be reviewed and corrected. If the present structure of the Council remains the same, then a majority of the permanent members must oppose a resolution for it to be rejected. We, the countries of the third world, see in this an important question which underlies the credibility and efficiency of our Organization, and is therefore something to which serious thought should be given.\n12.\tBefore leaving the question of South-East Asia, my delegation cannot refrain from raising the issue of Korea, which unfortunately is on the agenda of our Assembly and which we shall be considering later on. However, at the present stage we have to stress that, since the joint communique of 1972' whereby the two parties directly concerned undertook to begin a dialog with a view to the peaceful settlement of the problem of peaceful and democratic reunification of the country, no progress has been made in spite of the text of the consensus adopted by the twenty-eighth session and the resolution adopted by our Assembly last year on this item [resolution 3333 (XXIX)]. One of the major reasons for this stagnation lies in the presence of foreign military forces based on Korean territory.\n13.\tIt is fortunate that the United States Government, which maintains at considerable expense the so-called United Nations Force, has taken the decision to dissolve the United Nations Military Command. It is, however, regrettable that that dissolution has not been accompanied by evacuation. That solution can in no way facilitate contacts between the two parts of the country and open the way to serious negotiations with a view to the reunification desired by both sides.\n14.\tThe delegation of Dahomey very much hopes that the United Nations will discharge its responsibilities before it is too late. Our Organization must create the conditions necessary for transforming the armistice into lasting peace and accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of the two parts of Korea. To bring that about, our Assembly must call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korean soil, so that the Koreans, and they alone, can settle their problems among themselves.\n15.\tThe Middle East is enjoying relative peace, in the sense that the sound of gunfire is heard less clearly, at least on a large scale. Here, again, apart from the contribution of our Organization in sending peacekeeping forces, the United Nations has really had nothing to do with the silencing of the guns, and only the good will of the super-Powers has made it possible to create a situation which gives to the international community grounds for gratification. We see here an illustration of what we said last year, when my delegation stated that if the super-Powers could cease their rivalry, zones of conflict could disappear for ever, Of course, the different disengagement agreements, negotiated at such cost and then signed, constitute positive approaches to a final solution of the Middle East problem.\n16.\tIt is particularly fortunate that Israel has finally conceded that its peace and security lie above all in its withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories; but these provisional solutions should not make us forget the real nub of the problem the Palestinian question. The injustice of turning the Palestinians into eternal wanderers must be finally and definitely redressed. The Palestinian people, like the Jews, must have a homeland. That aspiration was clearly expressed by our Assembly last year [resolution 3236 (XXIX)]. So, until the Palestinian problem has been thoroughly tackled, with all the necessary seriousness, with a view to a final settlement of what has come to be known as the Middle East crisis, all solutions of the papering- over type will remain futile and there will be no peace in that area, The super-Powers should be told that instead of engaging in blind antagonism their actions would be more beneficial to the international community if they were to bear in mind the Palestinian situation and attempt to work for the major interests of the peoples of the area.\n17.\tThe situation in Cyprus still gives cause for concern. It must be recognized that, under the aegis of the Secretary-General, talks between the two communities have made it possible to achieve some results, however meager they may be. My delegation wishes vigorously to reaffirm the position it defended last year. For Dahomey, there is an independent Cypriot State and a Cypriot people and we must leave it to that people to solve its own problems as a Cypriot people and not as members of a Greek-Cypriot community or a Turkish-Cypriot community.\n18.\tOnce we concede the terms \\\"Greek Cypriot\\\" and \\\"Turkish Cypriot\\\" our Organization is thereby sanctioning division and preparing the ground for external aggression, for the intervention of neighboring countries in the affairs of the Cypriot State. An excellent illustration of what we are saying was the occupation by the Turkish army of the richest part of the island, on the pretext of protecting a people, without our community being able to react because the super-Powers so willed it. In the view of my delegation, no acceptable and realistic solution can be found, unless our Organization calls for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the island, whether they are there on the basis of an agreement or for purposes of aggression and occupation. We must allow the people of Cyprus, under the enlightened leadership of Archbishop Makarios, to become the master of its destiny, in unity and with territorial integrity. My delegation vigorously condemns all secessionist and separatist designs aimed at the partition of Cyprus.\n19.\tSince the assumption of power by young officers of the Portuguese army and the elimination of the reactionary and retrogressive clique of Caetano, we have to recognize that Portugal has been able, in spite of its domestic difficulties, to keep the promises it made in our Assembly and before the whole world.\nThanks to its scrupulous respect For the time-table which was drawn up, we have been able to welcome here the delegations of Sao Tome and Principe, Cape Verde and Mozambique.\n20.\tUnfortunately, in Angola the process of decolonization does not seem to be taking a normal course, not only because of the lack of agreement between the representatives of the liberation movements whose task it is to prepare for independence but also, and above all, because of the interference of some foreign Powers which are primarily attracted by the vast wealth and economic potential of the country. My delegation appeals urgently to our brothers in the Angolan liberation movements not to lose sight of their primary objective of independence and the need to unite in order to achieve it, instead of playing the game of those who are trying to weaken them by urging them to mutual annihilation. Our brothers in Angola should not forget that if Africa has been reduced to a state of chronic under-development, it is because at a certain point in its history its sons were taken away and forced to develop the industrialized countries of today. Our brothers in Angola must understand that it is not in the interest of the future nation of Angola, and still less in the interests of Africa as a whole, that its sons should engage in mutual slaughter. The Angola of tomorrow, rich and prosperous, will need all its population to promote its development.\n21.\tApart from what I must call the extremely regrettable situation in Angola, Africa can take pride in the success of the process of decolonization in the Territories formerly under Portuguese administration. But what about the other colonies? The case of the Comoros puzzles my delegation. We wonder how it is that France, our friend, and the champion of decolonization, did not respond in time to the frequently reiterated aspirations of the people of the Comoros to become independent. My delegation wonders how it is that, faced with legislative maneuvers, the Government of the Comoros was obliged to proclaim the independence of the Territory unilaterally, and why we were not spared this masquerade of a coup d'etat against the Government of President Abdalha. These are questions to which the delegation of Dahomey would like to hear answers. Dahomey sincerely hopes that the enlightened interests of the people of the Comoros will triumph over the concern to preserve vested interests whether or not they relate to a strategic military base.\n22.\tDahomey welcomes the independence of the Comoros, in whatever form, and urgently appeals both to the former administering Power and to the people of the Comoros themselves to safeguard their national unity and territorial integrity.\n23.\tIn southern Africa my Government has followed with concern the maneuvers of the Vorster-Smith gang, aimed apparently at finding a common platform for the convening of the constitutional conference which is to negotiate the transfer of power to the overwhelming black majority of Rhodesia. Subsequent events have shown my Government that it was fully justified in having serious reservations about the feverish activity and the so-called good offices of Vorster. How, in fact, can we trust or give any credence to this racist chieftain who has no intention of giving an inch in his heinous and abject policy of apartheid?\nHow can we trust this Nazi who, despite the numerous resolutions of our own Organization and the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice,-1 continues illegally to occupy Namibia and to establish bantustans there in order to block for ever the independence and territorial integrity of that country? What credence can we really give to this man when he claims to be urging Smith, his flunky and associate, to go cap in hand to the representatives of the Rhodesian liberation movement to discuss with them conditions for organizing a constitutional conference? It is time for Vorster and Smith and others to understand that Africans are not fools and that the liberation movements are not to be deluded. They know that force alone can triumph over the obstinacy of the inveterate racists and the unregenerate colonialists, and that they can only free their territories by force of arms, as was the case in other parts of Africa and elsewhere. In order to spare so many human lives, Smith must prove his good faith by agreeing to the prerequisite of the representatives of the Rhodesian liberation movements who call for the freeing of all political prisoners, the holding of discussions in neutral territory and the reduction to a bare minimum of the transitional period to precede the transfer of power from the white minority to the overwhelming black majority. There can be no question, therefore, of the liberation movements undertaking discussions in unfavorable conditions, with a knife at their throats. Nor do we need to add that the administering authority can no longer continue to play the role of Pontius Pilate, and must discharge its proper responsibilities by creating the necessary conditions for sincere, useful and constructive negotiations.\n24.\tThe racist regime of apartheid believes that it is making an impression on international public opinion by stating that it is boycotting the thirtieth session. This was certainly a wise move. Whether or not the delegation of South Africa is represented at the session, it is true nevertheless that differences between it and the United Nations remain, and that the question of Namibia must be settled without delay. Since the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on this question, the illegality of the presence of South Africa in Namibia is not open to question. My delegation believes that the measures taken by this regime to consolidate the annexation of Namibia by South Africa, the creation of Ovambolands and other areas is a challenge to the whole international community.\n25.\tIn the face of this situation, our Assembly must take the most energetic action to prevail upon this regime, rejected by our Organization, to divest itself of a Territory that does not belong to it, a Territory which our international community is determined to administer until such time as power can be transferred to the people of Namibia themselves, the sole and authentic representative of whom is the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO].\n26.\tThere is an artificially created situation in western Africa that is indeed one of concern to the delegation of Dahomey. We wonder how Africans themselves can employ a double standard in the matter of decolonization; how they can proclaim the overwhelming necessity to decolonize under Ihe terms of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in resolution 1514 (XV), on the one hand, while on the other hand they recommend the suspension of any application of that Declaration until the International Court of Justice has given a decision on the situation before the colonization of the Sahara under Spanish administration.\n27.\tThe attempt to have our Assembly adopt a resolution contrary to the principles of the United Nations has made it an accomplice in an injustice and a plot the consequences of which cannot be foreseen. In the view of my delegation, the most important thing in the case of the Sahara under Spanish administration is the interest of the people concerned, their true aspirations, not the claims of certain neighboring countries. It is for this reason that my delegation deems it necessary to repeal the ambiguous and treacherous resolution adopted by our General Assembly last year, and to return purely and simply to the strict application of resolution 1514 (XV). In this particular case the situation has been clear ever since the administering Power decided to decolonize the Territory. Nothing should now be allowed to halt this process. Once it is independent and sovereign, it will be for the people of the Sahara themselves to decide on their own future and whether or not they wish to be united with any neighboring State. But before the precondition of independence no neighboring State can say that it has a greater interest in the Sahara than the people of the Sahara themselves, or that it can make a decision for them.\n28.\tAnother matter of serious concern to my Government is the question of disarmament. Everyone talks about disarmament, but in actual fact it would appear to be merely a dialog of the deaf, dominated, of course, by the obvious selfishness of the great Powers. Their boundless individualism makes possible the maintenance of the various areas of tension that we mentioned earlier. The great Powers proclaim from the rooftops their wish to disarm. Some of them call this wish by the misleading name of \\\"detente\\\". But what exactly is the disarmament they are talking about, and what is the area it involves? These questions become all the more urgent as these Powers go on manufacturing ever more sophisticated weapons which they sell at very high prices to others so that these latter can continue their mutual slaughter, so eager are they for the rapid recovery of the petrodollar, or because of the profits derived from gold, diamond and other mines. In these circumstances, the so-called Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe that was held recently is nothing but a crude farce; for it is immoral for Europe to wish to institutionalize the frontiers that emerged from the last war and to seek thereby to assure peace and security, while at the same time it is busy sowing horror and terror elsewhere by supplying the most highly developed arms to other continents. No. The Middle East, SouthEast Asia, even Africa, cannot be regarded as testing- grounds for new weapons designed in countries in which an effort is made to maintain peace and prosperity. The great Powers are deceiving themselves when they think it sufficient to utter the word \\\"detente\\\" in order to settle everything.\n29.\tAccording to certain people, detente is the ' magic key that opens all doors, consolidates peace, facilitates decolonization, guarantees development, and I know not what else. There can be no detente or peace if any part of this world is living in prosperity while the overwhelming majority lives in poverty. My delegation believes that peace must be enjoyed by all or it will not be enjoyed by anyone. That is why Dahomey believes that this is no longer the time for hypocrisy, and calls upon the super-Powers to ponder something that was said a few days ago at this very rostrum by our brother, the doyen of this Assembly, Mr. Baroody of Saudi Arabia: that instead of talking about detente, it would be better to talk about entente understanding. Indeed, through understanding it would be possible to stop the production of arms, whether logistic, conventional or other. If such arms were not exported, peace and security could be ensured, not only in the countries that produce them, but also for all generations, present and future, in the entire international community. Let us hope that the great Powers, together with the small ones, will resolve to set out on this course, the only one capable of leading us to a real and stable era of disarmament.\n30.\tNow my delegation would like to say something about the seventh special session which ended a few days ago. The results of that session are still fresh in our memories and there is no need to stress the problems of development and international co-operation which were then discussed. The Foreign Minister of my country, Comrade Michel Alladaye, indicated here the objectives which Dahomey would like to see our community achieve: among others, the regulation of the commodity and raw materials markets, the indexation of the prices of those commodities and raw materials in relation to the prices of imports from developed countries, and the reform and democratization of the international monetary system.\n31.\tAfter arduous and difficult negotiations, we can today take pride in the fact that we have been able to reach agreement on the essentials; this is an important step towards the establishment of the new economic order that is the desire of the whole international community. Now we have to embark on the phase of practical implementation. Dahomey ventures to hope that the General Assembly, at its thirtieth session, will undertake this task and that other United Nations specialized agencies will do so too.\n32.\tThese are some of the items on the agenda of the thirtieth session on which my delegation felt it necessary to make some comments in the general debate. We have said that while it is true that our work has begun in an atmosphere of relative tranquility in the traditional areas of tension, it is nevertheless true that in most cases that situation is not due to direct action on the part of our Organization, and this is very much to be regretted. The obstinacy of the superPowers and their national pride make them prefer to settle certain matters themselves, outside the United Nations. We have said that the Great Powers, and above all the super-Powers, will have to agree to co-operate frankly and sincerely with the Secretary- General in order to strengthen the role of the United Nations.\n33.\tWe have said that we must revise and correct the right of veto within the framework of the review of the Charter, because it is wrong that in 1975 the will of a super-Power should prevail over the will of the overwhelming majority of the Security Council.\n34.\tWe have said that the solution of the Middle East crisis lies in the question of Palestine, which must be settled in a just and equitable manner.\n35.\tWe have said that the Cypriot people must become masters of their own destiny in unity and territorial integrity.\n36.\tWe have said, on the question of the Sahara under Spanish administration, that the United Nations cannot make the implementation of the Declaration in resolution 1514 (XV) subject to any pre-conditions.\n37.\tWe have also said that true disarmament will result from an entente and not from detente among the great Powers, and that a necessary condition for this will be that they refrain from exporting arms and other means of destruction.\n38.\tFinally, we have said that the results achieved by the Assembly at its seventh special session augur well and give us hope that many controversies between rich and poor will see the beginning of a solution through dialog and free co-operation in the common interest.\n39.\tThe delegation of Dahomey very much hopes that the observations we have just made here in all humility will be of inspiration to the work of the thirtieth session and will help us to make progress in and to consolidate the cause of peace, decolonization and development for all.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "352.\t I bring to this Assembly warm and fraternal greetings and best wishes from my President, Ngwazi H. Kamuzu Banda, and the Government and people of the Republic of Malawi. It is my President's sincere hope and belief that the deliberations of this session will be guided with wisdom and maturity in an atmosphere of mutual understanding and a willingness to reach compromises on any divergent issues that may come before it.\n353.\tOn behalf of the Malawi delegation and on my own behalf, I wish to offer the President heartfelt congratulations upon his election to the high post of President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. His election is viewed by the Malawi delegation as an expression of the appreciation felt by the United Nations of the peaceful and constructive work which the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has done in various international forums. Our two countries are far apart geographically, but our peoples have for a long time had each other's respect and understanding. In his high office, to which he comes armed with distinction and obvious talent, I am confident that his understanding, knowledge, vision and rich experience in the United Nations will play a vital role in ensuring the successful deliberations of this session of the General Assembly. To this end, I wish to assure him of the full co-operation of the Malawi delegation.\n354.\t1 wish also to pay my country's tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, for the able manner in which he conducted the deliberations of the twenty-ninth session of our Assembly.\n355.\tIf we look back over the annals of our Organization, the events of last year stand out remarkably as milestones on the road to the realization of the aims and purposes of the United Nations. Of all the recent developments, the termination of the 500-year-old Portuguese empire has been of great importance. This year we all participate in an enlarged Assembly with the admission of newly independent States. Permit me to express our hearty congratulations to the leaders and the peoples of the States of Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe and to welcome their leaders here on behalf of my President and the Government and the people of the Republic of Malawi. Their admission is not only consistent with the principle of universality but it also gives the world body a truly representative character.\n356.\tIt gives me great pleasure to welcome our neighbor, Mozambique, to this Organization. The President-for-Life of the Republic of Malawi, Ngwazi H. Kamuzu Banda, has already stated on more than one occasion that the Government and People of Malawi greatly rejoice in Mozambique's independence. He has said that Malawi is happy that Mozambique is now a free and independent sovereign State. He reiterated what he said many times, namely, that Malawians and Mozambicans were one and the same people and that the boundaries between the two countries were \\\"not of God's making and not of our own making, but of other people's making, the former colonial and imperial Powers\\\". He also emphasized that our \\\"policy towards free and independent Mozambique is, and always will be, the traditional Malawi policy. That policy, as everyone knows, is one of good-neighborliness, friendship and go-operation and, when necessary and possible, helpfulness to neighbors.\\\"\n357.\tWhile my delegation is happy that Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe are now independent, we are deeply distressed that at a time when independence in Angola is on the doorstep the loss of life in that country has been and continues to be heavy.\n358.\tIn like manner, Rhodesia is a similar case. My delegation cannot but express its satisfaction that the policy of dialog and negotiations is being accepted as one of the ways of achieving peaceful solutions to the problems of that country. As believers in the philosophy of contact and dialog as the only practical way of solving the problems of southern Africa, we welcome the efforts which have been made during the past year by the leaders of Zambia, the United Republic of Tanzania, Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and others towards a constitutional settlement in Rhodesia and, at the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, held at Kampala from 28 July to 1 August, Malawi has in its own way kept abreast of developments and has taken part in one way or another in the quest for a solution of the Rhodesian problem.\n359.\tWe are also concerned that Namibia continues to be a problem and that no just solution to it has been found. We hope that the discussions that have continued to take place between the various leaders in that country will lead to a satisfactory solution.\n360.\tThe Government of Malawi continues to follow with interest the evolution of events in the Middle East. Our concern over the state of affairs prevailing in that region is due to our conviction that international peace is indivisible. In this connexion, I would like to applaud the role which the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Henry Kissinger, has played and continues to play in the search for a durable peace in that area. It is a matter of great encouragement and relief to most of us that an interim peace agreement between Israel and Egypt has been signed. The success of that agreement will depend on the good will of all the nations involved in the crisis. It is our sincere hope that a more lasting agreement will be achieved so that permanent peace can be attained in that troubled area.\n361.\tTurning to South-East Asia, my delegation is happy to see that the wars which characterized life in that region have come to an end. At least there is no more loss of life or damage to property.\n362.\tI should like to say a word or two about an economic achievement which has been realized on the African continent and of which Africa must be very proud. I am referring to the ACP-EEC convention of Lome signed by the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific [A CP] and the countries of the European Economic Community [EEC]. That Convention, which was signed in Lome, Togo, in February this year, brings together 46 African, Caribbean and Pacific States in a global effort to rationalize trade relations with the EEC. The ACP group of countries is a unique association which brings together States of varying colonial backgrounds and, in most cases, of conflicting post-independence ideologies. However, the very fact that such countries could negotiate and come to a unanimous agreement is an encouraging sign that we can bury our differences if we want to achieve a common goal.\n363.\tThere is no doubt that the ACP group of countries bargained convincingly with the EEC, and through the concessions inherent in the Lome Convention, they are bound to gain. We, in Malawi, are proud to be parties to the ACP-EEC Convention of Lome and we shall do all we can to ensure that these African,\nCaribbean and Pacific countries' relations with Europe are maintained to the benefit of all concerned.\n364.\tIt would be remiss on my part if I did not express once again my country's appreciation of and gratitude for the assistance which we have received and continue to receive from the United Nations and its economic, social and technical agencies. This assistance has been and still is of vital importance in our struggle to create a truly viable economy and achieve a state of meaningful economic as well as political independence. I also wish to place on record our gratitude, not only to the United Nations and its specialized agencies, but also to those Member States of the world body whose generous contributions have made it possible for the agencies to fulfill their commitments.\n365.\tWe have been an active Member of this Organization for more than a decade now. During this time, we have seen the United Nations grow both in functional bodies and in the responsibilities assigned to it. There is a tendency in the United Nations to try to expand it. However, we are not against progress and expansion. On the contrary, we believe that society is by nature dynamic and, bearing that in mind, its institutions must grow in order to respond to changing circumstances. But there are certain standards and patterns of growth which any institution must adhere to in order to maintain its shape and to remain within reasonable proportions. It is the feeling of my Government that the expansion of the Organization has been out of proportion.\n366.\tI am referring to the emergence of numerous functional bodies within the United Nations family which purport to perform specialized activities. We are indeed aware that, with the strides being made in scientific and technological sophistication, the world has become more complex. But are we not making it more complicated by continuing to create more organs to perform essentially the same traditional roles? More and more United Nations specialized bodies are being created. Usually, the functions of the new bodies are not clearly defined, but, all the same, Member States have to contribute to their financing and the annual budget of the United Nations continues to be revised upwards. In this connexion, the Malawi delegation supports the need to restructure the United Nations economic and social system as recommended in the report of the Group of Experts on the Structure of the United Nations System.16\n367.\tWe feel that steps ought to be taken to arrest this over-expansion of United Nations functional bodies. In order to take this step, a review of the United Nations system is called for. It is my country's feeling that most of the functions now being performed by the specialized bodies could be adequately discharged within the machinery of the traditional United Nations specialized agencies.\n368.\tWe feel also that, while the existing specialized bodies of the United Nations, such as the Economic Commission for Africa, the International Labor Organization, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Environment Program, and so on, have done much commendable work in their respective fields, they still have a lot to do if they are to sustain their credibility. Experience has shown us that these organizations have over the years tended to hold more seminars and dwell more on the theoretical aspects\nof the various problems which face mankind today We think that the time has come for these bodies to talk less and act more and that they should refrain from holding numerous seminars and engaging jn voluminous paper work instead of concentrating on finding practical solutions to our problems.\n369.\tBefore I conclude, allow me to reiterate once more my Government's belief in the policy of contact and dialog or contact and discussion as the only practical way of solving most of the world's political problems and conflicts. Speaking on this very rostrum in 1964 my President, Ngwazi H. Kamuzu Banda, made it clear that Malawi believes passionately in ideals for which the United Nations stands; that is world peace, security and justice. We believe that these ideals can be realized through peaceful discussions among nations and not through threats or violence. We believe that, had the policy of contact and discussion which my President initiated been adopted among nations, most of the problems and conflicts which confront mankind today would have been solved long ago.\n370.\tBefore I come to the end of my address I want to thank the President, the Secretary-General and the members of the Assembly very much for their patience and indulgence in listening to my country's views on some of the pressing problems of our times. May the spirit of contact among nations and communication of ideas which symbolize the objectives of this Assembly continue to enrich our minds and broaden our outlook on the major issues facing the international community. To that end, allow me to assure the President that the constructive efforts of the United Nations towards those goals will enjoy the full support of the Government of the Republic of Malawi."

        "file_text": "54  It is with an extremely deep sense of joy and thankfulness that I accept the privilege and pleasure of addressing this body. Please allow me, Mr. President, without any hesitation whatever, to express for my country, Government and for myself personally, the great satisfaction that your elevation to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly of this United Nations has brought us. Indeed, we are fully aware of the very high esteem in which you are held and the respect you have merited in international circles, particularly for your wisdom and for your extraordinary degree of statesmanship, as demonstrated throughout your years of public life. Please accept my warmest and sincere congratulations and those of the Government and the people of a small and incomparably beautiful country,\nGrenada, known as the \\\"Isle of Spice\\\" and renowned for its friendliness and the warmth of its people.\n55.\tI should consider myself remiss should I fail to place on record my country's appreciation for the herculean task so ably performed by your predecessor. Mr. Abdelaziz BouteElika, in presiding over the work and activities of the twenty-ninth session as well as the seventh special session of the General Assembly. In this context, also, please permit me to pay a warm tribute to our beloved and illustrious Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt WaJdheim, whose tenacious and effective dedication to the cause of peace and justice has been instrumental in stirring a sense of awareness among the leaders of the more industrialized nations of the needs of the less developed ones, thereby achieving a greater measure of understanding and meaningful co-operation.\n56.\tMay I at this juncture be permitted to extend a warm hand of welcome to the States of Cape Verde. Sao Tome and Principe and Mozambique which have been admitted to full membership at this session. Indeed the Governments and peoples of these States must essentially be as proud of their membership and as happy in their association, privileges and concomitant responsibilities as we were when we were similarly admitted one year ago. I am particularly gratified by every step taken, at any time, and in any part of the globe, bilaterally or unilaterally, with a view to giving full, uninhibited and unconditional freedom from colonial oppression or minority domination to our brothers and sisters to join us in this world assembly of people.\n57.\tMy country has made a definite contribution in areas that have been of specific concern to this body during its twenty-ninth and again now at its thirtieth session. I refer to the equal status of women which is one with and indivisible from the goal of human rights. Our philosophy has long been committed lo the full participation of men and women in equal partnership for the conduct of the affairs of our country. This has been a specific policy of my Government which is reflected in the enactment of laws that entrench and enshrine this principle, Within the confines of our limited financial resources we have endeavored to carry out Programs recommended by this Organization during International Women's Year, pro-grammes that would reach out and involve rural women in the efforts and activities generated in the urban centers. We have sought to conduct research in areas requiring improvement through the work of a commission established by my Government, and its recommendations will form the basis of further governmental action for even greater equity in access to education and training, in law, politics, employment, social conditions, sports and recreational activities and indeed in all other fields. Permit me to slate with justifiable pride that Grenada reflects today the harmony of citizens who live in peace with each other, and our people enjoy the fullest exercise of freedom in a land known for its incomparable beauty and for the friendliness of its inhabitants.\n58. When Grenada was graciously accepted as a fully fledged Member of the United Nations we pledged to uphold all the obligations within its Charter. These obligations are similarly upon ihe shoulders of every nation Member of this Organization and, as we in\nGrenada raise our voices m support of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe, we are doing no more than in conscience fulfilling our obligations as contained within the Charter. But 1 feel strongly- that this obligation cannot be confined to Grenada but must be borne by the United Nations as a whole. I therefore urge the United Nations to accept its obligations within the Charter to ensure that the decisions reached here by resolutions to give effect to the freedom of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe are fully complied with by the Government of South Africa and the Smith regime respectively.\n59.\tClearly the issue is not between South Africa and Namibia, or the Smith regime and Zimbabwe, but rather it is definitely between the Government of South Africa and the Smith regime on one hand and all the Stales Members of Ihe United Nations on the other. Must the United Nations continue to shirk its responsibilities, condone the denial of freedom to the peoples of these two countries, and settle for a potential deterioration of the respect and confidence of this body? Or should we take steps now and I mean steps sufficiently effective to bring South Africa and the Smith regime to their senses to give freedom to our brothers and sisters in those two countries and retain the respect of the peoples of the world for this body, the United Nations?\n60.\tI wish to reiterate my country's irrevocable stand on the principle of territorial integrity, and in this context I urge the United Nations to take immediate steps to implement resolution 1514 (XV) and to ensure the emergence of the State of Belize from colonial rule to fully fledged independence for its people whose protracted aspirations has been frustrated by powers and circumstances beyond their control.\n61.\tThis dews not necessarily mean that Grenada is opposed to negotiations. But. committed to the principle that demands freedom for the peoples of the world and thinking first and foremost of the people of Belize above anything else and looking objectively at the United Nations obligations to the peoples of the world, one cannot hesitate to urge that the people of Belize should be given the right to enjoy the fullness of independence with all its attendant rights and privileges, as well as its obligations. Should we in the United Nations shirk our responsibility under the Charter, the consequences must inevitably be not only a burden on our conscience but also a potential danger to international peace. And so we demand full independence for the people of Belize now, and I repeat, independence now.\n62.\tInextricably linked with the inherent right of a people to self-determination is the principle of economic survival, especially in the case of former colonial Territories whose economic resources have been exploited by their imperial masters and which must now fend for themselves upon the attainment of independence.\n63.\tI have spoken in many places about the precarious economic plight of certain countries, such as my own, upon emergence to independence. Only a few weeks ago, I made reference to this on the occasion of the joint annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and its affiliates. I recognize that this is not the final forum for ventilation of this matter, as the United Nations has wisely provided for an International Court of Justice which can deal more appropriately with the issue because of its legal implications.\n64.\tWe are happy to note that the report of the United Nations Visiting Mission to Montserrat [A/10023, chap. XXVIII] stressed that economic safeguards from the colonial Powers were necessary when the colony attained independence. This observation emphasizes the point which Grenada has been making for some time that economic viability is a necessary concomitant of political independence.\n65.\tThere is also evidence to alleviate our fears since our thoughts on the matter are reflected in paragraph 4 00 of resolution 3201 (S-VI) adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, which stipulates that all States, territories and peoples under foreign occupation, alien and colonial domination or apartheid have the right \\\"to restitution and full compensation for the exploitation and depletion of, and damages to, the natural resources and all other resources of those States, territories and peoples\\\".\n66.\tPerhaps, with United Nations influence and bilateral negotiations already started between my country and the imperial colonial Power, I hope it may not be necessary to proceed with Grenada's specific problems to the International Court of Justice, as has been contemplated.\n67.\tIn the context of a growing awareness of the international community about economic justice for developing countries, we strongly support the positive attitude of the seventh special session of this Assembly on the establishment of a new international economic order for regulating the economic relationships between rich and poor countries in a more equitable manner. We therefore urge all Member States to co-operate for the early implementation of measures designed to improve the economic lot of all men on this planet.\n68.\tThis session is in a sense historic and significant in that it marks the end of the third decade of the existence of this Organization, and as we look in retrospect we cannot avoid a feeling of emotional conflict the joys of that which has been accomplished; the sorrows of international wars, of strife and strikes; the strings and red tape attached to the limited cooperation by which the developing countries received some assistance; the fears and apprehensions that reigned over some of our peoples in countries less industrialized and somewhat vulnerable to the greed and ambitions of larger nations. In other words, it is definitely with mixed feelings and emotions that we can truly and honestly view in retrospect the activities of the United Nations over the last 30 years.\n69.\tBut this session is historic and significant for other reasons as well, because it ushers in the dawn of a new era, an era with a \\\"world order\\\" that offers hope to the third world in particular and at the same time one that offers in general greater hope and confidence in the multifarious aspects of human endeavor in medicine, in technology, in human relations, in social sciences and research, among others. Man, in his quest for greater knowledge and advancement, is exploring space and has actually walked in space; yes indeed, man has even traversed the surface of the moon. Man has long been exploring and is still exploring the unlimited abundance of our oceans wealth and potential.\n70.\tIt is in this context that I crave the Assembly's indulgence to repeat here an observation which I made a few weeks ago in my address to the joint annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and its affiliates. I said then that:\n\\\"There are truly.great people in every part of the globe. It is not the place or the size of the place in which one was born, nor the family to which he was born, nor the color of his skin that makes him truly great. In fact, the qualities that characterize true greatness in man are seldom found in pages or taught within the classrooms. Certainly, these sublime qualities are found in the deepest and innermost recesses of man's consciousness, and only he, and he alone, can discover them. But, regrettably ... the average man is afraid to unlock the door to himself.\\\"\n71.\tIt is in this context that it has dawned upon me very forcefully that the time has come when the United Nations must seriously give thought to and initiate the establishment of an appropriate department or an agency devoted to psychic research. I am certainly not so naive as not to appreciate the sensitivity of such a subject, but there is definitely justification for doing something about psychic research, particularly when one reflects on the bountiful human talents that go to waste because of man's ignorance of certain aspects of his immediate environs and, most certainly, of his esoteric or inner self, and on the various inexplicable phenomena which continue to baffle even the most advanced branches of science. The \\\"Bermuda triangle\\\" is but one example.\n72.\tFor various reasons, I consider it sufficient simply to announce the desirability of such a department or agency and not elaborate on it at this stage. But this, however, must not in any way cause anyone to underestimate the magnitude and the importance of this innovative subject. The knowledge that may become available to man through psychic research could very well make him the complete master of self and circumstances, and not the subject, in some cases the slave, thereof; we need a department or an agency devoted to psychic research.\n73.\tIn closing, I should like to state, without any reservation whatever, that it is my firm conviction that the whole world and, more specifically, the leaders of world affairs need a greater measure of recognition and acceptance of the universality of a Supreme Being whether known as God, Allah or Jehovah or by any other name. Yes, we need to recognize that Power, that Supreme Power; we need to accept God as the universal source of all existence, the center of all creation. We need to feel and to sense God within and without, around and above us, in us and all around us, not only for a few hours on the day of worship, but at all times, in every second, every minute, every hour throughout our entire life on this planet earth. We here need to sense the Supreme Being filling this entire magnificent building and, indeed, all space in the universe with His presence.\n518\n74.\tI submit in humility and with respect that it is only with this concept, the recognition and acceptance of the universal God and the sensing of His presence as the universal Power that is eternally holding and binding all things together, that a new \\\"world order\\\" based on peace and love can properly be established on a permanent basis; and I now engage the hearts and minds of all here to join in invoking and beseeching our universal and Supreme Master to refill us with an abundant measure of His divine, cosmic and universal spirit, to revitalize us with His universal energy. May our minds be all imbued with that divine and cosmic mind; may He quicken our intelligence with His cosmic divine and universal light; and may He inspire us with a love that is unselfish, a love that does not seek reward, a love that will hold and bind all peoples of our globe together with a new understanding and with lasting peace. If there are doubts in the minds of some of us, I can only console myself with the basic philosophy that \\\"We all belong to the same plant; the difference is, however, that some are in the fruits, while others are yet in the blossoms\\\". Let God be praised.\n"

        "file_text": "150.\t Mr. President, this session of the Assembly opens amidst signs of a new vitality, in an atmosphere of rising expectations. It is thus fitting that a personality of your wisdom and experience should preside over its deliberations. On behalf of my Government, I congratulate you on your assumption of this high office and look to your guidance.\n151.\tTo your predecessor, Foreign Minister Bouteflika of Algeria, my delegation wishes to pay a particular tribute for the distinguished way in which he presided over the twenty-ninth and the seventh special sessions of the General Assembly. His vigorous leadership was instrumental in enabling the Organization to arrive at some of the most significant decisions it has ever made.\n152.\tThe Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, has always been held in high esteem by my Government, and we once again offer him our support and cooperation.\n153.\tAllow me also to take this opportunity to welcome warmly to our midst the Republics of Cape Verde, Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe, whose admission to the United Nations has brought us closer to full universality.\n154.\tWe are meeting here during this thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations at a time of revolutionary change in human affairs. The last three decades have witnessed some of the most far-reaching changes on the international scene. The most outstanding feature of this transformation is the new resurgence we are witnessing of the third world which is striving to break the old pattern of unequal relationships, a pattern which was founded on the faulty precept of the permanent growth of the rich nations at the expense of the poor and is reflected in the growing gap between the developed and developing countries.\n155.\tIt is that break with the old scheme of things that has produced the signs of unrest within the United Nations as it marks the thirtieth anniversary of its birth. The United Nations has come under attack because it reflects the aspirations of a large majority of the deprived nations which demand a fair share of world prosperity, defy the one-sided rules forged in a bygone age and reject inequality, racism and colonialism.\n156.\tBut if the United Nations echoes those aspirations it equally provides the forum for dialog and the resolution of problems. That was evidenced in the recently concluded seventh special session of the General Assembly. The test of statesmanship is thus not to turn away from the United Nations because the Organization reflects the realities of the world situation, but rather to come to grips with the root- causes of the present state of affairs.\n157.\tThe United Nations has never lacked critics, and one cannot deny that some of the criticism is justified and has been made in good faith.\n158.\tAs we look back at the record of the past three decades we find that, as with any other human enterprise, there are positive and negative points on the balance-sheet. Yet given the constraints under which the Organization has worked, it has registered a commendable list of achievements in such areas as peace-keeping, decolonization and economic development, as well as in the social and humanitarian fields.\n159.\tAt the time of this anniversary let us, as Members of the United Nations, pledge ourselves to act in a manner that will rekindle the hope that mankind placed in this Organization 30 years ago.\n160.\tThe events of the past year have brought to the fore new developments and highlighted changes in many aspects of current problems. In Indo-China, war has at long last come to an end and a tragic chapter of history has finally been closed; the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has been held in Helsinki; and a major step has been taken towards the achievement of a final settlement in the Middle East.\n161.\tThere have been other events of great significance in the course of the past year, but I should like to confine my remarks to the areas of more direct interest to my country.\n162.\tFor many years, relations between Iran and Iraq were strained. I am happy to inform the Assembly that our differences have been finally and definitely resolved.\n163.\tAt the summit Conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] at Algiers on 6 March 1975, during a meeting between my august Sovereign and the Vice-Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council of Iraq, a decision was reached on the definite demarcation of the land and river frontiers and the re-establishment of good-neighborly relations. An era of co-operation has thus started in which all peoples, no longer burdened by the legacy of the past, can explore new horizons in many areas of mutual interest. This development could also allow our neighbors, the littoral States of the Persian Gulf, to enhance their co-operation for the maintenance of security and peace within that important waterway.\n164.\tI should like on this occasion to place on record the sincere gratitude and appreciation of my Government to all Governments and personalities that strove to bring about a peaceful solution between Iran and Iraq. It is especially an honor and a pleasant duty for me to mention the President of Algeria, Houari Boumediene, to whose tireless efforts that accomplishment owes a great deal. I should like also to express our appreciation to Algeria's Foreign Minister, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and his skillful collaborators, whose presence and co-operation during various stages of the negotiations were of immense value.\n165.\tIn the Middle East the danger of a new conflagration has not yet been removed. Much as we welcome the recent peace initiatives, we cannot fail to note that a real solution is still lacking at the scene of the conflict. At the heart of the problem lies the refusal of Israel to return the lands it has occupied by force and to recognize for the people of Palestine those same rights that it regards as sacrosanct for its own people.\n166.\tIn spite of that, we believe that efforts to prepare the ground for a durable solution must be encouraged.\n167.\tBearing that in mind, we praise the efforts made this year by the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Kissinger, to bring about a new agreement on military disengagement in Sinai. We are pleased that in spite of earlier setbacks those efforts finally had positive results and a new disengagement of forces proved possible of achievement. Throughout that long, arduous and often frustrating process, President El- Sadat of Egypt demonstrated high qualities of statesmanship. Among his many commendable decisions we count with great satisfaction the reopening of the Suez Canal and the resettlement of some 600,000 of the dispersed inhabitants of that area.\n168.\tWe praise equally the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Emergency Force and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force. We greatly value the importance of the role being played by the United Nations forces and we have ourselves, on an urgent request from the Secretary-General, contributed a contingency unit to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force. We firmly believe that the presence of those forces in the Sinai and Golan regions will encourage the movement towards a final peace settlement. That presence should not, however, allow stagnation to persist.\n169.\tMy Government continues to believe that the key to the solution of the Middle East problem lies in the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), together with other relevant United Nations resolutions which call for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from territories occupied in the 1967 war, including Jerusalem, the exercise of their legitimate rights by the Palestinian people and security and recognition for all States in that area.\n170.\tThe concerns that underlay our proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East remain a source of undiminished preoccupation. Last year I had occasion to explain to the Assembly the motives that had prompted my august Sovereign to renew his proposal for the establishment of such a zone in our region. I need not therefore cover the same ground again. Yet two basic propositions bear repeating.\n171.\tFirst, the diffusion of nuclear technology, encouraged by the fear of energy shortage, has sharply increased the likelihood of the proliferation of nuclear arms and hence the necessity for devising new means for curbing the spread of such weapons.\n172.\tSecondly, in the turbulent political atmosphere of our region the introduction of nuclear weapons not only cannot be discounted, but would represent the most dangerous aspect of nuclear-weapon proliferation. It would gravely complicate prospects for peace and security in the region.\n173.\tIt is for these reasons that we once again draw attention to the necessity for serious international action. We are most pleased that, as an outcome of the request by Iran and Egypt, a resolution was adopted last year with near unanimity which included the positive votes of all the permanent members of the Security Council [resolution 3474 (XXX)].\n174.\tWhile the entry of nuclear weapons into conflict areas represents the more virulent facet of nuclear proliferation, other aspects of the problem should not escape our attention. The basic truth that must not be forgotten is that the problem of proliferation, in essence, is a ramification of the existence of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the great Powers.\n175.\tWhile some of those Powers display a remarkable interest in curbing the spread of nuclear weapons, there is no matching willingness on their part to check what, in the parlance of arms control, has come to be known as vertical proliferation.\n176.\tNo doubt we see merit in the agreements concluded in the context of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks as a means of promoting detente and bringing further stabilizing effects to bear on the strategic relations of the USSR and the United States. We find, nevertheless, that the exorbitant ceiling placed on the number of strategic delivery vehicles and the excessively high threshold agreed upon for nuclear weapon tests codify, rather than curb, the nuclear arms race.\n177.\tMy country, which was selected last year to serve in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and is an active participant in the Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference, will continue to work actively towards the attainment of the vital objective of general and complete disarmament.\n178.\tBut, while this objective has not been attained and in the absence of alternative means for guaranteeing the security of States, countries find no other recourse than to devote attention to the requirements of their own security.\n179.\tWith respect to the Indian Ocean, my country has consistently stressed the necessity for keeping this area free from great-Power rivalry and competitive arms build-up. The safety of the trade routes and maritime passages is of vital importance to all the countries of the region. It was with this paramount concern in mind that we joined in the efforts of other littoral States of the Indian Ocean to establish a zone of peace in the region.\n180.\tCo-operation among the countries of the region themselves to promote the security and prosperity of the region would greatly enhance the chances of achieving the objective of a peace zone by eliminating the rationale for the presence of outside Powers, a presence which historically was based on the need to ensure safe and secure passage for trade. It is the prospect of such an outcome that enables us to look encouragingly at the proposed conference of littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean.\n181.\tAmong the important events of this year in the framework of the United Nations I should like to mention the World Conference of the International Women's Year. The two major documents adopted by the Conference the World Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Women's Year and the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and their Contribution to Development and Peace, 1975 represent a landmark in the history of the liberation of women, setting out principles and offering Governments clear guidelines as to the measures needed fully to integrate women into society.\n182.\tAnother great international event which took place this year was the holding of the seventh special session of the General Assembly, devoted to development and international co-operation. There is hardly any need to emphasize the importance of the resolution which was unanimously adopted at the end of the session on 16 September. This document came a year after the adoption of the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)] as well as the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)]. The specific measures which are aimed at achieving the over-all objective of the new international economic order, though modest, represent in principle a first step towards eliminating the disparity between the developed and the developing countries and increasing the capacity of the latter to pursue their development individually and collectively.\n183.\tWhile welcoming the resolution and hoping that the constructive exchange of views which took place will be conducive to the opening of a new era in international relations, one may be allowed to express doubts that some of the industrial countries will ever act on their promises at the United Nations. Doubts are especially justified since, immediately after the session, voices were raised against the third-world countries by some representatives from the industrial world who had pledged themselves to the cause of development.\n184.\tIn this respect it is surprising that since the closure of the special session some factions from the industrial world have continued to attempt to place the blame for the current economic crisis on OPEC and have gone so far as to threaten to act jointly with their allies to break the grip of the oil-producing nations on energy prices.\n185.\tIn this respect, the truth has been repeatedly explained by OPEC members. On our part, in the past two years, we have on a number of occasions presented figures demonstrating that an artificially low oil price had been maintained for almost a quarter of a century before 1974. During that period of time, our countries had been plagued more and more by the spiraling inflation in the industrialized countries.\n186.\tYet the oil polemic has become more stubbornly partisan in recent months. Our critics seem to have forgotten or overlooked the fact that the adjustment in oil prices was in response to this high rate of inflation and that such adjustment contributed only insignificantly not more than 2 per cent to the rising prices, while the cost of the goods imported by oil-producing countries from the industrialized world rose by an average of 35 per cent.\n187.\tOur critics are complaining about the so-called \\\"unilateral\\\" fixing of the prices by a \\\"cartel\\\". Shall we remind them that all major manufactured products in the advanced countries are priced through unilateral decisions. Even with regard to food, upon which the survival of man depends, the agricultural policies of the major exporting countries have very often consisted in maintaining high prices through limited production with a view to avoiding, as they say, undesirable surpluses which might depress the market. They object to the exercise of our sovereign rights over our natural resources, even though in the past they spared no effort to justify the unilateral price-fixing of their major oil companies and refused to call it a cartel action. They preach that no country or group of countries should have exclusive power in the areas basic to the welfare of others, even though they themselves took unilateral decisions in recent years that shook the very foundations of the world monetary system, at the expense of many other nations. They do not miss any opportunity to lament over the plight of the poorest countries. Yet at the height of their prosperity, based mainly on cheap energy, they constantly avoided contributing significant and adequate assistance to the poor. A few days ago, at the seventh special session, they even declined to undertake to try to bring their official development aid up to the very modest target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product by 1980.\n188.\tIn contrast, in 1974 alone the oil-producing countries granted over 2 per cent of their gross national product to the non-oil-producing countries. In the case of Iran, our foreign aid, bilateral and multilateral, was close to 6 per cent during the same period.\n189.\tMoreover, on the initiative of my Sovereign, the representative of Iran in the current ministerial meeting of OPEC at Vienna is proposing the creation of a special fund to help the least-developed nations, irrespective of the willingness of the industrial countries to accept a matching share in this undertaking.\n190.\tThe truth of the matter is that adjustment in oil prices was in response to the high rate of inflation in the industrialized countries, and to the prices of manufactured goods, many of which went up by more than 300 per cent in recent years. Moreover, economic realities dictate that oil prices should be in line with the cost of producing alternate sources of energy. Under the circumstances, and taking into account the continuing rise in the inflation rate which is eroding the purchasing-power of the oil-producing countries, a readjustment of petroleum prices has become an economic necessity.\n191.\tLet us not confuse the issues, The real question is not the price of oil, which is used only to hide the fundamental problem. The question is whether or not the industrial nations are ready to co-operate with others in shaping a new and just international economic order which would benefit the developed and developing nations alike.\n192.\tThe OPEC members have shown their goodwill by freezing oil prices until September 1975, and have expressed time and again their willingness for cooperation through dialog with consumers. They went to Paris last April with that aim in mind. And now they have agreed to return to the same conference table. It is now up to the industrial nations to show their goodwill.\n193.\tThe unanimous adoption of a set of measures in favor of developing countries by the seventh special session is the first step towards a new era in international economic relations. But our expectations will have to be put to the test at the Paris discussions on energy and other raw materials.\n194.\tLet us hope that, unnecessary polemics apart, the industrialized countries will come to the realities of our present world and accept interdependence as a two-way road linking all nations, rich and poor.\n"

        "file_text": "117.\t It gives me pleasure to express to you, Mr. President, our sincerest congratulations on the occasion of your election as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. We wish you success in your post and are fully confident that your abilities and experience will allow us to produce fruitful results in our work. It also gives me great pleasure to praise the outstanding role played by your predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in directing the work of the seventh special session and the twenty- ninth regular session, which we can truly say were two of the most important sessions the United Nations has held in its history.\n118.\tI should like to express our appreciation and thanks for the sincere efforts which the Secretary- General is making to ensure the implementation of the principles of the Charter and the achievement of the goals of international life.\n119.\tIt gives us great pleasure to welcome three new Members to our Organization, namely Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe and Mozambique after the long and bitter struggle waged by their peoples against the colonialist occupation forces, as a result of which they were able to attain their freedom and to reassert their national independence. As we welcome the admission of these new, friendly States to our Organization, we look forward with confidence to the not- too-distant day when we shall be able to welcome Angola and Papua New Guinea to our Organization.\n120.\tPerhaps it would be appropriate here to mention the unfortunate negativism which has prevailed over the deliberations of the Security Council on the applications for admission to the United Nations submitted by the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam. The action taken by the United States for the second time to debar these two States and to obstruct their just demands to become Members of the United Nations is indeed deplorable. In spite of that, however, we are happy to see the legitimate Government of Cambodia take its seat here among us after a long and bitter struggle against the activities of foreign agents and foreign interference in that country's internal affairs.\nMr. Erdembileg (Mongolia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\n121.\tThe General Assembly is holding its thirtieth session in the light of positive political events in various parts of the world. One of these is the escalation of the armed struggle in Oman under the leadership of the popular democratic liberation front of Oman and its heroic struggle against foreign interference aimed at achieving national independence and sovereignty both for the people of Oman and for their territory. Another is its persistent opposition to the setting up of United States military bases on the island of Masirah, near Arab oilfields.\n122.\tI should like now to refer to the success of the liberation movements in Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia against world imperialism. Their great victory has proved to the world that the perseverance of the popular masses and their participation in organized armed struggle should be considered one of the most important demonstrations of bravery, confronting as they did the most powerful State in the world with its destructive weapons and armed forces.\n123.\tThe achievement of independence by the new African States after a long, bitter struggle, the escalation of the legitimate struggle of the people of South Africa and Rhodesia against racism and racial segregation and in favor of their legitimate rights, the down-fall of fascism in Portugal, have opened the way for national progressive forces to carry out their own national policy in the absence of aggressive pacts. The opposition of the masses against imperialist domination in South America, particularly in Puerto Rico, where the people are struggling for independence and the right to self-determination, the resistance of the people of Chile to military fascism there, and the emergence of Cuba from the imperialist blockade which was imposed on it all these important events bear witness to the fact that the balance of power is shifting against world imperialism. The current phase represents a progressive and victorious stage against oppression and foreign intervention.\n124.\tThe peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America are today winning great victories for independence and liberation, yet imperialism in its various forms obstructs their aspirations while imposing its policy on these territories and exploiting their natural resources. Military conquest and imperialism remain unchecked, acting either through States which are their agents such as Israel and South Africa, by deploying their intelligence machinery to overthrow progressive national forces or by mobilizing its cartels to tie down some of the developing countries by means of economic relations which could ensure their continued subservience, thus thwarting the aspirations of their peoples to independence and development.\n125.\tIn the Middle East the United States continues to support Israel with arms in its persistent rape of Palestine, thus making its people homeless; Israel's continued occupation of Arab territory; its repeated aggression in southern Lebanon and its barbaric bombing of Palestinian refugee camps. This is all done in pursuit of the mirage of destroying the political and material existence of the people of Palestine and imposing its own conditions on the Arab peoples. The continuous supply by the United States of arms to Israel sophisticated weapons including long-range missiles to persuade it to withdraw a few kilometers from the occupied territories is the reward of aggression and a source of bitterness.\n126.\tIsraeli insistence on occupying Arab territories since the June 1967 war is indeed a flagrant example of blackmail that is rejected by the international community, as is its continued support of the United States Government. My country strongly denounces support of Israel in any form by any country, and rejects the idea that the United States, as a supporter of Israel, is qualified to mediate in the Middle East question and not to rely on the principle of unconditional withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied after the June 1967 war and the exercise by the Palestinian people of their full national rights by setting up a secular Palestinian State. All such attempts are doomed to fail and will not bring peace to the area.\n127.\tThe PLO, which has recently been admitted to full membership in the non-aligned movement, is the sole legitimate representative of the people of Palestine. If the basic reasons for the conflict in the Middle East and the legitimate national rights of the people of Palestine are ignored, nothing can be achieved. Mean-while, Israel continues its maneuvers aimed at dividing the united Arab front and establishing its aggressive policy. The General Assembly at its current session must put an end to Israeli practices which are contrary to the Charter and violate its principles. We therefore ask that the strongest sanctions be imposed on Israel, including the suspension of its membership in the United Nations and its expulsion.\n128.\tIf Israel represents racism and coercion in the Middle East, then the two racist regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa, which practice racial segregation and racism, are preventing the black majority from exercising their legitimate rights in their own countries. We support the heroic struggle which the African peoples are waging against the racist minority regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa. The United Nations must face its historical responsibilities firmly and allow the people of Namibia to attain its independence and sovereignty. On more than one occasion my country has expressed its full support for the liberation movements throughout the world in their legitimate struggle for victory against colonialism in its various forms and against racism and imperialist hegemony.\n129.\tWith regard to Cyprus, we feel that the true way to solve the Cyprus question is through the liquidation of military bases and the evacuation of foreign forces. Then the parties concerned can start negotiations under United Nations supervision for the maintenance of the unity of the people of Cyprus and the strengthening of Cyprus so that it may follow a policy of non-alignment.\n130.\tIn spite of recent victories obtained in SouthEast Asia by the peoples of Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos, the Korean question is still attracting the attention of the world. The insistence of the United States on its continued presence in South Korea, providing that regime with arms and instigating aggression against the North, will only increase tension in that part of the world. Democratic Yemen supports the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its request for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea and its desire to bring about unity by peaceful means and have a united Korea admitted to membership in the United Nations.\n131.\tThe interest of the world is focused on disarmament and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. If this is not achieved, the threat to international peace and security will remain. We in Democratic Yemen like others in the developing countries welcome these new trends to put an end to and prohibit the use of nuclear weapons and explosives and to direct nuclear energy to the service of development, peace and progress. We support the convening of a world conference on disarmament; we also support all the pleas to establish nuclear-free zones in various parts of the world.\n132.\tMy country believes that the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] should include the regions bordering the Ocean and the islands within it. We should like to support the proposal that the Middle East be declared a nuclear-weapon free zone and to ask that the prerequisite for signing a declaration to that effect should be a commitment to show goodwill and to implement it.\n133.\tThe General Assembly, at its twenty-ninth session, took a new step forward economically by adopting the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. It also took the resolutions and recommendations adopted at the sixth special session as a basis for understanding the prevailing trends in the world economic order. The restructuring of economic relations on the basis of co-operation and equity, while an attempt is made to seek economic independence and self-reliance in the national economy, will help considerably to alleviate the effects of the economic crisis.\n134.\tEconomic integration and co-operation among the developing countries, particularly those countries which export energy and raw materials, are indeed important. We should like to note the recent trend towards isolating the countries producing oil and other raw materials and linking them to the capitalist economy, while making full use of their natural resources and exploiting them. The developing countries must be alert to and stand up to these neo-colonialist methods that seek to destroy their unity and exploit their resources and natural riches.\n135.\tThe loftiest ideal to which our peoples aspire is the strengthening of the foundations of justice, peace, prosperity and fruitful co-operation. We sincerely hope that the General Assembly, at this thirtieth session, will justify our confidence and the aspirations of our peoples to the attainment of these sublime human principles.\n"

        "file_text": "\n129.\t  It gives me great pleasure to express to the President, on behalf of the Government and people of the State of Kuwait, heartfelt congratulations on his election as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. His election is a tribute to the high status he enjoys in international circles as a statesman with wide experience. I wish him great success in guiding the proceedings of the present session. I want, too, to pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the President of the twenty-ninth session and the seventh special session, for the wise and effective manner in which he presided over their deliberations.\n130.\tI should also like to commend the efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, to strengthen the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security, as well as his concern for the problems of the developing countries, for which he deserves our appreciation and thanks.\n131.\tThe previous regular session yielded many tangible results in the field of disarmament and other fields, including the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. However, we cannot evaluate the role of the United Nations on the basis of the decisions adopted by its principal organs because a wide gap still exists between the adoption and the implementation of United Nations resolutions. It is a cause for great satisfaction that the Assembly at its seventh special session was able to examine the obstacles which hinder the establishment of the new international economic order, agree on a plan of action and approve\nthe measures necessary to put the provisions of the new order into effect. I should like to commend the constructive spirit which permeated the negotiations between the various geographical groups during that session. Though many of the measures agreed to are inadequate to fulfill the aims of the new order, we welcome them as a first step in the right direction leading to increased co-operation among States in trade, industry, science, technology and other fields of economic activity. The developed countries bear a heavy historic responsibility for achieving these goals and taking the necessary political action implicit in these decisions. No excuses will be accepted in the future for failing to discharge responsibilities and obligations that are prerequisites for the establishment of a new international economic order.\n132.\tWe attach particular importance to the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at its fourth session, which will follow up the work of the seventh special session and continue the dialog between the developing and the developed countries. We also welcome the efforts of our Organization to solve the worsening population problems of the world, provide multilateral food aid, extend emergency assistance to victims of drought and natural disasters, and organize programs to protect the human environment. Such activities had humble origins and are being steadily expanded to meet the needs of our new international community, which is based on interdependence. Naturally this requires concerted efforts by all nations to find common solutions to international problems.\n133.\tI should like to commend the efforts of the non-aligned countries and the developing countries to make basic changes in the present international systems. If one reviewed the major developments in the United Nations during the past three decades one would realize how much our Organization is indebted to those countries. The declarations adopted by the non-aligned countries and the developing countries during the past months in several conferences held in Algeria, Lima, Dakar and other capitals, clearly reflect the effective role they play in eliminating the remnants of colonialism, putting an end to unfair economic and social conditions, preserving spiritual and human values, solving problems posed by the danger of nuclear confrontation, achieving more democratic international relations and eliminating causes of tension which afflict mankind as a whole The effectiveness of these countries was enhanced by the logic of universality in United Nations membership, which is inescapable for any organization that aims at maintaining world peace and security and at promoting world prosperity and the advancement of mankind.\n134 I should like to take this opportunity to welcome the admission of the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe to membership in the United Nations, which is a new victory for the principle of universality and a major contribution to {he effectiveness of the United Nations. We hope hat transition to independence in Ango a will take place n the peaceful and orderly manner in which its sister States have achieved independence in spite of the internal dissensions created by some foreign interests.\n135.\tKuwait supported the applications of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam for membership in the United Nations because it believes that the two countries satisfy the requisite conditions for membership. We hope that the hurdles placed in the path of their admission will be removed, especially after the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 3366 (XXX) by 123 votes to none. Though we uphold the principle of universality in the United Nations, we should like to explain that this only applies to countries which adhere to the Charter, respect its principles and comply with its provisions. There are Member States within our Organization which have violated the Charter, disregarded its principles and flouted its provisions and yet remain Members, I should like to appeal to the international community to put an end to these violations by imposing prohibitive sanctions, including expulsion, so as to compel such countries to respect the will of the international community.\n136.\tThe endeavors of our Organization to improve i ts work in response to the demands of the non-aligned and developing countries were successful in all the principal organs with the exception of the Security Council. Because of lack of great Power unanimity, the Security Council was unable to apply the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter which empowers the Council to take the necessary measures to maintain or restore international peace and security even if that requires complete or partial interruption of economic relations and means of communications, the severance of diplomatic relations and the use of armed forces. In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [Al10001IAdd. 1] the Secretary-General admitted that the Council was not able to discharge its primary function and apply the system laid down in the Charter in an adequate manner. Instead, the Security Council evolved a procedure of decision by consultation and consensus which made the parties to a dispute the main factor in reaching a settlement. It is therefore our view that the Security Council has not been able to act in the manner prescribed in the Charter and is content, on the rare occasions in which it deals with questions of international security, to apply procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes without enforcing the measures provided for in the Charter to compel recalcitrant States to respect the wishes of the international community. It is our belief that so long as the Council maintains this attitude its prestige will be undermined and small countries will remain victims of force and aggression.\n137.\tConditions in the Middle East will continue to oscillate between war and truce and the region will remain in a state of constant turmoil until the problem is solved correctly and soundly at the root. The principal problem lies in the displacement of the people of Palestine from their land and the occupation of their homeland by world Zionism, which has colonized Palestine and deprived the rightful owners of the land of their right to self-determination and independence.\n138.\tPeace will not be achieved in the Middle East as long as the people of Palestine remain deprived of the most elementary rights enshrined in the Charter and in numerous resolutions adopted since 1948, the latest of which was General Assembly resolution 3236\n(XXIX), which reaffirmed the inalienable human and national rights of the people of Palestine.\n139.\tLikewise, a just and lasting peace will not be achieved in the Middle East unless there is full respect for the principle enunciated in several resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, which is in fact a corner-stone of the Charter and which emphasizes the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and calls for the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories. I wish to emphasize a truth that cannot b\u00ab concealed: that unless the original sin which was perpetrated against the Palestinian people is corrected by the restoration of its inalienable human and national rights there will be no just or lasting peace in the Middle East.\n140.\tAny step which is taken with respect to the conflict in the Middle East must be measured by its ability to deal with the roots of the problem, namely, the tragedy of the Palestinian people. Kuwait bases itself on the Charter, which stipulates that the territories of others shall not be acquired by force and calls for complete and unconditional withdrawal by any aggressor a principle which has been reaffirmed in repeated resolutions adopted by the General Assembly since 1967 with respect to the conflict in the Middle East. Accordingly, any Israeli withdrawal from Arab lands must not be subject to any conditions.\n141.\tWe have been following with concern Israel's efforts to extort from the United States, as a condition of its limited withdrawal in the Sinai, extensive financial, petroleum, diplomatic, political and military commitments. The totality of American commitments to Israel constitutes an ominous precedent; it strengthens Israel's determination to resist withdrawal from the other occupied Arab territories, hardens its intransigence regarding its territorial expansion and fosters in Israel a conviction of being immune to any measure aimed at compelling it to make further withdrawals.\n142.\tIsrael's acquisition of modern sophisticated weapons will lead to the escalation of the arms race in the region and raise the level of destructiveness of future warfare in the region. These arms which will be given to Israel will only aggravate tensions in the region, increase the elements of instability and prompt the Arab States to seek new weapons to avert the anticipated dangers.\n143.\tIn resolution VIII adopted at Lima the non-aligned countries stated that they were convinced that the time had come to apply sanctions against Israel because it persisted in its refusal to implement United Nations resolutions and in its violation of the Charter [jee Al 10217 and CorrJ, annex]. Kuwait maintains that the time has come for adopting punitive measures against Israel, such as the imposition of economic sanctions and expulsion from the United Nations, in view of Israel's record of violation of the Charter, its failure to implement United Nations resolutions and its exacting a price for its aggression and for the dispersion of the people of Palestine.\n144.\tThe recent Israeli aggression against the Al-Ibrahimi Mosque in the City of Al-Khalil constitutes a danger to Islamic sanctuaries and religious rituals respected and practiced by all Moslems in the world. This flagrant violation, in addition to the desecration of Holy Places in Jerusalem and the annexation of\nArab places by Israel, is not only a flagrant violation of United Nations resolutions but also a challenge to the feelings of the Moslems and the very bases of this Organization. Therefore we request the imposition of stringent measures against the perpetrators of these acts, who have defied United Nations resolutions without punishment by the international community.\n145.\tThe international political climate and disarmament are closely interrelated. I have previously welcomed detente and the improvement in the relations between the big Powers, the latest manifestation of which was the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which we hoped would have a positive influence on solving problems created by the cold war and various other international problems. It seems that detente was not sufficient to end the arms race and lead to speedy measures for more general and complete disarmament. In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General said the following:\n\\\"In a world increasingly preoccupied with the problems of social justice, hunger, poverty, development and an equitable sharing of resources, global expenditures on armaments are approaching $300,000 million a year. Never before in peacetime has the world witnessed such a flow of weapons of war. Some $20,000 million worth of arms are now sold annually in the international arms trade.\\\" [Al 100011Add.1, sect. VUL]\nThat paragraph is of special significance as it shows the close relationship between disarmament and social and economic development. We believe that lavish expenditures on arms have a marked effect on the deteriorating social and economic conditions in the world today, including world inflation, and may partially account for the reluctance of some developed countries to provide financial, economic and technical assistance to developing countries. Natural and human resources in the world are very scarce and in any case are insufficient to develop and improve weapons of mass destruction while at the same time providing food, clothing and other necessities to peoples. Hence disarmament has become a complex matter which transcends political relations among the big Powers; it includes economic problems in developed countries and their impact on economic and social development plans in the developing countries,\n146.\tWhile speaking of disarmament, may I reaffirm the support of my Government for the proposal to hold a world disarmament conference. Kuwait has sponsored this idea because it firmly believes that disarmament is a matter that equally concerns all countries, big or small. Disarmament negotiations were not successful in the past because they were conducted in the form of a dialog between the two super-Powers. We believe that the conference should be mindful of the incontrovertible fact that foreign occupation, colonialism and apartheid sow the seeds of conflict and compel small nations to purchase arms for use in the struggle to eliminate those evils. The conference cannot succeed unless all countries take part in it, including the nuclear Powers themselves. The agenda of the conference should be comprehensive enough to include questions not broached by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament,\n147.\tFrom the outset Kuwait supported the call for declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. The countries of the Indian Ocean have been affected in the past by the conflict between the big Powers and the division of the world into spheres of influence .through the establishment of military bases and the conclusion of, military pacts to promote the designs of the big Powers. I should like to proclaim today my Government's support for the proposal to hold a conference in the near future to study the prospects of concluding an international agreement to make the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. I should, therefore, strongly object to all attempts being made to establish military bases in certain islands of the Indian Ocean and any facilities that may be extended to the big Powers which may be of value to them in their political and military conflict. We believe that the conference cannot succeed without the support of the big Powers and the major maritime users of this ocean. A long time has elapsed during which it has been possible to study this matter in all its aspects and prepare the necessary studies; the time has now come to make progress towards concluding an agreement binding on all countries concerned.\n148.\tWe have closely observed the work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction since it was first established and we felt sure that its preparatory work had sufficiently advanced to ensure the success of the United Nations Third Conference on the Law of the Sea. Though the Conference has held more than one session, it has not yet been able to conclude the desired comprehensive agreement the chapters of which will encompass all aspects of the law of the sea and reflect new developments in international society and express the will of States which were not allowed to take part in the process of international legislation in the past. The agreement should also include the new regime which would be applied in the area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction that has been declared the common heritage of mankind as a whole. The process of negotiation is very slow and the major maritime Powers still adhere to obsolete texts and seek to take advantage of their advances in the field of science and technology to deprive the developing countries of their legitimate rights to the resources of the area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. This abnormal situation cannot continue because disputes arise frequently between States over such questions as fisheries, pollution and the resources of the continental shelf. These matters cannot be resolved by unilateral declarations; multilateral agreements are still the main instrument of international legislation. We hope that the next session of the Conference will reflect a true political will on the part of the major maritime Powers to meet the wishes of the developing countries and implement the provisions of the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof, beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction [resolution 2749 (XXV)}.\n149.\tPortuguese colonialism in Africa ended as a result of the struggle of the peoples who were living under Portuguese rule and thanks to the role played by the developing countries and the United Nations. The victory achieved by African countries which formerly lived under Portuguese occupation should be\nan incentive to the international community to support, morally and materially, the struggle of the people of Namibia for freedom and independence. It should also strengthen the determination of the international community to take effective measures against South Africa, which has disregarded the wishes of the people of Namibia and our international Organization and has ignored the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice through its continued occupation of Namibia.\n150.\tThe policy of apartheid pursued by the minority regime in South Africa, which was condemned by the United Nations, is still a challenge to peace and security in Africa and the world at large and a violation of fundamental human rights and the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The racist minority regime in Rhodesia also constitutes a violation of fundamental human rights and the principles of the Charter. It is therefore our duty to do our utmost to put an end to this abnormal situation both in South Africa and in Rhodesia. The cause of freedom is an integral whole; so long as there is one oppressed people in any part of the world, peace and security will remain a far-fetched ideal.\n151.\tKuwait sincerely believes in regional co-operation among States; such co-operation helps to reduce tension in any part of the world in which it takes place. The countries of the Gulf believe in this principle and have taken definite steps to express it in a concrete form so as to promote stability in the Gulf and put an end to foreign interference in the affairs of the Gulf, which are the sole concerns of the States in that region. Kuwait believes that responsibility for the security and defense of the Gulf is a matter that should be shouldered by the countries of the Gulf themselves.\n152.\tKuwait believes in co-operation based on understanding and dialog. It thus attaches great importance to the Arab-European dialog, which started recently through the medium of the League of Arab States, The main aim of this dialog is to make use of the potentialities of the industrial countries of Europe for the benefit of the developing countries of the third world. We stress the need to organize the transfer of the resources of technology, capital, management and trade to the developing countries within the framework of the Arab-European dialog which we envisage as a manifestation of the new international economic order adopted during the sixth special session of the General Assembly. Hence the spirit of co-operation which has marked the dialog between the two parties is an integral part of the atmosphere which characterized the negotiations during the recent seventh special session. I should like to voice the hope that the Arab-European dialog will succeed because it offers great benefits for the developing countries and the European countries.\n153.\tThe ultimate aim of our Organization is to establish the rule of law in all activities of the international community. The essence of the ideal of the rule of law lies not in technical law as such, although that is of major importance, but rather in the supremacy of certain ethical convictions, certain rules of decency prevalent in the community, and in the psychological fact that those who are at the apex of power share those convictions and feel bound to conform to them.\n\n"

        "file_text": " Mr. President, it gives me pleasure to convey to you our congratulations on the occasion of your election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. We wish you every success in fulfilling your task and express our confidence in your ability to guide the Assembly at this session towards the result expected from it.\n2.\tI should also like to commend the efforts of your predecessor, our colleague Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in presiding over the last regular session and the seventh special session and guiding them to the success they achieved. I should not let this occasion pass without noting with deep appreciation the sincere endeavors of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, to uphold the principles of this Organization and to attain its objectives.\n3.\tIt is also a pleasure to note that this session has witnessed a positive event in the admission of a number of newly independent States to membership in the United Nations: they are the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the People's Republic of Mozambique. The admission of these young States indicates that the long-standing gap between the principle of the universality of the Organization and its limited reality has begun to narrow with the withdrawal of the forces of colonialism and the emergence of the new countries of the third world which have gained their freedom and independence after a long and arduous struggle. In welcoming the new Members, my delegation wishes to assure them of Iraq's readiness to co-operate with them within the United Nations and outside it.\n4.\tWhile we note this positive event, we cannot but remember the regrettable fact that there are other States still deprived of membership in this Organization. It is a source of disappointment and bitterness that the United States of America should resort to the use of the veto to defeat the equitable application of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam for membership in the United Nations. On the other hand, we are pleased to see the legitimate Government of Cambodia occupying its rightful seat in the United Nations.\n5.\tThe thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations provides us with an opportunity to look in retrospect at the distance covered by the international community over the last three decades, at its successes and its failures. Thirty years after the signing of the Charter of the United Nations one must make an appraisal that will determine the areas of success as well as of failure in order to arrive at a deeper understanding of the world's problems and to mobilize collective efforts towards solving them. The world that we inhabit is indeed characterized by violent upheavals, complexities, and conflicting interests, in spite of which the United Nations has achieved a fair measure of success in meeting the world's problems and in comprehending its vicissitudes. The United Nations has also remained, in the view of all States, the appropriate and acceptable instrument for the treatment of deep-rooted problems, as it has remained the greatest hope for the creation of a world in which justice, peace and prosperity will prevail.\n6.\tThe Secretary-General's introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [AllOOOllAdd.l] contains a comprehensive survey of the Organization's work during the recent period of its existence, obviating all that which may be said in this field.\n7.\tWhile we recognize the United Nations' numerous achievements which are deserving of praise, we must also refer to the dangerous problems still threatening mankind with dire peril. First and foremost among those perils are the problems which concern the maintenance of international peace and security.\n8.\tIf the steps taken towards international detente  the victory of the peoples of Indo-China, the dissolution of colonialism in the African continent, the United Nations conferences on population, food, the law of the sea, International Women's Year, the non-aligned conference, and the dialog between the developed and the developing countries within the framework of the United Nations if, as I say, all these events represent an aspect of positive developments in the international situation since the end of the last session, there are still certain negative factors which pose dire threats. In the forefront of these problems directly affecting international peace and security, is the question of Palestine.\n9.\tThe question of Palestine is a flagrant example of settler colonialism and perhaps one of the most blatant cases of injustice in the history of mankind. It is without any doubt the problem of a people whose land was usurped and which was exiled by the brute force\nA/PV.2359\u2003\nof foreign invaders who had come to establish in that land a racist regime with the support of the forces of imperialism led by the United States of America. The General Assembly adopted its famous resolution 3236 (XXIX) affirming the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine in Palestine, including its right to self-determination, independence, and sovereignty, and the right to return to the homeland from which it was expelled. In spite of the fact that nearly a year has elapsed since the adoption of that important resolution, the Zionist forces of occupation in Palestine continue their occupation of the Arab land and continue to deny the rights of the Palestinian people in defiance of the will of the international community. What should be a cause for censure and firmness is the Zionists' persistence in defying the relevant United Nations resolutions and in implementing a policy of aggression and expansionism aiming at the creation of new political facts transcending the question of Palestine and the rights of the Palestinian people. The Zionists have even resorted to mass killings in order to exterminate the Palestinians, but the will of the Palestinian people and its determination to persevere and to continue in its struggle are stronger than all the attempts made against its very existence  such as barbaric air attacks on refugee camps killing thousands of unarmed, innocent refugees.\n10.\tThe sanguinary tragedy that has been the lot of the people of Palestine for the past 28 years, the scenes of which are being enacted in full view and within earshot of the world, is, above all, the responsibility of the United Nations. It was the General Assembly that voted for the partition of Palestine in 1947 [resolution 181 (II)] in contravention of the provisions of the Charter and the terms of its mandate. Acting under the pressure of the colonialist forces led by the United States of America, the United Nations thereby deprived the people of Palestine of its right to self-determination and turned it into a nation in exile. It is in the light of these facts that the significance of the General Assembly's resolution concerning the rights of the people of Palestine [resolution 3236 (XXIX)] adopted at the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, becomes evident.\n11.\tDuring the last quarter of a century, the world has witnessed radical changes in the political structure of States. These changes were reflected in the United Nations and were responsible for the initiative taken towards finding a settlement based upon the rights of the Palestinian people and its legitimate struggle. The resolutions of the United Nations, in spite of their importance, are not sufficient in themselves as remedies for a problem which threatens international peace and security. These resolutions must be accompanied by actions which will guarantee their implementation. Hence, the implementation of the provisions of the Charter with regard to Israel, including its expulsion from the United Nations, would constitute the right approach towards the desired settlement of the problem, and the international community will thus have taken a positive step towards rectifying the error it had committed. Within this context, the Government of Iraq reaffirms anew its unswerving determination to continue the struggle, together with the Palestinian people and the Arab nation, in order to liberate the Arab lands from Zionist aggression and to restore to the people of Palestine their inalienable rights.\n12.\tAmong the problems that are still threatening international peace and security is the increasing pace of armament in the world. The arms race, particularly that of nuclear weapons, poses an enormous threat to the future of mankind if no comprehensive and drastic solution is arrived at. In spite of the limited progress achieved in controlling strategic nuclear arms and bacteriological weapons, our world is still in desperate need of regional and international measures to limit the arms race, to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and to limit the use of atomic energy to peaceful purposes only.\n13.\tWe believe the success of endeavors to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons depends on the accession of all States Members of the United Nations to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXI 1), annex]. It also depends on the readiness of States possessing nuclear weapons to take effective and immediate measures to fulfill their obligations, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty, and to undertake not to resort to the threat of the use of nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear country. Iraq, as a party to the non- proliferation Treaty, finds that Treaty an indispensable instrument for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons under the present international circumstances. Iraq therefore also warmly supports the appeal of the Soviet Union to stop all nuclear testing, including tests held underground, and considers the Soviet initiative a considerable contribution to the strengthening of efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the creation of a suitable climate for the initiation of the process of general nuclear disarmament. Iraq also considers the proposals concerning the creation of nuclear-free zones in various parts of the world another effective means for making the whole world a nuclear-free zone. Iraq regards the General Assembly resolution concerning the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East [resolution 3263 (XXIX)] as a constructive preliminary measure. We believe that the way to the implementation of this resolution lies through the accession of all the parties concerned in the area to the non-proliferation Treaty.\n14.\tMy delegation considers with concern and denounces the American armaments plans with regard to Israel and the evolution of those plans which seek to make of Israel a nuclear Power that would dominate the Arab States. My Government considers non- alignment a basic pillar of its foreign policy. As those who pursue the policy of non-alignment have reacted positively to events and adopted a progressive approach which distinguishes between good and evil and does not equate the aggressor with the victim of aggression, and as they have in that policy paid serious attention to the problems of poverty and injustice in the world, the non-aligned policy has played an effective role in promoting international understanding and the beginning of the establishment of a world order under the rule of justice, freedom and peace. My country is honored to be an active member of the community of non-aligned States and, hence, we cannot but exert our utmost efforts for the consolidation of the foundations of the movement and its success. We attach special importance to the next conference of Heads of State or Government of non-aligned countries to be held at Colombo next year.\n15.\tIraq is part of the Arab nation, which suffers from the fragmentation initiated by colonialism and which has suffered and continues to suffer from injustice, aggression and exploitation. Iraq therefore believes in the unity of the Arab nation and struggles with all the means at its disposal for the realization of that unity in order to build a modern Arab society which would add to the strength of the progressive forces of the world. Taking this principle as a starting- point, Iraq stands by the side of the partitioned nations in their legitimate struggle to unify their countries, as it also stands on the side of all progressive and just causes in the world.\n16.\tThe Western Sahara area in Africa is undergoing developments that call for comment. We call upon the friendly Government of Spain to terminate its rule over the territories of Rio de Oro and Sakiet El Hamra, known as the Western Sahara, and this in agreement with the brotherly Governments of Morocco and Mauritania. We are confident that the Government of Spain will thus strengthen its ties of friendship with the Arab people which is bound to Spain by strong historical ties.\n17.\tOut of our belief in the peaceful settlement of international disputes, we express our satisfaction with the agreement we arrived at with our neighbor Iran. That agreement settled all the disputes which were pending between our two countries and which almost led to the outbreak of an armed conflict. The agreement which was declared at Algiers on 6 March 1975 has led to the delimitation of the land boundaries and their complete closure to clandestine traffic and saboteurs. The river boundaries were settled in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Baghdad and its protocols signed at Baghdad on 13 June 1975. Those agreements will open up new horizons for fruitful co-operation between the two countries, on the basis of reciprocal respect for sovereignty, and on the basis of their legitimate mutual interests. The agreements serve as an example of the renunciation of the use of force in the settlement of international disputes and respect for the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.\n18.\tThe termination of the war in Indo-China with the victory of the peoples of that area over colonialism and the collapse of the puppet regimes is an event of outstanding importance. It signaled the end of the policy of internationally policing the area and perhaps the end of that policy throughout the world. It has thus contributed to the strengthening of peace and stability in that part of the world. This accomplishment was achieved through the struggles of the people of Viet Nam and the people of Cambodia, for which they deserve our highest admiration.\n19.\tThere remains, however, next to that great positive achievement, the problem of Korea: another focus of tension in east Asia threatening peace and stability not only in that area but also in the world at large. Iraq calls for the withdrawal of foreign forces from the territory of South Korea in order to enable the Korean people to exercise its self-determination by itself without any foreign interference. We also support measures aiming at the unification of Korea.\n135\n20.\tIt is truly regrettable that colonialism should still survive to this day, despite all the efforts of the United Nations to eradicate this evil phenomenon. The African peoples continue their struggle in order to complete the liberation of the African continent from colonialism and racial discrimination. My Government therefore declares from this high rostrum our full support for the aspirations of the African peoples for unity, freedom from colonialism and final deliverance from the racist regimes. We pledge that we shall always remain by their side and co-operate with them with all the means at our disposal for the realization of their legitimate aspirations.\n21.\tSouth Africa's violations of the Charter of the United Nations and its constant defiance of the resolutions of its various bodies do not require any proof. In spite of the numerous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly confirming the right of peoples to defend their freedom and independence, in spite of the resolutions calling upon South Africa to end its illegal occupation of Namibia and to allow the people of Namibia to exercise its self-determination, South Africa continues to ignore those resolutions and to defy the will of the people of Namibia and of international public opinion. The acts of aggression committed by the South African regime and its persistence in its policy of apartheid towards the majority of the population, puts that regime in the same category as the Zionist regime, thus deserving expulsion from the United Nations.\n22.\tIn speaking of the liberation of the African peoples, we must commend the progressive approach adopted by the Portuguese Government to end its presence in its colonies. We must also praise the heroic struggle waged by the peoples of those territories for their freedom and sovereignty. We support the struggle of the African people against the racist regime in Southern Rhodesia and salute the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe to overthrow that regime.\n23.\tThe Government of Iraq follows with great interest the development of events in Cyprus, and wishes to reaffirm here its firm support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and the non-aligned status of the island. We sincerely hope that peace and understanding will be restored in Cyprus. We believe that it is incumbent upon the parties concerned, especially the Greek and Turkish communities, to make greater efforts to arrive at an agreement which will satisfy all parties and guarantee the legitimate interests of the two communities.\n24.\tIraq supports the policy of international detente and the substitution of constructive, positive relations for the policy of confrontation and cold war. It should be noted at the same time, however, that the policies of understanding between the great Powers should be in conformity with the right of peoples to independence, sovereignty and progress. Iraq also supports the proclamation of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.\n25.\tAllow me, finally, to refer to the effects of economic conditions on international relations. The great gap in the distribution of wealth and the continuing phenomena of exploitation and inequality in the exchange of trade are problems which, if not solved radically, can lead only to disruption of the international situation and threaten peace. Developing countries have endeavored for years, within and outside the United Nations, to rectify these conditions without any noteworthy success.\n26.\tThe resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its last special session [resolution 3362 (S-VII)] on the economic situation was a positive resolution although it does not satisfy all the expectations of the developing countries. What is required now is that the resolution be implemented in a positive spirit of goodwill.\n27.\tAs a developing country, Iraq declares its full support for the legitimate aspirations of the countries of the third world and strives with them, with all the means at its disposal and all its capacity, to implement that resolution and to make of it a beginning for the radical solution of the world's economic problems. We sincerely hope that the forthcoming negotiations at the Paris Conference will bear positive results.\n28.\tThose are some of the tasks of our Organization to which Iraq attaches great importance. Our delegation will undertake to explain its position on those subjects and other items of the agenda in greater detail in the various committees of the General Assembly. Iraq, which has always had faith in the United Nations and has always supported its endeavors, wishes further success for the Organization, for the benefit of all mankind.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t I should like first of all to extend to the President my sincere congratulations on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly. His election emphasized the democratic nature of this body which, in giving practical expression to the sovereign equality of Member States, chooses its leaders on the basis of individual merit, international stature and achievement. In assuring him of my delegation's unqualified support and cooperation, I wish him great success in his task of presiding over the deliberations of this session.\n2.\tPermit me also to express my appreciation of the skillful and dynamic leadership provided by his predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria, during the twenty-ninth session and the seventh special session, all of which gave rise to momentous and historic decisions. The great achievements and successes attained by our Organization during his tenure of office are not only a source of pride and admiration for the capacity of our Organization, but also a true reflection of the dedication, statesmanship and valuable contribution of that great son of Africa to the purposes of this world body.\n3.\tA heavy burden of responsibility lies on the Secretary-General and his staff because of the increasing scope and complexity of the work of the United Nations. My delegation joins whole-heartedly in the many expressions of appreciation for the complete dedication of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and the Secretariat as a whole, to the tasks connected with peace and progress.\n4.\tI wish to express also, at this stage, my Government's satisfaction with the continuing expansion and efficacy of the co-operation which exists between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity [OA U]. This co-operation has proved to be of immense value in all areas of development and it gives heartening and practical support to the campaign against racial discrimination and colonialism.\n5.\tThe accession of new States to membership in the United Nations brings us closer to the goal of universality. I am particularly happy to see the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the People's Republic of Mozambique take their places as States Members of the world body, after long years of struggle and sacrifice on the part of their valiant peoples. Their success is an inspiration to those still under colonial and racist domination and a warning to the minority regimes that they cannot long succeed in their efforts to suppress the forces of liberation.\n6.\tOn behalf of my Government, I take this opportunity to commend the Government of Portugal for having acted with determination, integrity and good faith in the fulfillment of its declared policy of promoting the speedy independence of those territories.\n7.\tWith regard to Angola, my Government shares the hope of the members of the OAU that the liberation movements which were able to fight with discipline and dedication against colonialism will use those qualities to settle their differences, call a halt to the fratricidal armed struggle and devote their energies to the attainment of the cherished goal of independence and the consolidation of national unity.\n8.\tIt is particularly important at this crucial stage in Angola's history that all outside efforts be directed towards the task of reconciliation and not towards purposes other than the achievement of independence, peace and security for the people of Angola.\n9.\tIn considering the problems of this troubled area it is well to remember that throughout history nations of all degrees of development have suffered the agonies of civil strife. The majority have emerged from such troubles with their nationhood strengthened and have gone forward with the task of national reconstruction and development.\n10.\tIt should have been possible for us to have welcomed, as full-fledged States Members of the United Nations, the representatives of the Republic of South Viet Nam and of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, had it not been for the opposition of\ncertain Powers in the membership of this Organization, My delegation must express its deep disappointment that the Vietnamese people, so long subjected to military aggression, are now the victims of diplomatic aggression. They have been unjustly denied membership in this world body a privilege which they clearly earned by their courageous struggle to recover their national independence and by the spirit of friendship and co-operation which they have shown to all States, in accordance with the principles of the Charter.\n11.\tIn this connexion, it is also pertinent to pledge our unqualified support to the people of Korea in their desire to attain peaceful reunification of their fatherland. We strongly believe that it is high time that this Assembly gave practical expression to the joint communique of South and North Korea of 4 July 1972, which, among other things, provided for the elimination of external forces and the attainment of the goal of national unity by the Korean people. It is within this spirit that we reaffirm the need to promote the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, so that the heroic people of that divided country can take their rightful place in the family of nations.\n12.\tIt is with great satisfaction that my delegation notes the presence of the representatives of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia. We have always recognized and supported that Government as the legitimate one and Prince Sihanouk as the Head of State of Cambodia. We extend our congratulations to the people of Cambodia for their brilliant achievements and extend to them best wishes for future success in the task of nation-building and social reconstruction. It will be our delegation's pleasure to listen to the address this afternoon of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, whose respected voice, though not heard in the United Nations lately, has nevertheless been raised on numerous occasions in the chambers of the third world and other international forums.\n13.\tIn recent years we have talked a great deal in the United Nations about interdependence and the need for global action but, at the same time, we have withdrawn more and more into the opposing camps of rich and poor, old and new; industrialized and developing nations with an increasing loss of mutual confidence and trust. Such divergence of our political attitudes is a glaring fact of our contemporary world which has of late overshadowed most of the major issues facing mankind and of direct concern to this world body. It has been evident in the effort to establish a new world economic order; it affects the Middle East question; it is a feature of the campaigns against apartheid, racial discrimination and colonialism, and its latest manifestation is the widely divergent and sometimes conflicting opinions about the nature and machinery of the world Organization itself.\n14.\tMy delegation sincerely hopes that the willingness shown by developed countries at the seventh special session to listen with respect to third-world voices, and the sympathy shown therefor, will crystallize into positive action not only to achieve the declared goals and objectives of a new world economic order but also to bring about just solutions to political and human rights problems involving peoples of the third world.\n15.\tThe effects of apartheid suffered by millions of Africans in South Africa and Namibia and the attempt to impose an apartheid-type of society on the people of Zimbabwe are, of course, of serious concern to independent African countries in particular, and to mankind as a whole. We had hoped that the virulent form of racial discrimination which flourishes in southern Africa had been unquestionably established as a crime against the conscience of the world and a crime against humanity. But attempts to use all the resources of the United Nations system in the campaign to eliminate the blot on our world civilization are labeled in some quarters as the irresponsible or unenforceable decisions of a mechanical majority, while the expressions of our indignation at the systematic dehumanization of our brothers is often dismissed as rhetoric.\n16.\tIn the face of our detractors' massive financial, economic, military and diplomatic involvement with South Africa we are asked to believe that it is only our methods that are questioned, not the substance of our protest.\n17.\tOur skepticism on this point is reinforced when we note the immediate outcry about and the diplomatic reprisals taken in regard to the recent execution of five convicted European terrorists in Spain. We cannot help but compare this reaction with the negative response to third-world efforts over the past decade to induce Member States to cut off diplomatic relations with the perpetrators of Sharpeville and the enforcers of an official terrorism which has taken the lives of countless Africans people whose only crime was to protest against intolerable and dehumanizing oppression. The deliberate misrepresentation of third- world actions is another negative approach calculated to sow seeds of mistrust and suspicion among Member States. A case in point is the misrepresentation of the General Assembly's use of its prerogative, at the twenty-ninth session, to reject the credentials of the South African delegation. That was an action taken only after repeated and solemn demands for an end to apartheid and to the illegal occupation of Namibia and, indeed, after 29 years of United Nations concern over and condemnation of South Africa's racist policies. In short, we see more indignation directed in some quarters against the campaign to end apartheid than against apartheid itself and that would seem to be an attitude that deserves our serious thought and attention.\n18.\tThe grave and tragic developments of the situation in southern Africa continue to increase in intensity and dimension. South Africa is still in illegal occupation of Namibia; its people are still subjected to apartheid and police-state terrorism; and the authorities are still attempting to foster elements long rejected by the Namibian people and to suppress the voices of their legitimate leaders.\n19.\tIt should now be apparent to all that Ian Smith has no intention of entering into negotiations leading to majority rule in Zimbabwe. Even pressure from the Vorster regime has not succeeded in moving him in the direction of a generally acceptable settlement. On their part the political leaders of the people of Zimbabwe need to close their ranks and continue their liberation struggle on a united front. Their present division and conflict can only weaken them and give their enemy the chance to exploit their differences in an effort to maintain the status quo. This strategy of the Smith racist regime and his supporters shall never be allowed to succeed.\n20.\tIn South Africa the staggering truth is that the majority of the people over 17 million of them are being made aliens in their own homeland by a racist minority of 4 million. They are being dispossessed of their own national heritage and forced into migrant labor encampments in a process ironically described as national self-determination. A few cosmetic changes and a few surface reactions to economic pressures cannot hide this grim reality.\n21.\tSuperficial peaceful overtones in the guise of detente cannot change the situation. Such a move is nothing but a tactical manoeuvre and a direct outcome of the political realities in southern Africa following the overwhelming victories scored by the liberation movements in the former Portuguese Territories and the subsequent emergence of the independent State of Mozambique and the forthcoming attainment of independence by Angola. The racist regimes are also confronted by international pressure and expressions of abhorrence against apartheid which have the cumulative effect of demonstrating the bankruptcy of racist rule in southern Africa.\n22.\tIt is clear to my delegation that only rigorous, consistent and uncompromising opposition to the minority regimes, only the full use of all the measures of coercion available under the Charter, and wide and generous support for the liberation movements can ensure progress towards the stated goals of the United Nations in southern Africa, namely, the elimination of apartheid and the liberation of the people of Namibia and Zimbabwe.\n23.\tMy delegation calls on all those States which have given little or no support in the past to the principles of the Lusaka Manifesto on Southern Africa, the Mogadiscio Declaration and the recent Declaration of Dar es Salaam to show a new spirit of understanding and co-operation towards the task of the liberation of southern Africa. We appeal particularly to the United States, now celebrating the bicentennial of the first successful war against colonial domination, to view the struggles of oppressed peoples today as a reflection of their own revolutionary struggle for freedom and independence. It is the duty of the United States Government to view the problem of Zimbabwe not in the light of economic interest, such as the supply of chrome and other raw material, but first and foremost in the context of the more serious and fundamental questions of human rights and universally accepted democratic principles of majority rule.\n24.\tIt is a matter of satisfaction to my delegation that in many territories across this planet the process of self-determination has taken place peacefully and in accordance with resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960. We congratulate the people of Papua New Guinea, who have already celebrated their independence, and look forward to welcoming them to membership in the United Nations. We also congratulate the Comoros on the achievement of independence. However, we must firmly state our concern that the people of that Territory be left to shape their future freely without any foreign pressure or interference which would tend to jeopardize their sovereignty and independence.\n25.\tWith respect to the political future of Seychelles, we are happy to note that a target date has been set for its independence and that the people of that Territory can now look forward to the attainment of their complete freedom in 1976.\n26.\tThe serious situation prevailing in French Somaliland is of particular concern to my Government. For far too long the people of that Territory have been denied the opportunity to exercise fully and freely their right to self-determination and independence.\n27.\tThe Somali Democratic Republic has always stated in no uncertain terms its firm adherence to the principle that the wishes, the true wishes, of the people of the Territory must constitute the paramount and fundamental basis of any arrangements for political change.\n28.\tThe Chairman of the Provisional Military Administrative Council of Ethiopia, in his address to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU held at Kampala this year, made a similar statement of principle. This was further echoed by the Ethiopian Minister for Foreign Affairs in his statement to this Assembly [2374th meeting]. The Somali Democratic Republic welcomes this forward-looking and positive approach by the Ethiopian Government. This is a significant move on the part of the Ethiopian Government and a step in the right direction. We trust that this declaration of intent will be given practical expression by the Ethiopian Government. In view of this development, the French authorities can no longer maintain that rival external claims could create a dangerous or unstable situation on the accession of the territory to independence.\n29.\tMy delegation took careful note of the statement of the French Minister for Foreign Affairs on 26 September 1975, when he said: \\\"France wishes to respect the decision of all Africans freely to determine their own destiny and to assume responsibility for their future under conditions of their own choosing.\\\" [2364th meeting, para. 43.]\n30.\tThe problem in the past with regard to French Somaliland has been that the procedure for the exercise of the right to self-determination was not chosen by the majority of the people. Such a procedure, which was laid down by the French Government, was, according to international opinion as reflected in the press reports on the last referendum, most undemocratic and colonially oriented, to say the least. The wishes of the people in French Somaliland have never been expressed in a free and democratic climate. If France is indeed true to a progressive policy ol respect for the right of self-determination, as the Foreign Minister has stated in the General Assembly, it should itself insist that the wishes of the people ot French Somaliland be respected and that unconditional independence be granted to the territory.\n31 Referring to the French Government's attitude towards African territories still under its colonial rule, the President of the Republic of Uganda and current Chairman of the OAU, Field Marshal Idi Amin Dada, in his recent address to this Assembly stated the following:\n\\\"In spite of France's negative attitude, the international community and OAU, in particular, have\nbeen more than patient with France on matters relating to the decolonization of its African Territories. It is time for France to reciprocate ...\\\" [2370th meeting, para. 99.]\nMy delegation fully agrees with President Amin in his aforesaid comment.\n32.\tBoth the OAU summit meeting at Kampala and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries held at Lima have reaffirmed their support for the struggle of the people of French Somaliland for national independence. My delegation is confident that the General Assembly will also call once again on France to grant unconditional independence to the people of the Territory in accordance with the principles of resolution 1514 (XV). We earnestly hope that France, which has played so notable a part in the historic process of decolonization in Africa, will not delay the granting of independence to the last of its African colonies.\n33.\tI turn now to the Middle East question, which has been confronting this world body almost since its inception. Any progress towards the settlement of this problem is to be welcomed. However, peace in the area will continue to be elusive until the rights of the Arab people of Palestine have been restored and until Israel withdraws from all Arab territory illegally seized in the war of June 1967. These prerequisites for peace have been reaffirmed repeatedly by international consensus and are provided for in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973. Twenty-seven years ago the General Assembly endorsed Count Folke Bernadotte's declaration with regard to the Palestinian people that the right of innocent people, uprooted from their homes by the present terror and ravages of war, to return to their homes should be reaffirmed and made effective.\n34.\tToday it is still necessary to redress the historic wrong done to the Palestinian Arabs who were forced into exile by a deliberate campaign of terror, the sole aim of which was to ensure the establishment and maintenance of an exclusive Zionist State, whatever the cost in terms of human suffering. The problem created then will not fade away and disappear. The Palestinian people have not, and never will, allow themselves to be swept off the stage of history in order that the supposed wrongs of a people lost in the mists of antiquity should be redressed. The Palestinians are not ghosts from the old past. They are physically with us today; we see their sufferings; we hear their anguished voices; we cannot, and should not, turn a deaf ear to their demands for justice.\n35.\tThe majority of States Members of the United Nations have reaffirmed, in resolution 3236 (XXIX), the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self- determination and to national independence and sovereignty. This is a position based on reality, on the logic of history and on established principles of human rights and international law. There is also majority support for the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] a decision which signifies recognition by the international community of the international status of the Palestinian people and which constitutes an essential step in the realization of their legitimate aspirations.\n36.\tIsrael's occupation of Arab territory since 1967 has provided another cause of conflict in the Middle East. This occupation contravenes the principle of international law, reaffirmed in resolution 242 (1967), that the acquisition of territory through aggression is illegal.\n37.\tThe extensive official Program of Jewish settlement in every area of occupied Arab territory, and in particular Jerusalem, amounts to annexation. These actions, together with the frequent violations of the human rights of the people of the occupied territories and the brutal acts of military aggression against neighboring civilian populations, are in flagrant contravention of international covenants and agreements and of the norms of international behavior.\n38.\tIsrael's long record of contempt for United Nations resolutions and the threat posed by its aggressive and expansionist actions to regional and international peace and security must be countered by firm international action. The United Nations cannot be true to its own principles and yet remain passive in this matter. A growing consensus of world opinion shares this view. The OAU summit meeting at Kampala, in a strong expression of Afro-Arab solidarity, and the Lima Conference of Non-Aligned States have both called on the Security Council to take all necessary measures, including those stipulated under Chapter VII of the Charter, to force Israel to desist from its obstinate course. My delegation trusts that all those who genuinely seek peace in the Middle East will join in the call on the Security Council to act in accordance with its responsibilities.\n39.\tWe believe, too, that in the case of Israel, as in the case of South Africa, the United Nations must consider its right, clearly set forth in the Charter, to suspend or remove from membership States whose grave and continued aggressions constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n40.\tAs my delegation has maintained on other occasions, universality is our cherished goal, but not at any price.\n41.\tBefore concluding my remarks on the Middle East I want to touch on a most dangerous development in that already explosive situation. I refer to the indiscriminate supply of arms and money to Israel, the aggressor in the Middle East, by the very State which purports to be working tirelessly for peace at the diplomatic level. More particularly, the Somali Democratic Republic and, I am sure, the overwhelming majority of Member States, find it inconceivable that the introduction of nuclear missiles could be contemplated by any State with a genuine wish for peace in that area. We trust that such action will not be taken, and that serious attention will be given to redressing the arms balance in the Middle East as an important step towards the ending of the arms race and the establishment of stability and security in the area.\n42.\tThe situation in Cyprus is another cause for international concern and poses another threat to international security. Last year, in his address to the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, the President of the Supreme Revolutionary Council,\nMajor-General Mohamed Siad Barre, referring to the Cyprus problem, said:\n\\\"In this connexion, we feel that all the parties concerned should meet under the auspices of the United Nations with a view to seeking ways and means towards an appropriate settlement. To restore peace and stability in the island, we should ensure that the Cypriot people should be left to determine their own political future.\\\"5\n43.\tIt is a matter of great satisfaction to my delegation that the problem has been entrusted to the Secretary-General, whose role and efforts hitherto have been most commendable. We are confident that the two communities in Cyprus will reach a negotiated settlement through the good offices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n44.\tThe United Nations has shown an exceptional capacity to respond to the needs of the world's peoples on a planetary basis. It has shown an overall concern for the development needs of the poor nations and established enterprises which deal with problems such as that of the world's population and its threatened environment. It continues to work towards the improvement of the health, living conditions and food supply of peoples. It has shown deep concern for the welfare of children, the hope of future generations, and wisely supported the fundamental social revolution aimed at raising the status of women and involving them in the processes of development.\n45.\tIt is a chilling thought that all those global activities and the individual efforts of the world's peoples to establish just, secure and productive societies are constantly endangered by the threat of a nuclear holocaust, and could be instantly obliterated by a single mistake or miscalculation in the deployment of the nuclear weapons of the super-Powers. I need not dwell on the shameful and unnecessary waste of resources which, instead of being applied to the maintenance of the balance of terror, could be better utilized to fulfil the urgent human needs of the world's peoples.\n46.\tThe smaller States and non-nuclear nations are engaged in a movement to create nuclear-free zones and zones of peace in order to protect their peoples, as far as possible, from the dangers of nuclear warfare. The movement has already had practical effect in Latin America. Its extension to Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, as proposed by many of the States of those areas, would provide a valuable contribution to international peace and stability. In addition, many non-nuclear States have already committed themselves to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], of which my country was one of the first signatory parties, in a sincere effort to make a contribution to world peace.\n47.\tThe nuclear Powers are now gravely concerned over the growing capability of smaller States to convert industrial atomic energy to military purposes, but those States have been given no incentive to preserve their non-nuclear status since there has been no significant progress in the much more fundamental and pressing problem of reducing the nuclear capabilities of the super-Powers. In this connexion we add our voice to those of the representatives of the third world in hoping that positive steps will be taken by all States, big and small, for the attainment of complete and total nuclear disarmament in the interest of world peace and progress, to which we are all committed.\n48.\tThe Somali Democratic Republic, an Indian Ocean State, has always supported and continues to support the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. We deplore the joint decision of Great Britain and the United States to establish on the island of Diego Garcia an American naval base which will be a center for the exercise and display of American military power in the area. That development can only escalate big-Power rivalry in the Indian Ocean, increase international tensions and undermine the purposes of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.\n49.\tMy Government fully endorses the proposal for a conference of littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean. Such a conference would give added weight and practical support to the principles of the Declaration on that important area, which constitutes one of the great maritime crossroads of the world.\n50.\tThe importance of economic issues in international affairs has been fittingly highlighted by two special sessions devoted to development and related questions. However modest the achievements of the seventh special session may have been, the atmosphere in which it was held provided a welcome sign that the relationship between the developing and developed countries can be based on dialog and co-operation rather than on conflict and confrontation.\n51.\tWhile my delegation is disappointed that the concept of a new world economic order is still viewed with reservations, and indeed with skepticism by some States, we welcome the fact that the seventh special session unanimously adopted a resolution [resolution 3362 (S-VII)] which incorporated the major principles of the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and of the Charter of the Economic Rights and Duties of States. It remains to be seen to what extent these principles and the measures proposed by both the developed and the developing countries can be translated into specific terms.\n52.\tImportant first steps have been taken in the form of specific proposals for the stabilization of export earnings, the liberalization of certain trade barriers and capital flow to developing countries for development investment. However, we hope to see progress on more fundamental questions, such as an integrated commodity scheme, the removal of non-tariff barriers and effective means for the transfer of real resources.\n53.\tMy delegation considers the measures proposed with regard to the world food situation to be of particular importance, and we are happy that high priority has been given to that question.\n54.\tWe also view with satisfaction the emphasis that has been placed on the special needs of the least developed of the developing countries, many of which, like Somalia, are prone to natural disasters that compound their development problems. My country has been affected for the last two years by a severe drought which destroyed a substantial part of the country's main source of export earnings, its livestock population. We have had to maintain more than a quarter of a million people in relief camps, apart from over half a million others who are being cared for outside the camps, and we have now embarked on a Program for the resettlement and rehabilitation of the drought- affected nomadic population. I should like to express in this forum the appreciation and gratitude of my Government to many countries for the generous assistance we have received, and also to the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who was instrumental in arranging the invaluable assistance we received through the United Nations system, especially through the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator.\n55.\tMy Government is faced with difficult tasks, but we have always taken pains to emphasize the need for national self-reliance, and the Somali people are involved at all levels with the work of resettlement and rehabilitation. We are confident that the national effort, together with continued international support, will enable us to meet successfully the challenges which face us.\n56.\tOne of the recurring items in the agenda of the General Assembly is the strengthening of the role of the United Nations with regard, inter alia, to the maintenance and consolidation of international peace and security. It will be difficult to determine the role of the United Nations unless there is a clear consensus  and there does not seem to be one at the present time about the very nature of the world body.\n57.\tSome would have us believe, for example, that the United Nations, which once took such authoritarian actions as the partition of Palestine and Korea, was never meant to be an organization which could intervene decisively to influence the course of events, and that it is merely a sounding board for international opinion.\n58.\tThe procedures established by the Charter for the conduct of the General Assembly are certainly those of a parliamentary democracy. But some States now maintain that decisions arrived at by majority vote are without value and that consensus is the only valid basis for United Nations action. It is difficult to know what we are to make now of controversial decisions of the past, such as the recognition of the State of Israel, which were forced through the General Assembly by narrow majorities. But of course it is not narrow majorities which cause so much concern today but large majorities, which is an unusual twist of the democratic ideal. There is a movement also to make the General Assembly reflect the elitist structure of the Security Council, as though the preponderance of power of that body were not already sufficient.\n59.\tSince the differences of opinion about the nature of the United Nations and the competence of its organs affect the way in which important issues are dealt with, it is important that there should be wide and open discussion and full and clear understanding of basic positions.\n60.\tProposals for constitutional change are already being considered by the Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter of the United Nations. It is of course essential that all serious proposals for changing the principles and procedures that guide the work of the United Nations should be directed through the proper channels. If it is proposed, for example, that majority vote should be completely replaced by consensus or that the General Assembly should no longer be master of its own procedures, then such fundamental aspects of the General Assembly's constitutional life can be re-examined. But these views cannot be stated as though they represent an existing reality or arrangements that can be simply brought about.\n61.\tWith regard to the review of the Charter, my Government believes that the Charter, in spite of its flexibility, is inevitably limited by the perspectives and the conditions that existed 30 years ago. It needs to be revised to reflect changing realities of the contemporary world. The Security Council, for example, no longer truly reflects the world's power structure. The centers of power have shifted since 1945 from some areas to other areas, from some nations to other nations.\n62.\tAnd we must ask what the power structure in the Security Council should represent today. Surely not the Second World War victory of the Allies over the Axis. Does the Security Council not have a duty, today, to be responsive to the will of the other 136 Member States which represent the vast masses of the world's peoples? Are these 136 States merely spectators while the big five alone are the actors which dominate the world stage? Are the 136 States Members to be forever subject to the whims of a group brought together and established in power by one of the accidents of history? These questions are pertinent in view of recent abuses of the power of the Security Council. The triple veto exercised over South Africa and Namibia and the one veto over Vietnamese membership raise the question of whether there should not be some mechanism to limit the use of the veto and establish a measure of accountability in the Security Council. It also raises the question of whether the Council should not be enlarged to reflect the new interests and attitudes of a major segment of our world civilization.\n63.\tI should like to emphasize that the United Nations is a living organism and like all living organisms must change if it is to preserve its vitality. The nations of the world have given the United Nations tremendous responsibilities for global organization. We must also give it the capacity to deal fairly and comprehensively with the new realities of our time. I am confident that we will take positive and practical measures in this regard.\n64.\tIn conclusion, I consider it most fitting and pertinent to quote a significant extract from the address of my President, Major-General Mohamed Siad Barre, then current Chairman of the OAU, at the twenty- ninth session of the General Assembly, which reads as follows:\n\\\"We still live in a world divided between rich and poor; a world where imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and racism\\\" and Zionism \\\"still exist in many of its parts; a world which is still under the threat of nuclear war; a world that is governed by economic systems which are unjust. I am sure that none of us has any illusions about the magnitude of these problems.\\\"6\n65.\tWhile we take note of the progress made towards peace and the relaxation of international tension and conflict in various areas of the globe, we are still confronted with most of the serious problems indicated by our President's address. I am confident that we have both the will and capacity to deal with these problems which constitute a major threat to inter-national peace and security. Wishful though it may sound to some of us, let us hope, however, that by the time the thirty-first session of the General Assembly is convened we will have witnessed the total eradication of the evils of colonialism and imperialism, we shall have shattered the day-dreams of the perpetrators of racism and apartheid, and we shall have eliminated the perils of Zionism, thus realizing some of the fundamental aims and purposes of our noble Organization.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\n109.\t I should like to extend to Mr. Gaston Thorn our warmest congratulations on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly. These congratulations are an expression of our appreciation of his outstanding personality, which enjoys our complete respect, and which will undoubtedly ensure the success of this session, owing to his wisdom and guidance. Our appreciation also goes to his country, which has a special standing in Europe. I need not remind the Assembly of my country's desire to consolidate and strengthen its relations with all the friendly countries of Europe, which we consider to be the source of modern civilization and technology from which the entire world has benefited. I need hardly say that the Yemen Arab Republic is desirous of developing friendly relations with all the countries of the world on the basis of mutual respect and equality, in an attempt to establish positive and fruitful cooperation that will lay the foundations for world peace and co-operation.\n110.\tI should like also to express our appreciation of the valuable efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in carrying out his major tasks with such great sincerity, for which we thank him.\n111.\tMy country would also like to extend a welcome to the three new States Members of our international Organization; their entry renders it more important and is one more step towards universality. On behalf of Yemen, I should like to congratulate the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and extend to them our sincerest wishes for a positive contribution to the work of the United Nations.\n112.\tThe twenty-ninth session and the seventh special session of the General Assembly marked a tangible turning point in international relations. The Palestinian people have regained some of their usurped rights. On the level of economic and constructive co-operation the special session achieved many of its objectives. That special session was convened on the initiative of the President of Algeria, Mr. Houari Boumediene, while the success of the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session was undoubtedly due to the efforts of his brilliant Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika who presided over the two sessions and won the appreciation and admiration of us all.\n113.\tThe present session is, like all sessions, dealing with many important topics. However, the Palestine cause is the focus of the attention of the Member States and of world public opinion as a whole because of the dangers inherent in that cause which threaten the Middle East and the entire world with a new explosion whose dimensions and effects it would be difficult to assess. It is well known that the land of the Palestinian people, who number nearly 4 million, is still usurped and that their legitimate rights are still trampled under foot. The majority of these people are suffering horrible repression under Israeli occupation,\nwhile others lead a life of misery in their own lands and in refugee camps scattered in neighboring countries. Still another segment of the Palestinian population remains dispersed inside and outside the area.\n114.\tIsrael, which has dispersed and removed the indigenous people by force from their land and which has usurped their property, continues to deny their rights, to prevent them from returning to their homes, trades and farms, to ignore their legitimate and recognized rights and to defy the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. You will recall that as a result of that defiance the Assembly, in resolution 3236 (XXIX), expressed particular awareness thereof, when it reaffirmed almost unanimously \\\"the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people in Palestine\\\", including its right \\\"to national independence and sovereignty\\\". The General Assembly also reaffirmed \\\"the inalienable right of the Palestinians to return to their homes and property from which they have been displaced and uprooted\\\".\n115.\tWe should also like to remind the Assembly that the relevant resolutions of the United Nations last year and in previous years recognized that the Palestinian people is a principal party to the search for a durable and just peace in the Middle East. In order to find such a durable and just settlement of the Middle East question we must give the Palestinian people its full national rights, because in addition to complete withdrawal from occupied Arab territories, this is the core of the problem.\n116.\tWe also note that the aforementioned resolution requested the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its thirtieth session on the implementation of this historic decision. My delegation will study this report and express its opinion as to the steps it is necessary to take in order to restore the rights of and redress injustice to a people for whose unhappy fate the entire world is responsible, because its present situation contradicts the elementary rules of justice as well as the mores and principles of the United Nations.\n117.\tWhat is applicable to the usurped rights of the Palestinian people is also applicable to the usurped lands of three States Members of the United Nations which since 1967 have been under military occupation. Israel continues to ignore and defy all the international resolutions requesting it to withdraw from the territories which it has usurped by force of arms.\n118.\tIt would be fitting for the international community to consider taking the deterrent measures provided for in United Nations documents in order finally to put an end to Israel's intransigence and defiance of United Nations resolutions.\n119.\tCan the Christian and Moslem worlds forget that the sacred city of Jerusalem is part of the occupied territories\u2014Jerusalem with all its sacred buildings, its history, the position it holds and the spiritual meaning it has in the hearts of millions of Christians and Moslems? Is it possible that Jerusalem should remain occupied or that the occupation of the indivisible parts of the territories of three sovereign States should persist, and that the rights of the Palestinian people, which have been recognized by the entire world, should continue to be ignored without such a position leading to an explosion that would impede any\neffort aimed at establishing a durable and just peace, thus threatening the whole region and the entire world with grave dangers?\n120.\tWe must refer on this occasion to the new, advanced, additional weapons which Israel is to receive and with which it will threaten the entire area, weapons capable of carrying nuclear warheads, weapons of mass destruction. I should like to point out that the provision of such weapons, the cost of which runs into thousands of millions of dollars, would encourage Israel to continue its occupation of Arab lands and to ignore inalienable and legitimate rights.\n121.\tI should like to repeat once more what has been said from this very rostrum by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kuwait. He said that \\\"The totality of American commitments to Israel constitutes an ominous precedent; it strengthens Israel's determination to resist withdrawal from the other occupied Arab territories ...\\\" [2368th meeting, para. 141]. This topic is one of great concern to the Yemen Arab Republic because it impedes the efforts that are needed to find a just solution, encourages the aggressor to cling to the fruits of his aggression and may further encourage Israel to continue the pastime of political blackmail it has specialized in, finding in the Zionist circles that support it a means of acquiring all it asks for, freely, unconditionally and without making any concessions.\n122.\tThis continued response to the Israeli policy of political blackmail at the expense of the national interests of others will deepen doubts and lead to great disappointments, The world, since the beginning of this year, has witnessed many conferences and meetings at various levels, and the policy of detente has made great strides forward thanks to the Helsinki agreement. My country, which believes in the benefits of international co-operation, has welcomed and contributed to many of these regional and international conferences such as the conferences of non-aligned countries. My country has also given particular attention to the noble and human task carried out by the Islamic Conference and we hope that that body will be able to participate in the activities of the United Nations as an observer.\n123.\tI am happy to state that my Government attaches particular importance to the agenda item concerning the strengthening of respect for the rules of international law in relations between States and the consolidation of the role of the United Nations in this respect because we uphold the principles of international peace and security, which should be respected to enable the entire world to enjoy stability and permit the developing nations to undertake the projects that are vital to ensure their rebirth and development. This development, which the Yemen Arab Republic is exerting every effort to carry out with the necessary speed and sincerity, is the target that our President, Ibrahim Al-Hamdi, has placed at the head of the list of national aspirations he is trying to fulfill. We also hope that the international community will be able to find ways and means to strengthen the role of the United Nations so that it may carry out its task of safeguarding and consolidating peace by obliging those who rebel against and defy its decisions to respect the rules and obligations of the United Nations and of international law.\n124.\tYemen joined the other countries of the third world at the Lima Conference. It also participated with great care and attention in the seventh special session of the Assembly, devoted to the search for a new world economic order built on justice and positivity. We welcome resolution 3362 (S-VII) adopted by the General Assembly at the end of the session, as well as the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which, if respected by the developed and rich countries, will bridge the gap that currently divides them from the developing States.\n125.\tI turn now to the subject of the law of the sea. When the General Assembly adopted its historic decision which, by its letter and spirit, declared that the sea-bed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction were the common heritage of mankind [resolution 2749 (XXV)], the international community took a courageous step forward. It was one of the most just and equitable decisions taken by the United Nations, in our view, because that was the first time since the inception of the Organization that a decision had been taken whereby 70 per cent of the earth would be subject to new and just concepts of equality for all with respect to rights and equitable distribution of resources.\n126.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic has shown great interest in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurdisdiction, as well as in the first, second and third sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Yemen adheres to the principle of the exercise of sovereignty over territorial waters on the basis of the just resolutions adopted by the African States and the non-aligned countries, all of which affirmed that principle to which we all adhere.\n127.\tOur adherence to the principle of innocent passage basically arises out of our recognition of the right of coastal States to exercise sovereignty over their under-water land, irrespective of whether there is an international waterway through their territorial waters. It is, of course, obvious that our acceptance of this concept does not mean that the coastal States have the right to impede the freedom of trade or other navigation on the contrary. However, military passage through territorial waters must be subject to conditions, some of which are nominal only, that give the coastal State the right to exercise its national sovereignty and the sense that it is doing so. Those conditions will, when necessary, enable it to ensure its peace and security.\n128.\tWe also consider that total ownership by the coastal States of mineral, fish and other resources of the economic zone, whether in the sea-bed, the ocean floor or the subsoil thereof, should be very clearly specified in the provisions of the law of the sea which is currently being elaborated. We are looking forward with great optimism and open-mindedness to the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to be held next spring. We shall welcome all opinions provided they do not deprive us of our right to exercise sovereignty over our territorial waters, wherever those coastal waters may be, and do\nnot hinder our freedom of exploitation in waters of our economic zone.\n129.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic was one of the countries which participated with great interest in the first, second and third sessions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD]. It continues to devote particular attention to that organization, because Yemen has felt optimistic over the future of UNCTAD ever since its establishment in 1964. Indeed, we consider it an excellent forum in which to draw up practical measures that may eventually narrow the gulf separating the rich, developed countries from the deprived, developing countries. In fact, UNCTAD has, during its three sessions, adopted positive and practical resolutions and, although its decisions have been implemented only partially to date, we feel that the advanced, rich countries will implement the resolutions already adopted and any subsequent ones, because a just distribution of wealth is in the common interests of all mankind; the rich cannot continue to exploit others ad infinitum.\n130.\tAmong the causes occupying the full attention of Yemen, its Government and people are the struggles for freedom and national independence, for the elimination of racial discrimination and for a decrease of spheres of influence. It is therefore my responsibility and duty to deal with the following issues. My Government wishes to express great satisfaction over the end of the cruel and bitter war that afflicted three Asian States, namely the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, the Republic of Viet Nam and Cambodia. We hope those three countries will be successful in rebuilding what has been destroyed by the war and healing its wounds. At the same time, we consider it necessary for the world as a whole to contribute to that noble human task.\n131.\tWe also firmly support the legitimate applications of the two Viet Nam for membership in the United Nations.\n132.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic has taken particular care to exercise its right to membership in the/Id Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean. We did so in the interest of excluding great-Power military rivalry from that critically important part of the world, which has become a natural passageway for the super-tankers that carry a vital source of energy, whose importance is clear to all whether in peace, in disturbances or in war.\n133.\tYemen has participated, and will continue to participate in the consultations that began last year on the holding of a conference to consider aspects of the question of peace in that part of the world. It is an area that is gaining in importance with the growing number of weapons that are continually being grouped there, the great fleets and the bases that the great Powers compete with each other to establish here and there in the outlying parts of the ocean and on its strategic islands.\n134.\tWith the same aim of ensuring peace and averting the scourge of a destructive war in our area of increasingly strategic importance, the Yemen Arab Republic favors the adoption of the wise and responsible draft resolution submitted by Iran which would declare the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\nMy delegation will follow this draft resolution with great care and attention.\n135.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic, its Government and its people wholly condemn the racist policy of South Africa which contravenes all principles and concepts of our modern age, as well as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We shall continue to denounce this racist policy from which African peoples are suffering because the Pretoria Government insists on continuing to practise its criminal policies in contravention of basic human rights. Pretoria arrogantly defies all international mores and charters.\n136.\tThe Government of the Yemen Arab Republic and its people affirm that more effective and positive action should be taken to put an end to these unjust acts and to force the Government of South Africa to comply with the many resolutions adopted by the United Nations.\n137.\tFrom the same starting point, my country also condemns the illegal racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia and fully supports the rights of the people of Zimbabwe to exercise their legitimate right to self-determination and sovereignty. My Government also fully supports the effective steps adopted by the General Assembly to terminate the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa. More effective steps should be taken to put an end to this illegal occupation and to grant the people of Namibia their full right to independence and self-determination:\n138.\tLast year we called upon friendly Spain and we do so once again now to put an end to its domination of the Rio de Oro and Sakiet A1 Hamra, which is Western Sahara under Spanish occupation. Such an initiative by the Government of Spain would remove the threat of tension from the area and would strengthen the traditional relationship between Spain and the Arab countries.\n139.\tIn conclusion, I should like to express the wishes and hopes of the Yemen Arab Republic that peace and security will be consolidated in the world through the strengthening of the authority of our international Organization, which, through the 30 years of its existence, has proved to be the best means of avoiding wars and disasters. My Government will support all efforts to enhance the authority and improve the efficiency of the United Nations so that it may be what we have always wished it to be, that is, a practical instrument for ensuring peace built on justice and equality of the rights and duties of all States, in spite of the negative aspects from which the small and developing countries have suffered. Those negative aspects have encouraged and continue to encourage some States to ignore resolutions adopted by the General Assembly either unanimously or by overwhelming majorities. I am referring to racist Governments with Fascist trends, such as those of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia and Israel. In spite of that, the United Nations will remain the means whereby the peoples of the world can solve their problems and find victory for their just causes.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "152.\t Let me begin by expressing, on behalf of the Government and people of Jamaica, our congratulations to the President on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly. Because of achievements as Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, we expect that under his leadership, this session of the General Assembly will continue the momentum which was generated within the United Nations under the leadership of his distinguished predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria, To Mr. Boute- flika I offer my congratulations and thanks on a job well done during what can be truly described as one of the most eventful years in the history of the United Nations.\n153.\tWe wish to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General and the staff on the Secretariat for the continued invaluable assistance we have received in our efforts, which will benefit a great portion of mankind through the maintenance of peace and the application of social and economic justice.\n154.\tThree newly independent nations the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the People's Republic of Mozambique have now become Members of this Organization, and Jamaica extends to them a sincere welcome. We look forward to the forthcoming membership of Papua New Guinea in the United Nations.\n155.\tThe past year has been one of profound change in international, political and economic affairs, and this session gives us an opportunity to ask the question, \\\"Where are we, and where do we go from here?\\\" In addressing ourselves to that question, let us first look at the United Nations system.\n156.\tThe United Nations, which is becoming truly representative of all the peoples of the world, reflects the conscience of mankind. Today, when travel, communications and the media link all the peoples of the world, more effective dissemination of information on the work of the United Nations could buttress its foundation of universal support and worldwide co-operative action. Already the United Nations has earned the world's respect in its own impartial corporate personality, It has earned that respect by its direct impact on individual men and women of the world.\n157.\tIt is because of that direct connexion between the United Nations and the peoples and the need to strengthen that link that I am going to pose the following questions, through you, Mr. President, to the peoples of the world.\n\\\"Here at the United Nations we deal with vital issues affecting mankind, such as war, peace, hunger, human rights and a host of development problems. In respect of those issues, what do you, as citizens of Member countries of the United Nations, know of the policies and positions advanced here by your representatives in your name? To what extent do those policies and positions truly represent your attitudes and feelings?\n\\\"The greatest strength of the United Nations must be in its broad-based acceptance by the peoples of the world and not merely by statesmen representing their countries. Mr. Average Citizen, do you know and approve the fact that while the advanced countries of the world spend between $250,000 million and $275,000 million per annum in military expenditure, only $11,000 million is being spent on official development assistance? Do you know and approve that, while you, through your representatives in this Assembly, are speaking of easing international tensions to usher in an atmosphere of peace and prosperity, and while you may be sending tractors to help in planting food for the hungry, you are also sending sophisticated weapons to murder the weak?\\\" It is difficult to say which we deplore the more: the dilemma of the poor nations that purchase swords instead of the ploughshares that they need, or the guilt of those merchant nations that deal in death by the massive sales of armaments.\n158.\tThe major Powers, which share the responsibility for international peace and economic well- being, at the same time manufacture, sell and ship missiles, tanks and guns, sometimes to both sides in an international conflict. The media are replete with pictures of suffering orphans of war and the endless line of distraught refugees whose fields have been defoliated by the modern instruments of war, and those Powers are selling them guns instead of implements for reconstruction. To people who need homes, food and medicine they sell tanks, guns and missiles. A gun has but one use. It cannot build a school or a home; it cannot plough the land for food. It can only kill and destroy.\n159.\tThe trafficking in arms is not limited to areas of overt conflict. It becomes even more clandestine in nature when used for subversion, against the exercise of full sovereignty by States in pursuit of political, social and economic policies which do not find favor with interfering interests. This is of particular importance to developing countries, which are implementing programs for the structural transformation of their societies and which therefore run the risks of internal disturbances fomented by external forces.\n160.\tDoes the ordinary citizen know that after wholesale devastation by war, when the victims offer their hands in forgiveness and attempt to join the United Nations as a haven of peace, those most responsible for the devastation refuse to accept that gesture, by denying them membership?\n161.\tI agree without reservation with the words of the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Kissinger, that: \\\"A world in which the survival of nations is at the mercy of a few would spell oppression and injustice and fear.\\\" [2355th meeting, para. 73.] All small nations know that; they believe it, with fear and trembling.\n162.\tCyprus is but one example of the tragedy of interference and oppression of the weak by the strong. Belize is another example, and I note with joy that the United States has offered to stand ready to assist in the settlement of regional disputes.\n163.\tIn Belize we have a good example of stagnation  indeed, more festering sore of discontent. We must not accept a stalemate there, even as we reject it in the case of Cyprus. We must keep up the momentum for peace, and we call upon the Powers, especially the influential Powers of Latin America, to remove Belize from its intolerable position. It is now on the threshold of independence, yet unable to accept that freedom which is offered to it as of right because it fears annexation.\n164.\tOne question I wish to ask is this: Why do some trouble-spots, like the Middle East or Cyprus, attract the attention of the great Powers, with massive interference, while the interests of the peoples of Belize and southern Africa seem to pass unnoticed as far as positive action is concerned? As a representative of a small country I must confess to great confusion here as to whether the concern of the great Powers is to protect the rights of people or to secure the rights to property. I am confused as to whether detente means here that the great Powers, ideologically poles apart, have together adopted the same policy of inaction in cases like those of Belize and southern Africa.\n165.\tWhy is it that, although for years the United Nations has been reviewing the trouble-spots of the world, where the security of the world is threatened, millions of dollars have been spent on the conflict in the Middle East and not a cent has been spent by any of the great military hegemonies to restore justice to the millions of blacks in southern Africa, including those in Namibia and Zimbabwe? Is that another question of \\\"kith and kin\\\"? Yet many consistently pay lip-service in the United Nations to the concepts of universality and the indivisibility of justice.\n166.\tMy country joins in congratulating the leaders of Zambia, the United Republic of Tanzania, Botswana and Mozambique on their courage and unselfishness in their efforts to establish justice in southern Africa by all means.\n167.\tRegarding the Middle East, any action which halts the unnecessary sacrifice of human lives is a step in the right direction, and is welcomed. While we welcome the genuine efforts made towards the achievement of peace in the Middle East, my delegation expresses the firm belief that for a lasting peace a fair and permanent settlement of the just claims of the Palestinian people must be made.\n168.\tI have commented on some of the major current political issues which affect the lives of millions of people throughout the world. An event of considerable political and economic significance occurred during 1975, a very short time ago; that is, the seventh special session of the General Assembly, Undoubtedly, much discussion will take place during this session about the results of that one. However, in my delegation's opinion it is still too early to make a full assessment; but I will say that the earlier session marked the beginning of a process, and its results will require careful and sober evaluation. It is true to say that it was an advance to have proceeded without acrimony or violent confrontation. It was a success to have had countries of vast ideological and economic differences seated together in deep and long consultation. However, the reservations expressed by some delegations have cast doubt on the value of what may have been achieved. Nevertheless, developing countries have set out to make fundamental changes in the international economic system, and we are determined to continue this process.\n169.\tIt is also encouraging to see that those voices that had ominously spoken about the decline of the United Nations have been converted to a new note of optimism and the question I ask is: Have they become admirers because the United Nations has changed, or have they changed their tune because the United Nations has so far failed to effect a real change? The special session, however, did show that the General Assembly of the United Nations is still the only international forum which acts as a final repository of hope for mankind, and that in the words of a representative of a Member State, \\\"the system works\\\".\n170.\tA few months ago, at Kingston, Jamaica, a conference was held by the Heads of Government of the Commonwealth of nations. This body, ranging alphabetically from Australia to Zambia, comprises some 25 per cent of the Governments of the world. Represented there were the millions of India, as well as the more modest numbers from Barbados. The great leaders from varying backgrounds, bound together by that particular mystique of the Commonwealth, met under Prime Minister Michael Manley of Jamaica, himself a symbol of the possibilities of change; and there they set an example to the world of how free men in a free association can unite in the quest to establish social justice and extend it to the poor of the world, regardless of color, creed or political persuasion.\n171.\tLet me turn for one moment to the ongoing Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. There have been expressions of dissatisfaction at the rate of progress. This is understandable because the problems are so numerous and complex, and also because there is a real danger that unnecessary delay may cause States to make unilateral and precipitate declarations against the moratorium and against the spirit of the convention itself. My delegation, however, sees some signs of hope: from new ideas, such as a concern for the less-developed countries, including the land-locked, island-developing and others; identification of the treasures of the ocean beyond national jurisdiction as the common heritage of mankind; and deliberate efforts at adjusting the existing economic imbalances.\n172.\tMy delegation believes that there has been evidence of deliberate and unnecessary delay by some of the great maritime hegemonies which are not yet prepared to concede these economic, adjustments during the negotiations. It seems they would rather preserve a system that retains an advantage for the more technologically advanced.\n173.\tWhen we consider that the immense wealth, both mineral and organic, of the sea and ocean bed means for some countries not merely an improvement in the quality of life but survival itself, the Assembly will, I am sure, share my hope that the same speed and application manifested during this past seventh special session will be applied to the next session of the Conference on the law of the sea and bring it to its final phase.\n174.\tWith so many experts and specialists, there can be no excuse to the peoples of the world for this issue drowning in the sea of indecision.\n175.\tIn the midst of all these considerations, we must not lose sight of the central core of our endeavors, which is the pressing need for the fullest mobilization of the human resources of developing countries. In this connexion our women must be brought fully into the mainstream of economic, political and social life, contributing as vital elements to the process of development and benefiting equally from that process. This is the imperative of healthy national growth; it is the imperative of social justice. For this reason, Jamaica welcomes the designation of this year by the United Nations as International Women's Year. It has given added inspiration to our national efforts in this area. We have accelerated all of our policies and programs during the course of the past 12 months in the fields of education and skill training; maternal and child health; legislation ensuring a minimum wage to all workers, male and female; equal pay for equal work; social legislation relating to the status of the child and the unmarried mother; and the establishment of a women's bureau in the office of our Prime Minister. These are all instruments which we have developed this year for the more effective elimination of any discrimination or inequalities which inhibit our women from full participation in national life. No nation can afford to be without the contribution of its women in the search for international peace and equity.\n176.\tThe central theme of all developmental policies, whether at the international, regional or national levels, must be the improvement of the quality of life for all the peoples of the world. The Government of Jamaica is particularly gratified by the adoption earlier this year of the Plan and program of Operations for the United Nations Habitat and Human Settlements Foundation, which in effect has set the stage for the Foundation to become operational. It is imperative that Human Settlements policies designed to bring about such an improvement be evolved without delay in order that the basic human needs for housing, which continues to assume critical proportions, may be tackled at both national and international levels. Jamaica has participated actively in the work of the Preparatory Committee for the forth-coming Habitat Conference to be held at Vancouver in 1976; and in addition we attended the regional conference recently held in Caracas, Venezuela. It is our expectation that the Human Settlements Conference will mobilize international awareness to the enormity and the urgency of the problem.\n177.\tThe international community faces a tremendous task not only in the field of integrated social and economic development, but also in the political arena. This is essential for the implementation of the former. It is clear that substantial restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system must take place in order to make it more responsive to the requirements of the international community, and in particular in the implementation of the new international economic order. My delegation notes with satisfaction the establishment by the General Assembly at its seventh special session of an Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System. However, restructuring of the system will not bear the expected fruit if the necessary political will does not exist for the implementation of the new order. This political will can be achieved only through influencing the mind of'' the man in the street''. In this regard, all member countries must play their part. In addition, the communications-information media has a crucial role in re-educating the people.\n178.\tIn conclusion, I wish to endorse the statement made by our previous President, Mr. Bouteflika, on this subject, He said:\n\\\"Because of its vast facilities and the size of its readership, even in our countries, the Western press, in my view, bears an even greater responsibility in this area. It can and unfortunately it has to some extent done so attempt to counteract the present course of events in the world and take the easy way out of flattering the ego of the wealthy and seeing nothing but ingratitude and incomprehension in the behaviour of the poor. It can also and this is precisely where the greatness of its vocation lies help the mass of its readership to become aware of the real problems of the world and the danger concealed behind an all-too-complacent prosperity to enable it to gauge the magnitude of the suffering all around it.\\\"3\n179.\tIt is because we believe in the United Nations and reaffirm our full support that we have directed our thoughts, through you, Mr. President, to the peoples of the world."

        "file_text": "\n117.\t  Mr. President, permit me, before I begin my statement, to offer you my sincere congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. The great responsibility thus entrusted to you unquestionably reflects the recognition by the international community of your statesmanlike qualities and your ceaseless efforts in the international cause. I particularly wish to congratulate you because of the solid ties of friendship that unite our two countries.\n118.\tI would also like to congratulate, once again, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, upon the competence with which he discharged his functions as President of the Assembly at the most recent regular and special sessions of our Organization. His devotion to the cause of Africa, of non-alignment and of the third world and his attachment to the ideals of the United Nations made it possible, at the twenty-ninth session, for our Organization to score noteworthy victories in such important fields as those relating to the independence of peoples, to economic justice, and to international peace and security. We have every hope that the same will be true at the present session.\n119.\tI wish, too, to repeat to the Secretary-General the assurance of our full confidence and the appreciation of my Government for his tireless work in seeking to bring about a world of peace and justice.\n120.\tMy delegation is also particularly happy to give a warm welcome to our sister countries, the Republic of Cape Verde, the People's Republic of Mozambique and the Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, new Member States of our Organization, whose participation will make a valuable contribution to the realization of the principles and purposes of the Charter and\nwill also be a concrete manifestation of the universality of our Organization.\n121.\tMay I be allowed to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the memory of two great sons of Africa, Amilcar Cabral and Eduardo Mondlane, who were murdered by colonialism and whom we continue to mourn. The struggles they waged within Partido Africano da lndependencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC] and FRELIMO, carried to a successful conclusion by their worthy successors, have now made it possible for these young States to become full members of the community of free and independent peoples.\n122.\tAs you know, this thirtieth session has opened against a background of profound changes characterized, on the one hand, by the success of the national liberation movements and the progressive forces  although limited here and there by the persistence of a will to dominate on the part of the great Powers, which oppose the political awakening of the peoples of the third world and, on the other hand, by the deterioration of the world economic situation, a consequence of the old international order, which must be replaced by a new, more just and more humane order.\n123.\tDespite the detente that continues between the great Powers, as reflected in the positive results of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, violence and war are still plaguing the third world, which, in some of its parts, is witnessing tragic events that may have dangerous repercussions on international peace and security.\n124.\tCertain crisis situations affecting our countries have not yet been resolved; or they are indeed being deliberately encouraged in order to divert the attention of the international community from major world problems and to compel our countries to concern themselves primarily with those crises, which threaten their independence and security.\n125.\tIn Africa, where we have without any doubt witnessed a genuine improvement in the situation with the victory by the national liberation movements over colonialism, we will still find racism and foreign domination persisting, particularly in the southern part of the continent. They, as is generally agreed, constitute the contemporary version of the notorious system of slavery, which in past centuries caused on that continent the most terrible genocide in history.\n126.\tIn Angola, where it is really true that foreign Powers are maneuvering to cause a civil war, my Government believes that it is the duty of the international community to appeal to the Angolan liberation movements to put an end to their fratricidal struggle. The immediate withdrawal of South African troops and the cessation of the supply of foreign arms should be demanded. My Government hopes that the OAU will succeed in the noble task of reconciliation which it has undertaken, so that next 11 November that country can accede to independence with peace and unity among the three liberation movements restored.\n127.\tBut if, by some misfortune, the effort of our continental organization were to fail, we would then have to have recourse to other means to put an end to this distressing situation which, since 25 April 1974, has caused more African deaths than have the 15 years of liberation struggle. My delegation believes that the\nUnited Nations, whose duty it is to safeguard peace wherever it is threatened, should from now on concentrate more of its efforts on this problem and be ready, if necessary, to intervene in such a way as to put an end to the genocide now taking place there under the reprehensible influence of foreign Powers.\n128.\tMy delegation takes this opportunity to proclaim that President Idi Amin spoke from this rostrum on behalf of the OAU and of all Africa. We very much regret the lack of courtesy shown him by representatives of the host country.\n129.\tWith regard to the question of southern Africa, my Government feels that the international community should continue to help the national liberation movements of those countries. Senegal, which has always, by material and moral assistance, supported these movements, will continue to exhort them to fight by force of arms while remaining open to negotiations with the adversary.\n130.\tWith particular regard to Namibia, my country, which recognized SWAPO which has a permanent office at Dakar as the authentic and sole representative of the Namibian people, has always taken an unequivocal stand. This attitude is justified by the fact that Namibia is not a part of South Africa, whose Mandate over this Territory was withdrawn by the United Nations.\n131.\tWe have always vigorously contended, and we have never been proved wrong, that South Africa has no rights over Namibia, not even that of conquest. South Africa should therefore comply with the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations and with the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 21 June 1971,4 and recognize the territorial integrity and unity of that country as a nation, and put an end to its policy of bantustanization.\n132.\tWithin this context, my delegation is most happy to be able to announce to this Assembly that a major conference will be organized at Dakar in January 1976 on Namibia and human rights. We are aware that such a meeting will particularly help international opinion better to understand the painful problem of Namibia and will also better enable it to work towards a speedy and final solution of this problem.\n133.\tWith regard to Southern Rhodesia, Senegal condemns all delaying tactics engaged in by the existing racist minority regime in an attempt to postpone indefinitely the achievement of a solution in keeping with the aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe. I should like to take this opportunity to repeat here on behalf of the Government of my country our determination to continue to support unreservedly the lawful struggle of the African National Council, which can always count on our solidarity.\n134.\tAs for South Africa, its proclaimed policy of detente with regard to independent Africa will be unacceptable until at home it has conceded equality of rights for all human beings and has consequently declared itself ready to grant the rights of the majority, and until it has begun negotiations with the liberation movements which undeniably represent the aspirations of the majority of the people.\n135.\tWith regard to the last colonial territories still existing on our area, such as Djibouti and Seychelles,\nmy country has always felt that it was the duty of our Organization to do everything in its power to see to it that the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples contained in resolution 1514 (XV), was strictly implemented, particularly at a time when we are joyfully looking forward to welcoming within the community of free nations the new State of Papua New Guinea, whose independence was proclaimed on 16 September 1975.\n136.\tThe case of Spanish Sahara, as it is called, should, however, be the subject of a particular examination. As we are aware, with regard to the decolonization of that Territory, our Organization has asked the International Court of Justice to pronounce on the legal status of the country prior to Spanish occupation. At this moment, we cannot prejudge the verdict of the Court, but if this verdict were to confirm the rights of Morocco and of Mauritania it seems to my delegation only justice to recognize the rights of those who possess them.\n137.\tIn this regard some people state that even were the International Court of Justice to recognize the rights of Morocco and of Mauritania, nevertheless the principle of self-determination should be blindly applied. But apart from the fact that self-determination in that Territory of 50,000 indigenous persons under, we are told, more than 70,000 foreign occupiers would have little chance of being genuine, this attitude would be contradictory to recent decisions taken on the subject of decolonization in the area of northwest Africa.\n138.\tFirst, in that case, what would have been the point of consulting the International Court of Justice if we did not intend to take account of its verdict?\n139.\tAlso, why was a referendum not organized when Ifni was restored to Morocco in 1969 or, before that, in the case of Tarfaya in 1958, or of Tangiers in 1956?\n140.\tFinally, with regard to Namibia, was not the verdict of the Court simply adopted by our Organization?\n141.\tI should also like to add that, to my knowledge, the number of referendums on self-determination organized throughout the world by the United Nations can be counted on half the fingers of one hand.\n142.\tOn the basis of all this, my delegation will support the verdict that the Court, in which my delegation has every confidence, will give to our Organization.\n143.\tMy delegation feels that Spain, in turn, would be making a gesture of goodwill to Africa if it were to abide scrupulously by future decisions of the Internationa] Court of Justice, and it hopes that, however that may be, the settlement of the problem of the Sahara will be in keeping with the best interests of the peoples directly concerned.\n144.\tAs to the Comoro archipelago, which my delegation would like to congratulate warmly on its progress in its national liberation struggle, our Organization should do its best to ensure the national unity and territorial integrity of that country.\n145.\tAs can be seen, the situation in Africa is still marked by injustice and tension imposed by foreign forces greedy for domination.\n453\n146.\tThe Asian continent is on the threshold of an era of peace and justice since the triumph of the liberation struggles in Cambodia and Viet Nam.\n147.\tMy Government would like to take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to the brave people of Cambodia and the Royal Government of National Union headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk upon this victory against foreign interference, which is not only a victory for Cambodia, but is also a victory for all peace and justice-loving peoples. The great people of Cambodia has taught the international community that the will for national independence always prevails in the end over injustice.\n148.\tMy delegation is very happy to welcome to this Assembly the true representatives of Cambodia, the Royal Government of National Union in this case, whose seat was illegally usurped by people who now have been thrown out by their people and by history.\n149.\tWith regard to the Republic of South Viet Nam which a war that had lasted more than a quarter of a century had prevented from recovering its independence, my delegation would ask all free and independent countries to co-operate sincerely by helping that country's economic recovery, as well as that of Cambodia. The Senegalese people has always supported the Vietnamese people in their national liberation struggle, and today, we are distressed at the fact that it has not been admitted to the United Nations this year. The attempt to link this admission, and also that of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, to a problem of a different nature, is, in our view, an unacceptable maneuver aimed at postponing a historic fact which is, in any case, inevitable and one which could not but enhance the growing prestige of our Organization. My delegation hopes, however, that the spirit of justice and international co-operation will finally prevail and that the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam will soon be admitted to membership in the United Nations.\n150.\tThe Korean people aspire to peaceful and independent reunification. My country calls for the withdrawal of the foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the United Nations flag, and would remind those who persist in attempting to perpetuate the artificial division of this nation, that their efforts to pursue this hopeless policy are doomed to failure because, like all great peoples, the Korean people will be reunified. Until this happy event occurs and it will not be long in coming because it is part of the process of history  my delegation requests that the existing military armistice agreement in Korea be replaced by a peace agreement in order to create favorable conditions for transforming the armistice into a lasting peace in Korea and to accelerate the independent, peaceful reunification of this country.\n151.\tCyprus and the Middle East are such constant hotbeds of international tension that our Organization has to pay particular attention to them. Cyprus is occupied and divided, and it is the duty of our Organization to restore its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. My delegation believes that a settlement in Cyprus should be outlined by the two Cypriot communities themselves. In this regard, we hope for a successful conclusion in the best possible circumstances of the inter-communal talks going on under the auspices of the Secretary-General, and we\nhope that they, very soon, will make it possible to restore to the brave people of Cyprus their independence and an opportunity to live in peace and freedom.\n152.\tThe Middle East and Palestine, where a critical situation still prevails, remain a zone of conflict and will remain so until lasting peace has been established there. The \\\"no war, no peace\\\" situation, which is in fact just a situation of latent war, is something we should not allow ourselves to get used to. It prevents a peace worthy of the name from being restored in this region. Therefore, the existing state of affairs should be brought to an end. We note with satisfaction the recent military disengagement in Sinai which marks a small step forward towards the establishment of peace in that area. But in order to bring about a peace worthy of the name in the Middle East and in Palestine, my delegation believes that whatever action is taken must be within the framework of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The fundamental aim of such action should be Israel's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from all territories occupied since 5 June 1967 and the recognition of the sovereign rights of the people of Palestine in Palestine.\n153.\tUnfortunately, Israel, instead of pursuing in the interests of peace, a policy which would eventually lead to its complete withdrawal from the occupied territories, and to its recognition of the Palestinian reality, continues in fact its policy of Judaization in the belief that might makes right. Thus, a few months ago at Hebron, in the latest in a series of similar acts, a confiscation was carried out in the holy places of the Al-Haram Al-Ibrahimi Mosque, which is entirely Arab because it was built under the Caliphate of Omar. It is time for the international community to find practical ways and means of having its resolutions respected by its members, particularly when peace is threatened by a failure to comply with those resolutions.\n154.\tAs is clear, a settlement of the Cyprus and Middle East crises in a global context should be embarked upon as soon as possible. Such a settlement should be brought about with the help of the international community, which should participate even more actively in the efforts made to produce a solution to these crises as soon as possible. In this connexion, the non-aligned countries should also play a more active part in the search for ways and means of overcoming these crises in keeping with the principles laid down by the United Nations.\n155.\tThe United Nations, in which my country has always had the greatest trust since it is a forum where the world situation is best understood, continues to be the pre-eminent place for a dialog among developing and developed countries. The seventh special session of the General Assembly, devoted to international co-operation and development, clearly showed this to be the case. On that occasion, the developing countries, as you are aware, negotiated with the developed countries in a spirit of consultation, not of confrontation. Thus, their efforts to control effectively their own resources and to influence decisions on major international economic problems of concern to the whole world community, were given added impetus particularly because of the solidarity which has for some time marked their relations.\n156.\tInternational economic relations based on justice can only exist if the claims of every country to exercise sovereign rights over their own natural resources are recognized. It is no accident, therefore, that the major conferences which have taken place since the sixth special session of the General Assembly, on raw materials and development, have been primarily concerned with the recovery by all countries of their natural land and marine resources. The various meetings organized since that historic event, namely, the World Population Conference, held at Bucharest in August 1974, the World Food Conference, held at Rome in November 1974, the Dakar Conference on raw materials and the Conference of Heads of State of the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries [OPEC] at Algiers, the Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, held at Lima in March 1975, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held at Geneva, the World Conference of the International Women's Year, held recently in Mexico, and also the seventh special session of the General Assembly, all dealt with the same problem: the absolute need to change the anachronistic and unjust system of domination which is a feature of the current world order of which, in the final analysis, the main victims are the least developed peoples of the international community.\n157.\tFor all these conferences, the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)] and also the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] constituted frames of reference, thus opening the way which will inevitably lead to a radical change in the current system of international economic relations.\n158.\tFor their part, the developing countries, as Members will have noted this year, have made a particularly positive contribution: indeed, inspired by the firm will to achieve success in the revolution which must necessarily occur in economic relations among peoples and motivated by the need to give priority to development problems and world economic stability, they have endeavored to strengthen and coordinate their actions with a view to creating true horizontal co-operation, particularly within the field of raw materials, thus creating a concerted negotiating power that will allow them to bring about the establishment of a new international economic order.\n159.\tIn this regard, members will remember that at the beginning of this year, more precisely from 3 to 8 February 1975, the Conference of Developing Countries on Raw Materials was held at Dakar and on that occasion a Declaration and an Action Program were adopted,5 defining a development strategy, the fundamental principles of which are essentially based upon solidarity and mutual support between oil-producing countries and countries producing other raw materials and on the concerted actions of producers' associations to protect oil and other raw materials.\n160.\tThat strategy thus founded upon the strengthening of economic, financial and monetary co-operation among developing countries, will make it possible for them to deal on an equal footing with developed\ncountries in all meetings convened for the purpose of bringing about the new international economic order, and particularly in the United Nations.\n161.\tThe summit Conference of OPEC at Algiers, which took place within the same frame of reference as the Dakar Conference on raw materials and the purpose of which was also that of resuming dialog between the developing countries and the developed countries on problems of raw materials, energy and development, made possible a certain balance of power within the international economic structure, and succeeded in modifying, for the first time to any appreciable extent, the traditional flow of financial resources caused by unjust trade relationships which have been imposed for so long by the developed countries.\n162.\tThis action of solidarity on the part of the developing countries was also demonstrated at the first Paris meeting on energy, raw materials and development convened upon the initiative of the President of France. The position of my country on this North-South dialog was very well expressed by President Leopold Sedar Senghor, who said in this regard:\n\\\"The developed countries tend to separate energy, raw materials and development. Now, in my view, all of these things are very closely interlinked. In practice there is just one problem-, that of development.\n\\\"We must resume the Paris conference and begin a general discussion on raw materials so that some principles concerning the stabilization of purchasing power can very quickly be worked out.\n\\\"Once the developing countries which have expressed their view on this subject at the Conference held in Dakar at the beginning of the year have been given that satisfaction, the Paris conference could, in a second phase, draw up a time-table of further meetings that would consider each raw material, beginning with energy-producing raw materials.\\\"\n163.\tThe resumption this month of this North-South dialog was fortunately recommended by the General Assembly at its seventh special session. It is a dialog that is of great concern to my country and one that should be considered an important turning-point in the irreversible process that will lead us to the establishment of a new international economic order.\n164.\tThe expansion of its scope, recommended at the seventh special session, will make possible wider and better balanced representation for all members of the international community, which should make the forthcoming Paris conference the beginning of sincere and frank co-operation between developing and developed countries.\n165.\tOther meetings with regard to the new international order have been organized last year and this year by the United Nations. In 1974, as Members will recall, the World population Conference and the join FAO/UNCTAD Conference were held at Bucharest and Rome, respectively, to deal with the drying increase of population and the world food crisis, which were aspects of the old international economic order.\n166.\tThis very year, the third session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the i>ea,\nheld at Geneva, also challenged the same system of domination and dependence and condemned the prevailing international economic order. Definite progress was made there, particularly in the recognition of the sovereign rights of coastal States over a zone of national jurisdiction not to exceed 200 miles, without prejudice to the interests of all States with regard to international communications.\n167.\tAt the same time, it was considered that the area and the resources of the sea-bed should be administered by an international authority which would be at the service of the international community as a whole, but which would take particular account of the interests of developing countries.\n168.\tThe position of my country on this subject is well known and is similar to that of other African and non-aligned countries, anxious as we are to see the establishment of justice in this area. The new regime governing the sea, which will be born of the dialog embarked on last year in Caracas and which will be continued next March in New York, should effectively ensure the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and promote the economic interests of developing countries.\n169.\tAt Caracas and at Geneva, thanks to the united attitude of the third-world countries, we have now embarked upon the formulation of a new humanitarian international law of the sea, which should become an instrument of justice, co-operation and peace. My delegation is very gratified at this.\n170.\tAt the Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization [UNJ DO], held at Lima, from 12 to 26 March, contradictory positions emerged. The developing countries reaffirmed the importance of industrialization as a means of achieving the objectives of economic and social development and, on that occasion, called for the transformation of UNIDO into a specialized agency of our Organization, so as to make it a more effective instrument of co-operation which would enable them to achieve 25 per cent share in world industrial production by the year 2000.\n171.\tThat demand, entirely supported by my delegation, met with opposition from the developed countries which does not seem right to us.\n172.\tThe World Conference of the International Women's Year, which was recently held in Mexico, falls within the same framework as the above-mentioned conferences, the essential purpose of which is to bring about a new international order. The need to ensure equality of rights for women and their contribution to the achievement of the objectives ot the Second United Nations Development Decade, was the reason why the international community adopted the World Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Women's Year and the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Feace, 1975 My delegation whole-heartedly approves the major principles contained in the Mexico Declaration and the Plan of Action, and hopes for the ear y achievement of the objectives of the International Women s Year so that we may build a more humane society where men and women can live in dignity, justice and prosperity. Indeed, the problems that concern women,\nand which we must resolve in the end, are without any doubt the problems of society as a whole and if we do not tackle them in time the resulting malaise will be damaging to the whole international community.\n173.\tAs Members will have noted, the legitimate claims of the international community for the establishment of a society which will be more just and more humane are not entirely yet understood by all the Members of our Organization.\n174.\tMr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, asked at the seventh special session, \\\"What kind of world do we want to build? What kind of future are we to prepare for coming generations? One is tempted to reply that that is the essential question. At least, that was the understanding of the General Assembly when it achieved an honorable compromise at that special session, a compromise accepting what is, in the final analysis, the condition of interdependence of all sectors of mankind.\n175.\tIndeed, as the Assembly is aware, the positive results of that historic session laid the groundwork for concerted world economic action. That action will spare the international community the confrontation which would have been entailed by its failure. Instead of confrontation between poor and rich countries we now have the prospect of co-operation, where everyone will endeavor to translate those ideals into reality for the greater good of all mankind.\n176.\tIn this connexion it would appear necessary to strengthen international security and solve world problems in the spirit of the principles of active and peaceful coexistence, which should form the basis of relations between all countries, in order to bring about a new international economic order as soon as possible.\n177.\tThe establishment of zones of peace and an increase in the number of denuclearized zones are the only way to ensure that we, the developing countries, will not ourselves be caught up in the unbridled arms race. It is therefore necessary to establish control machinery and formulate a disarmament policy linked to a new philosophy of co-operation for purposes of development.\n178.\tIt would be desirable also, still within the framework of the search for a world of peace and justice, to convene a world disarmament conference, to enable the international community to discuss a problem which is crucial for survival, survival which is possible only within the context of collective security.\n179.\tThe effectiveness of such action can be guaranteed only within the framework of a United Nations which would reflect the new international situation. That requires a comprehensive revision of this Organization's system in order to lend greater reality to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The example of the right of veto in the Security Council, which is based on an international order dating from the Second World War, is clear enough.\n180.\tToday, progressive forces have emerged on the world scene. The countries of the third world, which for some time now have tended to become the arenas\nof international conflict, demand that no arbitrary veto be cast against their legitimate claims for national independence. The recent use of the veto against the admission of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam to the United Nations bears eloquent testimony to the fact that this system, which is now in the service of certain States, is a flagrant violation of the principle of the sovereign equality of States. We think we should envisage a solution in keeping with the aspirations of the whole of the international community, in order the better to accelerate the establishment of the new international economic order which we all so ardently hope for.\n181.\tIn the same context, my delegation hopes that the review of the Charter, begun by the Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter of the United Nations, created at the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, will lead to positive results. In the meantime we believe it would be highly desirable, even within the framework of the present Charter, to strengthen the functions of the United Nations by making improvements, particularly in the light of the need to maintain international peace and security and to accelerate economic and social development in developing countries.\n182.\tI should not like to conclude without making an appeal, as I did last year from this rostrum for peace, that peace so necessary to all, but particularly to the third world in order to ensure its economic development. It cannot be just the privilege of a small group of countries. It should be extended to cover the whole world, where the emergence of the third-world peoples is a new factor that could transform contemporary international relations for the benefit of the whole of mankind.\n183.\tA necessary prerequisite for that peace is the ending of the various conflicts provoked in developing countries by foreign interests. That peace should be total and permanent. We do not despair of seeing it come about one day.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "110.\t It is with great pleasure that I convey to the President the congratulations of the Nigerian delegation on his election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. He represents a country and a region which have tremendous potential for the advancement of the ideals of the Charter of our Organization and for the realization of the aspirations of the underprivileged section of mankind. His well known personal commitment to the cause of peace and the uplifting of human dignity encourages me to hope that, under his wise guidance, this session will achieve significant success. In this endeavor, I assure him of the co-operation of my delegation.\n111.\tThe relevance of the United Nations to the solution of the urgent problems of today is no longer in doubt. In the period between the twenty-fifth anniversary and this session when we celebrate its thirtieth anniversary, the Organization has proved its awareness of its responsibilities not to some, but to all its Members. Its devotion to the maintenance of peace has been balanced by an appreciation of the need to promote the economic and social well-being of all mankind. It has gone beyond pious statements delivered with great solemnity in this historic hall and then quickly forgotten. It has adopted the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and has proclaimed a new international economic order, with an appropriate Program of Action. The World Population Conference, the World Food Conference, the third session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and the General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, all held under the auspices of the United Nations, are indicative of the increased preoccupation of our Organization with the need for results that will benefit its membership. Moreover, the seventh special session, which ended only a few days ago, convinces my delegation that our Organization is capable of rising to the challenges of the future.\n112.\tWhen the sixth special session was convened, there was discerned a definite antagonism to the aspirations of the poorer section of our membership. Rather than face the glaring disparities between those who have and those who have not, a desperate attempt was made to put blame where none was due. We left the sixth special session painfully aware of our lack of consensus. The seventh special session, by its positive achievement, has demonstrated the truth in the age-old saying that where there's a will there's a way.\n113.\tWhat is left is a demonstration of commitment by action to show that the awakening of Members of the United Nations to the need to be faithful to all the Articles of its Charter is not just one of those ephemeral developments which pass away once a \\\"strategy\\\" has been adopted. We have the experience of the two strategies for the First and Second United Nations Development Decades to justify such a fear. AH too often we tend to forget that the Charter devotes two chapters, embodying 18 articles, to the question of international economic and social co-operation. In Article 55, the United Nations committed itself to the promotion of higher standards of living, full employment, solutions of international economic, social, health, and related problems, with a view to \\\"the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations\\\". In Article 56 of the Charter, all of us, Members of the Organization, pledge ourselves to take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organization for the achievement of the purposes enunciated in Article 55.\n114.\tTherefore, if the inequity in the world economic system has persisted so long, the fault is not in the Charter; rather it is in the lack of political will by Member States to discharge their obligations. That will must now be shown positively to be present. For it seems to my delegation that events of the past two years ought to have shown in unmistakable terms that the poor, the downtrodden and the underprivileged countries will no longer accept the conditions which perpetuate their seemingly hopeless condition. If the rich nations can read the signs, if they can make genuine efforts at being partners in the accelerated progress of the developing countries, then a beginning will, have been made in fulfilling the Preamble to our Charter, \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\", and \\\"to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\\\".\n115.\tThe seventh special session ended with the unanimous endorsement in plenary of the measures proposed by its Ad Hoc Committee.4 My delegation expects that we shall all take swift action to bring about a new system of economic relationships between the developed and the developing countries. We expect early expansion and diversification of the exports of the developing countries. We expect an improvement in our terms of trade through a buffer- stock financing arrangement, involving producers and consumers within an integrated Program appropriately indexed to sustain and increase our purchasing power relative to the manufactured goods, technology and services which we import. The measures recommended in resolution 3362 (S-VII) for the transfer of real resources for financing development and for the reform of the international monetary system should also be implemented without delay. These measures are necessary to ensure an increased flow of concessional financial resources and a greater involvement of international financial institutions in the development strategies of the developing countries.\n116.\tWe do not, of course, lose sight of the need for the developing countries themselves to co-operate more effectively in improving their economic conditions. To this end, a greater degree of collaboration on economic projects has to be developed. A good beginning has already been made in the willingness of the developing countries which are producers of oil to assist positively other developing countries which are in a slightly less advantageous position. Indeed, the assistance given by such countries over the past two years has been to the tune of 2.2 per cent of their gross national product. My own country, Nigeria, in spite of its own tremendous internal requirements, has contributed its own modest share towards the development process in other countries. In addition\nto the bilateral assistance which we have provided for other developing countries, we have made available a substantial contribution to the African Development Bank in order to increase the Bank's capacity to give development loans to African countries. We intend, within the limit of our capacity, to continue this process. 1 should also refer to the co-operative effort which was concreted at Lagos in May this year, when 15 West African countries signed the Charter of the Economic Community of West African States. We hope that that charter will turn out to be the launching-pad for an economic grouping that will benefit all its members and their peoples.\n117.\tThe United Nations provides the ideal forum for working out the mutually beneficial partnership implicit in the new world economic order. So also does it provide an indispensable stage for the preservation of international peace and security in conditions of sovereign equality of States, large and small. If it is to fulfill this role, it has to be strong and effective. The thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Organization gives us a good opportunity once again to examine together in a constructive manner how best to strengthen the Organization and thus make it more responsive to the needs of a rapidly changing world. To pretend, as some powerful Members of the Organization do, that all is well with the Charter is to live in an ivory tower. On the one hand, criticisms are always made by the developing countries concerning the undemocratic set-up enshrined in the Charter. Through that system, a few countries are able to frustrate the will of the vast majority. On the other hand, developed countries have accused developing countries rather unfairly in my view of imposing a tyranny of the majority on die General Assembly. The upshot of these accusations and counter-accusations is the need to take a close look at the Charter.\n118.\tDuring its twenty-ninth session, the General Assembly adopted resolution 3343 (XXIX), which set up a Group of Experts with the mandate to submit a study containing proposals on structural changes within the United Nations system that would make it fully capable of dealing with problems of international economic co-operation in a comprehensive manner. This recognition of the need to update the structure of the United Nations so as to make it more responsive was proved right; for, in the report submitted by the Group of Experts, there were very constructive proposals which, by common consent, are to be referred for further action to the Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System. In paragraph 10 of its report, the Group observed:\n\\\"Every serious reform proposal (as opposed to marginal proposals that amount to mere 'tinkering') is bound to cut across someone's vested interest in the status quo. A meaningful reform of the system, to take account of new requirements and developments, may involve the forgoing of some short- term interests and entrenched habits in favor of long-term interests in a workable international economic order.\\\"3\n119. No better advice could have been offered for the future growth of this Organization. No greater justification could be given for the wisdom of the General Assembly when, after a long debate, it adopted\nresolution 3349 (XXIX), which created an Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter of the United Nations. My delegation regrets that the unco-operative attitude of certain Members has prevented the Committee from making progress. Without going into great detail, let me remind those who oppose even a simple review of the Charter of the following facts: first, that the United Nations today has a membership of 141 Members. Of this number, only 51, or slightly more than a third, were \\\"present at the creation\\\". If the two thirds which later subscribed to the Charter cannot even make suggestions for its improvement in the light of experience, then we will be made to feel that we are at best second-class Members. Secondly, even the founding fathers thought it wise not to preclude the possibility of amending the Charter: Article 109 makes elaborate provisions for reviewing the Charter, while Article 108 specifies the manner in which amendments shall come into force. Thirdly, changes are implicit in growth. My delegation looks forward to more positive developments in this issue. Meanwhile, the General Assembly at this session should pronounce its determination to work relentlessly for a more democratic set-up which will better fulfill the aspirations of all Members of our Organization.\n120.\tSeveral factors have proved conclusively that the super-Powers can no longer assume exclusive responsibility for international peace and security. Take the issue of disarmament, for instance: in spite of its place of primacy in the objectives of the Charter, it has almost become a lost cause, thanks to superPower collusion. The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, which was intended as the main forum for disarmament negotiations, has been debilitated by a creeping paralysis. Its collective efforts are being frustrated by bilateral deals between the super-Powers which appear to them as progress, but which to the generality of the Members of the United Nations are tantamount to glossing over the real issues. The chief function of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament is not to get enmeshed in protracted negotiations on collateral and sub-collateral measures of disarmament. The goal we all aim at is general and complete disarmament under a system of international supervision. To attain this goal we have to agree on a comprehensive test-ban treaty.\n121.\tThe lack of progress on this crucial issue continues to bedevil all other related disarmament questions, namely, the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the prevention of a group of privileged nuclear Powers making a mockery of the concept of the sovereign equality of States; the reduction of the staggering expenditures in the military budgets of the affluent countries; and the diversion of human and material resources from the pursuit of the armaments race to the promotion of the economic and social progress of humanity as a whole.\n122.\tAs far as we are concerned, there are no technical obstacles to the verification of a comprehensive test-ban regime which should prevent its early adoption, provided the political will and mutual trust exist. While we recognize the value of technical and scientific expertise in classifying the complex issues involved in disarmament negotiations, the work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament should not be diverted into peripheral and marginal alleys in which annual seminars and symposia are conducted on this or that aspect of specific disarmament questions.\n123.\tIn this connexion, my delegation regrets that a good opportunity for advancing the cause of disarmament was missed during the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Review Conference' failed to rise to the task of providing more positive barriers against horizontal as well as vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons. The nuclear Powers parties to the Treaty cynically held back from giving assurances and guarantees that they would refrain from the use or threat of use of the deadly weapons. Similarly, there were no clear commitments on the part of the nuclear-weapon States that they would pursue the obligation incumbent upon them under article VI of the Treaty [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] to carry out meaningful negotiations with a view to achieving concrete measures of nuclear disarmament. For those of us who have willingly given up our nuclear options in becoming parties to the Treaty, the attitude of the nuclear Powers has served to confirm the inequity of a world dominated by super-Power hegemony. There is need for all States to confront the issue of disarmament in a more constructive and meaningful manner in a forum of sovereign equality. The proposed world disarmament conference can provide such a forum. If the attempt to convene such a conference continues to be frustrated, my delegation will not hesitate to join other third-world States in demanding that the General Assembly focus attention on disarmament in a special session.\n124.\tI should now like to touch upon some of the specific political issues involving international peace and security on which this Assembly must act.\n125.\tThe past year has witnessed very startling developments in the liberation struggle, both in IndoChina and in Africa. The people of Viet Nam have reasserted their independence and can now look forward to taking their rightful place in this august Assembly. My delegation hopes that it will not be long before the obstacles being placed in the way of the admission of the two Viet Nams is removed. In Cambodia, too, a popular regime has been installed. My delegation is happy that the Cambodian people will now be able to harness its efforts for the reconstruction of its country and the rehabilitation of its war-ravaged economy. We welcome them back into our midst. We also note with satisfaction the emergence of Papua New Guinea to independence and look forward to welcoming this new country to the United Nations.\n126.\tIn Africa, through the persistent struggle of the liberation movements, supported by all forces opposed to oppression, the battle cry has been sounded against Portuguese colonialism. The glorious example of the entry of Guinea-Bissau into this community of sovereign States has been followed at this session by the admission of Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe. We again congratulate those new countries on their achievements and look forward to working closely with them.\n127.\tWe call upon the international community to rally to the assistance of these new nations, which are confronted with tremendous problems arising from their long colonial status. Sao Tome and Principe, as well as Cape Verde, urgently requires assistance in coping with the great influx of refugees who have been displaced by the Angolan situation. My delegation hopes that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will take appropriate and urgent action to help in finding a solution to this humanitarian problem.\n128.\tRegrettably, Angola, whose emergence as a sovereign State and membership in our Organization we had looked forward to with hope, is engaged in a fratricidal conflict that is sapping its energy and diverting it from constructive pursuits. The Nigerian Government vehemently deplores the instigation of one group of Angolans against another. Most solemnly and in the name of humanity we call upon the outside meddlers in the Angolan situation to keep off and to give the Angolan people the chance of settling down to the immense task of nation-building. The Nigerian Government will not accept the truncation of Angola as now constituted. We do not believe there exists in Angola any problem that cannot be solved within a united Angolan nation. I therefore appeal to the Angolan leaders to place the interests of the Angolan nation and people before party and personal advantage. I sincerely hope that statesmanship among the Angolan leaders will yet prevail, for my delegation will derive great joy from being able to welcome a united, peaceful Angola into our midst before long.\n129.\tNotwithstanding the progress made in decolonization, imperialism still constitutes the most potent threat against international peace and security in southern Africa. The problem of Zimbabwe is a great reminder, if indeed one is needed, of the great hurdle that still has to be surmounted before we see the end of racism and imperialism. By an adroit act of political gamesmanship, the white rebel clique in Zimbabwe, aided by the racist regime in South Africa, almost succeeded in luring the international community into a sense of false security. We were almost led to believe that the rebel clique had at last read the signs, recognized the futility of its senseless policy and decided to take the indispensable steps towards ensuring for itself and its children conditions of peaceful and meaningful co-operation with the indigenous population it had so long oppressed. Regrettably, Ian Smith has once again shown his determination to wreck all chances of a peaceful transfer of power. By wrecking the talks between his illegal Government and the African National Council, by engaging in the dangerous game of trying to divide the nationalist united front, by seeking to hold talks with puppets in the assembly of tribal chiefs, Ian Smith is inviting an intensified armed struggle whose ultimate result is not in doubt.\n130.\tSince the United Nations is witness to the bad faith and unreliability of Ian Smith, it should give maximum support and encouragement to the nationalist' movement of Zimbabwe. The Federal Military Government of Nigeria pledges its unflinching support. My Government meanwhile calls on the African National Council to close ranks, to cast aside petty jealousies and personal ambitions, and to concentrate, in unity, on the task of ridding its fatherland of the oppression of the white rebels. \n131.\tThe situation in Namibia continues to deteriorate. Not only has South Africa flagrantly defied the United Nations; it has even refused to make a declaration, as required by Security Council resolution 366 (1974), that it would comply with the resolutions and decisions of the Organization. Besides, South Africa has persisted in its diabolical policy of Balkanizing Namibia through the creation of bantustans. Under the guise of permitting black and white ethnic groups of the Territory to determine their own future without interference, the Vorster regime has continued to perpetuate its stranglehold on Namibia. How can the entire world body look on helplessly when South Africa continues most blatantly to violate the tenets of our Organization? The Namibian people have almost exhausted their patience waiting hopefully for the United Nations to assume its responsibility. Are we going to fail them, or shall we resolve more than ever before to confront South Africa with the force necessary to bring about withdrawal? My delegation believes that if we have the political will we can in a short time solve the Namibia problem.\n132.\tTo insist, as do some Members of the United Nations, that the situation created by South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia does not constitute a threat to international peace and security is to be guilty of multiple standards. The Namibian situation is capable of provoking a racial war on a continent which needs a long period of peace to recover from imperialist exploitation. I therefore hope that those who used their veto power to prevent effective action against South Africa will reconsider their position and recognize that their responsibility under the Charter extends to the world at large.\n133.\tAt its twenty-ninth session, the General As- ;embly in its wisdom adopted resolution 3207 (XXIX), n which it called upon the Security Council to review the relationship between the United Nations and South Africa in the light of the constant violation by South Africa of the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Unfortunately, the Security Council could not take a decision owing to the use of the veto by some of its permanent members. The rest of the story leading to the exclusion of South Africa from further participation in the work of the session is well known.\n134.\tThe interesting thing is, however, that South Africa has now intensified its propaganda campaign to project an imaginary process of liberalization. As we all know, the truth is that nothing has changed. The most obnoxious aspects of apartheid are still very much in evidence. Rather than begin the necessary contacts on the basis of equality with the black South Africans, the racist regime prefers to conduct so- called dialog with independent African countries. Vorster will not talk to fellow South Africans who happen to be black, but he will wine and dine, and will even pay secret visits to, black leaders elsewhere.. The confusion which this monumental hypocrisy was intended to cause in the ranks of the OAU was, happily, exposed at the ninth extraordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministers held at Dar es Salaam last April. The Declaration adopted at that time confirmed Africa's view, first articulated in the Lusaka Manifesto, that friendship between South Africa and the rest of the continent can have as its basis only the abandonment of apartheid. To insist that meaningful dialog can be commenced with South Africa under its present leadership is to betray the oppressed non- whites in the country.\n135.\tThe Federal Military Government of Nigeria acknowledges the sovereign right of each country to determine its policy on specific issues. However, the Federal Military Government also believes that certain self-evident facts should unite all Members of the United Nations on an issue such as apartheid, which is so abhorrent to our Charter. It is sheer self-deceit to speak of being opposed to apartheid while at the same timing maintaining diplomatic, economic and other forms of links with a regime based exclusively on apartheid. It is even more serious when some Members of this Organization continue to supply South Africa with the weapons it needs to protect and perpetuate its obnoxious system. It is therefore incumbent on this Assembly strongly to reaffirm its arms embargo on South Africa and to -demand the end of economic collaboration and all other forms of contact with South Africa. My delegation wishes to place on record its appreciation of the indefatigable effort of the Special Committee against Apartheid, in exposing the evils of apartheid, and we hope that all Members of the United Nations will join wholeheartedly in the great task of effectively annihilating apartheid. Let those who at this time choose to develop or strengthen contacts and co-operation with South Africa beware.\n136.\tMy delegation is concerned that no solution has yet been found to the problem of Cyprus. We are apprehensive lest in this day and age the interests of a weak non-aligned country be sacrificed on the altar of big-Power politics. The current crisis in that island State was provoked and is sustained by the political and territorial ambitions of its big-Power neighbors who act ostensibly in protection of one or the other of the two sections of the Cypriot community.\n137.\tUntil the Cypriot people as a whole are made to believe that their first loyalty is to Cyprus and not to their ancestral home either in Greece or in Turkey, so long will there be room left for outsiders to fish in the Cypriot troubled waters. Nigeria does not believe in big-Power enforced settlement of the problems of a weak State. The principle of equality of States enshrined in our Charter is the very antithesis of imposed solutions. We are not unmindful of the communal fears; however, we do not share the position of those who would rather partition Cyprus. The territorial integrity of that young State must be maintained. The General Assembly must once again call on all parties directly involved in the Cyprus problem to show constructive statesmanship and work for a solution on the basis of General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX).\n138.\tThis Assembly will be faced once again with the unresolved problem of the Middle East and the intimately related question of Palestine. When we separated these two issues for discussion last year, we demonstrated, perhaps for the first time, our full recognition of the human tragedy created by the pro-longed upheaval in that area. The deprivation of their homeland inflicted on the Palestinian people and the' need to resettle them, not in refugee camps, not even in brotherly Arab countries, but in a country of their own, has become a most vital element in the search for meaningful and lasting peace in the area. The twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly gave somewhat overdue recognition to this aspect of the problem when it accorded Yasser Arafat the honor of addressing it. The Assembly then went further and accorded the Palestine Liberation Organization, the authentic voice of the Palestinian people, a place of honor in this Assembly and in other organs of the United Nations [resolution 3210 (XXIX)]. My delegation believes that these developments of the twenty- ninth session are indispensable steps towards peace. The people of Palestine must be associated closely with a settlement under whose umbrella they are expected to live.\n139.\tRegrettably, the threat to international peace and security which the situation in the Middle East constitutes still persists. The uncertainties in the course of events constitute a severe drawback in the pursuit of constructive efforts by the virile people of the area. The important issues are still unresolved even if some tentative progress has been made in creating conditions to facilitate peace contacts. My delegation believes that any breakthrough in any of the complex issues of the Middle East is a step for peace and must be welcome. The value of an all-or-nothing approach to a complex problem can be as doubtful as the arrogance which finds expression in the defiance of United Nations resolutions and genuine peace efforts. While we should therefore acclaim the recent accord, we must stress that lasting peace demands continuous movement. Israel must show positive signs of its willingness to abandon its defiant attitude and to negotiate on the basis of the resolutions of the United Nations. The goodwill of many Members of this Organization towards Israel has been more than vividly demonstrated in the decisions taken by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, held at Kampala from 28 July to 1 August 1975 and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Non-Aligned Countries held at Lima in August. Israel has the chance to reciprocate this goodwill and thus ensure for itself and its people peace within recognized borders. It is in the interest of international peace and security for Israel to be more constructive at this session of the Assembly; what is more, it is in the interest of the State of Israel.\n140.\tI dealt extensively at the beginning of my state-ment with the emphasis which our Organization has been placing on the economic development of Member States. This emphasis, which is long overdue, is in keeping with the ideals of our Charter. In the 30 years since that historic gathering in San Francisco which saw the birth of the United Nations, the glaring disparity between the few rich countries and the many poor countries has become more pronounced, to the point where urgent action is necessary if international peace and security are not to be jeopardized by open antagonism provoked by economic disparities. The Members of this Organization have within their capacity the means, and I hope the will, for spectacular progress in creating the conditions for a decent standard of life for everyone. The United Nations will be judged by the extent to which it is successful in combining this task with the equally vital job of up-holding peace and promoting self-determination and human dignity. Let it not be said of us that when we\nhad all the tools for making our Organization satisfy the yearnings of humanity we preferred to indulge our petty national self-interest rather than work for the over-all good of humanity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn beginning my statement, I should like first of all to convey to you, Sir, my most respectful congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Knowing the country that you represent, so rich in civil and democratic traditions, and knowing your personal gifts as an eminent statesman, we are certain that we shall have the benefit of a firm and enlightened guide. I should like to add, in my capacity as President of the Council of the European Economic Community, that we are particularly gratified to note that the representative of a country which is a member of the Community has been called upon to preside over the work of the Assembly as it celebrates the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations. To you, Mr. President, I should like to repeat that the countries of the Community are jointly determined to strengthen and make increasingly active their relations with the United Nations.\n38.\tTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, I should like also to convey our deep appreciation for his unceasing and tireless efforts in the affirmation of the ideals of the United Nations. As he has rightly pointed out in the introduction to his report to our Assembly:\n\\\"It is widely acknowledged that in our present world there is no rational alternative in international relations to the principles and procedures of the United Nations.\\\" [Al100011Add. 1, sect. XXL]\n39.\tI am glad at this regular session to begin my speech, as I did during the recent seventh special session, with a statement on behalf of the nine Foreign Ministers of the Community.\n40.\tOn 17 July last, at the end of a meeting of the European Council, the Heads of State and Government of the nine countries members of the Community issued a statement concerning the United Nations, which was subsequently submitted to the Secretary-General and circulated to Member States. In that statement, the nine members defined their joint vision of the role which the United Nations is called upon to play and their joint approach to the problems which the United Nations must help to solve.\n41.\tWith regard to the role of the United Nations, the members of the Community expressed their conviction that the Organization, while affected by the tensions which continued to divide the world, remained the indispensable instrument for meetings, negotiations and co-operation, because the growing interdependence of countries and peoples was multiplying the problems which required solution on the international level. Consequently, the members of the Community intend to play an active and constructive role in the efforts to strengthen the action and efficiency of the United Nations, in which the nine countries maintain every confidence.\n42.\tI think that it would be generally agreed that, during the seventh special session, which has just concluded, the countries of the European Community showed their united readiness to make a positive contribution towards the building of a more just and equitable international economic order. We welcome the successful outcome of the seventh special session and look forward as a Community to participating in the action that will follow.\n43.\tWithin the Organization, the nine countries plan to follow the path of conciliation and dialog based on the principle of universality, the application of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, respect for the rights of Member States and the carrying out of their obligations.\n44.\tWith regard to the problems faced by the United Nations, the nine countries are working primarily for the maintenance of peace and for the peaceful settlement of disputes and conflicts. I shall mention as an example the active support which the nine countries, taking advantage of the special ties of association existing between the Community and the three countries concerned, are giving to the unceasing and tenacious efforts being made by the Secretary- General of the United Nations for the solution of the Cyprus crisis, in accordance with the mandate given to him by General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) and Security Council resolution 367 (1975), in the adoption of which they played an active part.\n45.\tSimilarly, with regard to the Middle East, the nine countries reaffirm their keen and permanent interest in a renewal of efforts to achieve a final, overall, peaceful settlement which will be just and lasting, in pursuance of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and in conformity with the principles of their statement of 6 November 1973. The concept of justice and the desire to defend fundamental freedoms and human rights, as they have been formulated in that statement, form the basis for the commitment on the part of the Governments of the Community to help to put an end to the practice of apartheid and all forms of racial, political and religious discrimination, wherever they appear.\n46.\tMoreover, the principles of the independence and equality of peoples have inspired the action taken by the Community in making a solid contribution to the final settlement of the problem of decolonization. That contribution has included the new Members of the Organization the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, and the People's Republic of Mozambique, which we welcome among us today as a result of their accession to independence and will constantly be renewed in upholding the rights of the people of Namibia and the people of Southern Rhodesia.\n47.\tThe nine members of the Community, which worked closely together with the other Western countries, and especially with the United States and Canada, during the course of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, are most pleased that the Conference was able to establish the lines along which it will be possible to strengthen security and increase co-operation, exchanges and contacts among the peoples in the whole of Europe. The nine countries are convinced that the results achieved by that Conference will make an important contribution to the pursuit of the process of detente, not only in Europe, but all over the world.\n48.\tIn their statement on the United Nations, the nine countries also favored the achievement of concrete progress towards building up a more balanced and more equitable framework of international economic relations.\n49.\tFinally, in the spirit of interregional cooperation recommended by the United Nations, a dialog is proceeding between Europeans and Arabs with a view to the building, within a broader and more complete framework, of the links between individuals and the relations of co-operation between the countries of the Community and the countries of the League of Arab States. A fortunate beginning has been made to this dialog as a result of the recent meetings of two delegations of experts in Cairo and Rome.\n50.\tIt is the wish of the nine Governments to maintain a constructive dialog and to develop the greatest possible number of contacts with the other Members of the United Nations in a spirit of common understanding, in order to bridge the gaps between their respective positions and, if possible, to harmonize them.\n51.\tThe statement I have just made on behalf of the nine members of the Community has made it clear, through the series of examples mentioned of their actions and joint positions, that they are seeking objectives which are also being sought by the United Nations. This part of my statement may therefore be considered as the contribution made by them, not through recollections of the past, but through specific responses to the challenges -and responsibilities of our time, to the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations, which we are celebrating this year.\n52.\tHaving completed this general statement on behalf of the Community, I shall now continue speaking as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Italy.\n53.\tWe are all living through a period not only of great interest but of great changes. Both the world and international relations are changing with the emergence of new States. Italy takes a positive view of this process and also welcomes the slow and laborious confluence of vaster entities, linked together internally by common political, economic and conceptual interests.\n54.\tPrecisely because we are confronted with such an intensely dynamic phase in international relations, we deem it necessary to emphasize how closely the question of peace is linked with the existence of balanced and stable structures. Stability, of course, should not be understood as a static vision of the international system, but rather as a continuous and creative adaptation to the world historical process.\n55.\tOn the other hand, the growing pluralism deriving from the multiplication of international protagonists is the main cause of dynamism within the community of nations. The process of decolonization has liberated new forces. These require working space appropriate to their needs of recovery in the process of development and to their expectations for the future. In short, there has begun a process which implies, besides the conquest of national sovereignty, participation in those international decisions on which the social and economic survival of entire populations depends.\n56.\tUndoubtedly, pluralism implies the risk that disruptive tendencies might prevail within the system. The great multilateral forums are thus faced with the need to devise procedures which do not nullify the benefits inherent in a necessary and inevitable movement towards diversification, but which offer appropriate opportunities for all legitimate expectations without dislocating the system.\n57.\tItaly takes a confident view of this process, without abstract feelings of optimism, in the certainty that the profound motives of interdependence among peoples will finally triumph. It is these motives which, at the multilateral level, suggest a strategy of consensus, in conformity, moreover, with those principles of universality and equality which form the historical and juridical basis of the United Nations.\n58.\tItaly is situated at a cross-roads between three continents, in a geopolitically crucial region where fruitful coexistence between different civilizations and cultures is still interspersed with movements towards conflict and where the dynamic currents of the international system meet residual and tenacious sources of tensions. This special geopolitical position makes it essential for Italy to adopt clear definitions of diplomacy and strategy.\n59.\tIn accordance with this view and with these aims, Italy has found, in its friendly relations with the United States and in the Atlantic Alliance on the one hand, and in its commitment to European unity on the other, solid ground on which to base its participation, without isolation, in the peaceful and civilized development of international realities, with particular regard for the areas in which Italy is most directly and most naturally concerned.\n60.\tThese policies are in full accord with the great ideals and objectives of the United Nations and have enabled my country to make a contribution not only to the stabilization of Europe, by achieving the condition of security which is essential for all, but also to the process of detente, in whose continuance we believe.\n61.\tOur commitment to European unity is meant to be not only a model for joint development, but a new approach to co-operation with other countries as well. Thus, within the framework of the Community, Italy, like the other Community members, has been able to work out comprehensive forms of multilateral co-operation with the emerging countries in an effort gradually to go beyond bilateralism.\n62.\tOur policy is based on the premise that in order to achieve permanent conditions of world peace it is not enough to settle existing conflicts; we must also work for the gradual conquest of those imbalances which are at the root of instability and unrest in international life.\n63.\tAn essential and integral part of this development is the social and human element, because any new model of international relations will be very fragile unless it is based on respect for the dignity of the individual and his fundamental freedoms.\n64.\tIt is in this sense that I hope that the present session will go forward in a spirit of co-operation, with respect for statutory procedures, and in an atmosphere of serious and profound searching for solutions to the problems which still trouble political, economic and social relations between States.\n65.\tIn my statement on behalf of the Community I have already referred to existing conflicts. The Government of Italy is following with concern and special attention those affecting the Mediterranean area.\n66.\tWe are seriously preoccupied today with the Cyprus crisis precisely because it affects the background of interests in co-operation and political stability existing among Mediterranean peoples. We cannot forget that thi three countries directly involved are linked with Italy by numerous and special ties of co-operation and friendship. We have therefore done our utmost, directly, in our present capacity as a member of the Security Council, and within the European Community, to bring about between the parties an atmosphere more propitious for reaching a just and lasting solution to the problem.\n67.\tThus it is with deep regret that we have learned of the postponement of the talks between the two communities in New York. We hope that under the auspices of the Secretary-General, these talks will be resumed as soon as possible, and that no unilateral action by the parties will seriously disturb the progress of negotiations towards a final and equitable solution of the problem.\n68.\tWith regard to the Middle East, we have welcomed the conclusion, on 4 September at Geneva, of the second partial agreement between Egypt and Israel. We consider this step forward a further proof of the constructive attitude taken by Egypt, Israel and Syria since January and May 1974, when the first agreements for the separation of forces were reached. However, we believed then, and we believe now, that these agreements must in no case imply giving up an active and essential search for a, global solution to the problem.\n69.\tHere I must pay a deserved tribute to the determined and responsible efforts of the United States Secretary of State, who created the atmosphere for negotiation and made a decisive contribution to the search for formulas which made the agreement possible.\n70.\tWe must also express our appreciation to the President of Egypt, Mr. El-Sadat, for the political wisdom and far-sightedness he has shown in establishing, with the new agreement and the resulting improvement in the negotiating atmosphere, the bases for subsequent progress towards a peaceful overall solution for the benefit of all the countries in the area.\n71.\tWe must, finally, express our appreciation of the fact that the Israeli Government is now ready to seek its own integrity and security through political instruments and international consensus, which, for our part, we consider essential for the settlement of a conflict which has for too long afflicted the peoples of the region.\n72.\tOf course, it is more difficult to evaluate the medium-term and long-term prospects of the agreement of 4 September. These prospects appear to us to depend on the ability of all the protagonists to become involved in the process of peaceful settlement the key elements of which, as we have often stated, are: first, Israeli withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967; secondly, recognition of the national rights, of the Palestinian people, who cannot be denied a homeland; and thirdly, respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of ail the States of the region, naturally including Israel.\n73.\tThe position of Italy, which may be summed up in the two indissolubly linked principles \\\"security for States and justice for peoples\\\", induces us to condemn with the utmost firmness and with respect also to the absolute need for safeguarding the political and territorial integrity of Lebanon all violent actions, whatever their origin. Such actions give rise to a senseless spiral which is contrary to the path of peace.\n74.\tAnother region which for too many years has been a theater of war is South-East Asia. Although armed conflict has now come to an end in Viet Nam and Cambodia, there remain in those areas a number of problems related to reconstruction.\n75.\tThe Italian Government, having for some time now maintained diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of North Viet Nam, has recognized the new Governments of the Republic of South Viet Nam and of Cambodia and is now awaiting developments from the initiative already taken for the opening of diplomatic representation in the capitals concerned.\n76.\tIn line with the growing interest of the countries of the Community in the political and economic stability of South-East Asia, Italy will not fail to support all appropriate initiatives for the advancement of a region which has long sought to achieve its legitimate aspirations for progress in a new climate of peace.\n77.\tA fundamental component of peace is a general relaxation of tension. A decisive contribution to this objective will certainly be made through agreements in the field of arms reduction or disarmament, at both the general and the regional level, always with the maintenance of the necessary balance.\n78.\tThe world community must be freed from the threat of potential extermination by existing military arsenals. We must therefore renew our efforts in the field of disarmament, and of nuclear disarmament in particular. !n this endeavor, the role to be played by the major atomic Powers is obvious. Italy considers that the first Strategic Arms Limitation Talks agreements and subsequent understandings at Vladivostok constitute important steps towards the containment of nuclear armaments. These steps must, however, be followed by further progress in the direction of specific reductions in existing nuclear arsenals, as provided for by article 6 of the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n79.\tThat Treaty, which was ratified last May by Italy and four other Member States members of the European Atomic Energy Community, is an essential instrument in the struggle against nuclear proliferation, whether horizontal or vertical. It is in the interest of all to reinforce and to strengthen it. It is therefore important that the Treaty should command the universal acceptance that will help in great measure to achieve its objectives. The recent Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has in fact shown how profound and extensive is the world's desire for a more determined effort both in the field of nuclear disarmament and in the field of international co-operation for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, in a context other than that of proliferation. It must be clearly stated that, if we wish to reinforce and strengthen the non-proliferation Treaty and this is essential for the success of the struggle against nuclear proliferation we cannot allow these expectations to be disappointed. The non-nuclear-weapon States which have acceded to the Treaty must have the assurance that the Treaty will provide the necessary basis and an effective channel for acquiring the economic and technological benefits of co-operation in the nuclear field that are envisaged under the Treaty.\n80.\tIn the last two sessions of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament no substantial progress was made. It is necessary that the political will of all the Governments participating in the Conference, stimulated by a body so representative of world public opinion as is this Assembly, strive to reach in Geneva widely acceptable agreements, particularly concerning chemical weapons and the complete cessation of nuclear tests. Without substantial progress in these fields, the objective of general and complete disarmament under effective international control will prove even more difficult to attain.\n81.\tThe negotiations for the reciprocal and balanced reduction of forces in central Europe are taking place in a regional framework where thee nevertheless exists a relationship of forces which underlies the most important strategic' and political balance in the world and the deterrent effect derived from it. The special status of the Italian Government as it takes part in these negotiations, which concern ithe level of forces existing in central Europe, has not prevented it and will not prevent it from making its own specific contribution. The objective we are pursuing through the mutual and balanced force reduction is to reach agreements which stabilize military forces at a lower level, without creating conditions prejudicial to the political unification of Western Europe.\n82.\tDisarmament is both one of the premises and one of the essential parts of the process of detente. But the slow progress made in the dialog on the question of disarmament cannot allow us to forget that the process of detente is prompted by continuous demands and pressures which are much vaster in scope.\n83.\tIn the framework of detente, Italy has made its own significant and coherent contribution to the progress of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, whose important effect on relations between the Western countries and Eastern Europe I have already stressed in my statement on behalf of the Community.\n84.\tThe presence of the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, at Helsinki was a symbol of the fact that the objectives embodied in the Final Act of the Conference and those pursued by the United Nations are homogeneous.\n85.\tThe declaration on the Mediterranean approved by the Conference significantly broadens the concept of the problems of security and co-operation, emphasizing how these problems, by their very nature, cannot remain circumscribed within a well-defined regional context.\n86.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe achieved its solemn culmination in the Final Act adopted by the 35 countries. It is an Act which improves the atmosphere of detente in inter- European relations and East-West relations in general. Its practical effects will depend on the manner in which it is implemented.\n87.\tThe choice of multilateral forums for dialog does not exclude, but rather favors, the search by the Government of Italy for opportunities for constructive agreement on the bilateral level.\n88.\tThe relations between Italy and those neighboring countries wh'^.h do not belong to the European Economic Community bear witness to our determination to advance also along the path of bilateral cooperation. These relations are in fact excellent; the ties of friendship and co-operation which the Government of Italy has long since initiated with those countries have not only proved to be of mutual advantage but also brought about significant advances. The Government of Italy proposes to continue the policy which it has so decisively begun by giving every possible encouragement to those friendly relations it has so fruitfully established with its neighbors.\n89.\tThe solution of the problems of development and economic co-operation constitutes another essential pillar in that more equitable and stable structure on which we seek to build international relations.\n90.\tWe therefore note with satisfaction that this session of the General Assembly is opening at a moment in which we have clearly in our minds the positive results of the seventh special session, to which\nI made special reference in my statement on behalf of the Community. We must now keep alive the spirit of compromise and mutual understanding which the special session has generated.\n91.\tOne achievement can already be considered as realized. Through focusing the debate on fundamental issues and through the emergence of a more responsible and sensitive approach to the problems of the world economic situation, a growing awareness of the economic interdependence among States, industrialized and developing, consumer and producer, rich and poor, has become apparent.\n92.\tEvery country, on the basis of equality and in accordance with its potential, must be granted active participation in the production process of the world and in the distribution of its benefits.\n93.\tAs I have already said in my statement at the seventh special session, the United Nations, in tackling the issues of development and international economic co-operation, has drawn the attention of the entire community of nations to questions which, being everywhere a cause of concern, insecurity and uneasiness, constitute the most challenging complex of problems which mankind has been called upon to resolve in recent history.\n94.\tThe solution of the problems which I have so far described i feasible only through the observance of those fundamental legal principles which constitute the very basis of the international community and which are essential for its ordered development. Respect for legality postulates the inviolability of the law and its complete accord with international realities.\n95.\tItaly therefore supports the review now being conducted by the United Nations through the codification of current laws as well as the initiation of structural changes, such as those emerging from the laborious and complex search for new lines of agreement governing the utilization of the resources of the sea and the ocean depths.\n96.\tThe evolution of international realities is continually bringing new tasks before the United Nations, which, if it is to tackle them effectively, must constantly refine and improve its own structures.\n97.\tBearing in mind these requirements, the Government of Italy is participating in and requesting initiatives designed to rationalize the activities and machinery of the United Nations. We consider, too, that the proposals made for possible amendments to the Charter are justified. Among the proposals put forward in this field by Italy I would draw attention to that concerning the Commission on Human Rights, which we would like to see given the status of a principal organ of the United Nations within the meaning of Article 7 of the Charter. Italy maintains that the civilized conscience of mankind requires a more decisive effort from the United Nations in defense of human rights, aimed primarily at the elimination of all forms of racial, political and religious discrimination. The peace which Italy desires is not peace obtained through coercion. True peace is that in which everyone can enjoy freedom.\n98.\tLike the ultimate aim of States with respect to national societies, so, too, the ultimate aim of an inter-national system with respect to the community of peoples is man himself. It is precisely this concept which underlies the obligation of the United Nations to defend the fundamental freedoms of the individual. To encourage the international community to advance towards more developed forms of coexistence means, therefore, also to increase this role and this special responsibility of the world Organization. Through the protection of human rights and freedoms, the inter-national community can and must concur in raising the status of man with the final aim of making him, as an individual, the very protagonist of history.\n99.\tThe Charter of the United Nations offers us a set of values which is enlivened by ceaseless contact with international reality. It possesses the capacity for adaptation which will provide valid responses to the demands of mankind. These demands are derived from irreversible, positive changes. There is the change brought about by advancement to an era of interdependence, which makes selfishness outdated and unreal, and which makes any proposal for cooperation and solidarity realistic. There is also the change brought about by a desire for equality as a result of which consensus and joint participation will become the basic principles of the international system of the future.\n100.\tCertainly, such changes are accompanied by disagreements, tensions and confrontations, but these developments in the tortured history of mankind invite us to make a more severe and critical choice of the instruments of dialog and to search more intensively for a way of overcoming conflicts. We must strengthen our option for the multilateral prevention of conflicts as compared with our option of bringing conflicts to an end more or less opportunely. The Italian Government maintains that in the search for a method of peaceful settlement we will never run the risk of dispersal of efforts.\n101.\tItaly is therefore determined to base its contribution to the international community on the awareness of the fundamental interdependence of States, the need for consensus, the recognition of the diversity, but also of the ultimate complementarity, of interests, and on the search for common solutions to common problems.\n102.\tMy country regards the United Nations as all do as a vital point of reference and as the moral conscience of the world community with the aim of progressively creating a climate which will favor meetings of peoples and the development, on the basis of mutual respect, of the great ideals of independence, justice and freedom for both peoples and individuals, in spite of temporary difficulties and setbacks.\n103.\tAs Members of the United Nations we have the will and the potential to respond to the demands of mankind and that will and potential must not be wasted. I am convinced that we shall respond together to the challenge of our times. It is an enormous challenge bui: one within the reach of both nations and men: development with justice, security with justice, stability with justice, peace with justice.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "6.\t  Mr. President, on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates, I would, like to express to you our sincere congratulations on your election to this highly esteemed office, the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. We highly appreciate your well-known competence and long diplomatic experience, and we are confident that the work of the General Assembly will fully succeed under your wise chairmanship.\n7.\tI would like to seize this opportunity to extend our congratulations to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, for his wise and successful leadership of the last session.\n8.\tWe would like also to express our thanks to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his tireless efforts aimed at strengthening the United Nations and furthering its role in the maintenance of international peace and security. His visit last February to our country and other Gulf countries was most successful. He was able to see closely the efforts of our Government in promoting economic and social development. His visit provided us with the opportunity to discuss with him all matters pertaining to the strengthening of the United Nations and the enhancement of its role in the solution of international problems.\n9.\tIt gives me great pleasure to extend our warmest congratulations to the new Members of our Organization, namely, the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde, and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. We are confident that the admission of these States will add to the vitality and universality of our Organization. We are prepared to co-operate in all spheres with these States for the mutual benefit of our peoples and the world at large.\n10.\tAs did the twenty-ninth session, our present session faces problems and challenges of serious dimensions. The peoples of the world look to our Organization with high expectations for the solution to these problems and for the complete elimination of the causes of war and total destruction.\n11.\tNeedless to say, the question of Palestine is one of the most important and urgent problems that requires serious and immediate consideration. We noted with satisfaction the positive way the previous session dealt with this question. The inclusion of the question as a separate item on its agenda, and the adoption of the two resolutions, one emphasizing the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine, including the right of return and the right of self- determination [resolution 3236 (XXIX)], and the other \ngranting the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] observer status to the United Nations and other international organizations [resolution 3237 (XXIX)], were of great historical significance. The inclusion of the item and the adoption of the two resolutions reflected the achievements of the people of Palestine in their arduous struggle. Furthermore, it symbolized the support given by the Arab States, the countries of the third world and other freedom-loving countries to the Palestinian people in their struggle for justice and liberation.\n12.\tOne year has already elapsed since the adoption of the resolution on the rights of the people of Palestine. Yet Israel has not taken any steps whatsoever to facilitate the return of the Palestinians to their lands and properties. Rather, it continues to deny the very existence of the Palestinians as a people, and stubbornly refuses to recognize the right of the Palestinians to enjoy their inalienable rights, including the right to self-determination. It persists, not only in the usurpation of that people's material possessions, but also in deliberately attacking their spiritual and cultural heritage, by abolishing the religious and cultural monuments in Palestine created by the Palestinian people over a long period of history. Nothing could more starkly illustrate this policy of Israel than the continuous threat to which the Islamic and holy places in Jerusalem and Al-Khalil (\\\"Hebron\\\") are subjected.\n13.\tIn order to preserve its values and to prevent the deterioration of the present situation which is fraught with imminent dangers to world peace and security, the international community should not tolerate Israeli disregard and defiance of the United Nations resolutions. The proper response by the international community to such defiance of the international will would be in line with the recommendations recently adopted by a great number of States, members of the family of nations, at the Conference of Islamic Foreign Ministers, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Non-Aligned Countries.\n14.\tIn view of Israel's persistent defiance, the three Conferences recommended measures for forcing Israel to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions, including the application of sanctions as laid down in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Hence, it is imperative that the General Assembly at this session should adopt resolutions that go beyond mere reiterated support of the rights of the Palestinian people, and the urging of Israel to implement United Nations resolutions. We should adopt resolutions which include both an unequivocal order to Israel to implement the resolutions, and in case Israel persists in its policy of refusal and defiance, a clear reference to the implementation of the sanctions laid down in Chapter VII of the Charter.\n15.\tAmong the questions that concern us and cause us anxiety is the question of the continuous rule by the racial minority in South Africa, Rhodesia and Namibia. Once again, we reiterate our view that the continuing application of the policy of apartheid by the racist Government of Pretoria against the non- white majority of the population in South Africa is immoral, contravenes the principles of justice and equity, constitutes a defiance to human conscience and values, and violates the Charter of the United Nations.\n16.\tOur delegation participated in the Security Council's recent discussion of the questions of South Africa and Namibia. Our participation was motivated by our great concern and deep conviction that the perpetration of such inhuman and illegal situations in those two countries threatens peace and security in Africa, and consequently endangers international peace and security.\n17.\tWe, like our brothers in Africa, sincerely hope for a peaceful settlement of this problem. In the absence of such a settlement, we cannot but support materially and morally the African liberation movements that lead the struggle of their peoples to win back their dignity and to achieve their noble goals of freedom and independence.\n18.\tAs regards Western Sahara, we hope that Spain our friend will respect the resolution of the General Assembly which provided that no action be taken with regard to that territory until the handing down of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice [resolution 3292 (XXIX)].\n19.\tOne of the international problems awaiting urgent settlement is the question of Cyprus. We support the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. We appreciate the sincere efforts made by the Secretary-General to mediate between the two communities with a view to reconciling their differences. We attach great importance to the maintenance of peace and security on the island. This feeling is not only due to its geographical proximity to our Arab region, but also because of the historical, humanitarian and cultural bonds which we share with the parties to the dispute both Greeks and Turks.\n20.\tAs a small developing country, we are deeply concerned with the maintenance of peace and security in our region. Thus, my country warmly welcomed the settlement of disputes between our two neighbors, Iraq and Iran. We congratulate them on this achieve-ment. We also hope that all pending disputes in the Gulf region will be resolved in a constructive spirit of co-operation.\n21.\tWe also wish to reiterate our support for the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. It is of the utmost importance that this zone, of which we are a part, be free from big Power rivalries. Our goal is to see the Indian Ocean a zone where constructive and co-operative relations exist among its States, based on equality of rights and duties and free from interference by any State in the internal affairs of another. The States of this zone need to mobilize their resources and energies for the development of their national economies and to secure basic necessities which constitute the prerequisites for emerging from the economic and social backwardness from which they suffer.\n22.\tMy Government has also supported the United Nations resolutions regarding the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East. We believe that the best method for the establishment of such a zone is for all parties concerned to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex].\n23.\tAs regards the situation in Indo-China, we warmly welcome the restoration of peace in that region. We wish the peoples of Indo-China every success in their efforts to rebuild what the war destroyed and to develop their national economies.\n24.\tOn the international level, we support the efforts aiming at the easing of tensions among the big Powers. My country considers the results achieved at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, held in Helsinki, as positive and useful. The wise steps taken by the two super-Powers to bring an end to their accelerating arms race are well received and supported by us. It is indeed deplorable that this international trend towards the protection of mankind from the scourges of the modern war machine does not find a similar response among the rulers of Israel.\n25.\tThe recent press reports on the pending acquisition by Israel of highly sophisticated weapons of great destructive capability, to be added to its arsenal, are of great concern to us. Indeed, further aggrandizement of Israel's oversaturated arsenal by such lethal weapons would cause apprehension and alarm in all parts of the Arab world. Needless to say, the supplying of the Israeli war machine with such weapons could only lead to the threatening of international peace and security.\n26.\tThis session comes after the successful conclusion of the deliberations of the seventh special session of the General Assembly and in the wake of the adoption of the resolutions of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned countries, held at Lima in August. The resolutions adopted at Lima reflect the new spirit of change which is beginning to find its way into the arena of international relations. The old concepts, based on discrimination among the peoples of the world and on inequality in their relations, have been shaken to their roots. As a consequence of centuries of colonialism, the peoples of the third world, after achieving political independence, have found themselves in a situation of backwardness and are engulfed in an international economic order which does not correspond to their aspirations for advancement and their goals for development.\n27.\tThe individual experience of each people, and the similarity of the problems confronting all developing countries, have led the peoples and the Governments of these countries to search for new avenues in international relations. In their endeavour to establish a more equitable and logical world order that properly reflects their real needs, the countries of the third world have refused to join blocs or alliances, and instead have searched for means of co-operation among themselves, as well as with the other States of the world, based on the respect for sovereignty, democracy in international relations, and the struggle against aggression, colonialism and exploitation in all its forms.\n28.\tIn the economic field, these States called for the establishment of a new economic order, one that is more equitable and closer to meeting the needs ot development and improving the living standards ot the majority of the human race. The Lima resolutions embodied in their provisions the gamut of this historical experience.\n29.\tMy country, a faithful adherent to the principles of the non-aligned movement and a partisan of peaceful international co-operation, has generously contributed to alleviating the suffering of developing countries and to supporting their efforts to advance their peoples and to develop their economies. Immediately after the restructuring of oil prices and the availability of an apparent surplus, my country decided to allocate a large portion of our earnings from our only natural resource, oil, to the support of developing countries, despite a weak and newly created administrative apparatus. In purely numerical terms, our aid has amounted to over a quarter of our gross national product. In real terms, however, when the vast needs of our people for education, hospital facilities, urban development and culture are taken into account, the ratio of our aid to our gross national product greatly outweighs the significance of these numbers in absolute terms.\n30.\tWe also support the positive results achieved by the seventh special session, which we consider as a first step on the road towards full equality in economic relations among States. Though the decisions adopted at that session do not fully meet all the demands presented by the developing countries, we consider readiness to implement them as the yardstick for measuring the good intentions of the developed nations.\n31.\tWe are looking forward with great expectation and optimism to the next meeting, to be held in Paris, on energy, raw materials and development. It gives us great pleasure to serve as host for the next round of the Arab-European dialog, to be held in November of this year, to further explore areas of co-operation between the two regional groupings. We shall do our utmost for the participants and for the success of the meeting.\n32.\tDespite the complexity of the problems of our contemporary world, the successes achieved by mankind in the context of the United Nations during the last three decades strengthen our hope and increase our optimism about the future of co-operation and friendship among nations. My country pledges itself to fulfill sincerely the objectives of the Charter.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "148.\t I am happy to have this opportunity to speak in this Assembly as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Co-operation of my country, and I would immediately wish to associate the delegation of Chad, which I have the honor to head, with the tributes which previous speakers have paid to the President on the occasion of his election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that thanks to his diplomatic and statesmanlike qualities, which are unanimously recognized in Europe and in the United Nations, our work will certainly be successful in spite of the problems facing the international community. The delegation of Chad takes particular pleasure in the fact that in this year of the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations the presidency of our Assembly falls to a statesman whose country will never forget the sufferings of the last war. We are convinced, too, that he will make it his primary duty to remind us constantly of the will of those leaders who sought at any cost to prevent a renewal of the same tragedy by creating the system of the United Nations, which has now become one of the strongest bulwarks of men against barbarism.\n149.\tI should also like on this occasion to congratulate the outgoing President, Mr. Bouteflika, the\n! Foreign Minister of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, who is the pride of the whole of Africa and the third world and who, in the midst of political tensions and the divergent interests of influence brokering, conducted the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session of our General Assembly with such brilliance, tact and success. I should like to pay a warm tribute to him and, through him, to his country, Algeria, with which Chad enjoys excellent relations.\n150.\tMy warmest congratulations go also to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our Secretary-General, who ceaselessly works, with discretion but very effectively, for international peace and security.\n151.\tPermit me, on behalf of the High Military Council of the Provisional Government of Chad, to welcome our three brother countries just admitted to membership in the United Nations: the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the People's Republic of Mozambique. My delegation is delighted at this overwhelming victory over the colonialist forces in Africa.\n152.\tChad comes to this thirtieth session of the General Assembly with a new image. The wind of liberty and justice which has blown through Chad has swept away the unpopular regime in power prior to 13 April 1975.\n'153. I must recall what I have already had occasion to say in different international forums. Some still remember the political situation which prevailed in Chad before the military coup d'etat. The country was plunged in benighted obscurantism; national unity was being completely eroded because of the armed rebellion, the policy of social injustice, and the fact that the most elementary democratic liberties were being trampled under foot; the financial situation was catastrophic because of the squandering of public funds; the national economy was in full recession, and the army had been humiliated. Poverty, ignorance, unemployment, waste, peculation and corruption had become the rule in a country in ruins.\n154.\tIt was because of this tragic situation that a group of officers of the armed forces, swayed by patriotism and heeding the will of the nation of Chad, determined to overthrow on 13 April a regime which was no longer in keeping with the legitimate aspirations of the people, and henceforth to guide the destiny of the nation of Chad towards a better future.\n155.\tThus, the High Military Council, supreme organ of the State, and the Provisional Government of Chad determined to carry out a coherent program of action. Within the country the authorities restored the liberties of the citizens of Chad, including freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of worship. The lay State of Chad recognizes and guarantees liberty of belief and worship for all. There is no established State religion. Moreover, Chad respects the fundamental Charter of Human Rights, and will therefore thus respect the lawful rights and aspirations of all citizens of Chad, inside and outside the country, both exiles and those who took part in the rebellion. In due course a national constituent assembly will be elected on the basis of universal suffrage, in order to draft a constitution.\n156.\tIn the economic and social field, when the army took power, the country was on the edge of the \nprecipice. After 15 years of independence, the economy bequeathed to us by the colonialists had remained stagnant, if it was not actually deteriorating. No coherent policy in this field was undertaken by the former regime in order to effect any real improvement in the country's situation.\n157.\tIn the face of that situation, the High Military Council and the Provisional Government undertook in their program of action a series of measures affecting all sectors with a view to improving gradually the level of the national economy.\n158.\tChad intends to diversify foreign participation in its economic development. That is why we are against any allegiance to a foreign bloc, but we want to have good relations with all those who are ready to maintain good relations with us.\n159.\tWith reference to my country's foreign relations, I should like to state solemnly from this rostrum, on behalf of the High Military Council and the Provisional Government of Chad, that we unreservedly support the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity [OAU], and we shall pursue a policy of non-alignment and a completely free foreign policy.\n160.\tMy country respects all the agreements that have been duly entered into in the past and reserves its right to denounce and revise certain agreements that are not in keeping with the aspirations of the people of Chad, who has suffered so much injustice.\n161.\tThat, very briefly, is the program of action of the. High Military Council and the Provisional Government of Chad, on whose behalf I appeal to friendly and fraternal countries to strengthen active co-operation and enlightened solidarity among States.\n162.\tThe delegation of Chad, which I had the honor of heading during the course of the seventh special session of the General Assembly on development and international co-operation, followed the debates which then took place. Again, unreservedly, we support the very correct priorities of the third world. The satisfactory results for all, both for the countries lacking in capital equipment and the developed countries, in the matter of the establishment of a new international economic order must not be allowed to suffer the fate of previous decisions. At all costs the United Nations, which is the only authentic universal organ of cohesion, must give practical effect to its resolutions, because everyone in this Assembly is aware that order and discipline alone can safeguard peace and the prosperity of the world which is so uncertain today. Until such a line of conduct is adopted by the States Members of our Organization, the consequences which will flow from the current world economic disorder will be immeasurable.\n163.\tThe developed countries, which are responsible for the climate of disorder, can no longer shirk their responsibility. They must bring to bear effective remedies for the present crisis so as rapidly to bring about a world economic balance that will be beneficial to the whole of mankind.\n164.\tIn any case, the ball is right now in the court of the rich, and the third world is waiting to see what they will do.\n165.\tChad has always supported and will continue to support the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations: the maintenance of international peace and security, sovereign equality of all Members, the right of peoples to self-determination, international co-operation among Members, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, and respect for territorial integrity.\n166.\tWe take this opportunity to reiterate our unswerving loyalty to these unchanging principles.\n167.\tHowever, ever since the signing of the Charter in 1945, our world has undergone tremendous political, social and economic changes; science and technology have made great progress in the interests of mankind, and the process of decolonization continues to gain ground in considerable portions of the globe and liberates some of our brothers who are still under the colonial yoke.\n168.\tThe United Nations has always had to confront often difficult and delicate situations especially when it came to having the principles of the Charter respected. However, today the international community numbers 141 Members whereas only 51 countries took part in drafting the Charter in the particular circumstances obtaining immediately after the Second World War.\n169.\tWe cannot fail to observe, furthermore, a steady deterioration in friendly relations among the States Members of the Organization. This deterioration is rooted in the policy of hegemony, imperialism, expansionism, colonialism, racism, zionism and apartheid. The United Nations is the only body competent to confront problems of this importance. Now, it is generally agreed that the Organization is ineffective in the sense that many of its important resolutions have not been implemented or carried out. In the view of my delegation, this failure is due, not only to the lack of political will on the part of Member States to respect the provisions of the Charter, but also and above all to certain machinery and anachronistic practices deriving from these provisions which have completely paralyzed our Organization. A case in point is the right of veto enjoyed by certain Powers.\n170.\tFurthermore, my delegation also believes that the Charter should reflect more faithfully than ever the actual image of our Organization. Let us not be afraid of the desire to change because this is just a part of the normal process of the steady development of our world. The revision of the Charter is part of the logic of events.\n171.\tWith regard to the difficulties which our Organization faces concerning the respect due to the fundamental principles of the Charter, I have to denounce the actions of a great Power, a permanent member of the Security Council, in Chad's internal affairs. I refer to France, which, in its attempts to free a French citizen held hostage by certain citizens of Chad following her imprudent action and deliberate obstinacy, has lavished war material on outlaws in my country. My delegation feels that, with regard to a purely internal matter of Chad, this great Power, which we respect and for which Chad has made so many sacrifices in the course of history to save, namely France, is, we believe, infringing the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Chad. We therefore denounce France's attitude before international public opinion.\n172.\tA former colonial country still suffering atrociously from the consequences of foreign domination, Chad has been a Member of the United Nations since 1960 and a founding member of the OAU, organizations to whose principles and objectives it has never ceased to demonstrate its whole-hearted support, as 1 stressed previously. The unconditional support that we give to the struggle of the peoples still under colonial domination, the struggle against apartheid and Zionism, constitutes one of the fundamental planks of the program of action of the High Military Council and the Provisional Government of Chad.\n173.\tTherefore, my delegation can only express its satisfaction at the progress recently achieved in the process of decolonization. We do, however, deplore the slow tempo of the process in certain parts of the world and the wrongful exercise of the veto to block this process in others.\n174.\tWe should also like to recall the fact that these erroneous doctrines, the denial of universal justice, human rights and fundamental freedoms, contain within themselves the germs of potential dangers to peace, not only for Africa, but also for the world at large.\n175.\tMy delegation is gratified at the accession to independence of former Portuguese colonial Territories, and most recently of all the accession to independence of Papua New Guinea.\n176.\tHowever, we are very much distressed at the serious deterioration of the situation in Angola, where violent fratricidal fighting has been taking place. That poor country, which for so long has been waging an arduous struggle at the cost of indescribable suffering and sacrifices to free itself from foreign domination, should not, any more than those who have just traveled the same road before it, have to be preoccupied right now with anything but the rehabilitation of its national heritage.\n177.\tAlthough at one time we expressed admiration for the attitude of the Portuguese authorities with regard to decolonization, we are puzzled by and skeptical about its inability to implement the Alvor Agreement [see Al10040]. Indeed, how can we fail to be alarmed when we learn that, on the pretext of ensuring protection for workers in accordance with the recently concluded agreements between Pretoria and Lisbon, and of protecting a pumping station vital for cattle raising in Ovamboland, South Africa is intervening directly in the conflict by sending troops to the southern part of Angola?\n178.\tMindful of the unfair maneuvering and the malevolent designs of the imperialists to challenge constantly the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries they have been forced to leave, we would exhort our brothers in Angola, who are, in any case, well aware of this, not to allow themselves to be taken in by this play to divide them, or to be persuaded to announce the political tendency of their regime before the actual proclamation of independence on 11 November.\n179.\tSimilarly, although we concede that for purely humanitarian reasons the United Nations might organize an air lift to supply food and medicine to Angola, we cannot support the idea of sending troops there, since Portugal, the Administering Authority, must assume its full responsibilities itself.\n180.\tThe desire of Africans to find a peaceful settlement to the problems of Zimbabwe requires no further demonstration. It is only the intransigence, obstinacy and refusal of the illegal racist minority regime of Ian Smith which is creating obstacles. So if the people of Zimbabwe do not rapidly succeed in achieving their legitimate aspirations by means of a just and peaceful solution, the only alternative open to Africans will be armed struggle. They will be able and willing to make the necessary sacrifices for that. Mounting pressures and the intensification of the nationalist guerrilla war seem to be the only language which Ian Smith and his clique understand. Be that as it may, majority rule is the only formula acceptable to my Government in the case of Rhodesia.\n181.\tOn the question of South Africa, the most serious problem is that of apartheid and racial discrimination, which the Vorster Government continues to practice, in defiance of human rights and of the principles of the United Nations Charter. Indeed, all the resolutions adopted by the United Nations, its various organs and specialized agencies condemning apartheid have remained dead letters for the Vorster regime, which recently claimed that \\\"there is not a single State in the world that would agree to change its domestic policy as a result of any request made by third-party States. , . . South Africa is no more willing to do that than France would be.\\\"\n182.\tThe international community as a whole must no longer hesitate ruthlessly to ostracize the South African State in its present form. The South African Government must abandon its hateful policy, begin discussions with the South African liberation movements, free the imprisoned leaders, including Nelson Mandela, lift the restrictions on the liberty of others, and cease its so-called bantustan policy.\n183.\tWe also believe that the belated announcements of the alleged cessation of the sale of arms, including the \\\"Crotale\\\" missiles, to the South African Government are nothing but a decoy, because those who made them have already armed the protagonists of apartheid to the teeth and have given them the technological means to manufacture their own weapons. It is also clear that the cessation of these sales will be selective. Moreover, at the very time when such pronouncements are being made with the cynical idea of misleading Africans, Mr. Vorster's friends are sending one trade mission after another to Pretoria, while the published statistics make shamelessly clear the scale of their trade transactions with South Africa that increase the power of the racist regime which they profess to condemn. Just as apartheid and Zionism are to be denounced and condemned, so is' the criminal behavior of those countries.\n184.\tThe whole of Africa rejoiced at the proclamation, on 6 July last, of the sovereign independence of the people of the Comoros following the clear referendum of 22 December 1974. As we might have expected, this verdict of the people of the Comoros did not please either the colonial Power, which was compelled to leave the Territory, nor the querulous expatriates, who are still behaving like conquerors there and imagining that they will prevail. \n185.\tWe have no intention of getting involved in problems affecting the stability of the Comoros Government that face the indigenous people of that country, whose aspirations to self-determination and independence we firmly support. But we condemn any outside intervention that may imperil the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the archipelago, inasmuch as its component islands Mayotte, Moheli, Anjouan and Grande-Comore have, ever since 1912, clearly shared a common administrative and legal regime. There is no reason why, once they become independent, they should become powerless.\n186.\tOne of our immediate concerns is the Middle East question. My delegation remains convinced that respect for the usurped rights of the Palestinians is the indispensable element for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the area.\n187.\tIn South-East Asia the valiant people of Viet Nam, in the course of their long and arduous struggle for the independence of their country, have won a historic victory. My delegation would like to pay a warm tribute to the heroism of the Vietnamese people. We are still convinced that the simultaneous entry into the United Nations, as full Members, of the Governments of the Republic of South Viet Nam and the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam will confirm the principle of the universality of our Organization, and we shall support any initiative along these lines.\n188.\tMy delegation hails the presence in our Assembly of the authentic representatives of the Cambodian people, whose victory, won at the price of an incalculable struggle against the aggressor and for the defense and safeguarding of dignity, liberty, justice and peace, is a victory for the whole of the third world. We take particular pleasure in this because the Government of Chad was one of the first to recognize and support the Government of National Union of Cambodia under Prince Norodom Sihanouk. My delegation has always striven here for the restoration of that Government's legitimate rights in the United Nations,\n189.\tWe also support the struggle of the people of Laos to build an independent, neutral, united and prosperous country.\n190.\tWith regard to the question of Korea, I should like to repeat the position of my Government: we should like to see united the two fraternal Korean peoples, which are divided today. In this regard, I appeal to the Governments in Seoul and Pyongyang to continue their reunification efforts on the basis of the joint communique of 4 July 1972.2\n191.\tThat is why we welcome the inclusion in the agenda of the item concerning the creation of favorable conditions for converting the armistice into a durable peace in Korea and accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea [item U9\\.\n192.\tThe situation in the Mediterranean, where Cyprus has been the victim of foreign aggression, remains a matter of concern. My delegation would therefore like to appeal to the parties to the conflict to see to it that their efforts lead to the rapid restoration of peace and unity in this island. We call on the international community to apply immediately the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, particularly General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) and Security Council resolutions 365 (1974) and 367 (1975).\n193.\tPeace and security in the world are in danger because of the accumulation and perfecting of the weapons of destruction, in which the developed countries have been engaged for years now. This tension would be eased, if not eliminated, if the astronomical sums of money squandered in the arms race could be used to abolish poverty in the world.\n194.\tThe question of disarmament, the proliferation of weapons and nuclear tests has long been a matter of concern to us, but still no satisfactory solution has been found. It would seem that difficulties stem from the fact that some people are making a taboo of this business which nobody can breach. However, we should not like to minimize the efforts made so far and which continue to be made in order to achieve a global solution.\n195.\tBut when we think of the disasters which precisely led the world to create the United Nations, we are inclined to believe that in the final analysis the proper place to deal with the substantive question of disarmament, proliferation of weapons and nuclear tests can be only within the framework of a world conference where those who possess most destructive weapons just as those who do not great and small  can freely express their opinions, because if a world conflagration were to occur, the effects of thermonuclear weapons, for example, would not be felt simply by those who produce them but in some degree by the whole of mankind.\n196.\tIf we look back at what our Organization has done in the 30 years of its existence and at the changes which have occurred in the world over that period we see that the conscience of the world is developing. This is because the peoples are fighting for dignity, freedom and peace in a word, for a more fraternal and more equitable order. Nevertheless, there are causes that must be removed as soon as possible. I am referring to the threats of war and their corollaries such as the arms race and the uncontrolled traffic in war material; the accepted and even supported violations of human rights through the heinous doctrines of apartheid and zionism; the persistence of shameful colonialism; the doctrine that \\\"might makes right\\\" in the distribution of wealth. We would do well to dwell on past conflicts with their indescribable horrors and their unprecedented toll of suffering. We must bend all our efforts to the building of a better world in which love for one's neighbor and international co-operation on a footing of total equality will be our only way of life.\n"

        "file_text": "129.\t On behalf of the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho, I wish to extend to the President my warm congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that this Assembly is going to benefit greatly not only from his unquestionable ability as a statesman but also from his wide experience as a diplomat. To us, his election is particularly significant because it underscores one of the cardinal principles of our Organization, that is, the sovereign equality of States irrespective of their size, wealth or population. I wish to assure him, together with the Vice-Presidents, of the readiness of my delegation to co-operate with him in the discharge of his onerous responsibilities.\n130.\tI wish to take this opportunity to congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, for the skillful manner in which he presided over our work during the historic twenty- ninth and the seventh special sessions. Through his courage, determination, statesmanship and commitment to freedom and justice, he has rendered yeoman service to the international community.\n131.\tIt gives me special pleasure to welcome in our midst the delegations of the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, and the Republic of Cape Verde. Their long, heroic and successful struggle for freedom and independence bears eloquent testimony to the determination of the peoples of Africa to rid their continent of the remaining vestiges of colonialism and imperialism. The emancipation of these former Portuguese Territories has given impetus to the struggle for freedom and justice of the peoples of southern Africa still under oppression and white domination.\n132.\tWe congratulate Papua New Guinea on its accession to independence and we hope it will soon join this Assembly as a new Member. With all these new Members, the United Nations has become stronger and more representative of the peoples of our one world. We of the third world are particularly pleased with this development which is in line with the principle of universality enshrined in the Charter of our Organization. For us, the United Nations provides a useful forum for airing our grievances and seeking redress against exploitation and injustice. We have no qualms or fears about the so-called \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\".\n133.\tThis year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations. It is therefore fitting that we should review and assess the achievements and failures of the Organization as the principal instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security. To the extent that there has been no major war since the birth of this Organization, the original authors of the Charter can rightly pride themselves in having created an Organization that has contributed to saving \\\"succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\". This, indeed, is a significant achievement, for we are all well aware of the catastrophic consequences for humanity of a major war in this era of lethal biological and nuclear weapons.\n134.\tIt is to the credit of our Organization that its membership has grown from the original 51 to 141 in the short period of three decades. Taking account of the sweep of world history, this achievement of initiating, in one generation, a process of decolonization affecting nearly 100 nations, is, indeed, significant in its import for, and impact upon, international relations. As a result of the activities of the United Nations in the political, economic and social fields, the world will never be the same again.\n135.\tThe foregoing remarks notwithstanding, an objective record of the United Nations, one that truly reflects its performance, can emerge only if its activities are measured against the yardstick of the broad and comprehensive provisions of the Charter. As a result of localized conflicts in which Member States are directly or indirectly involved, humanity has teetered on the brink of a global war while the United Nations has stood and watched helplessly. All too often, solutions or attempted solutions to such conflicts have come from outside the United Nations system and, in the process, not only has the stature of the Organization been reduced, but its authority has been undermined. Unless immediate steps are taken to rectify this unhappy situation by invoking or altering the relevant sections of the Charter, the next 30 years could see a serious deterioration in the power and influence of the world body.\n\u25a036. A telling commentary on the weakness of the United Nations system is the fact that, while more than two thirds of humanity lives in poverty, ignorance, hunger and disease, billions of dollars are annually expended in the production of, and traffic in, the instruments of war and destruction. Over the past 20 years, our Organization has churned out pious resolutions and high-sounding declarations promising to redress existing inequalities between the rich and the poor. All too often, however, such resolutions and declarations have been reduced to agendas for further discussion rather than blueprints for effective action. The blame for these failures lies, not with the United Nations, but squarely with its Member States, which have been unable to reconcile their narrow national interests with their wider international obligations. When, may we ask, is the international community going to realize that the anger, resentment and frustration of the poor are more dangerous and powerful than the most lethal military weapons?\n137.\tWe have tried to show that this Organization suffers from institutional weaknesses which affect its ability to respond promptly and effectively to situations that could lead to a breakdown of the present international order. My delegation therefore looks forward to the report of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization and hopes that Member States will show sufficient political will to ensure that, as the Organization enters the second 30-year span of its existence, the United Nations will remain an international body capable not only of averting wars but also of ensuring human dignity through co-operation and mutual assistance in the exploitation of the world's resources.\n138.\tThe peoples of the third world are suffering from economic and financial ills originating in the industrialized countries of the world. The current international economic disorder, dominated by the economically advanced countries, is characterized by recession, rampant inflation, unemployment and balance-of-payments problems.\n139.\tAccording to facts and figures supplied by authoritative sources, the international economic situation is depressing if not frightening. In many countries, rates of economic growth have fallen by 50 per cent over the past year. International Monetary Fund studies show that poor countries face a cumulative balance-of-payments deficit of $35,000 million this year. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development report for 1974 describes the situation as one where the poorest countries are entrapped in poverty and in incipient disaster. Official development assistance is said to be declining from the present 0.33 per cent to a projected 0.22 per cent by 1980, and the purchasing-power of the dollar has decreased by 35 per cent during the past year. The recently announced 10 per cent increase in the price of oil will further dislocate the economies of developing countries like mine.\n140.\tWhat disturbs us most is the apparent indifference of the majority of industrialized countries to the economic plight of non-industrialized States, from which the former obtain most of the raw materials for their industries. A case in point is the reluctance or failure of most developed countries to transfer at least 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to developing countries by the end of the Second United Nations Development Decade. Only 16 months ago, this Assembly approved the Declaration and the program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-Vl) and 3202 (S-VI)]. Nine months have passed since the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] was adopted by this Assembly. Alas, those declarations seem to have been relegated to the limbo of forgotten things.\n141.\tPerhaps some positive action will be taken after the recently concluded seventh special session, which ended in a broad consensus. We welcome particularly the proposals regarding special assistance to landlocked States, the transfer of real resources, the reform of the international monetary system, the establishment of a link between special drawing rights and development assistance, increased food production, and better marketing facilities for agricultural products, both in the raw and the processed forms.\n142.\tIn spite of their own economic problems, we hope other industrialized countries will emulate the British example, as expressed at the current session by Mr. James Callaghan, United Kingdom Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs; and \\\"respond with urgency and a sense of justice to the manifest social and economic inequalities in the world today . . .\\\" [2358th meeting, para. 62]. The message of this commendable statement is clear: namely, that in today's interdependent world, no country can exist and prosper in isolation.\n143.\tMy Government believes firmly in rural development with agriculture as the pivot. This is clearly reflected in our second five-year development plan, which we are about to launch. By mobilizing local resources and using foreign aid judiciously, we hope to achieve a growth rate of at least 25 per cent in agricultural production. To achieve this high target, emphasis will be placed on projects which have a high employment and training content and which are also directly productive and revenue-earning. In this way, we hope, the incomes of the poor will be raised and the fruits of development will be felt where they are most needed, namely, at the village level.\n144.\tWe are extremely grateful to all Governments that are generously assisting us with our rural development programs. With their continued support and, we hope, that of others, Lesotho can quite easily reach self-sufficiency in cereal grains, such as maize, sorghum and wheat; grain legumes, such as beans, peas and cowpeas; in vegetables; in meat in all its forms beef, mutton, pork and in dairy and poultry products. We regard agriculture not only as a stepping- stone to industrialization but as the true basis of self- reliance as well. We are sharply aware of the manner in which some countries, including apartheid South Africa, use food as an instrument of their foreign policies.\n145.\tMy country has participated actively in all sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Because of the high costs, in -terms of both money and time, we hope that every effort will be made to reach final agreement at the next session, to be held in New York early next year. As a uniquely land-locked country, completely surrounded by racist South Africa, Lesotho would like to see a convention which would guarantee not only its right to free and unimpeded access to the sea, but also its right to share in both the living and nonliving resources of the economic zone along the shores in the southern part of our continent.\n146.\tWe are confident that a mutually acceptable formula can be found to accommodate the interests of both coastal and land-locked States. In this regard, we think it is time the international community should adopt special measures to protect us against a regime which invokes international law regarding its territory and airspace but treats the international community with contempt.\n147.\tWe have watched recent developments in the Middle East with great interest. To the extent that the Sinai disengagement agreement represents a first step towards creating a framework for peace in the Middle East, it is a significant breakthrough. None the less, many fundamental problems remain unresolved. At the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, my Government voted in favor of resolution 3210 (XXIX) because we recognized the inalienable right of the people of Palestine to exist as a nation. In the view of my delegation, therefore, further negotiations on the Middle East question must take cogni-. zance of this vital element, which is recognized in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 340 (1973), 341 (1973) and 344 (1973). Like most members of the Assembly, we recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole and authentic spokesman of the Palestinian people.\n148.\tMy Government is confident that, with serious determination on the part of all concerned, the nations of the Middle East including Israel can find a formula for the full expression of their national identities and existence. It is in the context of this conviction that I wish to reiterate my Government's unequivocal opposition to the occupation of Arab territories and attempts to change their demographic and economic nature for the benefit of Israel.\n149.\tAs you know, Lesotho is a small country in a difficult geographic situation. We are, therefore, particularly sensitive to the problem of Cyprus a small, non-aligned nation whose sovereignty and integrity have been flagrantly violated. The failure of the United Nations to prevent interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus by other States constitutes the most direct threat to the freedom, independence and sovereignty of small countries, whose continued survival depends on their collective voice and strength under the aegis of this Organization. In the view of my Government, interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus has complicated the task of the Secretary- General, who has indefatigably sought to encourage bi-communal talks in terms of the mandate conferred upon him by General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) and Security Council resolution 367 (1975). That the Secretary-General has managed, in the face of over-whelming difficulties, to keep up the momentum of such talks is a credit to his tact and diplomatic skill.\n150.\tMy Government welcomes the ending of hostilities in Indo-China after years of carnage and destruction. It behooves the international community, and this Organization in particular, to replace the indifference with which it treated the Indo-China wars with generous assistance in the urgent task of reconstruction and rehabilitation. In welcoming the \ndelegation of Cambodia to its rightful place in this Assembly, I should like to express the earnest hope of my delegation that the two Viet Nams will soon attain membership in this Organization.\n151.\tMy Government supported the 1973 consensus on Korea, which underlined the importance of the negotiations then under way between the North and the South. In our view, that consensus provides a sound basis for further discussion of the Korean question in order to avoid a futile debate of charge and counter-charge. Clearly, a continuing dialog among the people of Korea, unhindered by external interference, is the only solid premise for a lasting resolution of the Korean question. Any solution to the Korean problem must take into account the legitimate misgivings and fears of both sides.\n152.\tThe situation in southern Africa has thus far eluded all efforts aimed at removing once and for all the specter of a racial holocaust which could easily engulf the whole of mankind. The ghost of colonialism and racism continues to haunt millions of people in the subcontinent. Resolutions of this Assembly, decisions of the Security Council, too numerous to cite, have failed to exorcise this ghost.\n153.\tThe independence of the People's Republic of Mozambique has demonstrated the illusory nature of a permanent white minority beachhead in southern Africa. The heroic victory of Frente de Libertafao de Mozambique [FRELIMO], after 10 years of hard and often bitter struggle, has signaled the end of white supremacy. Taking a leaf from FRELIMO, the peoples of southern Africa are more determined than ever before to free themselves from the shackles of cruel political repression and merciless economic exploitation. My Government has consistently warned of the danger of racial conflict in southern Africa all too often, it must be admitted, to no avail.\n154.\tAs far back as 1966, my Prime Minister, Mr. Leabua Jonathan, tried to establish a working relationship with the South African authorities. He was, in fact, the first African head of State to establish formal contact with Pretoria. Our efforts, which were intended to pave the way for racial understanding and co-operation among all the people of southern Africa, failed because South Africa insisted that all discussions with it must be within the framework of its apartheid policies. On its own admission, South Africa has not moved from that position and is busy seeking international recognition on the basis of its apartheid policies,\n155.\tIn 1969 the OAU adopted the Lusaka Manifesto, which spell out the conditions under which Africa would be prepared to talk to the racists in Pretoria and Salisbury and the colonialists at Lisbon. The Manifesto has now been superseded by the Dar es Salaam Declaration on Southern Africa, which was adopted earlier this year by the Council of Ministers of the OAU at its ninth extraordinary session. Inter alia, the Declaration rejects dialog or detente with the white minority regimes. Specifically, Africa rejects any contacts with Pretoria and Salisbury which do not involve the indigenous people of the country concerned and which are outside the aegis of the OAU.\n156.\tIn spite of this unequivocal and uncompromising stand by Africa, South Africa continues to seek inter-national recognition by hook or by crook without abandoning its obnoxious policy of apartheid, which has been the subject of debate in this Assembly for the past 30 years. Its well-greased propaganda machine is causing confusion in our ranks while it goes ahead with its plans to fragment not only its own territory but also the United Nations Trust Territory of Namibia. Anxious to clutch at diplomatic straws, the racist regime is openly boasting about the success of its so-called detente policy.\n157.\tThe alternatives before the international community are clear: to continue to condemn and reject apartheid until final victory is won, or to abandon nearly 20 million black people to racial discrimination and white domination in perpetuity. To accept any aspect of apartheid, whether it be through diplomatic contact or recognition of the bantustans, is to choose the latter alternative. The black majority of South Africa is asking for freedom, equality and justice, not a twilight existence in a fragmented South Africa dominated by a white racist minority.\n158.\tMy Government fully supports the African National Council of Zimbabwe and welcomes initiatives from whatever quarter to ensure that the illegal Smith regime is ousted and the will of the majority of the people of Zimbabwe finds expression in the Government of that colony. As the legal authority in Zimbabwe, the United Kingdom should assume its responsibilities and ensure an early and orderly transfer of power from the white minority to the black majority. To leave matters in Ian Smith's inept hands is to court disaster. The African National Council should close its ranks and avoid the political rivalry that is being exploited by the rebel regime and its supporters both in and outside Zimbabwe. Angola, where there is external interference, is a good example of what could happen to a divided Zimbabwe. A propos of Angola, we wish to express our full support for the OAU Conciliation Committee, which was appointed at the recent meeting of the OAU Heads of State and Government at Kampala.\n159.\tThe illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa represents the most serious disregard of the will of the international community of our times. Offers of negotiation by the Security Council are being used by South Africa to buy time for the creation of so- called autonomous areas, that is, ethnically-based mini-States fashioned after its own bantustans. As far as we are concerned, the real test as to whether or not the South African Government is willing or even able to contribute to the eradication of colonialism and racism in southern Africa lies in its attitude towards the Trust Territory of Namibia. In the face of South Africa's intransigence, the attitude of Africa is clearly expressed in the Dar es Salaam Declaration which offers peaceful negotiation with the South West Africa People's Organization as the alternative to an armed struggle. The people of Namibia should not allow themselves to be hoodwinked through bogus constitutional talks designed to entrench apartheid in Namibia.\n160.\tOf all the problems of southern Africa none is more serious than racism which blights the lives of millions of people in that troubled region of Africa.\nEven such euphemisms as \\\"separate development\\\" cannot mask the ugly face of racial discrimination designed to perpetuate white domination in all spheres of life military, economic, political and social. His participation in the Victoria Falls talks notwithstanding, Mr. Vorster is still the king of apartheid, which is stronger today than it ever was. The fearsome apartheid edifice, so carefully constructed over the past quarter of a century, is still intact. In other words, there is no meaningful change within South Africa itself, whose black majority wants freedom and equality and not merely the removal of segregation signs from public parks and libraries. According to an American academic, who recently visited South Africa, Soweto, the African township near Johannesburg, where nearly 1 million Africans live, is \\\"the ultimate ghetto\\\". Over 50 per cent of South Africa's black population lives in the cities without enjoying any civil rights: \\\"Theirs but to do and die\\\" for their white rulers.\n161.\tWe realize only too well that the final solution to the problem of racism in South Africa will have to be found by the people of that country themselves. However, under present circumstances, the majority has neither political nor economic power and can only express their views from a platform chosen by their white rulers, that is, the institutions of apartheid. It is therefore the responsibility of the international community to assist, by all available means, in creating a favorable climate for meaningful discussions and meaningful change among all South Africans, including the opponents of apartheid who are either muzzled, in gaol or in exile. In the words of my Prime Minister, Mr. Leabua Jonathan: \\\"The bridges of understanding and communication must run to Robben Island as well.\\\" Only when this happens will we believe that genuine peace-making efforts are being made to save our subcontinent from widespread racial violence.\n162.\tWe wish to inform the international community that the creation of bantustans around our borders is likely to exacerbate relations between us and South Africa. During the past six years we have been engaged in discussions with South Africa on the establishment of a joint commission to examine and make recommendations on existing boundaries between the two States which were fixed by the colonial regime, at that time, the United Kingdom.\n163.\tWith the possible launching of the first bantustan next year, we are likely soon to find ourselves confronted with the problem of having to negotiate with pseudo-States under Pretoria's manipulation. As I have already indicated, to have any dealings with the bantustans is to accept Mr. Vorster's grand design, namely, the fragmentation of South Africa into mini- States each of which, including the white area, will eventually seek international recognition. We shudder at the thought, but our territorial claims over the conquered territories of the Orange Free State and parts of other provinces of the Republic of South Africa are valid and cannot be abandoned. Hence our fear of an imminent confrontation not only with racist South Africa but with its bantustans. For us, apartheid is a real threat and not just a diplomatic game for the assumption of meaningless moral postures.\n164.\tFrom this podium last year we expressed our reservations and fears about super-Power detente, which seemed like a mutual accommodation rather than a genuine search for permanent peace and security in the world. We are therefore gratified with the encouraging outcome of the recent Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which we hope will lead to better understanding not only in Europe, but elsewhere. It is the considered view of my Government that the future of the world lies in co-operation and mutual assistance among all States, large and small, rather than in ideological blocs, economic groups or military pacts.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "42.\t I am greatly honored to address the Assembly from this rostrum and to convey to the President and to the Assembly the greetings of the Government and people of Fiji,\n43.\tLet me hasten to add Fiji's congratulations to the President on his well-deserved election to the high and responsible office that he holds in this world Assembly, and to assure him of my delegation's full support and co-operation. I wish to express also our appreciation for the continuing good work of our dedicated and hard-working Secretary-General and all his staff in guiding this Organization in its efforts to achieve its objectives.\n44.\tThese objectives the maintenance of peace and security and the promotion of economic and social justice are matters of equal concern to every member of the international community, for no nation alone, or group of nations, can singly assure global peace and security. And no nation can any longer afford to live in complete isolation from events in other parts of the world.\n45.\tWe believe that the more universal the membership of this Organization, the more its effectiveness. Accordingly, we welcome into our midst the new Member States of Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and Mozambique. And we look forward with pleasure to the admission on Friday this week of a fellow Pacific Member State, Papua New Guinea.\n46.\tFor small countries like Fiji, membership of this world body is the logical stage to which we aspire after self-determination. Whether we are Member States or not, we look to the United Nations for recognition and acceptance of our sovereignty and independence. We wish to look to a strong and effective United Nations.\n47.\tMy Government attaches great importance to the universality of membership of this Organization. The United Nations derives its strength and effectiveness from its universality and the support given to it by all its Member States, large and small.\n48.\tWe therefore view with very serious concern developments that lead or tend to lead to a weakening of the role of this body. The Fiji Government will not support any move to expel any Member State which has observed fully and consistently its obligations under the Charter. It is our firm view that any move aimed at dealing with an erring Member State should be considered strictly in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter.\n49.\tThe Fiji Government also regards with deep disappointment the recent decisions to deny membership of the United Nations to aspiring nations. At a time when there is a growing identity of interests and an awareness of our interdependence, it is to be regretted that national self-interests continue to hold primacy over the broader interests of the whole international community.\n50.\tWe in Fiji are totally opposed to all forms of discrimination and injustice at any level and in any country. We condemn any Member State which seeks to enlarge its territorial boundary through force and violence. And we shall continue to oppose all forms of nuclear contamination by any country in any environment.\n51.\tWe do not believe that a lasting solution to any of these problems can be brought about by force or by exclusion from the world family of nations. In seeking solutions to the problems arising from differences and conflicts of national interests, we prefer that the international community should actively encourage peaceful accommodation through continuing dialog and constructive discussions among those directly involved.\n52.\tIt is for this reason that Fiji is deeply appreciative of the sincere efforts of the big Powers to narrow areas of disagreement and misunderstanding among them. In the absence of a universal resolve for general and complete disarmament, mankind can only hope to save itself from total self-destruction through purposeful detente.\n53.\tWe also welcome the recent Sinai agreement between Egypt and Israel and we wish to record our warm appreciation of the efforts of all those concerned, including the United States Government. This agreement is a further significant step towards a comprehensive settlement of the complicated and complex Middle East issue. Such a comprehensive settlement must be based on the principles contained in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In such a settlement, there must be full acceptance of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people as well as secure borders for all States in the region, including Israel.\n54.\tMy delegation also wishes to express the hope that the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will continue their dialog, guided by the joint North-South communique of 4 July 1972.2 And we would urge this Assembly to consider carefully whether the continued presence of the United Nations Command, or any other authority in its place, in the Korean peninsula stands in the way of peaceful North-South reconciliation and reunification, which both sides want.\n55.\tThere are, of course, other areas in which there are conflicts and tensions between countries and peoples, principally in southern Africa. In our view, the best settlements for all concerned cannot be reached by the use of arms. They can be found only through 550\ndialog between the parties directly involved. But dialog and discussion cannot yield positive results unless they are conducted in an atmosphere of open- mindedness, tolerance, trust, undemanding and good will.\n56.\tThese are the principles which guide us in Fiji in our own efforts to maintain peace and harmony in our multiracial society and in our endeavor to promote the well-being of our people in a just and equitable way. They also provide the basis of our approach to our external relationships.\n57.\tThe South Pacific is an area not very well known to many members of this Assembly. Twelve years ago, apart from New Zealand and Australia, there was no other interdependent country in the region. But far-reaching political changes have taken place since then. Western Samoa, Nauru, Tonga, Fiji and Papua New Guinea have all attained independence. The Cook Islands, Niue and the Gilbert and Solomon Islands have all achieved full internal self-government.\n58.\tIn many areas of the world self-determination and independence have beer achieved only after a long and bitter struggle. In the Pacific, however, political progress has been the outcome of a peaceful constitutional process. What has made this possible is a genuine readiness on the part of all those involved to engage in full discussions and consultations in a spirit of mutual understanding and responsiveness to one another.\n59.\tWe in Fyi are firmly committed to upholding the right of subjugated peoples to self-determination and independence, for there can be no lasting peace unless there is an end to political domination and economic exploitation. And it is only when the people are in complete control of their own destiny that they can fully realize their national aspirations and potential.\n60.\tAs an Organization dedicated to the pursuit of global peace and the collective security of mankind, the United Nations must encourage change in the peaceful and orderly way which we ourselves call \\\"the Pacific way\\\".\n61.\tAll of us share a common goal in the need to create an international society founded on respect for international law and order and peaceful co-operation. It is a society in which there is mutual respect among nations without distinction as to size, wealth or power. For unless there is recognition and acceptance of the sovereign right of every nation and people to develop and realize its individuality, there can be no hope for permanent world peace.\n62.\tWe in Fiji take pride in our diversity. Differences in custom, language and beliefs are looked upon as a source of great strength in our multiracial society. Our Constitution ensures the right of adequate representation of every community in our National Assembly. The Constitution also guarantees the fundamental rights and freedoms of every individual in our country.\n63.\tFiji, therefore, had no difficulty, upon joining the world community in October 1970, in accepting the preamble of the Charter oF the United Nations which reaffirms their common \\\"faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small\\\". Thus, we welcome the designation by this distinguished Assembly of 1975 as Inter-national Women's Year.\n64.\tAs a country in which every individual  enjoys equality of status and equal opportunity to participate in all aspects of our national life. Fiji also fully supports the aims and objectives of the Declaration and Plan of Action adopted at the World Conference of the International Women's Year.1 held in Mexico from 19 June to 2 July 1975. It is a matter of national pride for us in Fiji that women in our society have long been actively involved, with outstanding dedication, in public service, in setting a fine example of multiracial co-operative effort and in preserving the values of family life in an increasingly permissive and materialistic world.\n65.\tThe deliberate deprivation of basic human rights and freedom is a denial of our common regard for the dignity and worth of the individual. The protection and promotion of fundamental human rights and the ideal of the brotherhood of man must, therefore, be a vital function of this world body. If there is to be positive and effective action, what is needed is an integrated approach on the part of the United Nations as a whole through, perhaps, \u00ab human rights council with a commissioner for human rights.\n66.\tThe greatest threat to human liberty today is the continuing uncertainty of the world's economy. Rising prices, falling incomes, declining job opportunities, starvation and economic and social inequality, within and between nations, collectively undermine our national efforts to provide our citizens with the fullest opportunity to realize their right to a decent home, a broad and full education, adequate medical care and worthwhile employment.\n67.\tIn a situation of creeping inflation and spreading unemployment, there is a renewed urgency for immediate action by the international community to give every country and its citizens a fair chance. This calls for a massive commitment to measures to liberate the less fortunate from the vicious circle of poverty and to eradicate the widening disparity of wealth and economic opportunities between the rich and the poor, and between the urban populations and the vast majority who live in the rural ureas.\n68.\tIt is unacceptable that while S300.000 million are disbursed annually in military expenditure, millions of people should continue to live on the verge of starvation. And it is intolerable that 53 percent of the world's population should receive only 30 per cent of the world's income, and that the upper JO per cent of income earners, in poor countries should receive over 40 per cent of the total income.\n69.\tIt is imperative for the peaceful and orderly progress of society and the stability of the international community that there should be a collective commitment to practical measures to help the poor.\n70.\tIn this task, the essential first step is a sympathetic understanding, on the part of the economically powerful nations, of the needs and aspirations of others, and a willingness to transfer essential resources on terms that would allow adequate and sustained positive growth in their economies. At the same time, those with small and less viable economies must accept the axiom that their progress and prosperity lie in self-reliance. We believe that there is a limit to the extent to which one can continue to rely on others for the fulfillment of one's needs and aspirations.\n71.\tThe international community has been preoccupied with the formulation of a new international economic order, a new order to be founded on social and economic justice, an order that would ensure the narrowing of the income gap between the developed and developing nations. Our international development strategy, however, should not be restricted to these two economic groups, for there is an emerging fourth world in the least developed of the developing countries, a group towards which greater efforts should be directed in accordance with their development needs.\n72.\tThe labels and concepts of \\\"developed\\\" and \\\"developing\\\" nations and of \\\"donors\\\" and \\\"recipients\\\" are connotative of a colonial pattern of economic relationships, in which, among other roles, colonies and dependent Territories were looked upon primarily as sources of raw materials for the metropolitan Powers. But in a time when former dependent Territories have swelled the ranks of our Organization as sovereign States, there is the urgent need to adapt existing economic and social relationships to current needs and aspirations.\n73.\tAs long as we have an international order in which the world is divided and graded on political and economic levels, there can be no real progress towards international co-operation. What is needed is a new approach based on co-operation rather than confrontation and a new relationship between equal partners based on mutual respect and helpfulness to one another.\n74.\tIn the South Pacific, we have developed a consensus approach with remarkable success in the South Pacific Forum and its economic arm, the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation. These are two regional organizations that have been set up out of a common desire on the part of countries, within the region, including New Zealand and Australia, for consultation and co-operation on all matters of concern to the region. In fact, one of the basic functions of the Bureau is to seek to change the pattern of trade relations in the region in which the newly independent island nations were regarded as plantation areas and as markets for manufactured goods.\n75.\tThe same approach, based on a spirit of compromise and accommodation, has been an integral part of the Commonwealth system of regular consultation and co-operation. Indeed, a major outcome of the Commonwealth consensus approach was the joint Commonwealth report on the New International Economic Order submitted at the recent seventh special session of this Assembly.\n76.\tBut perhaps the most significant recent development in our search for a new pattern of international economic relationships is the Lome Convention, signed between the nine-member European Economic Community and the 46 States of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. It is a comprehensive system of relationships based on equality and mutual respect. But it is more than just a trading relationship; it is a partnership between peoples between the peoples of Europe and the peoples of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. It unites the peoples of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific in a common approach to their new relationship with the peoples of Europe.\n77.\tIt is this link between peoples that gives the Lome Convention its unique character. For economic and social development concerns the welfare of people, and the ultimate aim of development is to provide every citizen with the maximum opportunity and freedom to fulfill his needs and aspirations. Material abundance and infinite growth are important goals, but improving the qualify of life is more important than simply aiming to achieve a higher growth rate of per capita income.\n78.\tThe objectives of a new international economic order should, therefore, lay greater emphasis on a qualitative improvement than on quantitative growth.\n79.\tMost of us are plagued with the twin problems of inflation and unemployment because there has been too much emphasis on material growth and expansion. There is, as a result of this growth mentality, a persistent demand for an increased share of the national income, even when there is zero growth in productivity.\n80.\tBut we all know that higher incomes and better living conditions do not necessarily create greater happiness. All too often a rise in the general standard of material welfare has been accompanied by increased delinquency, vandalism, crime and restlessness.\n81.\tWe, in Fiji, have experienced this phenomenon. The emphasis that we placed on promoting industrialization in our five-year development plan that comes to an end at the end of this year has brought new problems. There has been bitter confrontation between labor and capital. There has been a marked increase in urban drift and the related problems of housing, education and unemployment.\n82.\tIn our next development plan, the Fiji Government is giving the highest priority to improving the quality of life in our rural sector. There is much that can be done to make people comfortable in rural areas. This means devoting more resources to the provisions of roads, water supplies and electricity, and to improving education and health facilities for our rural population. In order that their basic needs for food and shelter may be met, they should be encouraged to appreciate the fact that locally-grown food and locally available building materials could be significantly better than imported items. Our aim should be to improve the subsistence economy of the rural sector but not to substitute for it.\n83.\tAs an oceanic nation composed of a group of islands scattered over 100,000 square miles of ocean, and with relatively limited land resources, we must in future rely to an increasing degree on the resources of the sea that surrounds our island group to support our efforts to improve the standard and quality of life of our people.\n84.\tFiji, therefore, attaches great importance to the success of the critical negotiations currently taking place within the framework of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. It is our hope and expectation that the Conference will give full recognition to and acceptance of our special need. As an archipelagic State, we fee! it a matter of vital importance to us that we should be permitted to enclose the waters that join the many islands in our archipelago with archipelagic baselines, giving us the right to explore and exploit the resources that abound in these waters. At the same time, we would guarantee the right of passage of other nations through those waters.\n85.\tWe therefore hope that more urgent and concerted efforts will be made during the next session of the Conference towards the early conclusion of a comprehensive treaty. We cannot ignore the possibility that failure to reach early agreement over the rational utilization of two thirds of our planet may lead to unrestrained political and commercial rivalry dangerous for the peace and stability of the world.\n86.\tOur endeavor to improve the quality of life of our people will continue to be frustrated so long as the environment in which we live is threatened by nuclear pollution. And there cannot be any lasting peace or stability in our world so long as nuclear-weapon tests continue and the armaments race remains uncontrolled and unchecked. There can be no permanency in a peace based on fear of mutually assured self-destruction. Unless nation States renounce war as an instrument of national policy, armed conflicts and the armaments race will continue to be the greatest threat to global peace and prosperity.\n87.\tThe question of disarmament or, rather, the lack of progress in the field of disarmament is a matter of concern for all States, big and small, near and remote. With the unabated arms race and the stockpiling in ever increasing quantities of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, no corner of this globe can feel secure from the indiscriminate effects of modern warfare. As Mr. Henry Kissinger has stated, all of us friends, neutrals or adversaries  exist on a small planet threatened with extinction. The enormity of this threat increases year by year, and the halting of the nuclear-arms race is proving to be as difficult as reversing it. Peace based on ever more sophisticated nuclear-weapon superiority cannot endure the test of time nor will it inhibit nations possessing the technical capability from wanting to join the nuclear club.\n88.\tDisarmament and the regulation of arms have been among the important objectives of the United Nations for the past 30 years and much has been achieved in the last five years. While some important agreements for the limitation and control of armaments have been achieved, the halting or even the limiting of the arms race in either nuclear or conventional weapons has not proved possible. As the Secretary- General states in the introduction to his report to this session of the General Assembly:\n\\\"The danger of nuclear proliferation not only remains, but has increased; nuclear testing continues; weapons are increasingly sophisticated and deadly, and the technological arms race continually promises new and more horrible developments.\\\" [Aj 100011Add. 1, sect, VIJ I.]\n89. Recognizing the horrible prospects for all of us on this planet, the South Pacific Forum, comprising the heads of Government of the self-governing and independent countries of the region, has become increasingly concerned at the absence of agreement on an effective control of the arms race and the lack of substantial progress on a global scale in the achievement of a comprehensive ban on the testing, production, and deployment of nuclear weapons. Encouraged by the Antarctic Treaty prohibiting nuclear explosions in that area, and by the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) and the Declaration on the De-nuclearization of Africa adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, and by other regional efforts towards the same end, the countries of the South Pacific Forum have taken an increasing interest in the concept of nuclear-weapon-free zones and the importance attached to them as measures to control the nuclear-arms race. Indeed, the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in the introduction to his report to this session of the Assembly, has also stated:\n\\\"In a period where the widespread knowledge of nuclear technology and huge quantities of fissionable material are becoming available, nuclear- weapon-free zones provide the best and the easiest means whereby non-nuclear-weapon States can, by their own initiative and effort, ensure the total absence of nuclear weapons from their territories and enhance their mutual security\\\". [Ibid.]\n90.\tIt is with that consideration in mind that the member countries of the South Pacific Forum Australia, the Cook Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Western Samoa and Fiji after their meeting at Nukualofa on 3 July 1975, issued, inter alia, the following communique:\n\\\"The Forum reiterated its strong opposition to nuclear weapons tests in all environments and called for renewed international efforts towards a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and general and complete disarmament. In particular, the Forum emphasized the importance of keeping the region free from the risk of nuclear contamination and of involvement in a nuclear conflict and commended the idea of establishing a nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific as a means of achieving that aim.\\\"\nThe Forum agreed that it would be desirable for a wider endorsement of the idea to be sought through the adoption of a resolution by the General Assembly and for a study of the feasibility of establishing such a zone to be undertaken.\n91.\tIt is in pursuance of that communique that the delegations of New Zealand and Fiji took the initiative for the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly of an item entitled \\\"Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the South Pacific\\\" [item 120].\n92.\tAs my colleague Mr. J. A. Walding, the Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs of New Zealand [2356th meeting, para. 228], has already explained from this rostrum, at this stage we are merely seeking an endorsement by the Assembly of the idea of the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the South Pacific. In order to find ways and means to implement this idea, the Assembly would invite all countries concerned, including the nuclear-weapon States, to undertake the necessary consultations on the more specific proposals which must obviously follow.\n93.\tI should make it clear that it is not the intention of my Government to deprive any State, against its will, of its right to free and unimpeded passage in the high seas or the right of innocent passage in other waters. But we will vigorously oppose any emplacement or testing of nuclear weapons within territories in the South Pacific region.\n94.\tIt is the hope of my Government that this Assembly will find it possible to endorse the proposal contained in the draft resolution submitted by the delegations of New Zealand and Fiji [A/10192, annex]. In doing so the Assembly would be recognizing the modest contribution of the South Pacific Forum towards the goal of general and complete disarmament.\n95.\tIt is an initiative that is motivated by a genuine desire of our peoples for an international society in which every individual is assured of his own survival. There can be no permanent peace when the world is faced with the nightmare of nuclear proliferation and self-destruction. At a time when all of us are agreed on the need for a just international economic and social order, real progress can be achieved only when we all accept the fact that the basis for a new international relationship is mutual self-respect, sympathetic understanding and co-operation.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, permit me to begin by conveying to you the sincere congratulations of my delegation on your assumption of the post of President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. In extending our best wishes to you on your unanimous election to the office my delegation takes satisfaction that the Assembly will undertake these crucial deliberations under the leadership of an outstanding and eminent personality and statesman.\n113.\tMay I take this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Bouteflika, the Foreign Minister of Algeria, for the outstanding performance for which his term of office was notable. His was a term of office marked by great challenges and historic initiatives. This Organization can be proud that, under his dynamic and imaginative leadership, it could take a revolutionary look at the traditional political international order and address itself to the long overdue reform of the prevailing chaotic international economic situation. During both the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session of the Assembly he exemplified the surging worldwide tide against the discreditable oppressive traditional world order which is responsible for the misery and insecurity of the overwhelming majority of the world's population. He undertook his responsibility of guiding the historic sessions of our Assembly with great distinction, characterized by courage and compassion, as a spokesman of the international community, which has endeavored to change the inequitable status quo. We wish the Government and people of Algeria to know that we in the United Republic of Tanzania, as indeed I am confident those in the rest of Africa, are proud of him and the Algerian revolutionary spirit which produced him.\n114.\tAllow me now to warmly welcome the new Members who have joined our Organization. We salute the gallant and brotherly people of Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe, who, through sheer determination and unflinching belief in the justice of their cause, struggled undeterred towards the goal of achieving independence and the liberation of their people from the curse of colonial oppression. We particularly congratulate the brotherly people of Mozambique, who bring with them the spirit of valor and determination of a combatant people fighting against colonialism. Through a long period of perseverance and suffering, they, like their comrades in Guinea-Bissau, suffered the brutality of a colonial war, with the gallant sons of Mozambique paying the supreme sacrifice for the sake of freedom. Through their determination, the Mozambicans, under the dynamic leadership of Frente de Libertacao de Mozambique [FRELIMO], continued to inflict one defeat after another until the forces of colonialism and fascism had been liquidated. We salute, therefore, this inspiring example which our brothers in Mozambique set in the struggle for freedom.\n115.\tThe United Republic of Tanzania has welcomed with great satisfaction the independence of Papua New Guinea. We look forward to welcoming that new and promising nation to membership in our Organization.\n116.\tAnd as we rejoice at the membership in our Organization of Mozambique, Cape Verde, and Sao Tome and Principe, we very much look forward to the independence of yet another heroic new African State, whose emergence as a sovereign nation in a few weeks time is the result of a long and arduous liberation struggle. We await with great enthusiasm the independence of Angola on 11 November this year in accordance with the Alvor Agrement, and the subsequent membership of that State in the United Nations.\n117.\tWe are, however, fully aware of the machinations of the forces of imperialism and neo-colonialism calculated to rob the Angolan people of the fruits of their bitter struggle. In particular, we must condemn the intervention of South African troops and other mercenaries, as we must unequivocally reaffirm our support for the unity and territorial integrity of the territory.\n118.\tThe proclamation of independence by the Comoros in July this year has been a source of great satisfaction to our Government. That act represented a logical culmination of the legitimate aspirations of the people of the Comoros. We are looking forward to the time when that new nation will also join our Organization. At the same time we must warn against maneuvers  calculated to undermine the independence and territorial integrity of the new State. In this connexion, we would like to emphasize the declaration of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries in their Conference at Lima, in which they inter alia condemned \\\"any attempt against the national unity and territorial integrity of the Comoro Islands and reaffirm their absolute support to its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity\\\" [je? A/J0217 and Corr.l, annex, para. 41],\n119.\tThis should also have been an occasion for our Assembly to welcome the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam. But the abuse of the veto power by the United States of America has made this impossible, thus frustrating the wishes and expectations of the overwhelming majority of the international community.\n120.\tMy delegation would like to take this opportunity to convey, through the Permanent Observers of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam, our salutations of friendship and militant solidarity to the gallant and heroic Vietnamese people whose decisive victory over the forces of imperialist aggression constitutes one of the greatest victories over injustice in contemporary history.\n121.\tThe struggle of the Vietnamese people has been a long, arduous and painful one. Untold were the sacrifices made. Unprecedented in modern times was the degree of barbaric force used and the destruction and havoc created in that land where martyrdom became a rule rather than an exception. But, overcoming all obstacles, the Vietnamese finally liberated their homeland, and, in the process, have written one of the most glorious chapters in the history of a people's struggle for self-determination and independence.\n122.\tEven at the risk of reiterating what is obvious, 1 should like to emphasize that the blocking of the membership of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and of South Viet Nam, apart from constituting a grave injustice to the Vietnamese people, robs this Organization of two new important Members whose contribution would certainly enhance its effectiveness and prestige. It is, therefore, our fervent hope that the United States will reconsider its position so as to conform with the overwhelming wishes of the international community as expressed by the General Assembly in its decision last week [resolution 3366 (XXX)].\n123.\tThis year the world community marks the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Charter of the United Nations following the painful experience of two world wars. At San Francisco, the international community resolved never again to repeat and undergo the like of the preceding experiences. Expressing their commitments in the language of the Charter 30 years ago, they undertook to deploy all their individual and collective faculties to work diligently to fight and eliminate all the evils which lead to human misery and all the underlying causes of international conflicts.\n124.\tAn atmosphere of complacency may have been created by the relative international peace that has prevailed over the world in the last 30 years. But the basis of such complacency cannot stand any test. For, while in public we have all been talking of peace, we have yet to attain the basis of genuine peace, Oppression has therefore continued, while justice has yet to replace injustice. In our economic relations wasteful affluence has bred so much greed in the richer portion of our world that that part resists any meaningful change in the present economic system, which makes the rich richer while condemning the majority of mankind to more poverty, contrary to the provisions of our Charter. In other fields of human endeavor, distrust has led to the generation of destructive capacities as never seen before. In many parts of the world, injustice continues to be perpetuated, aggression and colonization venerated or tolerated. This intolerable state of affairs can only delay the achievement of real and lasting peace as resolved by the international community 30 years ago.\n125.\tOne of the most serious manifestations of human injustices in the history of world society is the enslavement of one people by another. Indeed, the denial to a people of the right to determine its affairs sums up a host of other injustices. Such a situation was rampant at the conclusion of the Charter, when a few countries, especially in Europe, prided themselves on possessing vast empires over the globe. The word \\\"empires\\\", as we know, was a euphemism for imperialism and colonialism, whereby vast populations in these so-called overseas possessions were reduced to the status of cheap labor and objects for the gratification of the lusts of their colonial masters. Happily, the world community came to realize this evil and condemned it through the Charter. Since then, and taking advantage of the inspiration provided by the Charter, and by the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)], whose fifteenth anniversary we are this year commemorating, peoples all over the world demanded, fought for and achieved their right to self-determination and independence. New nations have emerged from colonial servitude to independence and have assumed their rightful places in the world community.\n126.\tThat having been said, however, we must not forget that we still have among us Powers albeit a few which have not learned from the lessons of these world events or reconciled themselves to the idea of other peoples' right to self-determination and independence. These Powers continue to cling to universally condemned colonial practices and slavery. They have refused to accept that no nation has any right to determine and control the affairs of another people. This outrageous situation continues to exist in its most wicked form in southern Africa.\n127.\tIn Zimbabwe, despite international condemnation and opposition, the Smith regime continues to cling to power. In the search for peaceful changes to majority rule in Zimbabwe, the leaders of the African National Council have left no stone unturned. But all their efforts have been frustrated by the intransigence of the white minority regime. Only last month the leaders of the Council were at Victoria Falls to talk to Smith on the possibility of agreeing on the principle of majority rule in Zimbabwe. Smith deliberately wrecked the talks and went all out to create obstacles which make any further talks impossible.\n128.\tIn view of the foregoing, the people of Zimbabwe can either acquiesce in a life of perpetual slavery and bondage or resume and intensify the armed struggle for their liberation. Much as Africa would have preferred a peaceful solution to this problem, we must state very clearly that time has run out, and that we shall have no alternative but to support the people of Zimbabwe when they decide on the resumption and intensification of the armed struggle in accordance with the Dar es Salaam Declaration on Southern Africa.\n129.\tThe United Nations has a duty and an obligation to take all necessary measures called for in all resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly which aim at the liquidation of the Smith regime. In that connexion, in addition to the scrupulous observance of the existing sanctions, there is an urgent need to widen their scope so as to exert maximum pressure on that illegal regime.\n130.\tIn Namibia, the apartheid regime of South Africa continues to display its anachronistic bigotry not only by perpetuating its colonial presence but also by extending its racist policies to that international Territory. The responsibility of the United Nations and its Members on Namibia under the Charter is twofold. First, it is a responsibility we assumed to put an end to colonialism wherever it exists. And in this particular case this responsibility is all the more pronounced since Namibia is an international Territory directly within the specific responsibilities of the United Nations. Secondly, it is our duty to prevent or stop any situation that constitutes or may lead to a breach of international peace and security.\n131.\tVery regrettably the United Nations has not fulfilled these responsibilities. Recently, we have witnessed the consolidation of colonialism in that\nTerritory by maneuvers s designed to deflect the attention of the international community. South Africa . shows no signs of abandoning its defiance of the will of that community. Clearly, no one can now logically claim that the situation does not pose a threat to international peace and security.\n132.\tYet meaningful and effective action by the United Nations continues to be blocked by some Western countries. It is to these countries that we launch an appeal to reconsider their positions so that the Security Council can take effective measures against the Pretoria regime with a view to ending its illegal occupation of Namibia. At the same time, the United Nations has a clear responsibility to intensify its support of the South West Africa People's Organization [5 WAPO], in its struggle for the liberation of Namibia.\n133.\tThe rejection by the United Nations of the credentials of the delegation of the South African regime and the exclusion of that regime from participating in the debate of the twenty-ninth session demonstrated the awareness and indignation of the international community concerning the policies of apartheid. That act, the first of its kind in the history of our Organization, was the culmination of all possible efforts aimed at persuading that regime to abandon its racial bigotry. In spite of this, South Africa has been brazenly defiant of the very basic ideals of the Charter. South Africa, therefore, more than deserved the treatment meted out to it during the last session of the General Assembly. In fact, South Africa should have been expelled from our Organization many years back. This would have happened last year but for the veto that was cast by the three Western permanent members of the Security Council. In casting their veto, the three States namely, France, the United Kingdom and the United States vigorously strove to persuade the world that South Africa was beginning to come to its senses and was changing its adamant attitude when we had, in fact, long since discarded that illusion. These very Powers are among those which give active and positive military and economic assistance as well as political and moral support to suppress the fundamental rights and the dignity and worth of the human person.\n134.\tThese rights, which 30 years ago were articulated in the Charter of the United Nations, remain for the black people of South Africa a far-distant goal. Any change that has taken place in the past has been for the worse. And even at present there is absolutely no room for any kind of optimism about a peaceful change in the situation. In these circumstances, it is imperative that the international community should put its full weight to bear on the South African regime and the States that support it. Such a course of action must include the stopping of all collaboration with South Africa by all States, including the three Western permanent members of the Security Council. South Africa must continue to be excluded from the councils of all international organizations. But, above all, every effort must be made to isolate South Africa from the rest of the international community.\n135.\tIn the Middle East Israel continues to trample on the rights of the Palestinian people and to occupy the territories of neighboring Arab States. We should like to reiterate what we have repeatedly emphasized\nin the past: Israel cannot have peace and security and occupation of Arab territories at the same time. It cannot have peace while continuing to trample under foot the legitimate rights of the Palestinians, as authentically represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]. Israel cannot have it both ways. Occupation brings resistance and there is no doubt that the resistance of the Arab countries, whose territories have been occupied, as well as the Palestinians whose inalienable rights have been usurped, is mounting. And the international community is duty bound to support that resistance. Time is certainly running out.\n136.\tThe non-aligned State of Cyprus is seriously threatened with a permanent partition instigated by forces from without. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Member of the United Nations are at this very moment endangered in spite of the guarantee the world community undertook to give through the Charter and the United Nations. The small and medium-sized States cannot but consider the experience of Cyprus as their own, for they must always remember that they are potential victims of such a failure of international law and order. It is therefore imperative that no effort should be spared to ensure observance oif and respect for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus. In this perspective, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and his representatives once more deserve the compliments and gratitude of all of us for their selfless efforts in searching for a solution to one of the most serious problems facing the international community.\n137.\tWe have already hailed the outstanding victories of the Vietnamese people. Those developments, together with the decisive victories of the Cambodian people over the forces of imperialism and reaction, have radically transformed the situation in IndoChina towards freedom, justice and peace. As we warmly welcome back the authentic delegation of the Cambodian people, we express our hope that the lessons of both Viet Nam and Cambodia have been learned so that an end can be put to the continued outmoded policies of intervention in the domestic affairs of other States.\n138.\tIn this respect the attention of this Organization is particularly drawn to the situation on the Korean peninsula. There the United States Government continues to maintain its military forces in South Korea. The name of this Organization continues to be used to provide a shield for continued intervention in the affairs of Korea, to perpetuate the division of the Korean people and to escalate tension.\n139.\tThe Government of the United Republic of Tanzania wishes once again to reiterate its full support for the Korean people in their just cause of the peaceful unification of their country. To achieve this objective we must stress the urgent need to put an end to all foreign interference. In this respect Tanzania reiterates the demand for the immediate dissolution of the so-called United Nations Command and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea,\n140.\tRunning concurrently with the existence of the United Nations, the last 30 years have heard a lot of talk about disarmament. In reality, however, there is neither the will for, nor evidence of, meaningful \ndisarmament. On the contrary, certain Powers are now talking of the balance of power and are allocating to one another how much stockpile each should aim at for the future.\n141.\tThis year the parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons met to review the implementation of the Treaty. The deliberations of that Conference revealed and summed up the politics of nuclear disarmament today. It has been clearly revealed that nuclear disarmament has become a tactic of a few Powers only to acquire a monopoly of nuclear weapons. All this serves to further confirm the apprehensions expressed by my Government when the non- proliferation Treaty was being considered by our Assembly. Our concern is further aroused by the recent reports that one of the parties to this Treaty has openly threatened to use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear-weapon State. This clearly shows that our countries cannot be secure simply because nuclear weapons are in the hands of a few, especially when some of those few are responsible for most of the tensions in the world.\n142.\tDisarmament and the pursuit of military superiority are mutually exclusive pursuits. One has to give way to the other. Indeed, it is a matter of profound concern that certain Powers have decided to sacrifice disarmament and to engage in reckless competition for military power. It is all the more unfortunate that the genuine desire of many Member States for meaningful disarmament has been abused and twisted to promote a monopoly of nuclear weapons, thus threatening the freedom and independence of all non- nuclear-power States.\n143.\tIn order to liquidate the economic evils which plague the world today it is imperative to eliminate the root-causes of the present economic situation. This of necessity calls for overhauling the traditional economic order. This was the essence of both the sixth and the seventh special sessions: to dismantle the old economic system and establish a new international economic order based on justice and equality. We are pleased to note that through the two special sessions the world community has come to the firm conclusion that, in order to bring about a just, equitable and efficient world economic order, it is necessary to provide for a system that will ensure, among other things, fair and equitable trade relations, a reliable international monetary system, the flow of science and technology for development, and equitable participation in the production and distribution of goods and services.\n144.\tMy delegation is pleased to note that the struggle to establish a new international economic order has captured the world's attention and is gaining increasing support from many of the developed countries. We note with serious concern, however, that there is still a small minority who are concerned only with their immediate narrow and short-term privileges, who ignore the fundamental interests of the majority of the world's peoples, or who fail to understand that - the much-desired change will serve the interests of the international community as a whole. My delegation firmly believes that the international community has already begun the process towards change, and we must continue it on the basis of the current democratic procedures that are a reflection of political realities. In so doing we must express the hope that those who are still lagging behind in understanding the new challenges will move fast enough to meet the overwhelming rest.\n145.\tThe designation of 1975 as International Women's Year is an opportune coincidence. It is the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations, when we have rededicated ourselves to the ideals of the Charter, including emphasis on human rights. It is a year when the topical question is the reform of the world economic order, and the stress on woman's role in society therefore fits very squarely.\n146.\tWe believe that the strategy outlined at the World Conference of the International Women's Year, held at Mexico City from 19 June to 2 July 1975, aiming at a revolutionary change in the status of women and their involvement in all human activities, will be further facilitated by the economic and political awakening of our time.\n147.\tWith the passage of time it becomes more and more unnecessary to reiterate the importance of trust in and proper use of the United Nations. For the cumulative effect of experience only increasingly confirms that our world is a unity the components of which cannot afford to operate separately except at the expense of good order, peace and security. The United Nations is the only existing steering wheel, as it were, of progress towards the safety, prosperity and happiness of mankind.\n148.\tWe would not like to believe that the beneficiaries of certain discredited practices which the United Nations seeks to abolish thought to use the United Nations for the cynical perpetuation and furtherance of those very practices. But on a number of occasions recently we have witnessed that when the United Nations has stood firmly for the ideals of the Charter and demonstrated progress towards becoming a truly democratic institution, certain Members have displayed surprising disappointment with the Organization. It is important for such members to understand that the United Nations is not a classroom. What one witnesses in the United Nations today is the fruition of the hopes of the signatories of the Charter. It is a reflection of the irresistible trend of world affairs.\n149.\tDifferences of views there have to be, for the world is diverse. Diversity need not lead to irreconcilable positions and conflicts. Diversity can and should be used to enrich the deliberations and lead them to intelligent conclusions. Each member brings with him unique experiences which have to be taken into account if the interests of the whole world are to be catered for. But for anybody to attempt to rebuff the United Nations or to impose himself as a being more perfect than the rest is only to invite the whole tide of world opposition against him.\n150.\tWe therefore hope that all Members will have the interests of the entire world at heart, accept the equality of Members, and rededicate themselves to the realization of the common goals of the United Nations.\n151.\tThese are some of the thoughts which should be in the minds of all of us as we commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": " Mr. President, allow me first and foremost to add the warm congratulations of my delegation and my own to those already extended to you upon your election to the high office of President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\nYour election is a well deserved recognition of your\noutstanding qualities and a tribute to the hard-working and highly civilized country that you represent. The Government of Nicaragua, headed by its President under the constitution, General Anastasio Somoza Debayle, and the people of Nicaragua, cannot but express their joy at this signal event, and I bring to you their greetings and felicitations. We are convinced that your wisdom and experience will serve to guide our deliberations and will augur well for the success of this Assembly.\n147.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, for his efficient work at the twenty-ninth regular session and at the seventh special session of this Assembly.\n148.\tMay I respectfully request that you, Mr. President, convey our greetings to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose efforts in the very complex tasks of his high office we follow with keen attention and highly appreciate.\n149.\tA little over 30 years ago, on 26 June 1945, the representatives of 51 nations signed, at San Francisco, California, the Charter of our Organization. It was at the end of a war which had devastated the free world as a result of the ambitions of the Axis Powers which, in the previous month of May, had suffered a further defeat at the hands of the liberating Allied Command. Nicaragua is proud of the fact that it was one of the signatories of the Charter and that its delegation has subscribed to it and attended all regular and special sessions of the General Assembly.\n150.\tNow that the United Nations has completed 30 years of existence, we welcome the admission of Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe, to whose delegations we extend a warm welcome.\n151.\tThe emergence of independent nations is a characteristic feature of history that repeats itself today, because in this century the African peoples have waged an unremitting war against colonialism, a struggle in which the United Nations has played so crucial a part.\n152.\tIn the exercise of its universal responsibility as a harmonizer and promoter of the aspirations for development of all peoples, our Organization has no parallel. It has succeeded while at the same time fulfilling the other three purposes laid down in Article 1 of the Charter: the maintenance of international peace and security, the development of friendly relations among peoples, and the achievement of international co-operation in solving the world's economic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems.\n153.\tThe functioning of the United Nations has shown that the present international community demands new purposes and new activities from an organization such as ours.\n154.\tInternational peace and security, friendship and co-operation among peoples cannot be achieved by discrimination. Universality should not be a mere word used in speeches. It should be practiced effectively. We must guarantee to all peoples without exception their admission as fully fledged Members of the United Nations, by reason of the fact that they are States and meet the requirements of the Charter.\n155.\tDevelopment and relations among nations have shown that some States are more vulnerable than others to the effects of power and influence. The international order and its regulating organs must have more rational bases.\n156.\tHence, if the United Nations is fully to comply with its traditional purposes it must, in addition to jeing universal, be an effective and formal source of international law and a center of initiatives and action aimed at the economic and social development of all peoples. It is on this fundamental concept of the purposes and principles of the Organization that the action of the delegation of Nicaragua is based.\n157.\tThe thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations affords us an opportunity to reflect about the coming decades. It is impossible to judge a historical period exclusively in relation to events occurring within that period particularly when those spans of i.me are short and the events occurring are the consequence of earlier developments or initiative\\\" engendered subsequent to their inception.\n158.\tI do not believe that it can be said that the behavior of the international community is entirely satisfactory as I shall indicate later and undeniably the Organization must undergo considerable reform, which should begin at its very root.\n159.\tI believe that the seventh special session wa\u00bb a significant step towards that end, since it continued the process for the establishment of a new international economic order and created an Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System [resolution 3362 (S-VII)], open to all States, to initiate the process of restructuring the United Nations system in regard to international co-operation and development. Thus another milestone is added to resolutions 3172 (XXVIII) and 3343 (XXIX), to the declaration and the program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)] and to the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] produced by the General Assembly in these past years.\n160.\tThis is not the appropriate time or place to analyze in detail the results of the seventh special session, which is to be done at the level of the Main Committees. Allow me simply to recall that during that special session the head of the Nicaraguan delegation, said \\\"My delegation trusts that the method selected by the Ad Hoc Committee [of the seventh special session] to carry out its discussions and negotiations will lead to practicable results.\\\"5 It was that body, appointed at that session, that produced a new document which was adopted by consensus [resolution 3362 (S-Vll)].\n161.\tIt is now the task of Governments to interpret those purposes, implement those plans, achieve those goals, recognize that the essence of the new international economic order is co-operation, streamline the international institutional framework in order to supplement national development efforts, and become aware of the fact that the objectives of that order are universal and that the continuing process of development should not offer an opportunity for new profits but rather COnstlDigitiZed by Dag HammarSkjold Library progressive./ to reduce disparities between the nations of the world.\n162.\tThe foregoing leads to the recognition of the fact that the structural reform of th^ United Nations must include the reform of its juridical! bases. Nicaragua has endorsed such efforts since they were first undertaken.\n163.\tThe agenda of the current session is lengthy and includes many important items. The responsibilities that the Charter and practice have imposed on the United Nations encompass the most varied of responses to the problems affecting man and States. The approach to problems and to the solutions achieved is not uniform, and divergences of view and the need to harmonize them justify a dialog. I shall venture to express some specific views that Nicaragua regards as important.\nMr. Al-Khalifa (Bahrain), Vice-President, took the Chair.\n164.\tThe Middle East crisis is far from settled, although we welcomed with great satisfaction the agreement arrived at this very month between Egypt and Israel. A similar remark can be made about the crisis in Cyprus. There has been no significant progress in the reduction of the armed confrontation between the great Powers and the atomic danger hovers ominously over the whole of mankind. Small countries are marching increasingly towards the acquisition of arms, and this has the two-pronged effect of delaying their economic progress and fostering new tensions and crises. Recent events in South-East Asia have had repercussions in the area of Korea, leading to an increase in tension between the North and the South.\n165.\tOne might almost say that the only ray of light on the horizon was the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which was held at Helsinki. We believe that it represents an important step in the quest for new forms of improved relations and the elimination of international tension, provided there is a will to apply in good faith the letter and spirit of the agreements.\n166.\tPermit me to dwell for a moment on the question of Korea, since my delegation, together with delegations of countries from several regions of the world, has sponsored a draft resolution on that question which will be submitted to the Assembly for consideration [A/C.IIL.708]. We believe that the solution lies in the peaceful reunification of Korea through negotiations between the North and the South, that the parties directly concerned should be encouraged to hold such negotiations so that it may be possible to dissolve the United Nations Command while maintaining in force the Armistice Agreement of 27 July 1953. The foregoing would be a logical development of resolution 3333 (XXIX) adopted last year and a positive step towards peace and security in that important region of the world.\n167.\tIn the inter-American sphere we have pursued our task of restructuring our regional organization, which was established within the framework of regional agreements as laid down in Chapter VIII of the Charter, and a little over a month ago a conference was held which amended the Rio de Janeiro Treaty of 1947, so as to make it applicable, in regard to the maintenance of peace and security on the American continent, to the prevailing circumstances. My Government considers that tensions and situations of terrorism and violence must be replaced once and for all by constructive dialog and a climate of democracy and freedom. Although it has consistently maintained a positive attitude towards the political and economic problems of peoples, it has always believed that no measure of or desire for conciliation and peace should prevent compliance with the first duty of a democratic State, which is vigorously to condemn every movement of terrorism and violence.\n168.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was held from March to May this year. That Conference drafted a single text which should serve as a basis for purposes of negotiation.\n169.\tMy delegation attaches particular importance to informal consultations among delegations attending the current session of the General Assembly as such consultations will advance the work of the fourth session of the Conference to be held as of March next year. Nicaragua is especially interested in participating in those negotiations and sincerely hopes that the Conference will be successful in adjusting the law of the sea to present-day circumstances, while eliminating a source of acute controversy and international conflict that undoubtedly would arise unless a solution is found that reconciles important conflicting interests while still not losing sight of the need to achieve a more equitable international order where obsolete theories are abandoned and account is taken of the just aspirations of the developing nations for whom the sea is an indispensable element of full development.\n170.\tAs agreed three years ago, 1975 was proclaimed International Women's Year, and the culmination of the program was the holding of the World Conference of the International Women's Year at Mexico City from 19 June to 2 July.\n171.\tWe believe that respect for human dignity imposes equality between men and women and that both the legal and customary obstacles that, in the course of centuries, have prevented that equality being made effective, should be eliminated in order that we may have a society based on justice where the beneficial influence of women may be felt in all spheres of human endeavor. Consequently, my dele-gation will support any initiative aimed at giving practical effect to the relevant resolutions of the world Conference.\n172.\tIn reiterating our condolences to Turkey following the recent earthquake that shook that country, may I be permitted to make a few remarks on the subject of natural disasters?\n173.\tAs a country which received assistance from the Organization as a result of the destruction of our capital city by an earthquake in December 1972, Nicaragua is highly conscious of the importance of international aid in cases of natural disaster in the developing countries.\n174.\tWe believe that for that assistance to be more effective the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Co-ordination should be strengthened and that the expenditure incurred should be charged to the regular budget of the United Nations.\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjold Library\n175.\tIf this is not done, uncertainty regarding the availability of funds and the possibility of political pressures being exerted by voluntary donors in respect of the use of such funds, will continue. Moreover, the basic guidelines of the programs should stem principally from those countries which, for various geographical reasons or because of their degree of development, are the most vulnerable when natural disasters occur.\n176.\tAlthough at the beginning of my statement I gave a general outline of our position in respect of economic and social questions, I would venture to single out some specific topics to which my Governments attaches particular importance.\n177.\tIn particular, we attach great importance to international co-operation in regard to food. The population of the developing countries is still affected by a shortage of foodstuffs and production is still concentrated in the developed countries. The acceptable solution to shortages resulting from droughts or other natural disasters is that of the supply of foodstuffs to affected countries, but the only long-term solution against chronic shortages is the promotion of the production of foodstuffs while improving procedures for financing, production and storage.\n178.\tIn order to achieve that objective and through it to achieve world food security, international cooperation, the contribution of capital and the transfer of technology which will extend the areas of land under cultivation, irrigation, the acquisition of agricultural machinery, the use of insecticides and fertilizers are indispensable.\n179.\tThe work of the United Nations Special Fund, the report of whose Board of Governors we have before us [AII002I], calls in our view for consideration and reform. We believe that a review of the criteria laid down for determining which countries are most seriously affected by the international economic crisis should be undertaken. A more significant set of economic variables which realistically and more accurately reflect the harm done by the present international crisis should be applied. Otherwise, the impoverishment of countries having serious economic difficulties aggravated by the crisis, will grow. Those countries see that their options are greatly narrowed or reduced by the application of restrictive criteria which would lead to a slowing down of the development of their peoples.\n180.\tFor reasons similar to those given in regard to the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator, my delegation believes that the administrative and financial expenditure of the Special Fund should be charged to the regular budget of the United Nations and not defrayed through voluntary contributions.\n181.\tIn reaffirming the concept of the ethics of development, my Government does not disregard the need for objectivity, pragmatism and foresight in the new structures and programs. We sincerely believe in the compensatory stimulus of capital and labor on which our economic system of private property and free enterprise is based.\n182.\tWe also believe it valid to apply the principles of efficiency and effectiveness to the administration of resources as the most useful element for the determination of the extent of an undertaking especially because the main promotion in development should be oriented towards the ethical basis of well-being and equity.\n\n"

        "file_text": " I am glad indeed to have this early opportunity to congratulate Mr. Thorn on behalf of New Zealand on his election as President. New Zealand's relationship with Western Europe is of great importance historically and because of our close trade links, which we intend to preserve. We have been involved in negotiations with the European Economic Community which are basic to the well-being of our people. For the spirit of friendly understanding in which these negotiations have been conducted, New Zealand owes a great deal to him personally. We are confident that the same competence and understanding will distinguish Mr. Thorn's present term of high office. He can be assured of our fullest co-operation in his difficult task.\n216.\tThis thirtieth year of the existence of the United Nations has been a year of unprecedented economic and social activity. It has been a year when more than half of the world's population, that half which consists of women, has been reasserting its unanswerable claim to equal status and opportunity with men. For far too long women have been forced to carry an undue burden of the world's poverty and prejudice. And for them, quite rightly, words are no longer enough.\n217.\tIt has been a year also in which the poorer developing nations have been pursuing with great\nvigor their unanswerable claims to fairer terms of trade to enable them to earn a better life for their own people. And for them, quite rightly also, words are no longer enough.\n218.\tThe shocks and economic pains of the last two years have shown as never before the urgent necessity for practical steps to achieve change, Nations which for long have called for a new economic order are now at last being joined by others which are realizing that change is in their interests also. The growing interdependence of all nations is more apparent. We welcomed the general political commitment to change firmly and unanimously adopted at the seventh special session. We welcomed the new spirit of conciliation and compromise. Even more, we welcomed the obvious strong determination to go beyond words and votes and get down to practical action. The effectiveness of the United Nations will be judged not by its words, votes or hopes, but by its practical achievements in helping to bring about a better life. The record of words and resolutions of 30 years of United Nations existence would fill many warehouses; but the practical achievements can be quickly listed. So we must achieve a better balance, a balance that would provide new life to the United Nations and justifiable new hope to the peoples of the world,\n219.\tThe next steps are crucial. We now have a map showing the possible roads to the objective of a new world economic order. But the new rules of the road must be worked out and agreed upon to ensure that fast travelers do not monopolize the highways. Those who started late and those who wish to travel more slowly must have their fair share of the road also. They must be given the right of way at times so that they, too, can reach the destination that they desire for themselves. Difficult economic and political decisions will have to be made by developing and developed countries alike. It will take a new political will assisted by popular backing for the measures that are necessary in the wider interest. A task as far-reaching as this will never be easy; it never has been, nor will it ever be so. But, at least, we are committed to try.\n220.\tLast year, on behalf of my Government, I stressed the folly of squandering vast resources on the armaments race, which is now estimated to cost $300,000 million a year over $75 for every man, woman and child living on this earth. This is a frightening thought, when we know that over 1,000 million people have less than $200 a year to live on. It is an appalling waste of resources considering the desperate need to use all the skill and capital investment available for developing new sources of energy to help provide the increasing supply of food that is urgently needed to prevent much of the world's population growing, up with stunted bodies and minds.\n221.\tThe ever-growing trade in arms is another intensely disturbing development. Arms must not be treated as a normal means of earning money for the export trade. Those nations which contribute to the $20,000 million total of the world's arms trade surely bear a heavy responsibility to review their arms sales policies. This needs to be done on a joint basis for at present we find countries sheltering behind the sad argument that if they do not supply arms some competitor will.\n222.\tMy country views with special concern the constant growth of nuclear weaponry, with all its unthinkable consequences. And now as never before we require urgent agreement on a comprehensive test-ban treaty, a treaty that will put an end for all time to the further development and testing of new and even more terrible methods of mass destruction. But, beyond that, we need measures that will actually stop and reverse the build-up of nuclear weapons.\n223.\tThe New Zealand Government acknowledges with satisfaction the decision taken by the French Government a year ago to end its Program of testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, of which due note was taken by the International Court of Justice in its decision last year. We, the Government of New Zealand, acknowledge with satisfaction the decision of the French Government at that time. At the same time, let it be clear that New Zealand regrets that all nuclear-weapon States continue to test nuclear weapons, whether in the atmosphere or underground.\n224.\tWe regret that a number of States with the capacity to develop nuclear weapons have not yet signed the non-proliferation Treaty. We regret the unwillingness of some countries to agree to international control and supervision of peaceful nuclear explosions.\n225.\tWe believe we must have a comprehensive test- ban treaty. We believe that all countries must ratify and carry out the non-proliferation Treaty. Each day that passes when those steps are not achieved, more and more people view the continued piling up of nuclear arms with fear and horror. But if those steps were taken, it would help create the confidence on which greater measures of disarmament would be built.\n226.\tAs long as there is no comprehensive test-ban agreement, as long as there is no visible sign of progress towards such an agreement, it is natural that groups of like-minded neighboring States should try to reduce the legitimate anxieties of their peoples. New Zealand is attempting to do this by approaching the problem of nuclear disarmament on a partial and regional basis.\n227.\tA remarkable feature of the disarmament debate at the twenty-ninth session was the upsurge of interest in nuclear-free zones. At the Review Conference to the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons held at Geneva last May the value of this approach was fully recognized in the Conference's Final Declaration [A IC. 111068, annex /}. The Secretary-General, in an important passage in the introduction to his report this year, emphasized that nuclear-weapon free zones provide the best and easiest means by which those States which neither possess nor want to possess these weapons can, by their own initiative, interest and effort, ensure the total absence of nuclear weapons from their territories and enhance their mutual security [Aj 10001 lAikl.I, sect. VIII].\n228.\tAs the Secretary-General pointed out, the Latin American countries have already made substantial progress towards this objective in a large and populated part of the globe [ibid.]. For some years my Government has believed that the independent and self-governing nations of the South Pacific might emulate the example of their Latin American neighbors in an adjoining area. Although the South Pacific contains a vast expanse of ocean, it also comprises many islands and the inhabitants of these islands are deeply concerned about the nuclear threat. Last July, the idea of a nuclear-weapon-free zone was discussed further at the South Pacific Forum by the Heads of Government of Australia, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Tonga, Western Samoa and Papua New Guinea, whose independence and forthcoming membership in this Organization we greatly welcome. These nine South Pacific countries agreed unanimously that the concept of a nuclear- free zone in the South Pacific should be studied further and that, as a first step, the General Assembly should be asked to endorse the concept of such a zone. Accordingly, two members of the Forum which are also Members of the United Nations, Fiji and New Zealand, have proposed for this session an item on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the South Pacific [item 120], We appreciate that it is a complex question, and we are, of course, anxious to consult all countries which might be affected by the proposal. This process of consultation has already begun.\n229.\tWe hope that Members will recognize this proposal as a positive response to a widespread desire to extend the application of the nuclear-weapon-free zone concept, and we ask you to accept this action as contribution to nuclear disarmament and the strengthening of peace. It is on that basis that I ask with confidence for the support of all Members of this Organization .\n230.\tThe house of peace will be constructed from many building blocks. The great Powers have offered us no final blueprint. Sometimes we have no choice but to start building, setting some blocks in place without knowing precisely what the final structure will look like. But we do believe that all who can must start building those blocks now, in the knowledge that they will ultimately be used to build the house of peace that we all seek. My Government, for its part, will support any constructive proposal which offers the prospect of early progress towards disarmament.\n231.\tMy Government regrets that the question of the admission of new Members to the United Nations has again become a matter of controversy. The early history of this matter was an unhappy one: for many years, well qualified applicants were denied admission through the use or, rather, the abuse of the veto power. Eventually, a large number of longstanding applicants were admitted together, in what was described at the time as a \\\"package deal\\\". What was done then strained the provisions of the Charter, but my country actively worked for a positive result, believing that it was intolerable to exclude qualified applicants indefinitely and that exceptional measures were required to solve the problem.\n232.\tAfter the log-jam was broken in 1955, applications, for the most part, were dealt with promptly and on their individual merits; a large number of new Members were admitted without difficulty. The divided States Germany, Korea and Viet Nam  were the main exceptions, and they were recognized as a special problem. Then, just two years ago, the two Germanys were admitted simultaneously. We hoped that this welcome development would be followed by agreed solutions in respect of Korea and, following a peace settlement, in respect of Viet Nam. Unhappily, this has not proved possible. On the contrary, a situation has arisen which seems likely to provoke more controversy and bitterness and which could delay for a long time the admission of several countries which should be Members.\n233.\tI wish therefore to describe my Government's general attitude towards the question of membership in the present situation. We believe that applications should be dealt with in accordance with the principle of universality. It is true that the present membership provisions of the Charter do not reflect that principle as clearly as we believe they should. In our view, membership in the United Nations is primarily a duty. Membership imposes important obligations, and no sovereign, independent State should be prevented from assuming them.\n234.\tThat is not the only consideration. Membership also exposes countries to the cross-currents of international opinion; it can help to reconcile different views, or at least moderate them; and the benefits of all this can not be lightly disregarded.\n235.\tMy Government therefore favors the admission of North Viet Nam, South Viet Nam, North Korea and South Korea, even though reunification may remain the ultimate objective or even a priority objective in those countries. We recognize that North Korea is not at present pressing its application, which it first submitted some 25 years ago. But that is not a valid reason, we believe, for not admitting South Korea. There has been criticism of one of the permanent members of the Security Council for linking the application of South Korea with those of North and South Viet Nam. But if that approach is to be deprecated, then equally so is the attitude of those who insist that an application from South Korea can be considered only in conjunction with an application from North Korea in other words, that both States must apply together. If linking is wrong in the one case, it is equally wrong in the other. My Government regrets that the Security Council did not approve the applications of North and South Viet Nam. We hope it will reconsider their applications and consider that of South Korea as well at an early date.\n236.\tMy Government believes that in order to bring about universality the Charter provisions concerning admission should be simplified. In our view, the unanimity rule should not be applicable to membership applications in the Security Council and should be replaced by a suitable qualified majority. The criteria for admission should be the generally accepted criteria of independent statehood.\n237.\tThere is a further consequence of our philosophy of universality, and this concerns Members which do not live up to their Charter obligations. In my country's view, the philosophy of universality is opposed to the tendency which has recently become evident to invoke the expulsion provision in Article 6 of the Charter. We regard expulsion as a last resort, and one of doubtful practical value. It would be a substantial improvement if provision could be made for a variety of sanctions against a Member which persistently violated the Charter, including suspension from the exercise of some or all of the rights and privileges of \nmembership. The Member wh.ch is subjected to these measures should not, however, be relieved of the obligations of membership. In our view, that is a serious drawback to the present expulsion provision.\n238.\tNew Zealand is a firm supporter of the process of decolonization and of the principles of racial equality enshrined in the Charter. During the past year we have followed the developments in southern Atrica with close concern. My Prime Minister welcomed the opportunity to discuss the situation in southern Africa with the Heads of Government of the African countries which are members of the Commonwealth when the Commonwealth Heads of Government met in Kingston in May. New Zealand fully subscribed to the views expressed by Commonwealth Prime Ministers, including those relating to sanctions against the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia and on the question of aid to the many indigenous peoples of southern Africa.\n239.\tIn southern Africa there has been since last year's session of the Assembly encouraging progress in some areas, but disquieting developments in other areas, and in still other areas a disheartening lack of forward movement.\n240.\tFollowing the admission to the United Nations a year ago of the first Portuguese colony to be liberated, Guinea-Bissau, three more newly independent African States which were formerly under Portuguese rule have now taken their place among us. I take this opportunity to say a special word of welcome to the representatives of those countries. My country is conscious of the special problems which these new Governments face after a long period of struggle for their freedom and independence.\n241.\tThe decolonization of Portugal's African colonies has brought about a fundamental shift in the balance of forces in southern Africa. With this change has come new hope for a solution of the problems of southern Rhodesia and Namibia. In Southern Rhodesia the goal of independence on the basis of majority rule has at times during the year seemed closer. It remains the earnest hope of my Government that this goal will be achieved quickly and peacefully. We trust that the Smith regime will take full advantage of what may well be the last opportunity to achieve a negotiated settlement. As the Commonwealth Heads of Government pointed out at Kingston, if peaceful avenues are blocked by the Smith regime, a stepping-up of armed struggle seems inevitable.\n242.\tTowards the end of 1974 the Prime Minister of South Africa asked that his Government be given six months to demonstrate its determination to make progress on the issues which caused the Assembly to reject the credentials of the South African delegation at the twenty-ninth session. Those six months have elapsed, and the United Nations is entitled to ask what progress has in fact been made. On the positive side, let us acknowledge that the South African Government played a constructive role in bringing Mr. Smith to the conference table with the leaders of the liberation movements in Southern Rhodesia. On the negative side, I think we must acknowledge that there has been little indication of any intention on the part of the South African Government to abandon its intolerable policy of apartheid. For the non-white majority of its people, South Africa continues to be a police State in which racial discrimination is not simply a matter of ignorance and prejudice but a fundamental doctrine embedded in the basic political and legal system.\n243.\tSouth Africa's position in regard to Namibia is equally indefensible. South Africa has no legal claim to the Territory. The situation is a simple one, where the people of Namibia as a whole should be given the opportunity to exercise the right of self-determination as soon as possible under United Nations supervision. In the absence of a change of heart on these issues, South Africa cannot expect to resume its rightful place in the international community.\n244.\tSince east and south-east Asia is an area of prime concern to New Zealand, I cannot conclude without commenting briefly on some of the important events that have taken place in this region during the past year.\n245.\tIn Indo-China the prolonged military struggle is over. Political power there is in new hands, and whatever views we may hold about this we must all be grateful that the conflict has ended. There are lessons to be learned from the Indo-China experience if we, the international community, are prepared to heed them. It is not recrimination which is called for now, but a spirit of reconciliation and a readiness to help with the task of reconstruction. Some of the international agencies have already been engaged in this task, and their support has been invaluable. My Government is playing its part. We are willing, if so requested, to help with development Programs here as elsewhere without considerations of ideology.\n246.\tElsewhere in South-East Asia the changes may not have been as dramatic as they have been in IndoChina. But developments are under way which promise to be just as significant for the region's future. We have been heartened above all by the growth of a genuine regional spirit. This is best seen in the progress of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. The five members of the Association have displayed a sense of cohesion and common purpose in seeking new solutions to old problems. New Zealand has been pleased to offer support, in practical ways, for their collective efforts. We look forward to the day when with them, and with the countries of Indo-China we will work together as a partnership in a wider scheme of regional co-operation, for this is the way ahead.\n247.\tMy Government finds the trends in Asia encouraging. The situation in Korea, however, remains a source of serious concern. The continuing tension there, to which accusation and counter-accusation, threat and counter-threat, contribute, is a relic of another era.\n248.\tThe Korean question has been on the Assembly's agenda for a quarter century. Korea may seem remote to some countries and the history of events there may be growing dim. But in considering this item it would be folly to forget that the interests of many Powers are involved. It has been the scene of a terrible war. With irresponsible handling it could be the scene of another. The supreme interest of the United Nations is peace. It is our duty to make decisions that contribute to peace and reconciliation rather than to insecurity and continued bitterness. It is my Government's earnest hope that this year a solution will be found that is acceptable to all parties and particularly, of course, to the two Korean States. If such a solution requires that the United Nations Command be dissolved, then we have a responsibility to ensure that adequate arrangements remain to safeguard peace and the well-being of the Korean people.\n249.\tIn conclusion, the general debate with which we open each session of the General Assembly gives each Member small or large, poor or rich an equal opportunity to speak out honestly and frankly on matters it regards of vital concern. Indeed, it is more than an opportunity; it is a right and a responsibility. Each Member equally has a responsibility to help solve the problems facing the United Nations, and to contribute a share of the needed resources in proportion to its means. New Zealand has spoken out on the issues of most concern to us. I renew our pledge to play our part in finding fair and constructive solutions.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "71.\tAs a true African I do not want to speak to you in a foreign language. Thanks to the good offices of the Secretary-General, my statement will be read out to you by my Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Mr. Khalid Younis Kinene. Meanwhile, I wish to bring to you warm greetings from the people of Uganda, from all members of the OAU and from all peoples of the third world.\n72.\tI have put all the points which concern the OAU, the third world and the world as a whole in the statement which my representative will now read out to you. Thank you.\n73.\tMr. KINENE (Uganda): I shall now read out the statement by His Excellency Idi Amin Dada, President of the Republic of Uganda and current Chairman of the OAU, to the thirtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly.\n74.\tAs a pure and proper son of Africa, who does not believe in any colonial and imperialist language, I shall address you in an African language which will be interpreted to you through the good offices of the United Nations Secretariat.\n75.\tThis year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, and I therefore take the highest honor and privilege, on behalf of the OAU and on behalf of the entire people of Uganda, to bring to all representatives to the thirtieth session of the General Assembly greetings and good wishes from the heart of Africa. I wish, in particular, to express Africa's appreciation of the solidarity demonstrated by other delegations to this Assembly and to the entire American people who have welcomed me and accorded me hospitality since my arrival in New York.\n76.\tOn this occasion, I wish to express Africa's appreciation and gratitude to the founding fathers of the United Nations. In particular, I recall with admiration the dedication and great effort that all leading international civil servants have exerted for the success and growth of this Organization which has constantly faced very difficult crises. We recall, in particular, the first Secretary-General of the Organization, Mr. Trygve Lie from Norway, and the President of the first General Assembly, Mr. Henri Spaak of Belgium, and all successive Secretaries-General up to the last one, all of whom are now, regrettably, dead. Their individual contributions to the success of this Organization are very well known and acknowledged and will remain a permanent record in the history of the United Nations.\n77.\tMr. President, I wish also to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the high office of President of this session. With your enormous experience, I have no doubt that the business of this session will be conducted in a most competent manner, under your able and wise guidance. I also wish to pay a tribute to our distinguished Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and his entire staff for the dynamism and dedication with which they have been executing their duties. The entire membership of the OAU is particularly satisfied with the manner in which the Secretary-General has executed his African assignments, especially in the field of decolonization and the problems of the racist minority regimes in southern Africa.\n78.\tThe thirtieth session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when developments in the world are moving fast. Imperialism is being resolutely driven back, and the peoples of the industrialized countries are showing fresh interest in the genuine development of the third world and in its fight for economic independence and construction. The OAU, of which I have the honor to be the current Chairman, wishes this session success in its deliberations, aimed not only at consolidating the political and economic independence and the construction of its members, but also at the cultural and moral development of peoples all over the world. We in Africa, and in Uganda in particular, are fully dedicated and committed to that end.\n79.\tThe agenda at this Assembly session is a long one. But it is not my intention to speak on it at length. Permit me, however, to address myself first, on behalf of the 46 States Members of the OAU, to the pertinent problems that are of greatest concern to the African continent in the context of this world body. At a later stage. I will also have a few points to make as President of the Republic of Uganda.\n80.\tAll over the globe, there continue to be hotbeds of crisis in the political, economic, social and cultural fields. Many countries have consequently been involved in one way or another in trying to find lasting solutions to those constant problems, The twelfth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU at Kampala, the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries held at Lima, and the seventh special session of the General Assembly held in this very Hall not very long ago, go a long way in demonstrating mankind's commitment to finding solutions to the problems that lie between it and the ideals and aspirations of the international community it is trying to achieve.\n81.\tYou will permit me at this juncture, Mr. President, to dwell particularly on the economic problems that for a long time have created bottlenecks in world development. The fact that the program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order mapped out at the sixth special session of the General Assembly [resolution 3202 (S-VI)], and has now clearly been enunciated by the Lima Conference and the seventh special session, is, in my view, highly significant. It is significant because the developed nations, I hope, are beginning to realize that economic co-operation of any kind with the developing countries must take place strictly on the basis of mutual benefit to both sides as well as respect for the national sovereignty of each State. These recent international meetings have furthered a positive trend towards the attainment of a realistic and just international economic order fair to all parties to it. For this progressive development, I wish to pay a special tribute to the United States authorities, especially the President and the Members of Congress who approved a change in the United States attitude and policy towards the third world and, consequently, made that position known to the world during the seventh special session of this Assembly.3\n82.\tExcept for the southern tip of the African continent and isolated pockets here and there, the worldwide war for self-determination and political independence is almost over now. But the struggle for self-reliance continues. The present stage in this struggle is for economic independence without which, as it has rightly been stated, political freedom is meaningless.\n83.\tAll States Members of the OAU are vigorously waging battles for full economic control over their own affairs. Each State is following a method and a speed that is most suited to its national conditions. We in Uganda, having taken a short and revolutionary cut to economic independence, are now somewhat luckier than many of our sister States members of the OAU. Our experience, among many other things, has taught us that, if the more industrialized countries are genuinely serious about extending technical assistance to the developing countries, they should ensure that the experts they send are dedicated and appreciative of the aspirations and determination of the third-world countries to be masters of their own economies.\n84.\tThese modern technical missionaries should not have that old colonial mentality of their predecessors who came out to Africa with the conviction that they were coming to work among second-rate human beings. The modern expatriates Africa now needs should come with the knowledge that they are employees, not employers; partners for peace, not preachers of political ideologies or builders of foreign empires. If this type of expatriate comes to Africa, and indeed goes to other parts of the third world, the cause of international peace and positive development will be served.\n85.\tThe efforts for economic independence by all States Members of this Organization are aimed at ensuring that mankind's gains in the future will be stable and significant and that the society that the new economic order aspires to create holds immense potentialities. We do not only want a world free of colonialism, neo-colonialism, imperialism and Zionism, but a world free of hunger, disease, ignorance and any form of tension arising from inequalities in social or regional development.\n86.\tWhile there is positive co-operation among the nations of the third world, one regrets to note that co-operation between the third world and the industrialized nations still leaves a lot to be desired. Some industrialized nations still cling to the outdated attitude whereby they unjustifiably depend for their prosperity on the exploitation of the natural resources of developing nations. It is our hope and prayer that this thirtieth session will go a long way in promoting economic co-operation among those who are prepared to respect each other's sovereignty and are willing and ready to co-operate on an equal basis.\n87.\tLet me now touch on some basic political problems before this world body. Session after session this Assembly has spent long hours trying to find solutions to the problems of decolonization. Yet it is disheartening to note that, up to the present session, in this Organization which is the custodian of world peace and security there are still some countries which come to this Assembly to pay lip-service to the cause of liberty, democracy and justice while at the same time they continue the very malpractices condemned in this Hall.\n88.\tI am glad to mention that, despite setbacks, events over the past year in the arena of decolonization have moved at a faster pace. I refer to the accession to independence of the three former Portuguese colonies, Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe, and the former French Territory of Comoro, and their admission to the OAU at the twelfth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government held at Kampala. I hail, on behalf of the OAU, their admission to the world body and I am convinced that their revolutionary zeal with which they fought for their independence will lead them to make a worthy contribution to the deliberations of this Organization. I should also take this opportunity to congratulate the people of the new State of Papua New Guinea on attaining their independence. Africa welcomes this newest State of the Pacific to the ranks of this world body.\n89.\tAt this point, it is fitting for me to pay Africa's compliments to the Portuguese Armed Forces Movement for their far-sightedness. As a result of their very progressive policies since they took over power last year, Portugal is now in the process of realizing the true and internationally accepted limits of its sovereignty. Portugal can now afford to develop its economy without wasting its resources in outmoded colonial ambitions which its economic means could not sustain, The new-found independence and freedom which both the former Portuguese Territories and the Portuguese people are enjoying is directly attributable to the many years of struggle by the African peoples in the Portuguese colonies and to the progressive forces inside Portugal.\n90.\tI should like to punctuate the independence of the former Portuguese Territories by referring to the unhappy situation prevailing in Angola. The Portuguese Government remains in the final analysis the responsible Power in Angola until independence on 11 November 1975. For its part, the OAU will spare no efforts in contributing to measures to bring the situation under control.\n91.\tIt is pertinent here to warn against external interests in Angolan affairs which have made it more difficult to bring about reconciliation among the three major Angolan liberation movements: Movimento Popular de Libertafao de Angola [MPLA ], Frente Nacional para a Libertao de Angola [FNL4] and Uniao Nacional para aIndependencia Total de Angola {UNITA]. One positive role the United Nations can play in this tragic situation is to help to prevent the current conflict in Angola from being internationalized. The United Nations must unequivocally condemn those Powers which for ideological or strategic reasons are pouring arms into Angola, thereby complicating further an already delicate situation. The problem of Angola, being essentially African, should and ought to have an African solution. I want to assure you that the Conciliation Commission on Angola which was appointed by the last Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU is doing everything possible to bring about peace among the warring Angola parties. I am sure that the Commission will succeed in its mission. While on this point, I should like to stress what has already been stated many times before: that the problems of Africa can be solved by Africans alone, without interference from outside. There should not be any press or other public utterances claiming that African problems in Africa are so explosive that they require non-Africans to come and control them.\n92.\tWith the independence of the new States of Mozambique, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe and the Comoros, come two related problems. These are the return of refugees to their countries of origin and the urgent need of the new States for technical and financial assistance to enable these new States to cope with the problems of national economic development and social reconstruction.\n93.\tAs far as the question of the refugees is concerned, the OAU is grateful for the co-operation and generous assistance which the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, other United Nations agencies, individual Governments and various organizations have rendered and continue to render, not only for the return of the refugees to their countries of origin but for their resettlement, reconciliation and rehabilitation. However, the State of Cape Verde presently faces an exceptionally acute refugee problem arising from the current situation in Angola, where many of its citizens have been working. Cape Verde therefore needs urgent assistance for the resettlement of its displaced citizens, whom it cannot reabsorb at once. An appeal for assistance has already gone to all members of the OAU, but in view of the enormous size of the problem may I, on behalf of that Organization, extend the same appeal to all other Members of this Organization. The assistance can be channeled through bilateral or multilateral arrangements.\n94.\tOn technical and financial assistance, States Members of the United Nations will no doubt be aware of the scarcity of educational and health facilities that are normally allowed in colonial Territories by metropolitan Powers. A new structure for social services has therefore to be built; transport has to be developed; and, similarly, bases for agriculture and other economic backbones must be established. This is a formidable task with which the new nations are faced. I am sure that the United Nations, through its various specialized agencies, will play a worthwhile role in this great challenge facing its newest Members.\n95.\tOn behalf of the new nations I should also like to make a fervent appeal to all more developed nations represented in this great Organization to show solidarity and magnanimity by rising to the occasion through bilateral arrangements without undue political considerations.\n96.\tAs for the other colonial Territories, I can only hope that the remaining European colonial Powers  France, the United Kingdom and Spain will follow the example of the new Portugal and embark on a committed program of decolonization. The OAU cannot accept the lame excuse used by some colonial Powers that the colonial people are not ready for independence or that they prefer the colonial status to independence. No human being can choose to be a slave.\n97.\tThe Comoros declared independence from France last July. True to its principles of respect for the sovereign right of peoples to self-determination and independence, the OAU accepted the application of the Comoros for membership in that Organization.\n98.\tThe problems that ensued following the Comoros' declaration of independence and the stance adopted by the French Government are too well known to this august Assembly to require further elaboration. That the Comoros has not yet found it possible to apply for admission to the United Nations is no fault of the OAU. The intention of the French Government concerning the Comoros has remained ambiguous. France has a moral obligation to explain its position on this question.\n99.\tIn spite of France's negative attitude, the international community and OAU, in particular, have been more than patient with France on matters relating to the decolonization of its African Territories. It is time for France to reciprocate before our patience is completely exhausted.\n100.\tThe OAU has welcomed the results of the independence negotiations held last March at Marlborough House, London, between the United Kingdom Government and the two nationalist parties of Seychelles, Seychelles People's United Party [SPUP] and Seychelles Democratic Party [SDP], setting the date for independence as not later than 30 June 1976. It is our fervent hope that the United Kingdom Government will respect the wishes of the people for a united prosperous Seychelles nation.\n101.\tWe are, however, suspicious of the United Kingdom's intentions to retain some of the islands that rightly belong to Seychelles in what is referred to as 356\nthe British Indian Ocean Territories. Our fears and concerns arise out of the fact that this action undermines the territorial integrity of Seychelles. Besides, the OAU, as well as the non-aligned States, have expressly stated their opposition to big-Power rivalry in the Indian Ocean, which we want to remain a zone of peace.\n102.\tI should like to appeal to the United Nations, and particularly to the permanent members of the Security Council, to take meaningful measures to resolve the outstanding colonial problems of southern Africa. I am convinced that it is not beyond the competence of the United Nations to end colonialism and apartheid. We in Africa are prepared for a peaceful end to colonialism and apartheid, but if peaceful means are blocked there can be no other alternative but to achieve independence on the battlefield. The United Nations has a responsibility in this. You can help us save bloodshed by helping to implement United Nations resolutions on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples.\n103.\tIndependent Africa will not allow itself to be deceived by detente, which is in any case increasingly going bankrupt in the face of the sharpened struggle of the people of Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa. The States Members of the OAU have resolved to step up their support of the nationalists and the peoples of southern Africa in their multi-fronted struggle for national liberation. May I at this juncture express Africa's appreciation to all those countries that have assisted and continue to assist African liberation movements in their struggle for freedom and independence. In particular I wish to mention the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and other Socialist countries for their generous assistance, both moral and material, to the peoples of Africa still fighting to free themselves from the bondage of imperialism, racism and apartheid.\n104.\tI cannot condone any compromise with apartheid. The system must be eradicated root and branch and buried. It defies all known principles of humanity as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations or in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is for this reason that free Africa has insisted that South Africa has no right to United Nations membership because the very basis of its ideology and practice are a direct contradiction to the Charter of the United Nations.\n105.\tI should like now to turn to one other point that is of key importance not only to Africa and the rest of the third world but to the entire world. This is the question of peace and security. Africa rejects the opinion which has sometimes been publicly expressed that the problems of security should be the monopoly of the big Powers alone. We maintain that all peace- loving peoples of the world have an active role to play in world security, peace and co-operation. On a broader plane, we in Africa feel the need for more effective initiatives and the co-operation of all countries, big or small, which are keen to deliver the entire world once and for all from the forces of colonialism, neocolonialism, racialism and apartheid. For us in Africa, this is the central issue.\n106.\tHaving regard to the political and social clashes that are taking place in the southern part of our continent coupled with the bloody friction in the Middle\nEast at the northern end of our continent, it has become increasingly evident that, without the concerted involvement of the countries of the third world in peace-keeping, it will be impossible to solve the endemic problems in southern Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere in the world where hot political issues exist. Indeed, it will even be difficult to implement any meaningful international economic changes that have become a necessary factor in the attainment of secure international peace and harmony if the third world countries which now command a numerical majority in this Assembly are not fully involved in the process of making and guaranteeing world peace. In this particular connexion, I appeal on behalf of my African colleagues and the entire third world to the United States Government to reconsider its position in and relationship with Panama, an independent Member of this Organization, regarding the use of the Panama Canal. All international traffic using the watercourse should fully respect the sovereign rights of the Republic of Panama. This is within the acceptable principles of this Organization.\n107.\tI should like at this point to refer to the continued monopoly of the veto by the permanent members of the Security Council, which privilege some of them have used to protect situations that are against world peace. The third world cannot now be overlooked when the most important decisions, some of which even directly affect it, are being taken in the Security Council. At this time when the interdependence of nations, big or small, is an acknowledged fact, it is high time that this Organization, especially the Security Council, decided to review the Charter of the United Nations, adopted when not more than three African Members were independent. The implementation of this idea will be a great leap forward for mankind, since the principle of equality and sovereignty will have been mutually respected by each and every State.\n108.\tIt is thus my belief that, in consideration of the changed world political situation since the adoption of the present Charter, the review of the Charter should among other things, enable the third-world countries to exercise the rights at present being monopolized by the conquering allies of the Second World War. I would specifically propose that Africa and other recognized regional groupings in this Organization, which do not enjoy the right of a veto, be given a bloc veto each. As and when, for example, the Security Council decides on substantive issues, the concurrent votes of a region's representatives at the Council will have the same effect as that of a permanent member of the Security Council.\n109.\tEast-West detente has now been made concrete with the conclusion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at Helsinki. I wish to compliment all the countries that contributed to the success of that Conference. The Soviet Union in particular is to be given special thanks for conceiving the idea of the Conference and for working tirelessly and consistently until the signing of the Helsinki agreement.\n110.\tNow that detente between the Western and the Eastern States has thus been formalized, it would be a logical step forward in the search for world peace, if the third-world countries also met and reviewed their position in the light of the Helsinki agreement. The third-world countries which spread all over the globe should never lag behind in the search for world peace and security. Being composed of developing countries, the third world needs an assurance of peace for itself much more than the more industrialized countries. A security conference for the third world has thus now become necessary and should be convened as soon as possible.\n111.\tIn our regional search for international peace and security, the position of the People's Republic of China and Japan has not been very clear. From what I know, these two countries rightly belong to the third world. China, because it has always stated that it wants to belong to the third world. Japan, in spite of its high industrial development, naturally belongs to the third world. In any case, because of its geographical position and, especially since its defeat in the Second World War, it has never really been accepted by either Eastern or Western blocs of countries as a member of either.\n112.\tCountries of the third world, especially those in Africa, the Arab subcontinent and Asia, should very seriously think of this proposal to hold a security conference. With the inclusion of China and Japan in such a conference, the third world will find it easy to resolve, by peaceful means, problems that are found within or among its member States and thus avoid the interference of super-Powers that we have so often witnessed in such cases. The problems of North and South Korea, for example, would be made easier to soWe in the context of the third-world peace efforts, as these two countries are also legitimately within the third-world group.\n113.\tGiven its large and varied membership and its . enormous natural resources, such as those in Africa, which include high-nuclear raw materials, its rich historic cultures and revolutionary aspirations, the third world stands the greatest change to lead the world by peaceful means, if only it can co-ordinate its efforts.\n114.\tAs I said at the beginning, I should like now to discuss a few points in my capacity as President of Uganda, starting with the very first prerequisite of a State, namely, its land.\n115.\tNeedless to say, land is the greatest gift the Creator has given to man. Its price cannot be estimated in terms of money or any other measure of value. Without it there would be no States and the human race could not exist in the form in which we know it. Land, through the ages, has been the cause of both joys and woes, unity and conflict. When thinking about land in its proper perspective, considerations cut across national boundaries and assume an international character to which nations should give serious priority consideration, commitment and dedication. Today the peoples of the world are very much worried about overpopulation, and those fears are based entirely on the kind and amount of food that can be available to feed the ever-increasing millions of people on earth. As we know it today, food is a product of land. Therefore, land utilization and settlement are subjects on top priority to the human race. In many countries there is no more space left for the growing of food to feed their nationals, and therefore in this regard they face peril. The only hope for survival of such people lies in the amount of food that can be obtained from the new lands which are less populated, endowed with a good climate and soil and which, therefore, can achieve maximum production with the least effort in terms of technology and finance. Nations blessed with the attribute of a large area of arable land therefore stand in a unique position.\n116.\t1 am glad and proud to inform this Assembly that Uganda is one of the very few countries which occupy that unique position. Uganda realizes its moral responsibility to humanity to hold out the bread basket to the starving world. In this connexion, the Government of Uganda has recently promulgated three decrees designed to bring about maximum productivity and the better utilization of land within its national territorial boundaries and to increase employment opportunities. By the grace of God, Uganda does boast a wonderful climate, rich soil, a healthy energetic people, good means of communication and rich natural resources, all of which, if fully exploited, would benefit the human race and go a long way towards removing the fears in which the world is engulfed today. It is against that background that the Land Reform Decree, the Community Farm Settlement Decree and the Self-Help Projects Decree were promulgated in the middle of this year. Those decrees place all land in the hands of the Government for management, distribution and control, provide for its planned settlement and utilization and encourage the supplementing of financial investment requirements by our time-honored voluntary communal labor supply for community development.\n117.\tThe following reasons led to the reform of land possession and management law: to enable the Government to make proper plans of land use for maximum productivity; to remove the evils of feudalism which discouraged the farmers of the land and encouraged laziness and exploitation by the absentee landlords; and to provide employment. Under the new decrees, everyone in Uganda now has an equal opportunity to own land and develop it for the benefit of himself, the country and the world at large, since the world expects those who are so favorably placed as regards rich natural resources, like Uganda, to share them with their fellow human beings the world over.\n118.\tThe effect of the new decrees on Uganda's social pattern of life and economic development has been tremendous. Anyone who visits Uganda today will see the great strides that have been taken by the people in the development of land for agriculture and animal husbandry, although it is barely four months since the decrees were promulgated.\n119.\tThe international community has recognized that one of the most serious problems facing the majority of mankind today is the problem of human settlement. The three decrees promulgated in Uganda, already referred to, are meant among other things to solve this problem at the national level. It will be appreciated, however, that human settlement is an international problem which can best be solved at the international level. For that reason Uganda supports the proposal for the creation of a United Nations agency or program to deal specifically with this international problem of human settlement. In this connexion, Uganda offers to be the host country to the secretariat of such an agency or program of the \nUnited Nations, if and when it is created, As is very well known, Uganda has the capacity and the facilities to be host not only to the secretariat of such an agency or program but even to much bigger ones.\n120.\tFull exploitation of the land resources requires heavy financial investment. If the world is going to benefit in the shortest possible time from the natural wealth of Uganda, then the world must be prepared to invest in the exploitation of these resources. Uganda invites interested parties on the individual, State and international levels to participate in the exploitation of these rich resources. Our law protects foreign investments and we guarantee fair returns on these foreign investments. We respect in full measure the right to property as a fundamental inalienable right. Our Constitution guarantees this right and the Government and people of Uganda observe this constitutional guarantee strictly; so much so that when I declared the economic war in order to restore to our people their natural rights, dignity and self-respect and save them from callous exploitation by foreigners, I also guaranteed payment of compensation to these exploiters. Negotiations are going on between Uganda and the countries concerned to determine the amount due and the method and program of payment of compensation. The United Kingdom team was recently in Kampala, our capital city, for this purpose. The United States of America's claim has long since been settled. All that indicates that we are notjust interested in making sweet utterances or paying lip-service to human rights and law, but that we observe all these principles and back them up with practical, visible action.\n121.\tUganda takes strength and gains inspiration from the numerous utterances and resolutions of this venerable house urging the colonial and imperial Powers to make speedy restoration of full economic rights to the hitherto exploited, oppressed and enslaved peoples of the third world. My strength and earnestness of purpose is even greater when I stand here delivering my speech on the soil of the United States of America, the country which in our era conceived a new philosophy which has lit, cleansed, inspired and sustained the third world in the pursuit of freedom. The United States colonies resisted exploitation by foreign Powers 200 years ago. They wanted to have the sole right and control over their economy. This is the accepted principle today in this Assembly, in the world of peace- loving and right-thinking peoples and at the international law platform. We in Uganda have pursued the same goal.\n122.\tFor the pursuit of our natural rights; for the consolidation of our independence; for the retrieve of our economy; for our struggle for equality, dignity, justice in the world; for our efforts in fostering international brotherhood; for the creation of a world order in which there will be complete independence of States, with freedom for each State to decide on its destiny without regard to size, ethnic grouping, color or. creed; for our unflinching fight against oppression by big or technologically advanced nations, against exploitation and enslavement of the majority by a few powerfully placed reactionary and fascist minority regimes in southern Africa; for our dedicated commitment to the liberation movements in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, we have been subjected to blackmail, vulgar abuse, commercial ostracism, economic strangulation and treachery by imperialists in league with the Fascists and Zionists. Our case has exposed the moral bankruptcy of those powerful nations of the West which through deceive have for so long held themselves up as the bastions of peace, freedom and justice. They have, in their endeavors to distort our image in the eyes of the international community through their powerful news media in order to cover up for their inadequacies at home, not only revealed their hypocrisy but to their chagrin given unprecedented publicity to our nation and the truth we stand for.\n123.\tWhile we have liberated our economy to feed our people, unemployment in the United Kingdom has but soared to an all-time record. While we have taken measures to restore our cultural values and establish justice among our people, the United Kingdom has turned to blackmail in order to confuse the world about the terrible situation of an internecine war in the United Kingdom colony of Northern Ireland, where the colonized people live in great fear for their lives. Today, the London-based organization, Amnesty International, continues to pay lip-service to the cause of justice and, as shown in its recent publication, has blackmailed over 100 nations of the world as violators of human rights without mentioning the United Kingdom and its role in Northern Ireland. It is impossible to feel secure in the United Kingdom today because of the sporadic bomb blasts which wreck churches, schools, cafeterias, bars, trains and even hospitals. Kidnappings and murders have long since ceased to shock the British society as hardly a week passes without press reports of such horrible acts. This shows the decadence of a nation which once prided itself before the entire world, a quarter of which it colonized, as the fountain of peace, freedom, justice and tranquility. Amnesty International is fed on rumors and concoctions from discredited criminals in exile and, surprisingly, feels content to continue to be fed on rumors. Where on earth have exiles spoken glowingly of the regime in their country or exposed their own criminality? Amnesty International has taken no trouble to investigate or send a team to Uganda to see for itself. Its report has indicted over 100 States. How can it be said that 95 per cent of the entire world does not conform to accepted standards? By what measures does it judge 95 per cent of the entire world? What is the justification of the continued existence of Amnesty International if it is so helplessly behind the times? It has lent itself as tools for the smear campaigns perpetrated by the colonial and imperialistic Powers that fund its existence. It wishes to divert the attention of those peoples fighting for their freedom, equality and independence in order to subvert the world order. Such tricks have not succeeded in Uganda. Such tricks have not been accepted by the peoples of the third world, who form the majority of the world society.\n124.\tWe in Uganda are proud and committed to hold the banner of independence for the oppressed peoples to see and to follow. We condemn all forms of enslavement and economic exploitation as exhibited by the minority regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa. We salute the new order in Portugal which has seen the truth and committed itself to the liberation of all its colonies which formerly were called overseas Territories. We condemn any form of territorial aggrandizement as practiced by the Zionists in the Middle East. We condemn any perpetration of illegalities in the United Nations or sustenance of the bogus State of Israel. Until 1947 there was no State of Israel, but Palestine. The colonial Powers, for their imperialistic motives, created Israel, carved out of the State of Palestine, thus causing an upheaval which, if it is not settled immediately, may throw the world into conflagration. It is reported today that, in spite of the so-called peace accord between peace-loving Egypt and the bogus State of Israel, much more powerful arms have been delivered to Israel by the United States, including missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. This has created great uncertainty and fear not only in the Middle East but in all of Africa, which in the northern corner has the Zionists and in the southern corner the Boers of South Africa. It has also accelerated the chances of nuclear confrontation, which may spell the doom of the human race.\n125.\tIsrael, like South Africa, has absolutely ignored the United Nations resolutions commanding it to withdraw from the occupied territories of Egypt, Palestine, Jordan and Syria. It is disappointing to note that some major Powers, notably the United States of America, which are founder Members of this Organization which was established to bring about a world order based upon law, justice and peace, have not only continually supported Israel in flouting United Nations resolutions, but have also equipped it with powerful armaments to make it strong enough to defy, grab and plunder its neighbor's territory. Today, without the United States of America, there would be no Israel.\n126.\tThe United States' persistent support for Israel stems from the sad history of colonization. The United States of America has been colonized by the Zionists who hold all the tools of development and power. They own virtually all the banking institutions, the major manufacturing and processing industries and the major means of communication; and have so much infiltrated the Central Intelligence Agency [CIA] that they are posing a great threat to nations and peoples which may be opposed to the atrocious Zionist movement. They have turned CIA into a murder squad to eliminate any form of just resistance anywhere in the world. The role of CIA has been revealed to the world community by United States senators and congressmen themselves, as we learn from the United States news media. The top echelon of CIA has made an admission of this. How can we expect freedom, peace and justice in the world when such a powerful nation as the United States of America is in the hands of the Zionists? I call upon the people of the United States of America whose forefathers founded this State \\\"conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal\\\" to rid their society of the Zionists in order that the true citizens of this nation may control their own destiny and exploit the natural resources of their country to their own benefit. I call for the expulsion of Israel from the United Nations and the extinction of Israel as a State, so that the territorial integrity of Palestine may be ensured and upheld.\n127.\tWhen this objective is achieved the Holy City of Jerusalem will once more revert to its holy status. Jerusalem should and will remain the holy place of\nworship tor Christians, Moslems and Jews and must be free of any military  activity. When recently I had he honor of being received by His Holiness the Pope, in our discussion we shared this view.\n128.\tI like the Jews but I do not approve of Zionism. There are many Jews in many countries who do not subscribe to the iniquitous Zionist philosophy. To these, ail the peace-loving people of the world extend their hand in friendship. Indeed, Yasser Arafat himself announced at the General Assembly last year that the Palestinian people were prepared, ready and willing to live in partnership and amity with people of all creeds, Christians, Moslems and Jews in one State, the State of Palestine. Zionist Israel has refused this offer. While millions of displaced Palestinians roam without home, without shelter, without food, millions of dollars extracted from the sweat and resources of the American people go to aid and fatten the Zionists. While the United Nations continues to pass resolutions calling for peace in the Middle East, resolutions without sanction, the displaced Palestinian people decay and perish. Their hope and reason are fast running out, To my Arab brothers I wish to give a piece of brotherly advice. If they wish to defeat Israel they must unite. No country should be diverted from the common objective without consulting the other Arab States. Lack of proper consultation causes friction and mis-understandings, to the great benefit of Israel. Arab must stop fighting Arab so that together they may face their enemy, Israel.\n129.\tI wish to emphasize that I am not a racist. I hate racialism in all its manifestations, as practiced in Rhodesia and South Africa, Apartheid, like Zionism, is an enemy to humanity itself. Uganda is totally committed to the liberation of the African peoples under colonial minority regimes. We are baffled by the double standards displayed by imperialists who, in the name of democracy, plundered Viet Nam, Cambodia and many other lands while they support oppression in Rhodesia, South Africa and the Middle East; who veto the admission of gallant Viet Nam in the same way they veto the expulsion of South Africa and Israel from the United Nations; who withhold financial support from peaceful nations and pour investments into South Africa, Rhodesia and Israel.\n130.\tWe welcome investors to come to Uganda as friends, but not as masters, and they will find us active, generous and friendly. Anyone interested in youth programs, employment programs, increased productivity programs, freedom-from-hunger programs and environmental programs, whether taken together or separately, will certainly take an interest in our law of reform and the methods we have devised and continue to devise. To this end I wish lo restate that we are non-aligned and therefore our doors are open to any country or organization in the world with aims, methods and objectives acceptable to us to participate with us in the development of our land resources for the benefit of the world.\n131 While here in the United States of America, a country that is celebrating its two hundredth year of independence from British colonialism, I should like to mention, without in any way imputing racial bias, the position of the black Americans in this country. In spite of the fact that he was forcibly brought to this country against his will, the black American has contributed as much as, if not more than, most of the other races towards the construction, development and now the economic mightiness of this country. His contribution, to his credit, stands sharply in contrast to the treatment he has received from his fellow Americans. Having been in this country for some three centuries now and at present numbering some 30 million or more, one would have expected that of the 50-odd governors in this country at least one, if not several, would be black. As to the top executive policy-makers of the Federal Government, such as Secretaries of State, one would have hoped that at this time and moment in American history this great country, a champion of peace and freedom, would have boasted of having several black faces in that group of policy-makers. But none of these hopes have materialized. Why? This is a challenge that I would like to leave with the American people. It is a challenge whose concern has been beyond United States boundaries since the United Spates became a super-Power. Hence my mentioning it here.\n132.\tWhile I leave) the entire American community with this challenge, I should like to mention specifically that the black Americans themselves are to blame in a way because of the many reported divisions in their own communities. These divisions should certainly become unnecessary in the face of continued and perpetual subjugation of their own lot by their fellow citizens. For our part in Uganda, we have done our best to champion the cause of the black Americans. In the context of the OAU, we have for the last several years now advocated their identification with the continent of their origin in the same way as the other races in this continent take pride in their ancestral homelands.\n133.\tThe international community has committed itself to intensify action in promoting equal rights, opportunities and responsibilities of men and women, to ensure the full integration of women in the total development effort and to involve women widely in international co-operation and in the strengthening of world peace through the proclamation of this year, 1975, as International Women's Year [resolution 3010 (XXVII)]. I am glad to say that as far as Uganda is concerned, under my Government we have already guaranteed, in principle and practice, equality between men and women. Both sexes have equal opportunities and responsibilities to enable them to develop their particular talents and capabilities in the service of Uganda and the rest of the international community. Ugandan women have, like their male counterparts, full opportunities to make maximum contributions in every field and are playing their roles fully and effectively at all levels of decision-making, planning and implementation of all policies, programs and projects. Our women have been fully integrated. They receive their full share of the benefits of development. In this connexion I wish to mention that there are Ugandan women at all levels of administration, including, at the top, Permanent Secretaries; there are Ugandan women professors; a Ugandan woman ambassador; doctors; lawyers; business women, and women in all areas of our total endeavor.\n134. Our faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human being is so strong that we have extended it to all spheres of our endeavors, including the prison services. Our view of prisoners is not to inflict punitive punishment on them but to reform and rehabilitate them so as to enable them to become useful and responsible members of society who make maximum contributions to the economic and social development of our country. Prisoners in Uganda are therefore trained in such fields as crop and animal husbandry, where our prison industries are some of the best farming institutions in the country. They are also trained in such other skills as furniture-making, shoe-making, tailoring, black-smithing, metalworking, handicrafts and many other industrial skills. The results we are obtaining are very good indeed in that the majority of our prisoners complete their sentences fully reformed and use the skills attained in prisons in their future lives.\n135.\tWe in Uganda believe that the best and most practical and lasting form of international co-operation is in trade. It is for this reason that I wish to remind representatives, and through them the countries they represent, that Uganda produces some of the world's best coffee, cotton, tea, tobacco, copper and many other forms of trade commodities, which are available for the international community to buy. I express the hope that, under the proposed new world economic order, Uganda, like other developing countries, will receive fair prices for its raw materials, which constitute the major part of its exports.\n136.\tUganda, which is in the very heart of Africa, astride the Equator, is renowned as one of the world's tourist paradises. The fabulous beauty of the countryside, with its rich colors; the graciousness of its traditionally friendly, courteous and hospitable people; the mighty Kabalega Falls; the snow-capped, fantastic Mountains of the Moon, carrying permanent glaciers; the source of the immortal River Nile; the unsurpassable magnificence of the equatorial forests; the many lakes and the unequaled scenic beauty; the rolling and terraced hills; the extraordinary concentrations of wild life in its national parks and game reserves, including the rare, huge but extremely shy gorillas, the precious white rhinoceros, the lordly lion, zebras, leopards, cheetahs, herds of elephants, buffaloes, hippopotamuses, huge crocodiles, bewildering varieties of bird life; the famous local dishes, including the Nile perch and the local brand of gin-cum-vodka, unforgettable waragi the elegance of Uganda's traditional crafts; Uganda's rich traditional music, dances and cultural activities; the glorious summer sunshine of the Equator and the coolness of the mountain breezes; Kampala, the capital city, standing on a series of closely-gathered, lush green hills all these tourist attractions, topped with a year-round congenial climate, provide a visitor with the experience of a lifetime. All these God-given fantastic natural treasures are available to the world community as a whole. Ugandans welcome you and your fellow compatriots to come and share them with us in the spirit of international harmony and co-operation.\n137.\tLong live Africa. Long live the third world. Long live the United Nations. For God and our country.\n138.\tMr. AMIN (Uganda): I am sure you have understood my speech in a foreign language. I would like to summarize my speech very briefly in the language of the British, the language of the former empire of which I was formerly a member. I would like to thank all of you very much for listening to my speech and I want to inform you, on behalf of the 46 independent African Member States, that we in Africa are not racists and we have no discrimination. We want to work completely with the entire world community. We want to work together with people from Europe, from Asia, from the Arab world and from the other parts of the world such as the United States and Latin America. We consider you as members of the world community. Therefore, nobody should tell you that Africans are against the whites. No. It is the members of the racist regime of South African apartheid who are the actual criminals, who are highway robbers, stealing the gold and diamonds of others.\n139.\tI thought it was necessary for me, as Field Marshal Amin, to speak to you in English so that you will understand me very well. I would like to advise the whole world community, the United Nations Members here, that it is not true that the people of Angola are against the Portuguese. The peoples of Africa are against the white regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa. But the people of Africa are a majority in that part of the world, and therefore it is not advisable for the Portuguese people to leave. Before I left Uganda to come directly here I talked with the Portuguese Government, which is now in discussions with the nine-member Conciliation Commission in Kampala. The Portuguese can stay when Angola gets its independence. They want the technicians, they want the doctors, they want the engineers for building roads, they want the electricians, they want the teachers to educate them. Now, if the whole Portuguese community or the white community runs away, who will build that particular new, independent country?\n140.\tNobody should deceive you on this. If you will read my speech, which has been read to you by my Permanent Representative to the United Nations, you will see there the pictures: Britons in the various departments of the armed forces, being recruited, taking oaths. Of all the countries in black Africa, Uganda is the first to have even supersonic women pilots and a women's squadron.\n141.\tI just wanted briefly to tell you, therefore, that even the racist regimes in the southern part of Africa should not run away. They should not fear that if we liberate southern Africa we might kill all of them or throw them into the sea. No, because the people of southern Africa want people who can work together with them, but they are the majority there and they want to control the country. They want to be the masters of their own country. Therefore, the Europeans who are there will be advisers to them. Even Imyselfhave Italian advisers in the President's Office. I have British advisers. I have Germans; I have Americans; I have people from all over the world from Asia, the Arab countries, Latin America who are working with me.\n'42. It is very important that you, the representatives, tell your countrymen, and I want you to tell them and I shall myself also be touring many parts of the world.\nI want to see that many people are recruited, as has already been mentioned by my representative. I want to get the newly independent African countries doctors, engineers, teachers, electricians, mining engineers and so forth to help in developing those countries. We have so many rich natural resources. We have gold, and many do not have it.\n143.\tToday Europe, and especially the United States of America and the Soviet Union, have the means to find minerals in the land by satellite. But in Africa we do not have the money to do that. We want assistance. Therefore, all the countries that have these means of finding minerals must assist Africa. I am speaking to you on behalf of all the States members of the OAU and not only Uganda.\n144.\tYou should not listen to any rumors. If you want to know exactly what is going on in any African country, go to see for yourself. Some people might be talking, bringing some misunderstandings, even rumors, that for instance, the relations between Somalia and Ethiopia are very bad. They are not bad at all. They are very good excellent. People are enjoying themselves. I wanted to tell you this.\n145.\tAnd also, if you wish to hear anything about Africa, the office of the OAU in Addis Ababa is open to you. We have a Secretary-General; we have myself as Chairman, and my office is open 24 hours a day. You can get any information you want to have. But you should not listen to any rumors. African problems will be solved by Africa. This is very important. We have also gone deeply into uniting the Africans and the Arabs, and this will be happening very soon now.\n146.\tIn just a few words, do not fear Africa; be very friendly to Africa; when you come to Africa, you must know that you are coming to talk with people who also have brains and who can be very friendly to you. In Africa today the people are aware and capable of doing anything that any human being in this world can do.\n147.\tWith those few points, I thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.\n"

        "file_text": "42.\t  Mr. President, may I first of all congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. I should like to recall on this occasion that the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are linked by historical relations of long standing. I wish you much success in the exercise of your exacting mission.\n43.\tPermit me also to welcome the new Member States to our ranks: the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe.\n44.\tThe year of the thirtieth anniversary of the victory over Fascist m in the Second World War has been for us, Czechs and Slovaks, an opportunity to recall the events which had such heavy repercussions on our country, beginning with the ignominious Munich diktat, and to reflect upon their causes. Those six long years of the Hitlerite occupation of Czechoslovakia taught us a tragic lesson on the meaning of fascism.\n45.\tHowever, the people of Czechoslovakia never bowed to the Nazi yoke but combated it with armed resistance. We therefore remember with lasting gratitude the liberation of our country by the Soviet Army, which enabled the Czechoslovak people to build up a truly independent State and to devote themselves to creative work in conditions of peace. As members of the anti-Fascist coalition we welcomed with appreciation the efforts of the nations, united through the struggle against fascism, to build post-war life on the basis of lasting peace, sovereign equality, co-operation and the coexistence of States with different social systems. We are proud that at San Francisco we were among the 51 founding Members of this Organization, which embodied those principles in its Charter. We are pleased to note that, despite many problems, the United Nations has, in the 30 years of its existence, proved its legitimacy and viability and thus gained prestige in international relations. We believe that at the present time it represents the most suitable forum for the solution of world problems.\n46.\tIn this connexion, however, we are not concerned merely with historical reminiscences. We are concerned with the logical connexion between the lessons of that horrible war and the task of preserving and strengthening world peace in present conditions, as well as for the future. Consequently, we are concerned with a most urgent and timely appeal for the further expansion of the policy of detente, the development of international co-operation and progress in the disarmament effort.\n47.\tOur country, which in the history of the European continent has not been by-passed by any major military conflagration, has a natural interest in the continued expansion of the process of detente, on both a European and a world-wide scale. Its concrete content, as we perceive it, is the objective that the relations between States with different social systems should be based on such principles as the non-use of force, recognition of the inviolability of borders, settlement of disputes through negotiation, mutually advantageous economic co-operation on the basis of equal rights and the exchange of the achievements of science and culture.\n48.\tThe efforts aimed at the implementation of those principles were reflected in the successful conclusion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Through the words of Gustav Husak, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and President of the Republic, Czechoslovakia welcomed at Helsinki the signing of the Final Act adopted by the Conference, that undoubtedly most significant document of our times, representing the political culmination of the results of the Second World War. Our State is prepared to implement the conclusions of the Conference consistently. In order to live, mankind cannot afford a return to the cold war, which could be the first step towards a world Hiroshima. Given the current balance of forces in the world arena, the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems is the only reasonable international policy alternative.\n49.\tA settlement of relations between States in Europe based on the Helsinki Declaration of Principles could serve as a stimulus in the search for similar settlements in other parts of the world, particularly in Asia. Initiatives aimed at the implementation of the idea of collective security on that continent also are regarded by us as rational and beneficial.\n50.\tWe. note with satisfaction that the policy of strengthening the process of international detente is gradually becoming the determining factor in the work of our Organization also. The term \\\"detente\\\" has already become a part of the political vocabulary of the United Nations. Czechoslovakia, together with the other countries of the socialist community, is exerting every effort so that the principles of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems and advantageous co-operation among them may be implemented and become a part of the day-to-day activities of the United Nations.\n51.\tHowever, we continue to be realistic. The current favorable foreign policy atmosphere notwithstanding, we are aware that the antagonists of the positive developments throughout the world have not given up their objectives, that they continue their attempts to hamper these positive developments. However, those who sow doubts about the importance of detente should realize that they will be fully responsible for playing into the hands of those forces which, for their own selfish interests, wish to return the world to the period of cold war and dangerous confrontation.\n52.\tAs a firm component part of the socialist community of States, a member of the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance and of the Warsaw Treaty Organization, whose twentieth anniversary we commemorated this year, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic marches and will continue to march along the time-tested path that it has been traveling throughout the 30 post-war years. It is in the very essence of our socialist social system to strive to safeguard lasting peace and security for the peoples of our country, because only in that way is it possible to implement the ideals inherent in the nature of socialism. The Leninist policy of peace is therefore the foundation of all our activities in the sphere of international relations. It is a policy of principle in keeping with the vital interests of mankind. Proceeding consistently from these principles, in conditions of close co-operation with the socialist countries, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has been improving and developing bilateral relations also with the other countries of the world as our contribution to the creation of a new atmosphere in international life.\n53. In the course of the past year that fact has been strongly reflected also in relations of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic with almost all Western European countries in particular with France, Finland, the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark, but also with Greece, Italy, Portugal, Turkey and other countries. After many years of negotiations, our relations with the Republic of Austria have been regulated on a basis of principle, which proves that, given goodwill and taking into account the existing realities, it is possible to solve even very complicated problems. I can state with satisfaction that at the present time Czechoslovakia has normal, businesslike, constructive relations with practically all countries on the European continent.\n54.\tThus, through the development of its relations with other States Czechoslovakia not only has created better conditions for its bilateral co-operation but also has helped to bring about conditions conducive to the success of multilateral negotiations on the safeguarding of security in Europe.\n55.\tCzechoslovakia fully understands and actively supports the endeavors of the developing countries to consolidate their independence and ensure their all-round advancement. As for the non-aligned countries, we believe that they are a significant inter-national factor in the struggle for peace, against imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism and racism, and against all forms of international exploitation. We are highly appreciative of the ever-deepening contacts with India, the Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq, Algeria, Egypt, Afghanistan, Iran and the Libyan Arab Republic, with the newly independent States of Africa, and with Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Colombia, Japan, the Philippines, and other countries.\n56.\tIn recent years negotiations have been held also on the full normalization of our relations with the United States. Through no fault of ours, however, these negotiations have not brought the hoped for results.\n57.\tIn concluding this part of my statement, I should like to stress once more that the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is determined to continue to strive for a state of affairs in which reasonable, peaceful relations, based on the principles of equality and security for all countries and on their mutually advantageous cooperation, will prevail throughout the world. This is the position we expressed, during his last visit to Prague, to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose work we hold in high esteem.\n58.\tOf extraordinary significance for the creation of a favorable atmosphere in the world is the improvement of the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. We have therefore warmly welcomed the results of the negotiations between the Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev, and the President of the United States, Mr. Gerald Ford, at Vladivostok.\n59.\tIn the period since the last session of the General Assembly a number of important events have occurred in the world which represent success for international efforts for the consolidation of peace and the elimination of hotbeds of international tension.\n60.\tWhat I have in mind, in the first place, is the historic victories of the peoples of Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos. Czechoslovakia, together with the other countries of the socialist community, considered it its international duty to assist the just struggle of those peoples until it ended in victory. We resolutely support the just demand of the Governments of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam that these two Vietnamese States, which through their acts have demonstrated their will and readiness to fulfill the obligations enshrined in the Charter and to fight for lasting peace and security in the world, should be represented in the United Nations as full Members.\n61.\tThe thirtieth session of the General Assembly should contribute to the liquidation of one of the anachronisms of the cold war and should stand up for the speedy withdrawal of all foreign troops still unlawfully stationed, under the United Nations flag, in the southern part of the Korean peninsula; for the conclusion of a peace treaty; and for the implementation of further proposals by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at the creation of favorable conditions for the liquidation of tension and the consolidation of peace in that region.\n62.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic supports the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful and democratic unification of the two parts of Korea, without foreign interference.\n63.\tThe expanding process of detente has created promising conditions for a fundamental settlement of the explosive situation in the Middle East. This situation offers an opportunity to Israel to demonstrate its willingness to observe the United Nations resolutions, to withdraw from all the territories occupied in 1967 and to respect the legitimate rights of the Arab Palestinian people, including their right to establish a State of their own. Czechoslovakia supports the proposal to resume the work of the Geneva peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of all the interested parties, including representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], provided that all delegations will come to the conference table with the aim of restoring a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. We are in favor of a comprehensive settlement of this question which would guarantee the right of all the countries of that region to their independent development.\n64.\tWe are convinced that the problem of Cyprus can also be solved by political means. Czechoslovakia wishes to voice its continued support for the Government of Cyprus; we reiterate that we are in favor of a just settlement of the Cyprus question on the basis of respect for the principles of the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and political non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus, the ending of interference in its internal affairs and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from its territory.\n65.\tThis year a broad campaign was launched throughout the world, as well as in the United Nations, demonstrating solidarity with the people of Chile in their struggle against the crimes and reprisals of the military junta which overthrew the legitimate Government of President Allende. This year's General Assembly should resolutely speak out against the gross and massive violation of basic human rights in Chile, and call for the restoration of the civil rights of the Chilean people, and for the liberation of Chilean patriots, since the junta continues to ignore the United Nations appeals, including General Assembly resolution 3219 (XXIX), and is perpetuating the terror which it has unleashed against democratic forces.\n66.\tDespite the successes of the national liberation struggle in recent years, colonialism in the world has not yet been fully liquidated. The United Nations, too, must step up its efforts so that the colonial anachronisms from past centuries might finally disappear from the political map of our times. The Czechoslovak delegation supports the request for all the administering Powers to work out a binding time-table for the speedy granting of independence to all colonial and dependent Territories which so far have been under their administration.\n67.\tA permanent expansion of the process of international detente is hardly conceivable without a further relaxation in the military sphere. Our premise must be, in this connexion, that disarmament, after all, is an indispensable component and an organic part of the process of international detente. Our State, together with the other countries of the socialist community, has always been an advocate of the need to stop the arms race and gradually to introduce effective measures leading to general and complete disarmament. For us, therefore, a priority in con-temporary international relations is the need to achieve positive and concrete results at current disarmament talks. This stems from the profound humanism of the foreign policy of the socialist States. Today the world is overflowing with weapons of the most varied types and their stockpiles continue to grow. Can there be a more human goal than to rid mankind of the danger that these weapons will be used to unleash a worldwide holocaust?\n68.\tWe, therefore, attach exceptional importance to the appeal by the Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev, for the reduction of military budgets of the great Powers, for the limitation and reduction of armaments and the creation of pre-requisites for future real disarmament. The arms race is also spurred on by the research and development of ever more destructive weapons. In this situation, when the grave dangers exist of the creation of even more horrible weapons than the nuclear ones, we should like to voice our support for the initiative launched by the Soviet Union at this year's session of the General Assembly proposing to conclude an agreement prohibiting the development and manufacture of new types\nOf weapons of mass destruction, and of new weapons systems of that type.\n69.\tIn various forums, including the United Nations, the socialist countries have always urged that the most destructive weapons be excluded from military arsenals, that atomic energy be used exclusively for peaceful purposes, and the vast sums spent on armaments be devoted to economic and social development needs. Therefore, Czechoslovakia also supports the Soviet proposal to conclude speedily a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapons tests.\n70.\tOf extraordinary importance, in our view, are the negotiations on the reduction of arms forces and armaments in Central Europe, in which we are direct participants. These negotiations should lead to a substantial reduction in the concentration of troops and armaments in Central Europe while maintaining the existing balance of forces. We hope that the new European political realities will open up new possibilities for the Vienna talks, respecting the principle that the security of any of the participating countries must not be placed in jeopardy.\n71.\tThe struggle for the liquidation of the material basis of wars is one of the major tasks in current international activities. In view of the fact that disarmament affects all States in the world, we are in favor of a speedy convening of a world disarmament conference, which should give new impetus to the struggle for a world free of weapons and wars.\n72.\tDisarmament efforts are closely connected with the possibilities of solving the urgent problems of the world economy. It is, first, a question of expanding international economic co-operation and exchange of goods, as well as assisting in the economic growth of developing countries.\n73.\tThe Czechoslovak delegation is convinced that international detente provides better chances for the settlement of international economic problems and questions of economic development, and the advancement of all-round economic, scientific and technological co-operation. In this connexion, I should like to point out that it is their broad economic co-operation which is one of the decisive factors in the speedy growth of the economies of the socialist countries. A broadly based economic, scientific and technological co-operation among the States members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is becoming an increasingly important factor in the development of their national economies, in the increase of the prosperity of their peoples and the equalization of the level of their economic development.\n74.\tThe economies of major capitalist countries are undergoing serious disruptions. These negative phenomena have a particularly profound impact on the economic advancement of the developing countries. It is therefore quite understandable that the developing countries are striving to create new international economic relations based on the principles of equality, non-discrimination, non-interference in internal affairs, independent choice of the direction of their further development and effective sovereignty over their natural resources.\n75.\tThe recently concluded seventh special session of the General Assembly on questions of development and international economic co-operation represents a considerable step forward in the introduction of progressive principles into international economic relations. The final resolution of the seventh special session [resolution 3362 (S-VII)] rightly refers to the Declaration and the program of Action or. the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-Vl)] and to the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)], which contain the principles of peaceful co-operation and stress the close inter-connexion between the consolidation of international peace and security and social and economic progress.\n76.\tThis year our Organization commemorates 30 years of its existence. It is a long enough period for the reasonable principles underlying the settlement of relations among States to gain ground throughout the world on the basis of detente, by overcoming the dangerous policy based on positions of force, cold war and confrontation. However, it was too short a time for such equitable relations among nations to prevail in the world in such a manner as would fully correspond with the need for lasting peace and inter-national security.\n77.\tTo speed up the current positive process, when confrontation gives way to dialog, to assist in the advancement of those countries which have embarked upon the road to free development, to liberate colonial countries and peoples not as yet free those are the imperatives of our time and the great obligations of our Organization.\n78.\tIt is therefore necessary to enhance the importance and the effectiveness of the United Nations in the struggle for world peace and security on the basis of strict respect for the purposes and principles of the Charter. Therefore we have to reject anything that might threaten to undermine our Organization. Such a danger results, for instance, from certain attempts to begin a process of revision of the Charter, as well as from certain proposals put forward in this connexion which are directed against the very foundations of our Organization.\n79.\tIt is necessary for the process of detente, for disarmament efforts, for the desideratum of a general economic and social advancement to converge eventually into one fundamental demand: lasting peace based on the coexistence of countries with different social systems, with all the inevitable beneficial concomitants resulting therefrom in the sphere of economic and cultural progress, in the area of a purposeful and organized enhancement of countries and peoples embarked upon the road to development.\n80.\tThis must be our outlook not only for the next 30 years, in other words, a long-term prospect, but a prospect for the nearest future as well. A contribution to this end must be made also by this year's commemorative thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "75.\t  Mr. Gaston Thorn was elected President of our Assembly virtually unanimously. His good-heartedness, his statesmanship, his complete mastery of international affairs and his proven competence admirably qualify him for that office. He may be assured of the co-operation and the sympathy of my delegation. There is no doubt that under his guidance the success and effectiveness of the work of the present session of the General Assembly is already assured. We extend to him our sincere wishes for success in the noble but very difficult tasks he will have to discharge as President of our Assembly.\n76.\tI wish also to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate the outgoing President, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, on the particularly brilliant manner in which he guided the work of the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session of the General Assembly.\n77.\tNor could I possibly forget to mention our dynamic Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the indefatigable harbinger of peace, who devotes all his skill and self-sacrifice everywhere and in all circumstances to ensure the proper functioning of our Organization. We offer him our unswerving support and our profound gratitude.\n78.\tWe are meeting once again in this forum of dialog and conciliation to deal together, so far as we are able, with the difficult problems of a world in constant change, seeking realistic means of bringing about better understanding and brotherly co-operation among nations. The international community is unquestionably living through a decisive moment in its history.\n79.\tThe decolonization process, although not yet completed, has reached the point where it confirms that the sacrifices made by the peoples of the countries which for so many years suffered oppression and servitude have not been in vain. I express the profound satisfaction of my delegation at the glorious victories over reactionary forces won in hard-fought battles by the valiant freedom fighters. The delegation of Togo warmly welcomes the admission to our Organization of the sister republics of Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe and Cape Verde. We rejoice at the accession to independence of Papua New Guinea and hope to see that country join us shortly.\n80.\tHowever, despite' our legitimate pride at seeing the representatives of those brother countries seated among us, we should not lose sight of the immensity and seriousness of the problems they face. The people of Togo, its Government and its great party, the Assembly of the Togolese people, wish once again to assure them of our constant support in their efforts to build their States.\n81.\tBut side by side with these sources of satisfaction there is, unfortunately, the tragedy now taking place in Angola, with all its unforeseeable consequences, which constitutes a challenge to the international community. My delegation therefore urgently appeals to the three liberation movements to put an end to their internal struggles, to rise above their divergences and work together for the rapid restoration of peace, thus creating favorable conditions for the accession to independence of that country, with serenity and dignity, on 11 November next. We hope, furthermore, that the great Powers will cease their interference in the internal affairs of Angola, since we are convinced that a lasting solution to that painful problem can be found only by the Angolans themselves. The delegation of Togo, while reiterating its congratulations to the new Portugal on the decolonization process which has been set in motion since the fall of the former fascist regime, expects it to do everything in its power to comply with its commitments.\n82.\tRegarding Western Sahara, my delegation reaffirms its confidence that the bordering States and Spain will succeed, now that the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice has been rendered, in finding a solution that is satisfactory for the future of that Territory, with due regard for the legitimate interests and aspirations of the peoples concerned.\n83.\tWith regard to southern Africa, I need hardly emphasize that guaranteeing individual human rights, prohibiting all forms of racism everywhere and the independence of the peoples of the region are tasks to whose fulfillment my country continues to make a sincere and energetic contribution. So that those principles may triumph, we urgently appeal to the Security Council and to the great Powers to assume their responsibilities fully and to take up the challenge of the racist Government of South Africa.\n84.\tIn Namibia, the proponents of apartheid continue to disregard the resolutions of our Organization by applying the Machiavellian plan of bantustanization, which is a constant source of concern to my Government. While reaffirming its opposition to that odious policy, my delegation calls on the racist regime of Vorster to apply, without delay, the relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations and the Dar es Salaam Declaration adopted last April by the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], concerning Namibia. We reiterate our support for the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and insist that the peoples of that Territory must be able to exercise their inalienable rights to self-determination, independence and territorial integrity.\n85.\tWe hope that in Zimbabwe a constitutional settlement will be reached as soon as possible for the transfer of power to the black majority and we renew our constant support for and active solidarity with the just cause which the brother people of Zimbabwe are defending under the guidance of the African National Congress.\n86.\tIn the Middle East the signing of the partial disengagement agreement by Egypt and Israel gives reason to hope for a general settlement of the conflict. The delegation of Togo believes that these new measures will be followed by others, so that a just and lasting peace may be established which will guarantee the existence of all States and the peaceful coexistence of all peoples in that region, without losing sight of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. It is clear that this peace cannot be effective unless the State of Israel takes the final decision to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of 22 November 1967 and 22 October 1973 respectively .\n87.\tRecent events on the Indo-Chinese peninsula have proved once again that the might of external forces cannot wipe out the determination of peoples to free themselves from oppression and imperialism. We greet the victories of the people of Indo-China. We congratulate the Government of Kampuchea which, under the enlightened guidance of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, has ejected the foreign invaders from Cambodia and recovered the seat to which that country is entitled in our Organization. The leaders of the brother country of Cambodia can be assured of the constant support of the Togolese Government in seeking solutions to their problems.\n88.\tMy delegation regrets that inopportune consider-ations prevent the admission this year of the two Viet Nams to the United Nations. Once again, countries of the third world which fulfill all the conditions provided in Article 4, paragraph 1, of our Charter for occupying a seat in this Organization are victims of the inconsiderate abuse of the right of veto which is the privilege of a group of rich countries.\n89.\tAs regards the Korean problem, the position of the Government of Togo, which I stated at the twenty- ninth session [2257th meeting], has not altered. We are firmly convinced that only by the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea can conditions conducive to the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea be created. To that end there is an urgent need to convert the Armistice Agreement into a peace agreement.\n90.\tThe question of Cyprus continues to cause anxiety. The delegation of Togo at the appropriate time stated its view to the effect that any prospect of peace must start with the unconditional withdrawal of all foreign forces from the island. My delegation again expresses the hope that every effort will be encouraged so as to ensure for the two communities the possibility of harmonious co-existence within the same State. To this end we shall support any initiative calling for the immediate implementation of General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) and Security Council resolutions 365 (1974) and 367 (1975) calling on all States to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus.\n91.\tWith regard to economic questions, it is important to emphasize that the results achieved at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly clearly reflect the policies which are taking shape with the aim, on the one hand, of tackling the economic difficulties of all kinds which the world has been faced with since the end of the Second World War and, on the other, of controlling over the longer term the underlying cyclical or circumstantial fluctuations.\n92.\tMore than ever before the international community is questioning not only the capacity of its economic system for promoting material progress and social justice but also its ability to prevent an upheaval in political, economic and social relations. The fact that the different schools of thought disagree on the causes of the ills afflicting the world economy is not surprising, since the distortion of that economy has created real chaos by maintaining an archaic system which has ceased to meet the requirements of our new society.\n93.\tThe growing gap which separates a small number of industrialized countries from a large number of developing countries adds a new dimension to the present economic crisis, one of the causes of which is the faulty functioning of the international monetary system.\n94.\tIndeed, on many occasions several industrialized States have deliberately violated the sacrosanct rules of the International Monetary Fund because they considered themselves sufficiently powerful to avoid any reprisals. The distorting effects of speculative transfers of capital, the constant deterioration in the terms of trade and the uncontrolled fluctuations in rates of exchange have wiped out the efforts of poorer countries to emerge from economic and financial dependence. Thus the third world suffers from the arrestation of its own economic growth and, what is more, from the cumulative effects of the arrestation of economic growth in the industrialized countries.\n95.\tAll the efforts of the third world to bring order back to the international monetary system have encountered criminal indifference on the part of the industrialized countries which are hardly inclined to abandon any of their privileges for the benefit of those who have contributed to making them rich.\n96.\tThe results of the Third United Nations Conference on Trade and Development held at Santiago, Chile, have scarcely been more fruitful than those of the second session held at New Delhi. At most, a Committee of 20 has been established in which certain developing countries have acquired the right to participate in discussions on the reform of the monetary system, thus giving a democratic coloring to the former Committee of 10, in which only the main financial Powers took part.\n97.\tRecent events have confirmed the dangers of using national currencies as instruments of international reserve, Thus, fluctuations in the value of the reserve currencies and, in particular, the growing cost of acquiring gold as an instrument for the final conversion of reserve currencies have emphasized the need to devise a neutral instrument that would be free from these major disadvantages. This means that the developing countries are right in supporting the proposal to make the special drawing rights the inter-national monetary standard and in demanding a link between the allocation of those rights and their own needs.\n98.\tThe deterioration in the terms of trade and the fluctuations in export earnings dangerously jeopardize the development plans of the poorer countries with fragile economies.\n99.\tIn this respect, the Lome Convention, which associates a large number of States of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific with the European Economic Community has the great merit of providing for a mechanism for the establishment of a system for the stabilization of export earnings from commodities. The international community should use the example of this measure of great political significance in efforts to render more equitable the economic relations between the developing countries which produce raw materials and the affluent countries which use these products, thus, in our opinion, averting a useless confrontation between nations.\n100.\tFifteen West African States, representing approximately 130 million inhabitants, breaking through the linguistic barriers they inherited from colonialism, have refused to continue to have their region divided into English-speaking and French- speaking sectors and, on 28 May 1975 at Lagos, signed the Treaty establishing the Economic Community of West African States. This historic Treaty, in the conclusion of which my country is proud to have participated, is intended to promote co-operation and development among the signatory States in every field of economic activity and particularly in the sectors of industry, transport, telecommunications, energy, agriculture, natural resources, trade, monetary and financial questions and social and cultural aifairs, with the aim of raising the level of living of the populations, increasing and maintaining their economic stability, strengthening relations among themselves and contributing to the progress and development of the African continent. The States of West Africa are aware that their efforts at co-operation should not hinder those of other African countries to promote broader co-operation in our continent as a whole and in the world. We believe that this is a very good example of international co-operation which should be followed elsewhere.\n101.\tThe non-aligned countries recently proved strikingly, at Lima, that the international community needs peace and security and that the noble ideals of the United Nations can be achieved only by narrowing the enormous gap between rich and poor countries.\n102.\tThe industrialized countries have often reproached the developing countries for preferring confrontation to dialog, by having a so-called automatic majority play its role. That is not so. Conciliation has always been and remains our best weapon. That is why we desired and secured the holding of special sessions to study problems relating to raw materials, development and international economic co-operation so as to arrive at concerted solutions likely to hasten the emergence of a new world economic order. The Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)] adopted by the sixth special session, the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] adopted by the twenty- ninth session and the relevant final resolution on development and international economic co-operation [resolution3362 (S-VII)] adopted by the seventh special session should lead the rich countries to renounce their desire for economic domination so as to enable the poor countries to draw the maximum benefits from their natural resources with a view to their economic liberation.\n103.\tThus our Organization has become the center for major explanations, reconciliation of views, negotiations and decisions of the utmost importance between the developed world and the developing world, in so far as it seeks to correct the present imbalances so as to establish a new international economic order which is more just and humane. In order fully to attain this objective, however, we must restructure the economic and social system of our Organization so that it will be better able to meet the wishes of the emerging countries. It is, therefore, no mere chance that the General Assembly, at its twenty-ninth session and in resolution 3343 (XXIX), called for \\\"a study containing proposals on structural changes within the United Nations system so as to make it fully capable of dealing with problems of international economic co-operation\\\".\n104.\tA Group of Experts on the Structure of the United Nations System has devoted itself to this task and has sought the most suitable means whereby our Organization, having rid itself of this dead wood, will be able to focus in the future on the real problems of development and maintain cohesion in the international community.\n105.\tWe understand and approve the conclusions reached by that Group3 which, inter alia, advocates major changes in the central structure of the United Nations new approaches to economic problems and a thorough reform of the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies. Following in the footsteps of that Group, the seventh special session of the General Assembly decided to establish the Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System [ibid.] to prepare detailed proposals for action. My delegation hopes that this Committee will start its work as early as possible so as to be able to submit a report in the near future.\n106.\tAs we see it, our Organization faces immense tasks. To discharge them fully we need increased support from all its Members, large and small, rich and poor, powerful and weak. It is the duty of all to make a contribution to the carrying out of those tasks.\n107.\tThere can be no development without peace, and peace is a matter of goodwill. The new Togo, under the enlightened leadership of General Gnassingbe Eyadema, an apostle of peace, understands this well and spares no effort to achieve a better understanding among peoples, in particular those of the west African subregion.\n108.\tThat is our modest contribution to the attainment of the noble objectives which the international community has set for itself.\n109.\tI hope that our common will to bequeath to future generations a better world of prosperity, justice and peace will prompt us to do everything in our power to ensure the success of our Organization.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "94.\tOn behalf of the delegation of Burma, I wish to extend my warm congratulations to the President on his election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. We assure him of our full co-operation in the discharge of the responsibilities of his high office.\n95.\tAt the same time may I express the appreciation of the delegation of Burma to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika for the distinguished services he performed as the President of the last session of the General Assembly.\n96.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to express our warm felicitations to the delegations of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe on their admission to membership in this world Organization.\n97.\tWhile on this subject of the question of admission of new States to membership in the United Nations, I wish to state the consistent view of my Government that each application for membership should be decided strictly on its merits in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Charter.\n98.\tIn the case of a divided nation or a divided country, it has also been the consistent position of my Government to take into account the views and wishes of the two sides concerned in any matters affecting the divided nation or country as a whole, especially pending the reunification of the country.\n99.\tThe delegation of Burma accordingly regrets the absence of the delegations of its two friendly neighbors, the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam, which have agreed between themselves to seek admission to membership in the United Nations pending reunification.\n100.\tUnprecedented developments in the world situation since the United Nations was founded have given added urgency and dimension to the general concern about the maintenance of international peace and security and the solution of the growing political, economic and social problems now facing mankind. These developments, which could not have been fully anticipated by the founders of the United Nations, have thus posed serious challenges to the international community, whose survival and future largely depend on their ability to meet these imperatives of our time. However inadequate it may seem in the present circumstances, the United Nations system has been useful in creating the conditions of calm that are so essential for the peaceful settlement of disputes, be they political, economic or social.\n101.\tAs is well known, the United Nations system as regards the maintenance of international peace and security has been greatly hampered by the new antagonisms that arose soon after the end of the Second World War. Still, to our mind there can be no substitute for an organization of a universal character, with collective responsibility, if international security is to be effectively ensured.\n102.\tIf the role of the United Nations is to be strengthened in fulfillment of its obligations, Member States must be prepared to respect the decisions of its appropriate organs. Such decisions, it must be stressed, should be strictly in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and must be impartial in intent and application.\n103.\tWhile on this subject of the United Nations' peace-keeping role, my delegation deems it appropriate to observe that justice, as distinct from peace, should prevail in the settlement of international disputes; for without the one the other cannot be expected in the long run. This should obviously apply to cases such as the Middle East conflict, the lasting settlement of which cannot be secured unless a just solution can be found to the Palestinian question.\n104.\tMeanwhile, it is necessary to face up to one serious source of instability and conflict if peace is to be preserved. I refer to the practice of outside intervention in the internal or external affairs of States. The war in Indo-China, which has brought untold human suffering and massive material destruction, and which has caused general instability in the southeast Asian region as a whole, can undoubtedly be attributed to outside intervention on a very large scale.\n105.\tA process of social change and modernization is now taking place in many parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America and is to be welcomed. This process is in most cases accompanied by dislocation and convulsion. Unless some kind of action is taken by the international community to curb the tendency on the part of extraneous forces to intervene in such unsettled situations, local conflicts and local wars are likely to arise and even to intensify.\n106.\tAs we all know, in the preamble to the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV), annex], the General Assembly states:\n\\\"Convinced that the strict observance by States of the obligation not to intervene in the affairs of any other State is an essential condition to ensure that nations live together in peace with one another, since the practice of any form of intervention not only violates the spirit and letter of the Charter, but also leads to the creation of situations which threaten international peace and security\\\".\n107.\tOn behalf of the delegation of Burma, I wish to express our full support for the appeal made by\nthe Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [A110001 /Add. I, sect. XXI] that we, States Members of the United Nations, now go from eloquently expressed allegiance to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which include the principle of non-intervention, to the far more difficult task of making these principles a reality.\n108.\tThe gap between professions and performance, goals and fulfillment, is glaringly evident in the field of arms control and disarmament. In 1959 the General Assembly considered general and complete disarmament to be the most important question facing the world and expressed the hope that measures leading towards the goal of complete and general disarmament would be worked and agreed upon in the shortest possible time [resolution 1378 (XIV)}. But since 1959 the military arsenals of the major armed Powers have grown steadily in size and in diversity, world military expenditures have doubled, entirely new families of weapons of mass destruction have been developed and stockpiled, lethal weapons have become more lethal. As a result the original vision of a completely disarmed, peaceful and prosperous world has receded further and further into the horizon.\n109.\tIn the field of so-called partial and collateral measures also, the results achieved to date, and those which we may reasonably expect in the foreseeable future, are on the whole disappointing. I have no mind to ignore the several arms control agreements which we have been able to conclude, or to belittle their importance. But the inescapable fact remains that, when viewed against the overall magnitude of the armaments problem, the gains represented by those agreements are very small indeed. Even so, there have regrettably been no follow-up measures to augment those initial gains, although the Disarmament Decade has already reached its half-way mark.\n110\tThe prospects that one sees when one surveys the disarmament scene or contemplates its future progress are not very promising. Representing a peace- loving country which ardently desires to see this world of ours freed from the proliferation of armaments, the delegation of Burma would like to echo the hope expressed by the Secretary-General in the brilliant introduction to his report that: \\\"Member States will, with a sense of urgency, give new attention to an ancient problem which has\tpresented itse l in so ominous a form as today.\\\" [A/IOOOllAdd.l, sect. VIII.]\n111\tIn the economic, social and cultural fields, the United Nations has been more effective. However, the magnitude and the urgency of the problems involved are indeed formidable. The capacity of the United Nations to act as a center for harmonizing the policies and actions of nations is being put to a most severe test. The Organization should continue to play a constructive role in the evolution of a comprehensive approach to resolving the economic and social problems of our increasingly interdependent world.\n112. As we all know, two special sections of the General Assembly were held recently, devoted entirely\nto Economic matters. Considering the growing importance of economic issues in world affairs, it is highly opportune that the special sessions were held at this time. We therefore feel that the initiators of the\nmeetings as well as those participating in their preparation should be commended.\n113.\tRecent economic discussions have centered on the establishment of a new international economic order. The major decision was, of course, taken at the sixth special session. In particular, the program of Action adopted at that session contained many useful proposals which would contribute greatly towards the creation of a fairer world economic order.\n114.\tWhat is being attempted at present is no less than to restructure and re-order the existing international economic relationships. This is not an easy task. For understandable reasons, many countries have strong views on the matter and difficulties remain.\n115.\tNevertheless, some progress has been made. Thus the continuing debate has helped clarify many complex issues. In the process, new approaches and new courses of action, too, have been devised and recommended.\n116.\tBut, above all, the intensification of the debate in the wake of new developments in the structure of world economic power has given rise to a spirit of greater mutual accommodation, This was clearly discernible at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries held at Lima last August.\n117.\tSimilarly, an expression of a spirit of conciliation was also noticeable at the recently concluded seventh special session. Likewise, there was a desire on the part of all the participating countries to make progress and to achieve concrete results, thus agreement was reached for further co-operation in several key problem areas.\n118\tGiven this situation, the United Nations should help promote the emerging spirit of international cooperation and make it a vital force in world development. It is also implicit that to do so, the effectiveness of the United Nations must be enhanced in dealing with problems of development and international economic co-operation.\n119\tBy saying this we do not wish to deny that the United Nations is at present performing a useful function in international economic and social development. But its resources are limited, while the needs of world development are large. Hence it is all the more important to make effective use of the available resources.\n120\tWe are therefore in favor of the new initiatives that are being taken to make the United Nations a more effective instrument of development and international economic co-operation. We hope that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System established by the General Assembly at its seventh special session [resolution 3362 (S-VUJ] to prepare detailed action proposals will be able to make concrete recommendations which all of us can support.\n121\tThe ever-growing interdependence of States and the need for promoting co-operation among them so as to be able to take collective action in various field obviously cjS for the strengthening of the United Nations The move to examine what structural change are needed tn t h e United Nations system to make more efficient and economical is, therefore, to be welcomed However, structural changes alone will not create necessary co-operative relations among Member States. In this context, it will be necessary to take into account the possibilities and the scope of organizing specific needs, whether in the field of international security, economic development, communications or cultural co-operation. Only then can any structural or organizational changes that may be made secure the support and understanding of the Member States.\n122.\tAnother area in which urgent and timely international action is called for concerns the unfinished work of the third session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. As we all know, international maritime law, although it was codified as recently as 1958, has already become ill-adapted to meet contemporary needs and concerns. Under the impact of rapid and far-reaching political, economic and technological developments, the legal system established by the four Geneva conventions of 1958 on the law of the sea is fast becoming inadequate in fulfilling its primary purpose, which is to prevent disputes and conflicts among States in the ocean environment and to ensure a peaceful, orderly and equitable utilization of the seas and their vast resources. There can hardly be any doubt that the \\\"Geneva system\\\" cannot much longer withstand the thrusts and responses arising out of technological innovation, political aims and economic necessity. A breakdown of that system will inevitably deal a severe blow to the cause to which my country is firmly dedicated of promoting the progressive establishment of, and universal respect for, the rule of law in this world. Surely, there can be no rule of law on a world-wide basis if legal confusion and disorder prevail over the 70 per cent of the earth's surface that is covered by the seas.\n123.\tTherefore every State, large or small, rich or poor, landlocked or coastal, has a vital, overriding interest in a speedy elaboration of a new, comprehensive international treaty that would replace the outdated Geneva system by a new legal order which would be just and equitable and, for that reason, more stable, durable and viable. I am not unmindful of the complexity of the issues involved, the multiplicity of the national interests that need to be harmonized, and the sheer magnitude of the undertaking in hand, which is nothing less than to legislate for the international community as a whole on a long-term basis. I therefore realize that the task before the Conference is by no means simple or easy, and will require time for successful completion.\n124.\tBut we must also bear in mind that the political, economic and technological changes to which I have earlier alluded are taking place inexorably, thereby making the need for an international consensus on a new legal regime for the seas not only imperative but one of the utmost urgency.\n125.\tShould the negotiations at the Conference become indefinitely protracted or fruitless, they will surely be overtaken by events. The alternative indeed, the only alternative to collective international consensus is unilateral State action. In this regard I can do no better than to recall the wise words of the President of the Conference, Mr. Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka, when he emphasized the urgent need to modernize the law of the sea, by saying: \\\"Necessity knows no law\\\".\n126.\tMy delegation earnestly hopes that when the Conference resumes its work in the spring of next year a spirit of accommodation and a resolute political will will be displayed on all sides in the measure needed to make the Conference a total success.\n\n\n\n\n"

In view of the centuries-old ties of kinship and warm friendship which unite our two countries, it is for the Netherlands a matter of particular joy to see the Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in the Chair of this Assembly.\n46.\tEarlier this year an agreement was reached between the three partners of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, under which Suriname will soon achieve full sovereign independence. The Government and the people of the Netherlands and of the Netherlands Antilles are looking forward to the day when the General Assembly will welcome Suriname as a new Member of the Organization. The Netherlands and Suriname have agreed to continue the closest possible co-operation after independence.\n47.\tI take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to the three new Members of the Organization, Cape Verde, Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe.\n48.\tIn approaching the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations it is fitting to recall the great hopes and expectations which inspired the foundation of the Organization. In 1945 there was a deep yearning for peace and the determination to establish a new, dynamic system of international relations based not simply on existing power relations but on the ideals of justice and equality.\n49.\tAfter 30 years the Organization is confronted with the paradox that increased political and economic interdependence has not yet led to a strengthening of the United Nations. There is doubt and uncertainty about its future. In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General puts a searching question to the Members of the United Nations. He wrote:\n. . can they develop the capacity of the Organization for dealing with the global problems which now face all nations and which can certainly not be dealt with in isolation or by one nation or group of nations alone?\\\" [Al10001/ Add .1, sect. /.]\nThe answer to this question is by no means obvious.\n50.\tIt cannot be denied that in the last few years the danger of what has been called a creeping irrelevancy has emerged, interest in the United Nations has decreased and there is a tendency to deal with vital problems outside the United Nations. Moreover, regionalism, regional organizations and other new groupings, however legitimate and useful in themselves, have affected the strength of the Organization.\n51.\tThe ideal of universality is almost achieved but the rapid increase in membership at the same time tend: to lead to unwieldiness. Legitimate frustration and impatience with lack of progress in solving political and economic problems have led to the temptation to use majorities for unrealistic and, in some cases highly controversial decisions, which in turn give rise to bitter recriminations. Attempts other than in full compliance with the Charter to affect rights of Member States would, if pursued, seriously undermine the principle of universality and threaten the verj existence of the Organization.\n52.\tIn matters of peace and security the Security Council has not been able effectively to perform the functions assigned to it under the Charter. In a number of cases the provisions for the peaceful settlement of disputes and for peace-keeping have worked, but on the whole the balance is negative.\n53.\tThe world is faced with the worst economic recession since the war, affecting both rich and pool countries. Solutions are being sought in parts of the United Nations system and other organizations, but this vital world-wide problem eludes the world-wide Organization, which alone under its Charter should be called upon to deal with it in a comprehensive manner.\n54.\tPeace and security are intimately linked wit! economic and social progress, but up till recently the problems of economic development have never beer attacked at a high political level.\n55.\tI am convinced that, perhaps more than ever, the United Nations remains the only indispensable instrument for world-wide co-operation. It is, therefore, imperative urgently to seek remedies to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace and security and for economic co-operation through restructuring its system, revitalizing its negotiating process and, above all, renewing the political commitment of Member States to make full use of the Organization. The seventh special session has shown that, given the right conditions, the job can be done.\n56.\tIn East-West relations, detente has continued. The balance of power has had a stabilizing effect on actual and potential situations which threaten peace and security but has not solved them. Neither has the rapprochement between some of the big Powers led to the strengthening of the United Nations, or of the Security Council, in accordance with the purposes of the Charter.\n57.\tThe results of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe can represent a step forward on the road to detente and co-operation in Europe, provided they are translated into action. They could constitute a first step towards new political, economic and cultural relations based on sovereignty, equality and respect for human rights. This, in turn, should contribute to world-wide detente and co-operation and, in due course, to the strengthening of the United Nations. The Netherlands attaches particular importance to the principles of self-determination and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. As the Netherlands Prime Minister stated at Helsinki: \\\"Peace in Europe can only rest upon a firm foundation if these principles are applied and respected\\\".\n58.\tPolitical detente should be complemented by military detente, another test case for judging the follow-up of Helsinki. In this regard I wish to emphasize the importance of the Vienna negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions in Central Europe. A positive outcome of those negotiations will enhance both European and global security.\n59.\tIn the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General has rightly underlined the extreme dangers which the excessive arsenals of both conventional and nuclear weapons entail for the security of mankind. Indeed, the continuing arms race is one of the most serious failures of the international community.\n60.\tThe prevention of nuclear proliferation remains a matter of top priority. The Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons certainly helped to focus international attention on this problem and in particular on the grave risks involved in the spread of nuclear capabilities. There is, therefore, an urgent need for new measures to complement the role of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] as a barrier to proliferation and to prevent the diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful to military purposes. In this respect, I have noted with keen interest the proposals of my United Kingdom colleague, Mr. Callaghan. The frustrations expressed by many non-nuclear-weapon States place a heavy responsibility on the nuclear-weapon parties to the Treaty. After so many years of negotiations the nuclear Powers should finally agree on a comprehensive test-ban agreement and on effective measures of nuclear arms control which would do justice to the legitimate demands of the non-nuclear-weapon Powers.\n61.\tThe Netherlands continues to consider the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament an important vehicle for detailed negotiations on international disarmament and will make every effort to promote concrete agreements, not only with regard to nuclear weapons, but also on conventional weapons, chemical weapons and other weapons of a dubious nature, including weaponry which may affect the human environment. We have an open mind regarding possibilities and suggestions for improving the framework for future disarmament discussions.\n62.\tIn order to ensure international peace and security, a just and durable peaceful settlement of the conflict in the Middle East is imperative. The resolutions of the Security Council, in particular resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), together with the declaration of 6 November 1973 of the nine European countries participating in European political co-operation, contain the elements indispensable to such a peaceful settlement. The road to a settlement acceptable to all parties concerned is difficult. The Netherlands Government welcomes all measures which can contribute to leveling that road.\n63.\tWe are therefore particularly satisfied that fine statesmanship on all sides, by all concerned, made it possible at the beginning of this month to conclude a new disengagement agreement between Egypt and Israel. I hope it will soon be possible to agree on further steps which may eventually lead to a final peace settlement, bringing justice and security for all concerned. I attach considerable importance to the valuable role assigned to the United Nations in the disengagement agreements, which provide for the stationing of United Nations forces between the parties.\n64.\tThe situation in Cyprus continues to cause the gravest concern. Obviously, the present situation cannot possibly be maintained. It is imperative that the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the island be fully respected, and that the parties involved in the dispute scrupulously refrain from unilateral action. Although I am convinced that a political solution that will respect the integrity of the Republic of Cyprus cannot be reached unless all aspects of the problem are tackled comprehensively, I want particularly to stress the urgent need for a humane solution of the refugee problem on the island. I wish to pay a tribute to the patient efforts of the Secretary-General in the search for a solution of the Cyprus problem.\n65.\tExperience with United Nations peace-keeping operations, especially in Cyprus and in the Middle East, has demonstrated the essential role which the United Nations can play. The need remains, however, to renew the efforts to design a permanent framework for such operations.\n66.\tThe balance of United Nations efforts in the maintenance of international peace and security is uneven. I therefore agree with the Secretary-General on the need for reconsidering and, as he puts it,\n\\\"... revitalizing, in forms suited to the realities of our time, the concept of collective security and collective responsibility for the maintenance of peace through the United Nations.\\\" [A/IOOOIl Add.], sect. VII.]\n67.\tDetente cannot be restricted to one region or continent; it must be world-wide. For Korea, the General Assembly has laid the groundwork for such detente in its consensus of the twenty-eighth session.2 That consensus must now be implemented so as to allow further progress towards the peaceful reunification of the country, in conformity with the draft resolution of which the Netherlands delegation is a sponsor [AIC.IIL.708].\n68.\tThe situation in southern Africa, for decades an area of major concern to the United Nations, represents a mixture of hope and frustration. As a result of Portugal's vigorous decolonization policy, Mozambique has become independent. The Netherlands Government sincerely hopes that in Angola, which is on the threshold of independence, the tragic conflict between the liberation movements can soon be settled in a spirit of national reconciliation.\n69.\tEncouraged by the mediation efforts of the political leaders of neighboring countries, talks have recently been held on the future of Southern Rhodesia, where the illegal Smith regime is still in power, So far no positive results have been achieved. Before the situation becomes untenable, the Salisbury regime \n194\nshould yield to the legitimate demands of the African population for equality and majority rule.\n70.\tNo less urgent is the situation in Namibia. The South Africa Government must recognize the Organization's responsibility for Namibia and the role of the United Nations Council for Namibia, and must respect the wishes of its people to preserve the integrity of the Territory. The consultations organized by the South African Government on the basis of ethnic and tribal groupings are no substitute for the necessary negotiations with the representatives of all political movements within the population of Namibia.\n71.\tIn South Africa itself there is still no evidence that the Government is prepared to give up its fundamental positions with regard to the policy of apartheid. I strongly urge that Government to relinquish its racial policy, which must in the long run lead to disaster, and to have the courage to turn to new policies based on human dignity, equality and fundamental human rights.\n72.\tEarlier I stressed the link between peace and security and economic development. Last week the United Nations and its Member States achieved a major success in international economic relations. I refer to the results of the seventh special session of the General Assembly. After thorough preparations and serious negotiations, concrete agreement was reached at a high political level on a practical program to deal with the structural problems of development co-operation. The major industrialized countries took the demands of the developing countries seriously and came prepared for a genuine dialog. Negotiations took place on the basis of positions of equality. As a result, both developing and developed countries were able to make concessions. Developing countries, acting in solidarity, opted for conciliation and co-operation instead of confrontation; developed countries were equally willing to search for new avenues of co-operation. Both were determined to allow the political will to achieve results to prevail.\n73.\tThe concept of a new international economic order may still be controversial. The seventh special session has shown, however, that there is no disagreement on the need for fundamental structural change in international economic relations. We have agreed on an agenda of action. We must now see to it that the political momentum is not lost and that we move ahead in practical terms.\n74.\tLast week the President of France convened a preparatory meeting for the Paris conference on energy, raw materials, development and finance which will, I hope, meet before the end of the year. The unanimous decisions of the seventh special session of the General Assembly represent a sound basis for fruitful negotiations at the Paris conference and, at the same time, provide the framework for the necessary feedback of its results to the appropriate organs of the United Nations system.\nimplementation of the decisions of the special session. Last week the Netherlands Government proposed to Parliament an increase in its development co-operation budget for 1976 to an amount representing 1.2 per cent of our gross national product. In terms of official development assistance, expenditure for 1976 will exceed the 0.7 per cent target of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. Netherlands development co-operation will continue to be directed towards achieving structural changes in world economic relations and assisting the poorest countries and the poorest groups within countries.\n76.\tA large portion of our assistance will be earmarked to meet the immediate needs of developing countries and in particular the most seriously affected countries.\n77.\tThe Netherlands proposes to explore, together with other delegations, the possibility of taking action at this session of the General Assembly in the important field of the immediate needs of developing countries.\n78.\tThe seventh special session was primarily concerned with practical problems of economic development. Its follow-up should include the social and distributive factors of development and the role of women in development in conformity with the many valuable ideas put forward during the World Conference of the International Women's Year, held at\nI Mexico City in June and July.\n79.\tIf the seventh special session is to serve as a milestone in a progressive dynamic process towards new international economic relations, the United Nations machinery will have to be restructured and strengthened in order to enable the system to perform the tasks which it is called upon to carry out.\n80.\tThe Netherlands, therefore, attaches great importance to the decision of the special session [resolution 3362 (S-VII)] to set in motion the process of restructuring the United Nations system. We broadly endorse the principles and purposes contained in the report of the Group of Experts on the Structure of the United Nations System.3 In particular, I wish to stress the need to strengthen the Economic and Social Council and the Administrative Committee on Co-ordination.\n81.\tIf definite progress has been made in the economic field, the outlook with regard to human rights is far less favorable. There is still a wide gap between the human rights ideals reaffirmed some 30 years ago in the Charter of the United Nations and further elaborated in other international instruments, and the reality of human rights situations. Although progress has been made in certain respects since these freedoms were proclaimed, disregard of and contempt for human rights and fundamental freedoms are still afflicting many people. Racial discrimination and racism still persist, in spite of the energetic efforts of the United Nations. Acts of intimidation and repression are widely committed as a means to capture, exercise and maintain power at any price, and to suppress freedom of expression.\n82.\tPractices of torture and of other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment, often victimizing people who come out in favor of social justice, continue to be reported from various quarters. No continent is free\n75.\tFor the Netherlands and its partners in the European Economic Community it was a source of great satisfaction to see that the European Communities could make a constructive contribution to the success of the special session. In its national policy and in co-operation with its partners in the Community, the Netherlands pledges its full co-operation in the \nfrom this evil, which is a threat to human dignity and an offense against humanity, and which could be an impediment to peace and detente. That is why the Netherlands attaches so much importance to the principles of human rights contained in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975. That is why we cannot condone arbitrary arrest and why we reject capital punishment anywhere in Europe or elsewhere.\n83.\tThe Netherlands welcomes the decision of the Fifth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders to submit a draft of an international Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture or Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment [Al10260, para. /J] to this General Assembly for approval.\n84.\tThe situation with regard to human rights in Chile remains a source of deep concern. The Netherlands Government deplores the decision of the Chilean Government not to admit the fact-finding mission established by the Commission on Human Rights and rejects that Government's reasons for that refusal. I strongly urge the Chilean Government to reverse its unfortunate decision and to restore full respect for human rights.\n85.\tIt is obvious that the United Nations has a long way to go in the promotion and protection of human rights and that its capacity to deal effectively with situations in which these rights are encroached upon must be strengthened. I have in mind the creation of the function of a high commissioner for human rights and, perhaps, the establishment of a council on human rights as a permanent organ of the United Nations.\n86.\tAnother area in which the United Nations has been unable to live up to the provisions of the Charter is the progressive development of international law, which has not kept pace with the sometimes dramatic changes in political and economic relations. It is disturbing to note the widely different concepts of international law among Member States. For instance, no agreement has been possible so far on joint action to combat the scourge of terrorism, a field where international co-operation is urgently needed.\n87.\tAnother case in point is the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which again, as a result of wide differences of view, failed to produce agreement on the fundamental issue of the international regime of the sea-bed and its resources outside national jurisdiction. The Netherlands Government will do everything in its power to promote a universally acceptable treaty on the law of the sea, in which common, international interest should prevail over narrow national preoccupations. The international community would cause itself great harm if it failed to arrive at such a treaty in the near future.\n88.\tThe United Nations will inevitably suffer if it fails to reconcile the present differences on the rules of international law with the overriding requirements of mutual interest and co-operation.\n89.\tI have tried to analyze and assess the present state of affairs in the United Nations. The Organization and its Member States would do well to recall the fate of the League of Nations, which lost impact and relevancy because its members failed to use its full potential. Today, mankind is more than ever conscious of the interrelationship between peace and security, economic and social development, human rights and the rule of law. If the United Nations fails in one, the negative effect will spread to other areas.\n90.\tThe Netherlands Government, conscious of the threats to the cohesion and effectiveness of the United Nations, wishes to re-emphasize that the United Nations remains an indispensable instrument for worldwide co-operation. There is no alternative to the United Nations. All efforts must therefore be made to strengthen the capacity of the Organization to maintain peace and security and to promote international political and economic co-operation. In this respect, I wish to recall that the nine member States of the European Economic Community, in the Declaration adopted by the heads of State and Government on 17 July, jointly affirmed the need to strengthen the role and the effectiveness of dialog and worldwide co-operation. The Community stands ready to play its role to that end.\n91.\tAt the beginning of this thirtieth session a number of positive and encouraging developments augur well for our work in the months ahead: in particular, the positive outcome of the seventh special session. If we wish to preserve the United Nations, let all of us, each nation and each group of nations, grasp this new opportunity for joint action and maintain its political momentum in order to give renewed vigor to the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I first express to you most hearty congratulations from my Government and from myself on your election to the presidency of the thirtieth regular session of the General Assembly. I am sure that your own experience and personal distinction as Prime Minister of Luxembourg and the wisdom and the diplomatic skills for which your country has long been famous will stand you in good stead as you preside over the meetings of this session.\n2.\tAnd this session is a historic one. We are commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations. This is a time for some satisfaction and much reflection. Our Organization, whose Charter was written in the final months of the greatest conflict the world has ever suffered, has grown and developed through 30 difficult years, which have subjected it to great strain. But we, the Members of the Organization, must pause to reflect how far we have succeeded in our efforts to implement the purposes and the principles of the Charter. We must reaffirm the principles and ideals, and recapture the enthusiasm, which animated those who drafted the Charter in 1945.\n3.\tThe Charter has stood the test of time very well. We have all yet to make full use of the Organization to achieve the primary purpose declared in Article 1, to achieve international co-operation in solving economic and social problems. But the seventh special session made an excellent new start, and was a most important step towards resolving the major questions it faced. There was constructive debate and effective negotiation, with an evident desire for improvement in international economic relations. Its resolution [3362 (S-VIl)] was adopted unanimously, and the further negotiation on its detailed provisions is already beginning.\n4.\tOn this occasion, so soon after the special session, I wish only to re-emphasize that in the course of these further negotiations Australia will examine on their merits all proposals deriving from the resolution, for we support the thrust and objectives of the resolution and the achievement of a new international economic order.\n5.\tThe success of the special session in the face of the complexity of the interests at stake, some of them involving competition for limited resources, is renewed and timely proof of the high value of the United Nations. We must treat this invaluable asset with care.\n6.\tOur Charter opens with the expression of the determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. This was a passionate conviction which bound together the delegations at San Francisco. Today it is vital that all of us gathered here and the Governments that we represent should be equally determined to prevent developments which could lead to war. The past 30 years have not been scarred by a catastrophe of the scale of the two world wars, but they have been marked and marred by many smaller conflicts. The United Nations has helped to control and resolve some of these conflicts, but dangers to peace still abound.\n7.\tFrom the early days delegations have been agreed that to implement the Charter properly requires a great international effort to achieve disarmament, or at least the controlled reduction of armaments. Year after year in this Assembly, and in various bodies established by it, we have debated, argued, contended and endeavored to reach agreement on disarmament. All too often the thing most lacking was the sense of mutual trust and confidence without which no agreement for the reduction of arms can succeed.\n8.\tThe question of the reduction and control of nuclear armament is complex. But the essential nature of the problem and the essential responsibilities of Governments to solve it are clear. Here I wish to concentrate on some crucial aspects of nuclear disarmament.\n9.\tThe sense of urgency which was evident in the debates which led to the conclusion of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] of 1968 must be maintained. At that time there was widespread recognition of the dangers of the spread of nuclear weapons beyond the five Powers which already possessed them, and the increase in the nuclear weaponry of those Powers. We must continue to guard against any erosion of the non-proliferation Treaty and strengthen the will to make it work.\nA/PV.2357\n10.\tThe Final Declaration of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [AIC.III068, annex I] points the way ahead. All nations represented here, \nwhatever their attitudes to the Treaty itself, should appreciate the value of this Declaration for our future deliberations.\n11.\tFor many nations nuclear energy is an essential factor in their future economic development, but due attention must be given to the horrifying consequences of any diversion of fissionable materials to weapons manufacture. The growth of the civil nuclear industry throughout the world must be accompanied by internationally accepted safeguards to protect the security of all States.\n12.\tAn important step was taken in August last year when major suppliers agreed on additional safeguards to be applied to exports of certain nuclear materials and equipment. At the Review Conference there were encouraging indications that suppliers agreed on the need for further energetic action in this field. But the pace and scope of follow-up action has not so far been encouraging. Time is not on our side in this vital matter. The need for more power, the development of technology and the activities of commercial interests will not wait for Governments to act. Governments must keep ahead of them in the working out of safeguards.\n13.\tWe must also give the most careful attention to the problems presented by the conduct of nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. Austral;., would not try to deny to any State any legitimate means which would obviously assist it in its development. But, in the case of nuclear explosions, the very nature of the technology used makes us just as alarmed about the proliferation of such devices as we are about the spread' of nuclear weapons themselves. The technology can be diverted from peaceful to military purposes. The United Nations family has to find a satisfactory solution to this complex and urgent problem. Australia welcomes the establishment of the advisory group, which will hold its first meeting on 29 September under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency to consider this problem. We hope that all participants will approach their very difficult task in a spirit of determination to succeed.\n14.\tIt was obvious at the Review Conference, and in other meetings, that many non-nuclear-weapon States feel that in the implementation of the non- proliferation Treaty the burden is falling too heavily on themselves. In the consensus achieved at the Review Conference there is some hope that this justified concern of the non-nuclear-weapon States is being recognized by the nuclear Powers. We urge the nuclear Powers to make stronger efforts to meet the concerns of non-nuclear-weapon States.\n15.\tNo one should underestimate the difficulties in the way of achieving real agreements in this vital area. We cannot condone the stockpiling of weapons which ultimately are a threat to all mankind. We share the concern of countries which fee! their own security threatened by these weapons. There is no security in increasing the number or power of weapons or the number of States who make and hold them. Both are factors making for insecurity.\n16.\tAs the first step the United Nations should continue to work for the acceptance of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty as the most appropriate means of achieving nuclear arms control.\n17.\tI turn now to the question of decolonization. Under the Charter, colonial Territories have been a major responsibility of the United Nations, and the task is not yet complete.\n18.\tIt was a matter of pride for Australia that on the day on which this thirtieth session convened, the former Territory of Papua New Guinea became independent. This brought to an end the Trusteeship Agreement concluded in 1946 between the General Assembly and the Government of Australia. Now, as equal, sovereign States, Australia and Papua New Guinea are friendly neighbors, and our relations cover a wide range of mutual interests. Over the years we have known each other we have developed a considerable degree of mutual trust. The Australian Government and the Australian people express to the Government and people of Papua New Guinea their warmest fraternal greetings. We look forward to friendly and neighborly co-operation with Papua New Guinea in many fields, including here in this Assembly.\n19.\tDuring the past year we have been happy to see other former dependent Territories achieve independence and apply for membership in this Organization. We welcome the admission of the new States of Cape Verde, Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe. The pace of decolonization in the continent of Africa has increased tremendously, though very difficult problems still remain. Despite the commendable efforts by a number of interested parties, the impasse in Southern Rhodesia continues. But we still hope that there will be early progress towards the convening of a constitutional conference, with the declared objective of a negotiated transition to majority rule. The present situation is unacceptable and dangerous, and the regime in Southern Rhodesia must be made to realize the urgent necessity of negotiations on this basis.\n20.\tBoth through our participation in the work of the United Nations Council for Namibia, and also directly, we have sought to play our part in trying to bring about Namibia's full and complete independence. Regrettably, the recent South African moves in regard to the future of Namibia do not meet the requirements of the United Nations. The Australian Government chose Namibia Day\u201426 August\u2014to express to the South African Government its strong concern at the inadequacy of that Government's policies and actions. We stressed the urgent need to comply with the resolutions of the United Nations. We said the Organization must be involved in any process of consulting the people of Namibia if it is to have international credibility. We restated our firm position that Namibia should move rapidly towards independence as a united country and that the genuine leaders of the people should be parties to that process. We shall maintain our pressure on South Africa on this matter for as long as may be necessary.\n21.\tIt is now 15 years since the fifteenth session at which the General Assembly adopted two resolutions on decolonization and Non-Self-Governing Territories resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV). The former was the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The latter stated the principles which should guide Members in determining whether or not an obligation existed to transmit information under Article 73 e of the Charter. The greatest problems facing this Organization in the colonial field were and still are in the continent of Africa. However, we are glad to see that in recent years the United Nations has been devoting more attention to colonial problems outside Africa and particularly to the problems of small Territories. There still exist a considerable number of small colonies, most of them islands or groups of islands, which face very acute problems and which do not have a great deal in the way of natural resources for their solution* Here there is scope for more effort, more application of what the United Nations has learned over the past 30 years. The objective must be for the peoples of small dependent Territories to achieve not only an end to political dependence but reasonable economic conditions which are essential to the proper enjoyment of political freedom. We must be careful to take full account of the particular circumstances of each Territory and of the wishes of its people. Australia has greatly valued its close association with the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and respects the experience and dedication of its fellow members. Our close cooperation with the Special Committee is reflected in the importance we are attaching to its recommendations on the Territory of the Cocos Islands.\n22.\tI should like now to state briefly how Australia sees certain major political issues. I start, quite obviously, with the Middle East. The Australian view has long been that the existence of the State of Israel has to be accepted, and Israel has to have assurances of its security. Equally, the concerns of the Arab States for their security and territorial integrity have to be respected. We believe that, in conformity with the principle of self-determination, the Palestinian people has the right to create a State of its own, alongside Israel, if it so wishes. We believe that the legiti-mate rights of the Palestinian people are now widely recognized and accepted as one of the major keys to a peaceful settlement in the Middle East.\n23.\tAustralia welcomes the recent conclusion of a further interim disengagement agreement between Egypt and Israel. We see this as a further step towards peace, which we hope will lead to progress in other areas and to a full, peaceful and just settlement. We commend the continuing contribution made by the United Nations, especially through the Security Council and the peace-keeping forces established in the area.\n24.\tWith regard to Cyprus, we commend and thank the Secretary-General for the dedicated manner in which he has carried out his mission of good offices for the parties concerned in Cyprus. We see the role of the international community as essentially one of encouraging, where possible, the successful conclusion of inter-communal talks, of avoiding any action which would prejudice these talks, and of assisting in the alleviation of the difficulties faced by persons displaced by the violent events of last year. During the present year Australia has continued its efforts to help to ease the plight of displaced persons in Cyprus, and we have maintained our contingent of police with the United Nations force.\n25.\tThe Australian Government welcomed the end of the long conflict in Indo-China, which has caused so much suffering to the people of the countries of this region. Now that the war is over we trust that all South-East Asian countries will work to develop relations based on mutual respect and trust. Only if all the countries in the region, and the great Powers, accept that each State has the right to determine its own future free from outside interference will there be true prospects for peaceful and enduring co-operation and friendship in the area.\n26.\tIt is a matter of regret that the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam are not today seated in this General Assembly and it is our hope that, following our appeal to the Security Council, the situation will soon be changed. This Organization is now close to the achievement of universal membership; the admission of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam would be two more steps towards that goal.\n27.\tIn June of this year I paid visits to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. I was greeted warmly in both places. In both parts qjf Korea the people share a past and traditions of great value. But the vast gulf which has grown between them in the past three decades is very real. We wish to see good relations between the two States, but any realistic approach to the future of the whole of Korea has to proceed from the recognition that two separate entities exist, and that each is the lawful Government of that part of Korea in which it exercises effective control.\n28.\tIn our view, the two Governments are equally sovereign, and therefore in determining the future of the peninsula, unified or otherwise, the two Governments should act with full respect for each other's sovereign rights. Peace must be agreed, but it needs to be an enduring peace, recognizing the realities that exist in the peninsula. Peace has been preserved under an armistice agreement for over 22 years. We would welcome any progress which could be made to strengthen the prospects for reduction of tensions and for lasting peace. We would be most concerned if the prospects for progress were set back by the dismantling of machinery which has proven its usefulness, without putting something no less effective in its place.\n29.\tWhen I visited Pyongyang and Seoul I made it clear that Australia would support either or both of the Korean Governments if either or both wished to join the United Nations.\n30.\tMight I turn to the question of the peaceful settlement of disputes. In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization this year, our Secretary-General made some pertinent observations about the evolution of the role of the United Nations in its primary function of maintaining peace and security. It was in similar spirit that at the last session of the General Assembly Australia proposed under agenda item 36 on strengthening the role of the United Nations a re-examination of the possibilities inherent in the Charter for the peaceful settlement of international disputes. Our intention was to strengthen the application of the Charter and to bring again to the attention of the Members the variety of flexible procedures available to them in the Organization for the peaceful settlement of disputes, some of which deserve more attention than they have received in recent years. In accordance with the resolution adopted at the last session [3332 (XXIX)], the Assembly will be considering this year a report prepared by the Secretary-General. Australia hopes that this report will stimulate a useful debate from which Members will become more aware of the machinery available to them for the settlement of disputes.\n31.\tI should mention, too, another initiative which our delegation took at the last session of the General Assembly concerning diplomatic asylum and which was adopted as resolution 3321 (XXIX). A useful debate was held in the Sixth Committee and the debate will be resumed at this present session. It is clear from last year's debate that it will be a slow business to reach agreement on this subject, but the ultimate objective is a very important one, one we are fighting for, and we should like to see all States participating in this work.\n32.\tI have been pleased to note the remarks that have been directed towards the question of the law of the sea, because this is certainly a vital problem with which this Organization is dealing. The problem of the law of the sea affects not only immense political and strategic issues but also the economic future of all nations, whether coastal or land-locked. The new rules of international law now under discussion embrace not only the essential norms of sovereignty and the traditional freedom of navigation, but also questions of the exploitation of natural resources in an area which covers two thirds of the earth's surface. The new law must make a reality of the concept of the common heritage of mankind.\n33.\tThe third session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held at Geneva this spring, produced for the first time a single negotiating text, thanks to the initiative of the President of the Conference and the able work of the Chairmen of the three Committees. This text will be supplemented by a negotiating text, submitted by the President, on settlement of disputes. These texts have been studied by the Australian Government and discussion with other Governments has already begun. It is our hope that at the next session, in New York in March 1976, the Conference will agree on a negotiated text which can be accepted by Governments and which can become the convention of Caracas. In any event, we must press the negotiation to the earliest possible successful conclusion. As the Secretary-General reminded us recently, a modern law of the sea for peace and co-operatjon on the sea cannot be achieved by bilateral or regional agreements. A universal convention is essential.\n34.\tOn the question of human rights, this Organization, over the past 30 years, has endeavored to define, to broaden and to express in legally binding instruments the principle of human rights as contained in the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Unfortunately the United Nations has also had to express deep concern about many violations of human rights. We must press on with this work, however difficult, because the alternative is to fail to honor the principles affirmed in the Charter, by which we are all bound.\n35.\tThe Australian Government attaches great importance to International Women's Year as a symbol of the need for change and improvement and as a great new departure in itself. The scope of activities in International Women's Year is very wide because it aims at the improvement of the status and role of women in the development process and in all aspects of life. At issue are the legitimate needs and demands of half the population of the world. Deep-rooted discriminatory practices and discriminatory social attitudes have placed women in a position of artificial inferiority. Women everywhere in the world must achieve freedom and equality.\n36.\tI could sum up all the points I have tried to make very simply. The Charter has shown that with all its imperfections it is basically a sound instrument which provides the statements of principle and the institutional framework which al! countries need if we are to live in peace and mutual respect. But the task of applying principles of the Charter and living up to them requires great and continuous effort. Unless that effort is made, this Organization cannot succeed, and a light will go out of the world. It is the firm conviction of my Government that this Organization must succeed and to that end we reaffirm the pledge which we made in San Francisco in 1945. We must not fail the peoples whom we represent and in whose name our Charter was written.\n"

        "file_text": "115.\t It is my pleasant duty to bring the personal felicitations and greetings of my President, Mr. Siaka Stevens, to the United Nations, the leaders and representatives of all delegations, and the Secretary-General.\n116.\tSir, it is no doubt a distinct honor, not only to you but also to your country, that you should be presiding over this thirtieth session of the General Assembly. I wish, on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, to congratulate you most heartily on your election as President of the Assembly. I am confident that you will execute your duties with great distinction. Permit me also to congratulate all the members of the Bureau who have been elected to i assist you in the execution of your onerous duties.\n117.\tI wish to pay a special tribute to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Foreign Minister of Algeria, who, as President of the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session of this Assembly, guided our deliberations with distinction and dignity, to a successful conclusion.\n118.\tOn behalf of the Government and people of Sierra Leone, I wish also to avail myself of this opportunity to welcome as new Members of this Organization the States of Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe and Cape Verde. My delegation hopes that this Organization will profit from the experience gained during their struggle for independence.\n119.\tWe also congratulate the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia on its recent victory, and reaffirm our recognition and support of that Government.\n120.\tWe congratulate the people of the Comoros on their achievement of independence. We reaffirm our support for their territorial integrity and deplore most vehemently any outside interference in their internal affairs.\n121.\tWe also congratulate the people of Papua New Guinea, who became fully independent on 16 September. We are happy to note that their application for membership in this world body has been approved by the Security Council. We welcome them into the United Nations as fellow members of the Commonwealth. We look forward to co-operating fully with them as they take their place in this world body.\n122.\tMy delegation is happy to note the achievement of a modus vivendi between the rival parties in the Seychelles and also the agreement reached with the administering Power for the attainment of independence by the Seychelles not later than 30 June 1976. We look forward to similar progress towards self- determination in Djibouti and Spanish Sahara.\n123.\tIt is a matter of regret that even 30 years after the founding of the United Nations, my delegation finds itself compelled once again to condemn the stubborn and callous resistance of those regimes which continue to disregard the provisions of resolution 1514 (XV) and subsequent resolutions concerning the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.\n124.\tThis thirtieth session of the General Assembly is meeting in an atmosphere charged with a greater degree of optimism than hitherto. With such an atmosphere already evident, we anticipate significant developments in the implementation of that historic resolution.\n125.\tMy delegation notes with satisfaction, and some measure of relief, the concerted efforts which have been made courageously in recent years by European States, with the active support of the United States, to create a climate of peace and, it is hoped, of stability in continental Europe and its maritime enclaves that traditionally war-torn zone of the world.\n126.\tIt is for this reason that my Government has continued to support every genuine effort from any quarter to bring about a state of accommodation, if not of peace, in the relations between the competing ideologies of our time. Overtures of friendship, understanding and the manifest desire on the part of the developed and industrialized States to win the sympathy and understanding of us, the small, weak and poor nations of the world, do not go unnoticed. We may not lend our sympathy, support and co-operation to all such overtures. We cannot promise uncritical acceptance of offers of aid and friendship when these appear to us to be rooted in outmoded and anachronistic patterns of a bygone era. We shall, however, as Members of this world body, give our support, as we have always done, to the principles of the Charter. We shall continue to make ourselves accessible for consultations and co-operation with men and nations of goodwill everywhere, so long as the cause they seek to promote is that of international peace and security and the improvement of the Jiving standards of the world's poor and starving peoples.\n127.\tAs a member of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples my delegation had the pleasure of participating in the Committee's historic meetings at Lisbon from 11 to 19 June this year. The Sierra Leone delegation at that meeting applauded the drastic change in Portuguese colonial policy and expressed the hope that the change in policy would affect not merely the Territories in Africa but also other Portuguese enclaves wherever they may exist. We reiterate our expression of hope that a new chapter of mutually beneficial relations has now been opened between Portugal and its erstwhile colonies as well as between Portugal and the rest of truly independent Africa.\n128.\tWe are indeed saddened by the fact that our fellow Africans in the liberation movements in Angola continue to frustrate our aspirations and the speedy achievement of their country's independence by meaningless and fruitless struggles among themselves which only promote the evil intentions of the common enemy. We therefore appeal to our brothers of that strife-torn country to grapple with the realities of their situation at this crucial juncture and to bury their differences so as to attain independence as a unified nation.\n129.\tSince my delegation delivered its statement at this rostrum last year the liberation movements of Zimbabwe have taken the very mature and welcome decision to consolidate their struggle for self-determination and majority rule under the banner of the African National Council. At this juncture, my delegation wishes to acknowledge with satisfaction the recent positive moves made by the Government of the United Kingdom in this matter. Nevertheless, we urge that even greater efforts be made with a view to granting the just claim of the people of Zimbabwe to self-determination and independence. By the same token, we cannot conceal our feelings of uneasiness and regret at some of the indiscretions manifested in recent weeks within the leadership of the African National Council. We call upon our brothers to reassess their current stance and work together to expedite the end of the long struggle of the people of Zimbabwe for their independence.\n130.\tMy delegation renews its pledge to support without reservation the Lusaka Manifesto of 1970, the Mogadiscio Declaration of 1974 and the more recent Dar es Salaam Declaration on Southern Africa of 1975 until Zimbabwe and the rest of southern Africa have achieved their right to self-determination.\n131.\tMy delegation notes with deep concern that the political situation in Namibia has not changed. Despite several resolutions of both the General Assembly and the Security Council, as well as the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice asserting the illegality of the presence of South Africa in Namibia, the South African regime has persisted in its occupation of that Territory.\n132.\tSouth Africa's disregard of world opinion on this issue is accounted for by the fact that it illegally receives huge economic benefits from that Territory. Is this a situation which should be tolerated in this day and age?\n133.\tThe recent exercise of a triple veto against the draft resolution in Security Council document S/11713 of 6 June 1975,4 which advocated mandatory sanctions against South Africa, has left my delegation with feelings of discomfort as to the sincere intentions of those three great Western nations which have long held themselves out to be the defenders and custodians of the Western liberal tradition, with its emphasis on justice and human dignity.\n134.\tMy Government supports the demand that South Africa should without further delay adopt appropriate measures to enable the United Nations Council for Namibia to establish itself in that Territory so as to preside over the peaceful and orderly transfer of the functions of Government to SWAPO, the only representative body of the Namibian people which my Government recognizes.\n135.\tLast year, for the first time, the United Nations took an unprecedented decision to reject the credentials of the South African delegation and exclude it from further participation in the twenty-ninth session on account of South Africa's inhuman apartheid policies. In spite of this move, and also the fact that this world body and other international organizations have consistently condemned apartheid as an anachronism in the twentieth century, the Vorster racist regime has persisted in its flagrant disregard of the voice of sanity and has done everything possible to intensify its policy aimed at dehumanizing the majority population, whose only sin is that they happen to have been born black.\n136.\tThe days of colonialism, exploitation, racial discrimination and apartheid are numbered. The writing, even if faint in some areas, can be seen on the wall. The indomitable will of the oppressed people of southern Africa to breathe the air of freedom will, in the end, overcome the odious forces of apartheid, however long and arduous the battle may be. The Vorster regime would do well to take a leaf from the book of the recent history of the former Portuguese Fascist regime in Africa. It must abandon its present suicidal collision course, and embark on a dialog with the black and colored peoples within its borders. So long as the South African Government refuses to enter into dialog with the black and colored peoples within its own borders, my Government totally rejects any dialog between South Africa and African States,\n137.\tI am indeed very happy that the Viet Nam issue has at last been resolved and, now that political independence has been won, my delegation calls on all progressive nations to come to the aid of the Vietnamese people in their search for economic emancipation, and for the assumption of their rightful place as full-fledged members within the comity of nations.\n138.\tWith regard to the Korean problem, my Government has stated its position in clear and unequivocal terms in various international forums. The once united country of Korea has remained two separate entities for more than 25 years. The result of this is that it has become extremely difficult to work out a formula for their reunification. It is our view that only the Koreans themselves are qualified to work out a program of reunification for their country.\n139.\tFollowing this line of thought, we would advocate that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from the Korean peninsula and the dialog between North and South, which was suspended, should be renewed to facilitate the reunification of that territory. It is to be hoped that the Koreans would achieve the reunification of their territory by exchanges of visits, trade links, transport and communication agreements and the signing of a peace agreement which would eventually replace the armistice agreement.\n140.\tThe General Assembly adopted resolution 3212 (XXIX), which was endorsed in the Security Council by resolution 365 (1974), spelling out the terms and conditions for a peaceful solution to the question of Cyprus, Since then, my Government has followed with keen interest the developments on that island. We wish at this stage to commend very sincerely the efforts of the Secretary-General and all those concerned in attempting to work out a peaceful solution to this problem. We would continue to advocate respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Cyprus. My Government reiterates its avowed policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. My Government is convinced that the Turkish and Greek communities in Cyprus, with the active co-operation of the guarantor Powers, should be able to work out a solution acceptable to the entire people of Cyprus.\n141.\tMy delegation notes with satisfaction that a peaceful solution to some of the outstanding problems in the Middle East now appears to be in sight. I also wish to place on record my Government's appreciation of the strenuous efforts which have been made to bring about the Sinai Agreement. In particular, the combined efforts and initiatives of the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger, and the Secretary-General and his able staff are worthy of commendation. However, my Government is deeply concerned about the remaining issues, without the solution of which there can be no lasting peace in the Middle East. My delegation therefore calls upon Israel to adhere to Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\n142.\tTwenty-five years have passed since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but the observance of its articles has been rather disappointing. It is not unusual to hear of flagrant violations of those articles, particularly in southern Africa. The situation there has become a threat to international peace and security. Many resolutions have been adopted in connexion with the persistent violations of the Declaration, but little has been done to secure their implementation. It is the responsibility of this Organization to ensure that the atrocities committed in violation of human rights, especially in South Africa, are brought to an end.\n143.\tThe General Assembly adopted resolution 3010 (XXVII) designating 1975 as International Women's Year. In adopting that resolution, the international community solemnly undertook to devote the year 1975 to intensified action which would, among other things, promote equality between men and women, and ensure the full integration of women in the total development effort, especially by emphasizing their responsibility and importance in economic, social and cultural development.\n144.\tIt is with great pride that I state here that it is not only now that Sierra Leone is recognizing the important role of women. Throughout our history, women have been accorded sufficient opportunities to play active roles in public and private life. Sierra Leone women have been cabinet ministers and have been appointed ambassadors to foreign States. Our women have risen to the highest ranks in the civil service, the judiciary and the professions. They have also been traditional rulers for over a century, receiving the same high respect from their subjects as their male counterparts. The concept of equality between men and women, therefore, is not new to us in Sierra Leone. In fact, Sierra Leone granted women equal pay for equal work long before some advanced countries accepted this principle. It is the hope of my delegation, therefore, that this solemn undertaking to promote the cause of women will not terminate wit the year 1975.\n145.\tIn our attempt to effect a change in the international economic situation, the developing countries have attended several meetings between the sixth special session and the present session. All these meetings were designed to devise modalities the would ensure the equitable redistribution of the economic resources of the world and plan measure that would ensure peace, stability and the genera material improvement of the lot of mankind. My delegation realizes that there is a need to consider the diversity of interests. At the same time we should also like to stress that the discussions we have had so fa have revealed that the world economy cannot be left to function under the old system. Although we are no oblivious of some of the difficulties facing the developed countries, these difficulties should not be magnified or used as excuses to maintain the old order.\n146.\tThe recommendations and conclusions of the seventh special session give some satisfaction to my delegation, although there are some Grey areas which will have to be further examined. It is also clear that some of those recommendations provide only temporary solutions. Consequently, we should all be prepared to re-examine these issues with a view to providing for a smooth adaptation to changing circumstances. If in the spirit of co-operation we all keep open minds, we shall surely move forward.\n147.\tMy delegation has co-operated fully in the negotiations to date. We pledge our continued cooperation in all future negotiations aimed at bringing about conditions of economic stability and a climate of peace throughout the world.\n148.\tThe third session of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea ended on 10 May this year, no more near agreement on a comprehensive treaty than the second session. If the second session in the summer of 1974 in Caracas was notable for the reopening of the debates that had gone on in the defunct Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the SeaBed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, the notable achievement of the third session at Geneva was the distribution of informal negotiating texts covering all subjects before the Conference. These do not represent agreed articles. As the President of the Conference himself observed:\n\\\"It should therefore be quite clear that the single negotiating text will serve as a procedural device and only provide a basis for negotiation. It must not in any way be regarded as affecting either the status of proposals already made by delegations or the right of delegations to submit amendments or new proposals\\\".\nMy Government will study these texts very carefully in the light of the interests of the international community generally and in our interest in particular.\n149.\tFrom this rostrum and in the appropriate committees of this Organization, my delegation has made it quite clear, on several occasions, that active consideration should now be given to a review of the Charter of this Organization. Since the Charter is a legal instrument, it cannot be said that, literally taken, it is a perfect document. The fact is that, since legal norms are usually formulated in words liable to more than one interpretation, every legal instrument has its own life more or less independent of the intentions and expectations of its formulators. That the law is open to more than one interpretation is certainly detrimental to legal security; but it has the advantage of adaptability to changing circumstances without the requirement of formal alteration.\n150.\tThe United Nations, established by the Charter at the San Francisco Conference 30 years ago, is by its very nature a political phenomenon. This being so, a mere juristic interpretation of the Charter cannot do it justice. But just as it would be foolish to underestimate the political aspect, it would be a serious mistake to ignore the importance of the task of improving it to the extent possible.\n151.\tMy delegation therefore welcomes the establishment of the 42-member Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter of the United Nations, which has been mandated to discuss the observations received from Governments on the review of the Charter and to consider other specific proposals that Governments might make with a view to enhancing the ability of the United Nations to achieve its purpose.\n152.\tLet us for a moment reflect on the achievements of the United Nations over the generation of its existence. This Organization and its specialized agencies have transformed traditional inter-State relations, which had hitherto been characterized by confrontation, to those of consultation and co-operation among nations irrespective of their political, economic or social systems. Indeed, the United Nations has brought a new concept to international relations by its in-creasing concern for the welfare of the individual within the international community.\n153.\tMy delegation represents one of the smallest democracies of the world. Sierra Leone was admitted to membership in this world body barely 14 years ago as the one hundredth Member. The records will show not only that we have been concerned with the evils of colonialism, exploitation, racism, poverty and inequality, which have long plagued peoples and nations in the third world, but that we have been equally vocal and articulate in expressing our concern over larger issues such as war and peace, freedom and humanism, space exploration and the exploitation of outer-space resources whatever these may be for the good of mankind. We do not intend to change our course, certainly not our policy of non-alignment.\n154.\tWe are united in our determination and dedication to work resolutely with all States Members of this Organization engaged in the search for a new world order based on equity, dignity and justice. We shall continue to strive towards the goal of a world in which, to borrow the language of the late Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore:\n\\\"The mind of man is without fear\nAnd knowledge is free\nWhere men are no longer divided\nBy narrow domestic walls.\\\"\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It is with some emotion that I find myself today once again in this venerable Hall where in the 1950s and 1960s I had so often the honor of being the spokesman of my country, Kampuchea (Cambodia), and of participating in the work, deliberations and decisions of our Organization.\n98.\tIn 1970 and this went on until 1974 United States imperialism succeeded in having its own creature, the so-called \\\"Khmer Republic\\\", an anti- national, anti-popular, extremely corrupt regime which was the very denial of our national independence and dignity, improperly occupy the seat of independent, peaceful, neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea.\n99.\tOf course, the State of Kampuchea (Cambodia), of which I am the head and which has been a State Member of the United Nations since 1955, cannot recognize the validity of the speeches, statements, votes, commitments and other actions of the so- called \\\"Khmer Republic\\\" which illegally occupied the seat of Kampuchea (Cambodia) in the United Nations and affiliated or related organizations between 18 March 1970 and 17 April 1975.\n100.\tPermit me to convey, on behalf of the people and the Government of Kampuchea and on my own behalf, our deepest gratitude to those Members of our Organization which throughout the five years of an atrocious war imposed by United States imperialism on Kampuchea so nobly became the fervent champions of our just cause within this great Assembly.\n101.\tWe should also like to express our warmest gratitude to other countries and peoples which are not yet Members of our Organization but which none the less gave our national liberation struggle unreserved support and extremely valuable militant solidarity.\n102.\tWe should also like to extend our sincere thanks to those personalities, students and other citizens, male and female, of the United States, lovers of justice and peace, who, at the most tragic period of our history did everything they could to put an end to the folly of United States imperialism in Kampuchea.\n103.\tIt is only right to proclaim that all these countries, peoples and individuals gave us valuable assistance in overcoming adversity, thus bringing about the triumph of the cause of justice, freedom and peace, and did everything they could to curtail the unspeakable sufferings of our martyred nation. Kampuchea is duty bound to pay them the warmest tribute.\n104.\tAs you are well aware, the Cambodian people has always been devoted to peace and national neutrality, an attitude naturally very unlikely to give us any aggressive ideas with regard to other nations.\n105.\tBut our people possess an old tradition of patriotic struggle, a struggle which they have always waged with indomitable heroism against those who have committed aggression against or who have wished to colonize their native land.\n106.\tAfter having fought against colonialism for 90 years and recovered its national independence 22 years ago, the people of Kampuchea quickly saw that that independence was threatened by United States imperialism, which was even so arrogant as to deny the countries of South-East Asia the right to be neutralist, because, according to that imperialist view, those who did not agree to join the \\\"free world\\\" were ipso facto against it!\n107.\tThus, between 1955 and 1969, our country had to face growing difficulties of all kinds caused by American imperialism.\n108.\tWhen I speak of \\\"difficulties\\\", I am of course using a euphemism. But up to 18 March 1970, the day of the sinister pro-imperialist putsch of the Lon Nol group in PhnomPenh, the Cambodian people were able by their vigilance to foil all the plots and wreck all the anti-Kampuchean designs of United States imperialism, its accomplices and lackeys.\n109.\tImmediately after the Lon Nol putsch which overthrew the independence, peace, neutrality and non-alignment of Kampuchea, the Cambodian people, all patriotic Cambodian men and women, both in and outside the country, rose as one, and on 23 March 1970 vowed to rally to a United National Front and to struggle by every means in their power, and particularly by armed force, against neo-colonialist imperialism, the patron of those who carried out the Phnom Penh putsch, and to vanquish it in order to restore their lost freedom, sovereignty and national dignity.\n110.\tLet us make this very clear: we were dealing with United States imperialism rather than with the gang of the traitor Lon Nol, which, without the massive intervention by every means of its master, would not have been able to survive more than a few weeks in the face of the irresistible wave of the assaults of the patriots.\n111.\tThe struggle, therefore, was that of a small, poor and under-populated country facing a gigantic aggressor, a super-Power armed to the teeth, which did not hesitate to use the most sophisticated and murderous weapons, and one so opulent that it could spend every year almost $2,000 million in order to crush the small nation of Kampuchea, a super-Power considered invincible.\n112.\tIn the noble judgement of many African, Arab and Asian statesmen who have spoken before me from this rostrum, the history of the struggle of the people of Kampuchea and their victory has now become a part of the heritage of the peoples of the third world.\n113.\tIn attacking the small, weak and poor country of Kampuchea, United States imperialism has several aims in view. It wished to add a new jewel to its imperial crown, to acquire in South-East Asia a new military base for aggression, and to issue a serious warning to other small countries in the world that might dare to repulse the dangerous advances of the imperialists and other neo-colonialists,\n114.\tThe outcome of the seemingly completely unequal struggle between the victim of aggression, Kampuchea, and the aggressor, imperialism, was to assume the greatest importance.\n115.\tThe question was whether the justice of its cause and its patriotic heroism were sufficient to enable a small \\\"underdeveloped\\\" people to overcome an invader of such incredible power.\n116.\tIt is to the honor of the people of Kampuchea that they succeeded in driving out United States imperialism after five years of the most terrible suffering, the heaviest sacrifices and a struggle waged with really sublime heroism.\n117.\tIn their struggle our people and its national liberation army relied above all on themselves, on their own resources, on their own sacrifices, and were invariably guided by this golden rule: In all circumstances to remain independent, master of what was to be done in the country and master of their own destiny.\n118.\tOur people affectionately dedicate the success of our national resistance to all the people throughout the world who are fighting for freedom, justice and peace.\n119.\tImmediately after the final liberation of our country, our people and our nation, as a single man, threw themselves with faith and enthusiasm into a new and no less important battle, the struggle for true democracy and against economic underdevelopment.\n120.\tToday we can assert that a genuinely popular democracy and a new society have been born in Kampuchea a society without the exploitation of man by man, without differences of fortune and without other social ills.\n121.\tWith regard to the reconstruction of our country, our whole people and our whole nation, with the People's Army of National Liberation in the vanguard, have set to work since peace returned, to rebuild from its ruins our country, which United States imperialism and its lackeys had striven, by bombing, by machine-gunning, by napalm and other chemical weapons, to reduce to the level of the Middle Ages.\nSide by side with national reconstruction, our people have devoted themselves to economic development on the basis of agriculture, which is our primary resource.\n122.\tToday that is, after five months of very hard work the main means of communications, the ports and airports, the railways, are in use once again.\n123.\tOn the subject of agriculture, to which we have devoted our greatest efforts, appreciable results have already been obtained. Those results are the consequence of an improvement in agricultural methods and sizable irrigation work work already begun more than three or four years ago in the zones that were liberated at that time, and that has been systematically continued in the newly liberated zones. A large number of irrigation systems dikes, dams, water reservoirs, canals, raising and extension of banks  have been put in place by our people and its army, under the banner of the United National Front. These irrigation systems have obviously changed the traditional landscape of the Cambodian countryside for the better. And our great satisfaction stems from the fact that we now have enough cereal crops to feed adequately the seven and one half million Cambodians who now make up the population of Kampuchea, and to do so without needing to ask for aid from outside. By the end of 1976 Kampuchea will no doubt once again be an exporter of cereals.\n124.\tWith regard to industry, our United Front and our Government have endeavored above all to repair the factories damaged by the war and to put into operation once again industries having a close connexion with agriculture textiles, rubber, and so forth and those which should produce what our country and our people most urgently need: cement, paper, oil, consumer goods. Furthermore, our Government is drafting a plan for the development and modernization of the national industry, a plan that will be based on agriculture and will provide for equipment with modern machinery, to be bought with the earnings from our agricultural exports.\n125.\tIndeed, in this struggle against underdevelopment, our people and our country are following and will continue to follow the same golden rule applied before in the armed struggle for national liberation, namely: Remain independent and rely on yourselves.\n126.\tBy following such a policy in respect of the economy and national construction, Kampuchea believes it is serving with honor, faithfulness and effectiveness not only its own national interests but also the ideals of the third world, which is struggling bravely and with determination for its economic independence and which is well aware that its economic \\\"take-off' will be brought about not through foreign assistance but on the basis of self-reliance.\n127.\tThe foreign policy of independent Kampuchea has always been and will always be a policy of peace and friendship. Kampuchea reaffirms its unswerving devotion to the cause of universal peace and expresses its sincere desire to establish ties of friendship with all the peoples, all the countries, all the States, all the Governments that love peace, justice and freedom and that respect and will continue to respect Kampuchea's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, neutrality and non-alignment.\n128.\tI have just spoken of our neutrality and our non-alignment. That means that Kampuchea does not belong and will not belong to any Power bloc, has not established and will not establish any military or other alliance with other countries, has not joined and will not join any organization or group of States or nations  with the exception, of course, of the United Nations and the non-aligned group. That also means that Kampuchea does not permit and will not permit any country to establish bases or posts, military or otherwise, on its territory or in its territorial waters.\n129.\tKampuchea declared itself officially neutral as long ago as 1954, during the Geneva Conference on the Problem of Restoring Peace in Indo-China, and in 1955 it played a part in the birth of the non-aligned movement.\n130.\tToday Kampuchea, having escaped from the grip of imperialism, is more than ever devoted to non- alignment. Our choice of non-alignment is a constant of our national strategy and our foreign policy, and not a temporary option. For us, non-alignment is indeed a sine qua non guarantee of our independence and our peace, and also our best possible contribution to the stability of the international situation and to world peace.\n131.\tKampuchea consequently reaffirms its unswerving will to remain within the great family of.non- aligned countries and to do everything in its power to contribute to the success of the noble undertakings of that great family, which throughout the years  and particularly this year has not ceased to grow and become stronger.\n132.\tHaving suffered under the yoke of colonialism, particularly that of imperialism, and well aware of the difficulties involved in any national liberation struggle, Kampuchea is profoundly gratified at the final victory that, after a long, bitter and arduous struggle, the heroic peoples of Viet Nam, Laos, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and the Comoros have won against imperialism and colonialism. Kampuchea regards that great victory as its own and extends its warmest congratulations to those fraternal peoples. We welcome with joy the entry into the United Nations of Cape Verde, Mozambique, and Sao Tome and Principe and extend our sincere compliments to their representatives.\n133.\tKampuchea most cordially congratulates also the Arab peoples, and particularly the heroic Palestinian people, on the success they have achieved in their just struggle against the expansionist Israelis.\n134.\tKampuchea also whole-heartedly congratulates the peoples of southern Africa Zimbabwe, Namibia, Azania on the success of their just struggle against the racists and the latter's intolerable oppression or racial discrimination.\n135.\tKampuchea congratulates with equal warmth the other anti-imperialist peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America on the success of their struggle to safeguard their national independence, their sovereignty, their freedoms and the natural resources of their respective countries.\n136.\tKampuchea believes that world peace will remain precarious as long as crying injustice continues to be the lot of certain peoples and countries.\n137.\tThe Palestinian people and Palestine are in the forefront of these victim peoples and countries. The most recent resolutions of the United Nations on the Palestinian problem are good, but the Zionist Israelis and the United States imperialists are ceaselessly maneuvering to prevent faithful and total application of these resolutions.\n138.\tToday, even more than yesterday, United States imperialism is lavishing on Israel the most formidable weapons of war and granting the Israel Government new aid amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, thus openly encouraging it to block all possibilities of the indispensable solution of the Palestinian problem.\n139.\tKampuchea believes that the Palestinian people, a people possessed of admirable virtues but a people unfortunately victim of one of the greatest injustices of contemporary history, should have restored to it all its sacred and inalienable rights, including its territorial rights.\n140.\tTo permit such rights to be endlessly trampled underfoot is tantamount to saying to the other small peoples, particularly those of the third world, that there is no longer anything to protect them against the law that says that might is right and against the forces of injustice.\n141.\tThe Palestinian problem is thus of concern to all peoples of the world, and the peoples of the third world in particular. That is why Kampuchea believes that it is duty-bound to express its total and unswerving solidarity with the Palestinian people in their just struggle. We venture to express the hope that Israel not be considered as a State Member of the United Nations so long as it is unwilling to abide in every respect with United Nations resolutions concerning the rights of the Palestinian people and also the total, unconditional and immediate evacuation of the illegally occupied Arab territories.\n142.\tJust as we will always stand beside the Palestinian people, so Kampuchea will always support wholeheartedly the just struggle of the other Arab countries and peoples, in particular the struggle for the liberation of the Arab territories still occupied by Israeli Zionist forces.\n143.\tKampuchea unreservedly supports the just struggle of the great Chinese people for the return of Taiwan to the motherland, the People's Republic of China.\n144.\tKampuchea unreservedly supports the struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania against oppression and other kinds of injustice practiced by the racists in South Africa, Rhodesia and Namibia.\n145.\tKampuchea unreservedly supports the struggle and efforts of the peoples and Governments concerned with a view to accelerating the decolonization of the so-called Spanish western Sahara and of so-called French Somalia.\n146.\tKampuchea unreservedly supports the struggle of the Cuban people for the liberation of the Guantanamo base.\n347. Kampuchea unreservedly supports the struggle of the Panamanian people and the Puerto Rican people for the dismantling of foreign military bases improperly established in their countries so that they may enjoy complete national sovereignty.\n148.\tKampuchea unreservedly supports the Latin American States which have decided to establish the limits of their territorial waters at 200 nautical miles. We unreservedly support the struggle of the peoples of Latin America for the safeguarding of their lawful rights over their national resources.\n149.\tKampuchea unreservedly supports the struggle of the countries of the third world for equality and justice in economic relations with the developed and highly industrialized countries.\n150.\tPermit me now to turn to the Korean problem, a problem of great importance.\n151.\tFor more than 20 years now, United States imperialism has continued to keep the southern part of Korea and its unfortunate population under the intolerable yoke of its neocolonialism, its military occupation and the puppet regime of Chung Hee Park, an anti-popular, anti-national and, above all, extremely cruel and bloody regime.\n152.\tThe military occupation of South Korea is indeed twofold, because it is being carried out under the label of the United Nations and also under the cover of a treaty of military assistance or alliance between the Government in Washington and that in Seoul.\n153.\tAlong with the great majority of other States Members of our Organization, Kampuchea fervently hopes that the United Nations will without delay cease lending its honorable name to imperialism in its military and neo-colonialist occupation of South Korea.\n154.\tAs to the bilateral military assistance treaty or alliance between Washington and Seoul, Kampuchea believes that it is not worthy of respect because the two signatories to that treaty are not equal; the second does not represent an independent and sovereign State. Indeed, the regime of Mr. Chung Hee Park is not really an ally of the United States of America but merely a puppet of imperialism, That regime has no roots in the Korean people. Like the former regime of Lon Nol in Phnom-Penh and that of Nguyen Van Thieu in Saigon, the regime of Chung Hee Park could only survive with the support and military protection of the United States.\n155.\tKampuchea believes that our Organization, if it is to remain faithful to the spirit of its Charter, is duty-bound to demand that all foreign troops evacuate South Korea totally and without delay so that the population of South Korea may recover its liberty, control of its own destiny and its right to maintain fraternal relations with North Korea, freely exploring with it ways and means of permitting the two parts of Korea to achieve, without confrontation, the indispensable national reunification, peaceful reunification, without any foreign involvement in the process thereof.\n156.\tThe situation in the Far East remains explosive, because of the military and even nuclear threat which continues to hang over that important part of the world because of United States imperialism, the principal bases of which are in South Korea and some other countries of the region.\n157.\tIn South Korea, intensive war preparations have been noted and United States units have been maneuvering and deploying so-called \\\"tactical\\\" nuclear weapons.\n158.\tIn order the better to conceal its aggressive designs, imperialism is spreading throughout the world the rumor that the People's Democratic Republic of Korea is making intensive preparations for \\\"a war of aggression and conquest\\\" against South Korea.\n159.\tHaving a profound knowledge of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, which I visit several times a year and in which I have traveled widely, I can assert that that country is very far from harboring any aggressive designs against anybody or anything.\n160.\tOf course, its military organization is remarkable and powerful, but the essential character of that organization is obviously purely defensive.\n161.\tIf the People's Democratic Republic of Korea were belligerent, it would be difficult to explain why its people and its Government are so feverishly building every day so many schools, nurseries, civilian houses, public gardens, cultural centers, irrigation dams and new cities, the planning of which is exemplary.\n162.\tFurthermore, is it a crime, is it belligerence, to wish fervently for the reunification of one's country?\n163.\tMarshal Kim II Sung, on behalf of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea of which he is Head of State, has proposed a plan known as the \\\"Five-Point Orientation Plan\\\", to prepare, reasonably and in the context of national harmony between \\\"North\\\" and \\\"South\\\", the ground for bringing about the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.\n164.\tKampuchea believes that our Organization should warmly support this five-point plan of President Kim II Sung and thus help the Korean people to do away with the anachronistic division of its unjustly dismembered country.\n165.\tAs for the new plan put forward by the United States of America, which proposes a conference of the parties concerned in Korea to explore ways and means of preserving the armistice after the dissolution of the United Nations Command, Kampuchea believes that that plan contradicts the principle of respect for the sovereignty of the Korean people, which must be able fully to exercise its right to self-determination without any foreign interference. Kampuchea cannot, therefore, support such a plan. Indeed, it whole-heartedly supports the reasonable and just proposal of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea to replace the armistice agreement with a peace treaty capable of reducing tension.\n166.\tI should like, before concluding this speech, to say how much Kampuchea deplores the unjust and inadmissible blocking by the United States of America of the well-deserved admission of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam to full membership in the United Nations.\n167.\tThis General Assembly with only 7 abstentions warmly supported the application for admission of those two glorious Republics; and quite recently the Security Council supported that application with the unanimous vote of its members, except the United States of America.\n168.\tKampuchea believes that the United States' veto against the admission of Viet Nam to the United Nations is a petty tactic unworthy of the tradition of equity and fair play of the great American people.\n169.\tAs for linking the question of the admission of the \\\"Government\\\" of Seoul to membership in the United Nations with that of the admission of Viet Nam, this is not only absurd but also, what is more, a grave abuse of and a dangerous departure from the concept of the right of the use of the veto by permanent members of the Security Council, an abuse and a departure which our General Assembly must oppose.\n170.\tIn that spirit, Kampuchea calls upon the General Assembly to continue to act vigorously to remove the only obstacle which so incongruously stands in the way of the admission of Viet Nam to membership in the United Nations.\n171.\tHaving reached the conclusion of my speech I should like to convey to you, Mr. President, to the Secretary-General and to the delegates present the warm compliments and friendly greetings of the people of Kampuchea and its Government and to extend my sincere wishes for success in the performance of your noble tasks in the important work of this thirtieth session of our General Assembly.\n172.\tI should like also to reaffirm that Kampuchea will always remain faithful to the spirit and the letter of the United Nations Charter and will spare no effort to assist our Organization in the attainment of its objectives, in keeping with its ideals of justice, peace, liberty and progress.\n173.\tI should like also to stress that my country respects, and will always scrupulously respect, the national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and political and social system of neighboring countries and peoples, and of other countries and peoples in the world.\n174.\tKampuchea does not intervene and will never intervene in the internal affairs of other countries. But Kampuchea does reserve its right to defend itself by force of arms if it is the victim of attack or aggression.\n175.\tOf course, we hope that such a situation will never arise, because our profound hope is to live in peace and friendship with all countries, near or far, and to co-operate with them in various fields particularly in the economic field on a footing of complete equality and on the basis of the principles of mutual respect and reciprocal advantage. In particular, Kampuchea attaches the greatest importance to the development of its friendship and multiform co-operation with neighboring countries, with non-aligned countries and with the countries which, since 19701971, have given their firm and noble support to its just cause and its struggle for national liberation.\n176.\tIn conclusion, I would request Mr. Gaston Thorn to accept the warmest congratulations of Kampuchea on his election to the presidency of our General Assembly, and I would request all delegations of States Members of our Organization present here to be so kind as to convey my warmest wishes for happiness and prosperity to their respective peoples and also my cordial greetings to their illustrious heads of State and Government, and to accept themselves my best wishes for good health and success, with my sincere thanks for their kind attention.\n177.\tThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): On behalf of the General Assembly I should like to thank His Royal Highness, the head of State of Kampuchea, for the important statement he has just made.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t Mr. President, let me join other representatives who have spoken before me in congratulating you warmly on your election to this high and onerous office. In doing so, may I also bring to you and this Assembly warm greetings from my President, Mr. Jomo Kenyatta, the Government and the people of Kenya. Your election is proof of the confidence placed in you personally and in your country by the General Assembly. This session is bound to be remembered in history as a very important one for some of the reasons I shall touch on later. May I therefore wish you all the best in leading it to a successful conclusion. On behalf of my delegation, I pledge our support in your endeavors.\n2.\tI should also like, Sir, to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who, with singular distinction, led the General Assembly successfully through the twenty-ninth session and the seventh special session. We owe him a debt of gratitude for his untiring efforts and the wisdom he displayed at all times, even when there were heavy odds against him.\n3.\tIt is fitting also for me to pay tribute to the untiring Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and the entire staff of the United Nations for the work they have done in the past year. On the whole, the staff have worked hard and well under his leadership, and they should all be given every encouragement.\n4.\tEarlier in this session we witnessed the admission of three new Members: the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the People's Republic of Mozambique. We welcome these new Members with real joy for two reasons: first, this brings us closer to the total elimination of the evil of colonialism and imperialism; and, secondly, it brings us very close to the universality of the United Nations. We pledge our support and co-operation to the new Members in accomplishing the difficult tasks that lie ahead of them. No doubt the task of building their nations and consolidating their freedom and independence is a difficult one. We urge that the United Nations as a body, and Member nations individually, should lend a hand by giving them all assistance. Kenya will play its part.\n5.\tWhile on this subject, I must mention our dismay at the irrelevant obstacles that are being placed in the way of the admission of some new Members. We had thought that the United Nations had left such unworthy activities in the past. However, as this matter is still under discussion, I shall say no more at this stage.\n6.\tAs we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations, it is unavoidable that we should look back and take stock of the achievements and failures of the Organization. We are certain that, when the balance-sheet is drawn up on the achievements and failures, the result will unmistakably be that the Organization has been a success. Failures here and there, yes, disappointments, yes; but, on the whole, the Organization has grown from strength to strength and has accomplished a great many of the tasks for which it was established, and the outlook for the future gives us great confidence and holds great promise.\n7.\tWe have witnessed in the past year a campaign of vilification of the United Nations and open threats which deserves some attention. Some delegations in the past 12 months appear to have lost faith and hope in the United Nations and seem to despise it. For some, the United Nations has appeared to be a stumbling-block. The Organization has, however, consistently intervened in international activities for the benefit and welfare of mankind as a whole. No one here can say that the United Nations has been useless, for why, then, did it take these delegations so long to discover that and to act? Virulent attacks can only discredit those who engage in them. This Organization has stood and will continue to stand for peace and security for the benefit of all. If, in doing so, it frustrates some or injures the supposed interests of others, then we can only say that this is regrettable.\n8.\tWherever world peace and security have been threatened, the United Nations has not failed to exert the maximum pressure on the side of peace, tranquility and understanding. It has provided an invaluable forum for the exchange of views and dialog on issues of concern to the international community, irrespective of the status, social or economic system, level of development or military capability of any State. It is Kenya's sincere hope that the ballots cast in this Assembly will more and more reflect the general will of the international community to maintain peace and security for the nations, as well as its resolve to improve the welfare of all mankind. Kenya once more renews its dedication to the ideals of the United Nations.\n9.\tI wish now to survey the African scene in the context of the aims and objectives of the United Nations. Being an integral part of that scene, and considering the monumental challenges that confront us in this vast and varied continent, I hope my priority will be readily understood.\n10.\tIn southern Africa, the odious practice of apartheid continues to reign supreme. The white Rhodesian rebellion, sustained by external forces, continues to flourish. The South African expansionists harbor designs of maintaining physical control over Namibia in perpetuity under a discriminatory system. These afflictions cast a dark shadow over the destiny of Africa, whose security, survival and honor are at stake. Therefore, our grave concern for Africa is real; it is not merely an exercise in rhetoric.\n11.\tIn South Africa, the African continues to be subjected to the vilest forms of oppression and degradation. He is denied basic human rights. His cultural heritage is being systematically destroyed by discriminatory laws and police terror. Any right of association or of the expression of grievances has long since been stamped out. The tyranny of apartheid has decreed ruin and servitude for him. There is no glimmer of hope in the long night of darkness and desperation that has descended upon him. In such circumstances, a plea for mercy or reason is a cry in the wilderness.\n12.\tIn recent months the developments in Namibia have burst on the outside world as a harsh reminder of the nature of South African colonial rule. For, in Namibia, the African people have resolutely refused to continue to live under terror and have taken up arms under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] to defend their dignity. South Africa and the apologists of apartheid know that, in spite of the overwhelming might of the South African armed police State, bitter fighting has been going on in Namibia against South African colonialism, and the struggle continues.\n13.\tThe unfortunate, faithful allies of South Africa know that South Africa has no right to be in Namibia and that, despite the declared position of the United Nations expressed in various resolutions, South Africa continues to disregard the United Nations, and yet nothing that can really hurt their position has been done. This thirtieth session of the General Assembly should further examine the world body's position on Namibia.\n14.\tEvery peaceful method to win the rights of the overwhelming majority of black Africans in South Africa has been frustrated by the white minority racist regime. This situation is bound to explode one day, unleashing a racial conflagration without parallel in history. Such an undesirable development will be the making of the supremacist regime in Pretoria. This will be the choice dictated to the Africans by the unreasonableness and brutality of the whites in South Africa. It is clear from history that no force of arms or support from external forces ever cowed the will of the people to be free.\n15.\tKenya's own successful struggle against the might of the British and the Algerian onslaught against the equally determined French are sufficient reason for us in Kenya to believe in the eventual freedom of the Africans in South Africa. Portugal resisted the\\\" will for freedom of the people of Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe, Angola and Cape Verde, but it failed. South Africa and Rhodesia will fail too. We believe that the time has come for the United Nations to consider, in more concrete terms, what should be done to put an end once and for all to South Africa's constant violation of the fundamental principles of the Charter and decisions of the United Nations. We are tired of rhetoric; it has now become an exercise in futility. Let us sincerely resolve to achieve the complete realization of decolonization one of the most important goals of the United Nations and of the entire international community. Our determination is to destroy the policy and practice of apartheid despite its reaffirmation by the Foreign Minister of South Africa on 16 September this year during a visit to the Federal Republic of Germany.\n16.\tThe Kenya Government has consistently rejected the notion of dialog with South Africa. If Pretoria insists on advancing the proposal for a dialog in its present form, we would regard it as valueless. South Africa would be well advised to initiate first a dialog with its black population, which is its overwhelming majority. We reject dialog because we strongly feel that it would be grossly harmful to the struggle of the African people for self-determination while bestowing the seal of recognition and respectability on the racist regime and the vicious policies of South Africa. dialog would help South Africa to come in from the cold with triumphant success. Kenya will not be a party to these misleading and miscalculated designs unless South Africa engages in meaningful dialog first with the African National Congress and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania. Those two organizations hold the key to the success or failure of the detente exercise. They are the true representatives of the African people and we salute them. Only they can invite us, if they so wish and if there is a need, to engage with them and with their complete agreement in dialog and detente with the South African Government.\n17.\tIn Zimbabwe, the rebel Ian Smith has demonstrated clearly that he is not interested in a peaceful settlement of the problem he himself and his clique created in 1965 with their unilateral declaration of independence. He has continued to defy the African call for a peaceful solution to the question of true independence for Zimbabwe based on the principle of majority rule. He has sought to cash in on the temporary difficulties facing the African National Council and threatens to consult with non-representative individuals and outmoded institutions based on the long discredited and ineffective chieftainship system. He hopes in this way to escape what for him must be absolute torture, namely, negotiating for majority rule with the rightful owners of the soil. But lime is not on his side. The African in Zimbabwe is on the move and as of now is left with no alternative but to intensify the armed struggle in Zimbabwe. In this connexion, Kenya welcomes the recent announcement by the African National Congress leaders that, in the face of the developments now taking place in that part of Africa, an armed struggle is not only imminent but inevitable. There is little doubt in our minds that the criminal rebel Smith is only interested in the perpetuation of the illegal and intolerable white racist domination in Zimbabwe. We recommend that the United Nations should be more effectively involved to ensure the effective and demonstrable transfer of power to the Africans. The world community has every right to help to oust the rebel that Smith and his compatriots are and should seek ways and means to assist the Zimbabweans to do just that.\n18.\tWith regard to other parts of Africa still under colonial domination, our stand is very clear. Kenya fully supports the principle of self-determination and independence of the peoples of the country of the Afars and the Issas Djibouti and pledges material and financial assistance to the fight against colonialism and racist subjugation in all Africa.\n19.\tIn this context, we condemn strongly the French Government's encircling of Mayotte Island with warships and the stationing of troops there recently with a view to dismembering the newly proclaimed independence of the Comoro Islands and inciting the Mayotte population to secede from the Comoros.\n20.\tLet me reiterate Kenya's position with regard to the Spanish Sahara. We abide by the resolutions of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] passed at Mogadiscio and Kampala and will respect the wishes of the Saharan people in the light of the findings of the International Court of Justice. We therefore urge all parties to desist from taking any steps that might harm the interests of Spanish Saharans. Let us all leave them to make their own unfettered choice.\n21.\tI now turn my attention to what is probably the most dangerous area on the international scene the Middle East. The situation in the region continues to be grim, and although there has been a flicker of hope, the long-standing conflict is still not resolved. We have welcomed all peace initiatives in this conflict and express the hope that intransigence will give way to compromise and that equitable and just solutions will be found to the satisfaction of all parties concerned.\n22.\tTo avoid a shooting war and the disastrous consequences of such an explosion, we call upon the parties to implement Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). These resolutions take into account the interests of all parties. Kenya's position with regard to the Middle East has been repeatedly enunciated both from this rostrum and from other international forums. We believe that the following three principles are the prerequisite for a permanent and lasting peace: first, the right of all States to exist within secured boundaries; secondly, the right of the Palestinians to a national homeland; and thirdly, the inadmissibility of territorial acquisition by force of arms. Israel must therefore withdraw from all occupied Arab territories in accordance with United Nations resolutions.\n23.\tIsrael owes its legal existence to the United Nations and it cannot and must not be allowed to flout with impunity United Nations resolutions calling on it to respect the rights of the Palestinians and to withdraw from all occupied territories. Furthermore, for any ' durable peace to be achieved in the Middle East, not\nonly should the rights of the Palestinians be taken into account, but I think Israel ought to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization as the legitimate representative of the Palestinians. The people of\nPalestine are entitled to self-determination in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. Unless this is achieved, the problem of Palestine will continue to endanger international peace and security. What is now needed is the opening up of minds. The only solution is for Israel to make an agonizing reappraisal of the basic premises of its Government and for the Arabs to struggle for attainable objectives. The present position, despite the signing of the partial Sinai Agreement, clearly indicates that, without the full consultation and commitment to solutions by the Palestine people, lasting peace will be an unattainable objective. We are disturbed by the rising crescendo of the arms race which is being encouraged through the supply of sophisticated weapons of mass destruction in that area. We appeal to the major Powers to refrain from further exacerbating the situation as armaments only encourage nations to believe in the value of military strength, which is illusory in the long run.\n24.\tMy delegation has followed with great concern the development of events in Cyprus, keeping in mind the welfare of all the people of Cyprus. I wish to reiterate our support for the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Cyprus, a country which has made great contributions to our group of non- aligned States. We reaffirm our solidarity with one of our founding members. We note with pleasure the effectiveness of the work pioneered by the non-aligned countries, which enabled the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session to adopt unanimously resolution 3212 (XXIX), which was endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 365 (1974), thus establishing the framework, guidelines and principles for the solution of the Cyprus problem.\n25.\tExternal actions such as those we witnessed during the past year do nothing but hinder the natural development of the will to find a solution of the people concerned. I wish to express my hope and encouragement for the continued peace talks that have been taking place between the peoples of Cyprus. The continuation of those talks should prove fruitful for the Cypriot people as a whole, and no doubt in time the wounds will heal, thus allowing the Cypriot nation to return to normal.\n26.\tI wish now to make some observations on another matter that continues to occupy this Organization. Kenya has supported in the past and will continue to support in the future the proposal that the Indian Ocean be designated a zone of peace. We call upon all Member States, including neighboring States, to co-operate in implementing the Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. It is no secret that some States Members of the United Nations are at present competing for naval supremacy in the Indian Ocean to further their over-all global military strategy. This rivalry seriously compromises the efforts already under way to establish the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. The Kenya Government wishes to place on record its great concern with the subject.\n27.\tMy delegation is also concerned that some of the countries contiguous to the Indian Ocean have tended to see this problem of rivalry from an ideological point of view and have tended to condemn such activities on a selective basis. No solution can be found to this grave problem unless the countries bordering on the Indian Ocean speak against the activities of all those which undermine the concept of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. It does not serve any long- term purpose to single out any country for sole condemnation. All Member States which disregard the United Nations resolutions relating to the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace should be censured and condemned irrespective of their ideological orientation. Peace in the Indian Ocean is vital to our interests and future development. Hence, for us in Kenya, the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace is not apolitical slogan, but an imperative for our economic and political well- being. In this spirit, Kenya strongly supports the efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean under its indefatigable Chairman, Mr. Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka, which has continued to do its work despite the refusal of some Members to co-operate as they were requested to do in General Assembly resolution 3259 A (XXIX). Kenya also supports the proposal for littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean to enter into negotiations with a view to convening a meaningful conference on the Indian Ocean. We urge the maritime States to co-operate fully in the preparation of such a conference. We would strongly urge the Committee not to allow itself to be the political mouthpiece of any ideological bloc. This is the only way, as we see it, to ensure the success of the conference.\n28.\tI want now to refer briefly to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. As we all know, the basic objective of the Conference is to negotiate a comprehensive treaty establishing a new world order in the oceans. From the work of the two substantive sessions held in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1974 and in Geneva early this year, it is clear that efforts must continue to be made towards evolving an equitable system for the exploitation and utilization of the immense resources of the oceans. The system must take into account the divergences of the inter-national community as between maritime and non- maritime States, coastal and land-locked States, developed and developing States, and large and small States.\n29.\tIt is the hope of my delegation that, in a spirit of mutual accommodation and co-operation, the next session of the Conference, scheduled to take place here in New York early next year, will be able to resolve the outstanding issues and to adopt a convention. The work which the Conference did in Geneva is reflected in the single negotiating texts of the three Committees, which offer a suitable basis for arriving at acceptable compromises. However, my delegation says this without in any way endorsing any of the negotiating texts, and we shall make our views amply known when the Conference resumes its work with respect to each of the proposed texts.\n30.\tThe issues fall within two broad categories: the determination of the limits of national jurisdiction and the establishment of a regime and the machinery for the exploitation of the sea-bed area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, already designated as \\\"the common heritage of mankind\\\". On the question of national jurisdiction, the positions of many States seem to be converging on the establishment of an exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles. We are gratified that this idea, with the formulation of which we have been associated since the beginning, has now become almost generally accepted. We are, however, still facing attempts by some delegations to water down the content of the concept and to undermine the very basis on which the economic zone was promulgated as an acceptable compromise between conflicting interests. With regard to the common heritage of mankind, it is the view of my delegation that all nations should refrain, in the mean time, from taking any unilateral actions in the exploitation of the area. Such unilateral actions would constitute a violation of the moratorium which this Assembly wisely adopted on the subject in 1970 [resolution 2749 (XXV)]. Let me emphasize once again that the aim of the Conference is to prevent a shameful, costly and painful scramble for the oceans. It is imperative, therefore, that we should not frustrate that aim. We shall continue to support fully the common heritage concept so that it may be translated into a meaningful program for the benefit of the whole international community.\n31.\tAllow me now to say a few words in connexion with the review of the Charter. It should be recalled that, when the Charter was formulated 30 years ago, the world situation was very different from what it is now. The few small and weak States which were then participating, and which were presumably co-authors of the Charter, were in reality and, with due respect, little more than privileged observers. Hence, we find that some Members obtained a position of dominance within the framework of the Charter and its various organs which was then disproportionate to their number and which is now totally unrealistic, taking into consideration that the total membership of the Organization has increased from 50-odd States to nearly 150 States. In the light of the above, a review of the Charter is not only timely, but essential and indeed imperative if the Charter is to continue to serve the interests of all Member States.\n32.\tMy delegation totally rejects the argument advanced by some that the Charter is a sacrosanct document which has stood the test of time and which cannot be reviewed without jeopardizing the very existence of the Organization. This argument is disproved by the fact that there have already been far-reaching amendments to the Charter without disrupting the smooth functioning of the Organization. I refer specifically to the enlargement of the membership of the Security Council from the original 11 members to the present 15 members, as well as the increase of the membership of the Economic and Social Council from 27 to 54. These amendments made the two important organs more realistic in that they are now more representative of the international community than they were before.\n33.\tMy delegation is of the view that, even if the Charter had been a perfect instrument when it was formulated in 1945, it could not remain immutable and still meet the interests of the Member States despite the radical and dynamic transformation of the international scene. This was foreseen by the very founding fathers who provided for its review in Article 109 of the Charter. It is for this reason that during the twenty-ninth session my delegation strongly supported the establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter of the United Nations to discuss the observations received from Governments and to consider other specific proposals that might be made with a view to enhancing the ability of the United Nations to achieve its purposes. Though the Ad Hoc Committee did indeed meet earlier this year, it could not make much progress in view of the attitudes taken by some of the members who seem to fear even the thought itself that the Charter could be reviewed. It is puzzling indeed when the fear of thought is felt by very imaginative people. We are not advocating a wholesale revision of the Charter but a review of its working methods, which can be done in a systematic manner only if the work is entrusted to an ad hoc committee such as the one that has been established. We will therefore continue to support the Ad Hoc Committee, and we hope that all States will adopt a realistic attitude which would help to make the Charter more responsive to the interests of the international community as a whole.\n34.\tIn any case, all Member States will have a final say under the provisions of the Charter, since any amendments to the Charter require the support of two thirds of the members of the General Assembly, including all the permanent members of the Security Council. The fears that a review will lead to an imposition of the will of the majority on a minority and seriously compromise the vital interests of some Members is grossly exaggerated and in any case that argument can be reversed with equal applicability.\n35.\tI should now like to focus my attention and observations on the questions of development and international economic co-operation, to which Kenya, as a developing country, attaches the utmost importance. My delegation had occasion to dwell at some length on these matters at the recently concluded seventh special session, and we shall therefore at this point make only a few observations.\n36.\tJudging from the results of the sixth and seventh special sessions, the international community may well have just found a way out of a very sticky problem. We have reviewed the whole international economic situation and we have emerged, we trust, with a determination to effect the desired changes in the present international economic system for the eventual benefit of all. For the developing countries, and for us in Kenya in particular, this turn of events has ushered in a potentially promising new era not only for our people but for the whole international community, developed and developing alike.\n37.\tIn our view, the new situation, as expressed in the results of the sixth and seventh special sessions, poses a challenge and offers opportunities and hope to the international community. It poses the challenge of utilizing our now more enlightened and more comprehensive perception of our common destiny and interdependence. It offers the opportunity to speed up the tempo of the development process for the benefit of all, for speed is of the essence and practical results are urgently needed. It offers the hope of reducing the gap between the rich and the not-so-rich, not by insubstantial high-sounding economic promises, but by tangible workable programs. We have to address ourselves to the challenge and hope of giving inter-dependence real meaning through the expeditious implementation of our decisions taken at the seventh special session and, lastly, to the challenge and hope of assisting the developing countries in their efforts to uplift the economic conditions of their peoples.\nIn our belief, all this can be done without long-term sacrifice of the economic well-being of those who are at present afraid of the new challenges. What we need is courage and a clear perception of the new concepts of interdependence.\n38.\tThe resolution unanimously adopted at the seventh special session [resolution 3362 (S-VI!)] constitutes a truly historic and significant breakthrough. Its provisions in the areas of trade, finance, industrialization and agriculture, without a doubt, represent a step towards the establishment of that new understanding and that new system of inter-national economic relationship to which we all aspire. We have indeed laid the first brick, as it were, but a considerable amount of work remains to be done. We call upon the intellectual giants in theories of international economics to give us the lead and upon the practitioners to follow closely on their heels.\n39.\tMy delegation was particularly encouraged by the constructive atmosphere which prevailed throughout our long and arduous negotiations during the seventh special session. The discernible trend away from misunderstanding among the different groups was especially welcome. Such a trend should be sustained, for it augurs very well for our future work.\n40.\tThis work will be continued both at this regular session of the General Assembly and further at the forthcoming fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], which is scheduled to be held next year in Nairobi, Kenya. Given the added importance of the fourth session of UNCTAD, my country is now even more honored and especially conscious of its responsibility as the host of the meeting. The appropriate authorities in Kenya have already embarked on the preparation of the Conference, and we pledge to do everything possible to facilitate its success. We look forward to extending the usual Kenyan hospitality and to putting ourselves at the complete disposal of all those who will be participating at this next stage of our work.\n41.\tI should not like to conclude without saying a few words on the International Women's Year. The thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations has coincided with the observance of 1975 as International Women's Year. Kenya has taken this year very seriously. We sent to Mexico a strong delegation of women to participate in the deliberations, the aim of which was to increase the contribution of women to human development and peace. We have in our delegation here another strong contingent of beautiful ladies.\n42.\tWe in Kenya are doing all we can to implement the objectives contained in the World Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Women's Year.1 It is our intention to see that women and men have equality before the law and that women participate in the economic, social, cultural and political life of our African society in a suitable way. Our women have entered the professions on an equal footing with men and, as in other countries of Africa, they are to be found in the infantry and are also excellent paratroopers. We are making progress.\n43.\tI take this opportunity to thank the Government of Mexico for organizing so successful a conference to focus on the interests of the women of the world\ndespite the disruptive efforts of those who may have genuinely felt that enough was not being done for women. It is a healthy sign when people compete to do the right thing, and my country's efforts for women will be positively sustained.\n44.\tIn conclusion, may I once more renew Kenya's faith in the United Nations and pledge our support for the Organization in all its endeavors to bring freedom, peace, security, economic development and harmony among all the peoples of the world. I have to report that we have already allocated beautiful and very valuable land to the United Nations Environment program, and temporary buildings are already under construction. Our Government is intensely eager to have a suitable permanent headquarters put up on the site at Gigiri, Nairobi, which will serve as a constant reminder to mankind of the urgent and continuing need to preserve the environment for ourselves and future generations. We owe it to the children of tomorrow to do the best for them today.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. I believe that you are the first Prime Minister to hold this high office. The fact that you feel able to be away from your country for three months reflects well on the political stability of your country, as well as on your self-confidence and political courage, Not many heads of government would feel safe these days to be away from their countries for three consecutive months. Your election to this high office is primarily a reflection of your personal qualities; it also does honour to Luxembourg. As the Foreign Minister of a small country, I take some vicarious satisfaction in the fact that the representative of another small country has been elected to the presidency of this Assembly.\n32.\tMy delegation would also like to extend its warm welcome and good wishes to the three new Member States: the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, and the People's Republic of Mozambique. We also look forward to the accession of Papua New Guinea to membership in this Organization. As a close neighbor, we take very great pleasure in co-sponsoring its application for membership.\n33.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to our Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the tireless manner in which he has discharged his duties, some of them difficult and demanding, during the past 12 months. I should like to single out for special mention two examples of his contributions to the cause of inter-national peace and security. First, I think all of us owe him a debt of gratitude for having convened and chaired the inter-communal talks on Cyprus. Four rounds of such negotiations have been held. Although the negotiations appear to have run into difficulties, I would urge the Secretary-General to continue his efforts with the two parties in order to resume the negotiations on the outstanding obstacles in the way of a peaceful and lasting settlement in Cyprus. Secondly, I should like to congratulate our Secretary-General on the helpful role he played in bringing about the resumption of diplomatic relations between France and Guinea.\n34.\tThis year marks the thirtieth year of the existence of our Organization. This is a period of time which divides two generations: the pre-war generation, which had already been born when this Organization was founded and which still largely directs its affairs, and the successor generation, born since the United Nations was launched in San Francisco. This latter generation, the post-San-Francisco generation, which is now entering middle age, today constitutes the vast majority of the world's population. In the years ahead the direction of world affairs and of the affairs of this Organization will pass into their hands, and so any discussion of the United Nations and its future must be stated in terms meaningful to this generation rather than in accordance with the quaint beliefs and the obsolete prejudices of a gerontocracy which will fade away.\n35.\tIt is generally agreed that after 30 years this world Organization has lost much of its zest and vigor, and there are pessimists who hopefully predict its eventual demise. Though we disagree with the pessimists, it is nevertheless true that the high hopes the United Nations held out in its early years have, for the most part, evaporated. The sorry state into which it has fallen no doubt prompted this Assembly to set up an Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 3349 (XXIX)] to look into ways and means of rejuvenating it. These experts have now completed their report and I shall comment on their largely constructive and helpful recommendations later on.\n36.\tBut the streamlining of United Nations procedures and the restructuring of its machinery are by themselves not enough. What is required even more is a fundamental change in the intellectual, moral and emotional approach to world problems on the part of the 141 nations which collectively constitute the United Nations. The shortcomings and weaknesses of this Organization are in fact the sum of our own failures. We cannot absolve ourselves from blame by hiding behind abstractions like \\\"machinery\\\" and \\\"procedures\\\". We are the United Nations, and it can be no better or worse than we are.\n37.\tBefore I embark on what is really self-criticism, let me say that I disagree with those who claim that this Organization has nothing to be proud of and that the world would be better off without it. The facts do not justify that extremist view. The achievements of the United Nations may have fallen short of expectations, but its record in spreading education, in bettering the health of peoples the world over, in assisting developing countries in social and economic development and in promoting international co-operation in such diverse fields as outer space, the oceans of the world and peace-keeping are significant achievements and evidence of its great potentialities for good.\n38.\tPerhaps the two most outstanding achievements which more than compensate for its many failures are, first, the liberation of hundreds of millions of people from imperial bondage and, second, the inculcation, in however rudimentary and imperfect a form, of the habit of discussion and co-operation among 141 nations. Never before in human history have so many nations met so frequently to conduct discussions on so comprehensive a scale.\n39.\tSo, as we see it, the dismantling of the United Nations, far from making for more effective international diplomacy, would in fact plunge the world into inevitable disaster. The belief that world stability could be restored by a reversion to traditional great- Power diplomacy or by a restricted concert of nations calling themselves the third world would, in the long term, be disastrous for mankind. The fact is that there is no alternative today to the United Nations. Even if we were to scrap it tomorrow we would be forced, as a matter of survival, to create another organization very much like this one. This is because over the past 30 years we have unwittingly, and even unwillingly, created a truly interdependent world. It will become more, not less, interdependent with every passing year. Modern science and technology and the political, social and economic institutions they have forced upon us are thrusting us, very often against our will and against the grain of our national ideologies, in the direction of a global community. The global community is today not a myth, but a reality. Our economics, our politics and our social problems have global as well as national dimensions. Food and fuel, population and the environment, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the making of a new legal order to manage the uses and resources of the world's oceans, the transfer of resources and technological skills from developed to the less developed countries, and the rapid modernization and industrialization of the less developed countries are problems that demand simultaneously national and global solutions. Neither one by itself is sufficient.\n40.\tIn short, the world is one, and its fundamental problems are indivisible. This is the reality. But the ideology and approaches that guide deliberations in this Organization are rooted in a world and an epoch that has for the most part vanished. They are the beliefs which were shaped to meet the needs of a seventeenth-century Europe which had just discovered the marvels of coal and steam technology. The ideology of that period was a xenophobic nationalism built around the myth of racial supremacy and the civilizing virtue of a national religion which, it was claimed, was most favored by the Creator himself. That same ideology sanctified wars of conquest and the subjugation of inferior peoples as necessary steps in the march towards a higher civilization.\n41.\tIt is this seventeenth-century ideology which still governs our thinking and shapes our international policies in this Organization. True, these basic beliefs, in these more enlightened times, are dressed up in the rhetoric of internationalism and world brotherhood. But, shorn of these wrappings, what stands revealed is the seventeenth-century mind. Perhaps most dis-tressing of all is how readily some third-world countries, despite their having been victims of this outdated European ideology, have taken to xenophobic nationalism and the racial and religious arrogance associated with their former Western rulers. We quite rightly complain of the arrogance of the powerful, but if we are honest with ourselves we should also be critical of the growing arrogance of the weak.\n42.\tThe inadequacy of the United Nations is only partly attributable to organizational defects and inadequate procedures. More basic is the fact that we are seeking to resolve what are global problems in terms of a steam-engine nationalism. Worse still, we create more and more problems for ourselves by compelling an interdependent world to conform to the imperatives of an outmoded and increasingly irrelevant ideology. So our economic problems get worse because 141 nations formulate solutions to global problems in purely national terms. Hence, monetary problems, to name one, become unmanageable because there are as many often-conflicting solutions as there are nations.\n43.\tSo the first prerequisite for the revitalization of the United Nations is an acceptance of the fact that we are moving towards a global community and that, unless we think as members of a world community, the more intractable our problems, both domestic and international, will become. This does not mean abandoning national identities or the sacrifice of basic national interests; it is largely a question of a new kind of thinking which would permit us to consolidate and expand national interests within the wider framework of a global community. And this is not as difficult as it sounds. Great nation-States have managed to establish a satisfactory relationship between conflicting individual, group and minority interests within the structure of transcending national interests.\n44.\tIn this Organization we have 141 Members. Our interests do not always coincide and often they are diametrically opposed. Yet, collectively, we constitute the global community. If this Organization is to acquire significance and meaning, it should become the instrument for the planned nurturing and direction of the global community which we are now creating in an unplanned and unpurposeful manner.\n45.\tIf we are to play this role and, as we see it, this is now the only justification for this Organization  then I should like to suggest some guidelines.\n46.\tFirst, we must get away from the old concept, which dominated the last 30 years, of using this Organization as an arena for staging contests and confrontations for the edification of our home audiences and the working out of obscure private and public frustrations. In this regard, the great Powers should be blamed for first initiating this unworthy tradition in the days of the old cold war. If we are to find global solutions to planetary challenges, then we must learn to use this Organization as a forum for negotiations and problem-solving. It is no use talking about international co-operation while adopting tactics calculated to divide and humiliate Member States.\n47.\tA problem-solving approach requires a different cast of mind. It must accept the fact that, given 141 Members with diverse interests, very often a series of compromise solutions, less good than what we expect but each better than the preceding one, might be the practical road to an eventually satisfactory solution.\n48.\tSecondly, we must get away from the prevailing belief that a resolution adopted by a decisive majority has in fact solved a problem. This is perhaps our greatest weakness and one which has greatly helped to bring this Organization to its present sorry state. Where a resolution injures the basic interests of dissenting States, it will be ignored. Worse still, the resolution will be quietly breached even by States which had been shamed or cajoled into voting for it. By adopting resolutions which we know would be shamelessly breached we are in fact helping to bring our resolutions into disrepute.\n49.\tThe emphasis should therefore be not on decisionmaking by a majority but on conciliation and consensus-building. It is a fact that the principle of majority vote is becoming increasingly suspect in this Assembly for a variety of reasons. It has on many occasions become a device, not for conciliation, but for staging confrontations for humiliating opponents or for impressing antagonists and suggesting that the prime mover has more camp followers than his enemy. The result is that, through constant misuse, majority decisions have lost their efficacy. Far from intimidating the victim, they only strengthen his intransigence and compel defiance.\n50.\tIt is also true that on many occasions majority decisions are not made on the merits of the case. The unfortunate defendant is well aware that the judges and the jury have already arrived at a decision long before they have heard the case and the facts which is not surprising because the facts and the case which prompted the decision more often than not have nothing to do with the case at hand. Decisions are openly arrived at as a result of secret deals on matters irrelevant to the issue on which the pronouncement is made.\n51.\tAgain, there are resolutions which by their very nature invite defiance and even threats to peace. For example, any resolution which calls for hostility towards nations with which one has no quarrel and with which one may even be on the best of terms, or any resolution which calls upon a State to liquidate itself politically or economically will understandably be breached. Yet there have been occasions when such resolutions have been solemnly adopted by this Assembly.\n52.\tIt would, of course, be a good thing if decisions could be arrived at and implemented on the majority principle, But we do not think that the members of this Assembly are ready for it yet. The minority has yet to be satisfied that majority decisions are arrived at with judicial impartiality and that majority decisions are made by men of virtue and not by a kangaroo court.\n53.\tSo this Organization must for the time being aim at consensus-building or, as the United Nations Charter itself wisely prescribed, we must make the Organization \\\"a center for harmonizing the actions of nations\\\" not encouraging and expanding disharmony and conflicts.\n54.\tI should like now to make a few comments on the recommendations contained in the report of the Group of Experts on the Structure of the United Nations System, which bears the title, A New United Nations Structure for Global Economic Co-operationI refer, in particular, to its suggestion that, at the request of the General Assembly or the Economic and Social Council, or upon the motion of one tenth of the members of either body, a small negotiating group should be constituted to seek agreement on a specific action proposal or related action proposals in the field of development and international economic co-operation. Negotiating groups would be of manageable size, normally between 10 and 30, and would include countries principally interested in the subject-matter whether or not they were members of the Council. These groups would operate for periods of one to two years, subject to renewal as determined by the Assembly or the Council.\n55.\tThe Council would be kept informed by the negotiating groups of the progress being made by them. During the two-year period, the Assembly and the Council would be free to consider subjects under discussion in the groups and to vote resolutions thereon; but, in deciding upon whether to vote on a particular resolution, the Assembly and the Council would take into account the progress of the negotiations.\n56.\tEach negotiating group would function under the guidance of a full-time chairman with the assistance, if necessary, of a small representative body of vice-chairmen, all of whom would be proposed by the Secretary-General and confirmed by the Assembly or the Council, depending on where the proposal for the group originated. The full-time chairman would serve for the duration of the group. Each negotiating group would operate on the basis of unanimity. When a negotiating group reached agreement it would \nreport to the Council, which could adopt the agreement, refer the matter back to the negotiating group for further consideration or take such other action as it deemed appropriate. Upon approval by the Council, the agreement would be passed to the Assembly, which would approve the agreement, refer the matter back to the group or take some other action.\n57.\tMy delegation sees considerable merit in the consultative procedures proposed by the Group of Experts. We support them because they are designed to promote agreement on major policy issues where agreement might otherwise be unobtainable. We recognize, however, that it is not enough to introduce new consultative procedures for reaching agreement. It is also necessary to address the question of how negotiations should be conducted.\n58.\tAllow me to suggest four further rules for your consideration. The first rule is that to be successful in any negotiation one must examine the most constructive proposals the opponent offers. One needs to find a position offered by one side acceptable to the other side, and try to build from there. To put it very simply, the essence of the first rule in any negotiation is to see the problem from the point of view of your opponent; to understand the interests he has to serve; the constraints under which he has to operate.\n59.\tThe second rule, I would suggest, is that one should not seek superiority in any negotiation. As a very distinguished diplomat and negotiator, Mr. Averill Harriman, has put it, \\\"You can't accomplish anything by knocking your opponent over the head ... the idea that you can whip your negotiating opponent into agreeing with you is nonsense.\\\"\n60.\tThe third rule which I would offer for your consideration is that no party to a negotiation must insist that all its demands be satisfied. Every party to a negotiation must be prepared to sacrifice some of its demands and to make some concessions and compromises. There can be no successful bargain if it satisfies all the demands of one side and none of the demands of the other. There must be a mutuality of gains and losses and of rights and obligations.\n61.\tThe fourth and final rule which I would offer is that every country has a certain irreducible minimum national interest. It is unreasonable to expect a country to consent to any proposal which detracts from that interest. The parties to a negotiation must therefore attempt to perceive the extent to which other parties are able to make concessions, or can even be pressured into making concessions, and the limits beyond which it would be unreasonable to expect an opponent to go.\n62.\tThe four rules which I have suggested above are by no means original, nor are they intended to be exhaustive. They should, however, convey an idea of the kind of new values and attitudes which must animate the negotiations and guide the negotiators if the United Nations is to be changed from an arena for shadow-boxing into a forum for negotiations.\n63.\tThose who drafted the Charter of the United Nations were inspired by the vision of the Organization as a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations. That vision has never been more relevant than it is today. We are faced with a new agenda of pressing problems energy and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, food and famine, the population explosion and environmental deterioration and the north-south dialog: these are planetary challenges to which only planetary responses may be feasible. The United Nations is the appropriate forum in which solutions to these problems can be found. The seventh special session has perhaps been a turning-point in United Nations history. It has shown that the United Nations can be made to work, that peoples and nations can negotiate. Let us resolve to continue to exert our efforts in that direction.\n64.\tI began by saying that the thirtieth year marks the period of the gradual take-over of this Organization by the generation born since its inception. The older generation, the pre-war generation, has many things to be ashamed of, and the most shameful of these was the senseless slaughter unleashed by the last war and the subjugation of millions in the name of empire. But I like to think that we and they have atoned for all this by creating this Organization dedicated to the outlawing for ever of wars and imperialist adventures, But the atonement will not be complete until we can hand over to the new generation a United Nations refined and perfected to make it a reliable instrument for truly uniting the nations of the world. Then the new generation will have cause to say: \\\"The generation from whom we inherited our world were unique in that they swept nothing under the carpet for us to clean up.\\\"\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "166.\t As we begin the thirtieth session of the General Assembly, I should like to convey to the President the sincere congratulations of my delegation on his well-deserved election. We wish him every success in his term of office. I consider it highly significant that this session is being presided over by a worthy representative of a small country, which, though not having great economic or military resources, is a living and eloquent example of the finest legal traditions. That fact alone renews our confidence in the Organization and prompts us to look towards the future with greater optimism, for it is the future of mankind.\n167- I also wish to express the appreciation of my delegation, my people and my Government to Mr. Kurt Waldheim for the splendid work he is doing as Secretary-General which is apparent from the report on the work of the Organization he has submitted to the Assembly [A//000/].\n168. A year ago, at the beginning of the twenty-ninth session, the Chairman of my country's delegation, from this rostrum [2260th meeting], spoke movingly of the death and desolation left behind by hurricane Fifi after it had torn through Honduras. He also made what was not a request but an urgent plea to our Organization and all the countries represented here. That moving appeal did not fall on deaf ears. The Organization, acting in an orderly and effective manner, mobilized its human and financial resources on behalf of my country. It is my duty here to pay a tribute to the excellent work done by the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator, the United Nations Emergency Operation, the United Nations Development Program and the JSconomic Commission for Latin America.\n169.\tThe international community acted in a no less prompt and generous manner. From the four corners of the earth, regardless of distance and ideological differences, the assistance which my country needed first for its survival and secondly for its reconstruction,' was forthcoming. Once again it has been shown that distress unites men and nations.\n170.\tAs the representatives of your countries and Governments, please accept, for your demonstration of genuine solidarity, the expression of the everlasting gratitude of the people and Government of the Republic of Honduras.\n171.\tMay solidarity and understanding among the great and the small, among the wealthy and the poor, among the developed and the under-developed be permanent. May new structures for international trade be created and, as a result, may there be greater justice in the distribution of the world's production, with our only goal being the pursuit of the betterment of mankind.\n172.\tMy delegation takes special pleasure in welcoming to our Organization the representatives of Cape Verde, Mozambique, and Sao Tome and Principe. Honduras has always sympathized with those who were fighting to wipe out colonialism. For that reason we whole-heartedly welcome this new step towards greater human dignity, and we are indeed impressed by the understanding and willingness to rectify past errors in the process of liberation shown by the new regime in Portugal.\n173.\tIn the specific case of Mozambique, the fact that Honduras was a member of the fact-finding committee inquiring into the killings that had been denounced there brought us into direct contact with the courageous struggle of that people for freedom. That fact served only to increase our admiration for its patriotic sacrifices, and so we are particularly pleased to see that delegation take its rightful place in this Organization of free peoples.\n174.\tMy delegation welcomed the recent agreement between the representatives of Egypt and Israel. We believe that that is another important and positive step towards peace in the Middle East, in which the United Nations has played a prominent role. Once again, it has been shown that, when there is political will on the part of those involved, any conflict, no matter how complicated, can be settled in a dignified and civilized way, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of our Organization.\n175.\tOf great concern, however, are the situations of conflict which exist today in Latin America and which are a constant threat to peace. Such is, m fact, our assessment of attempts to delay a settlement of the problem in the sister Republic of Panama and the satisfaction of its just claims to full sovereignty over the Canal Zone. Panama's cause, inasmuch as it is a just one, is also our cause. Honduras hopes that reason and common sense will prevail, and that there will soon be a just and equitable agreement that will safeguard solidarity in our continent.\n176.\tMy delegation furthermore wishes to say that Honduras will stand by the sister Republic of Guatemala in its efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement \u25a0 of he dispute pending with the United Kingdom over\nthe Territory of Belize, which, legally and historically, has always been a Central American territory.\n177.\tMy Government is and always has been in favor of a total, simultaneous and definitive settlement of the differences existing between Honduras and El Salvador. Those problems not only affect the two countries concerned, but they also have a negative effect on the integrated development of the Central American region. In the search for a solution, my country has always maintained that there is no conflict between States that cannot be resolved through the application of the established principles of international law.\n178.\tIn connexion with this important matter, I take great pleasure in announcing in this Assembly that, to this end and in the same pacifist spirit that characterizes the foreign policy of Honduras, yesterday in the Commission of the Thirteenth Meeting of Consultation of American Ministers for Foreign Affairs whose headquarters are in Washington, I presented a draft general treaty, with the request that it be transmitted to the Government of El Salvador. If the other side demonstrates the necessary political will, that draft could be the basic working document for a suitable settlement that would lead to a return to normal relations in Central America.\n179.\tThe year 1975 has special historic significance for events of outstanding importance have occurred in its course: it was designated International Women's Year; the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea took place during that period; and it marked the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations.\n180.\tIt is fitting and proper that the world Organization should have recognized the intrinsic worth of women and the important role that they have always played, at times indirectly, in the working out of the destiny of mankind. It is with pride that I can say that in Honduras for the past century women have enjoyed civil rights and that two decades ago they obtained full recognition of their political rights.\n181.\tOur legislation has eliminated all forms of discrimination by sex, and so it is that today the women of Honduras are working effectively in public administration and in private enterprise, thereby taking part in the difficult and continuing task of developing the country.\n182.\tHonduras is a country bordered by two oceans which contain important natural resources that can go a long way towards meeting the economic and food requirements of our people. For that reason the multilateral negotiations on the utilization and exploitation of the resources of the sea, which were initiated by the United Nations in General Assembly resolution 2750 (XXV), adopted on 17 December 1970, are vital to us.\n183.\tFor this same reason we have taken part in the discussion of most items and questions relating to the law of the sea. It has been our constant belief that the only feasible agreement that can be reached should be based on recognition of the legitimate rights of the various members of the international community, regardless of their level of development or geographical location, and on the need to reconcile the interests of States.\n184.\tAt the third session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held at Geneva from March to May of this year, the documents of the session held at Caracas, containing proposals on the peaceful uses of the seabed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, were discussed. After further analysis of those documents, and after discussing previously unexamined issues, the committees of the Conference were requested to prepare an informal negotiating single text covering the items discussed by those Committees.\n185.\tWe appreciate the difficulty of reaching agreement on rights and claims which are the subject of controversy between the developing States and the major maritime Powers. Progress in this area notwithstanding, we believe that we could advance much further if we were to establish a separate body capable of bringing about a peaceful settlement of disputes of this kind. That body should be made up of specialists closely acquainted with the meaning of freedom of the seas, with the claims and rights of developing nations, and with their permanent sovereignty over their natural resources.\n186.\tWe are deeply convinced that there must be an international regime governing the oceans and recognizing the legal equality of States, on the basis of mutual co-operation. That is the only way to ban the rule of force and the economic hegemony which usually victimizes those countries lacking the power freely to assert their rights over the use of the sea and its resources.\n187.\tOn the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations, Honduras wishes to say it has full confidence in the Organization. We have always believed that there can be no peaceful coexistence among States if there is no respect for the rules of international law.\n188.\tIt has often been said that this is a legal and political Organization. We might even state that it is more political than legal. Because of its dual nature, it has in fact managed to survive for three decades. However, we believe that we should be aware of the fact that political considerations, though at times they may seem to be of overriding importance, should never lead us to adopt illegal resolutions. Whenever might makes right, even in resolutions of international organizations, it is a denial of the rule of law.\n189.\tIt is precisely to strengthen our Organization and to make the rule of international law ever more effective that my delegation has become a sponsor of the draft resolutions calling for a review of the Charter in order to make .it more relevant and more nearly perfect.\n190.\tOver the past 30 years the world has undeniably experienced the most spectacular scientific and technological advances in its history: geographical distances have disappeared, thanks to present-day means of communication. Day after day, medicine is discovering miracle drugs and surgical techniques never before dreamed of. Gigantic computers capable of performing in seconds calculations that might have taken years to perform have opened up the gates to outer space, while at the same time successfully unraveling the secrets of the atom. Nevertheless, all this progress has not brought about peace in the\nworld; it has not eliminated the constant threat of thermonuclear conflagration, which could well destroy the world in a matter of seconds. We have not even been able to do away with international terrorism, which endangers innocent human lives and causes great loss of life. And we have not done so because, deliberately or not, we have failed to take into account the need to bring about the well-being and betterment of mankind, because we have failed to understand that it is for the benefit of man that there is scientific and technological progress, and because we fail to appreciate that there are ethnic groups and human communities, and even nations, that continue to be the victims of injustice and whose dignity continues to be flouted.\n191.\tPoverty, ignorance and injustice have always been and will continue to be an inexhaustible source of violence. It is not enough for us vigorously to condemn all forms of violence, nor is it-enough for our Organization, through its specialized agencies, to carry out studies that merely bring out in cold statistics the iniquitous conditions in which more than half of the world's population live. The international community must give up its traditional passive attitude and decide to play an active part in the search for practical, permanent solutions to the tremendous problems besetting mankind.\n192.\tI do not believe that there is anyone who would object to justice guiding every aspect of international relations. I believe that the differences existing here between the industrialized and the developing countries relate more to procedure than to substance. For years now, the world Powers have imposed their policies on the weaker nations, and in certain cases have even threatened economic pressure or have used force. Furthermore, the sudden emergence of the third world, with its demands for justice and its increasingly effective methods for making its voice heard, has brought us practically to the stage of confrontation. Everything points to this being the wrong course of action. We must engage in a frank and constructive dialog in order to bring out areas of agreement and settle controversial issues through the use of reason based on good faith. Intransigence, regardless of the source, will never help us produce the just solutions which we seek.\n193.\tBecause of its magnitude, this task requires the joint efforts of all, of great and small, of rich and poor. The times require it, and the survival of mankind demands it.\n194.\tThe resolution adopted at the seventh special session of the General Assembly [resolution 3362 (S-Vllj] prompts us to believe optimistically that we are on the threshold of a new era in international relations and that the emergence and growth of effective co-operation among nations in their striving for human betterment and a more just distribution of resources and wealth will prove to be the hallmark of the last quarter of the twentieth century.\n195.\tThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): The representative of El Salvador has asked to exercise his right of reply.\n196.\tMr. ROSALES (El Salvador) (interpretation from Spanish): In reference to the remarks made by the Foreign Minister of Honduras with respect to the difference between El Salvador and Honduras, I should like to state very clearly to this Assembly that El Salvador has always strongly desired to settle this problem, which is still pending between two neighboring countries and brother nations.\n197.\tThis is proved by the various consultations which have been held at Mexico City, with the Mexican Government as mediator, and in other cities here in the United States. Furthermore, talks have been held at the presidential level in Managua, in San Jose and in Guatemala. Consequently we are the first to hope that the drafts which have been submitted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Honduras and which have not yet been seen by my delegation, or even, I believe, by my Government will provide, as he says, the bases for a worthy settlement of the problem.\n198.\tWe realize that this problem affects not only two neighbors but also the whole region of Central America. Hence, it is therefore the unwavering policy of the Government of El Salvador to promote worthy and peaceful solution to this dispute."

        "file_text": "96.\t  First of all, I wish to express the satisfaction of the Cuban delegation at the election of Mr. Gaston Thorn to preside over the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. The decision of the General Assembly is an expression of respect for the peaceful conduct of Luxembourg and for his qualities as an experienced statesman. My delegation reiterates its readiness to co-operate with the President in the discharge of his lofty responsibilities.\n97.\tMay I also extend a greeting to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Algeria and President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His able and laudable action was a decisive factor in inscribing the last session in the annals of the Organization as one of the high moments in its necessary evolution in harmony with the positive changes that are taking place in international life.\n98.\tCuba enthusiastically welcomes the new States Members of the United Nations. The Republic of Cape Verde, the People's Republic of Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe have joined our Organization after successfully completing their secular struggle against colonialism and have entered the stream of non-aligned revolutionary States. Their admission to the United Nations is a reminder to us all of the duty devolving on the international community to co-operate actively with the peoples of the former Portuguese colonies, thus helping them along the road to development. We await the speedy entry of an independent Angola, victorious over the intrigues of imperialism.\n99.\tIn welcoming the new Member States, we condemn the unjust exclusion of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam. The attitude of the Government of the United States in this connexion shows the stubbornness of imperialism and the total isolation to which it condemns the North American authorities. Only the veto repeatedly used by Washington has prevented Vietnamese representatives from taking their rightful place in our midst.\nThe General Assembly spoke out unanimously in favor of their admission. World public opinion, including that of the people of the United States demands that they be allowed to occupy their rightful places.\n100.\tThe North American veto on the diplomatic plane is the expression of their continued hostility to the people of the Viet Nam. The same warlike attitude which unleashed over Indo-China the cruelest of wars prompts the behavior of those who today decree the economic, political and diplomatic blockade against Viet Nam and deny their right of admission to the United Nations. It is the obligation of all to oppose this warmongering attitude and demand of the United States that it put an end to it once and for all.\n101.\tThe General Assembly should consider the steps that it might take to counteract the obstructionist action of the United States. If Washington persists in its veto against Viet Nam it will be necessary to mobilize all the peace-loving States and forces of the world until Washington is made to feel the effects of the universal censure of its aggressive conduct, which is contrary to the course of history.\n102.\tThe people of Viet Nam has made an invaluable contribution to the cause of those who struggle for freedom and independence. Its tenacious resistance to aggression, its indomitable fighting spirit and its glorious and complete victory have shown that today there is neither a weak or small people nor any imperialist might capable of deterring or containing the will for freedom of subjugated masses. Its example will always take pride of place in the struggle of the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and will be a living lesson and a permanent encouragement to them all. The historic magnitude of its struggle and triumph make it all the more necessary to assist, impelled by generosity, in the reconstruction of Viet Nam, laid waste by a war that was sustained for the sake of the salvation of all nations on the three continents.\n103.\tThe decision taken at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, held recently at Lima, to create a Solidarity Fund for the reconstruction of Viet Nam [see A/10217 and Corr.l, annex I, resolution XIII], which Cuba applauds and supports and which was in fact originally an initiative of Prime Minister Fidel Castro, must be accompanied by concerted action until such time as the international community as a whole and the United Nations in particular offer Viet Nam all the co-operation necessary to speed up the country's rehabilitation, and to demand of the Government of the United States that it fulfil the commitment under article 21 of the Paris Agreement to assist in healing the wounds of war in Viet Nam and Indo-China.\n104.\tThe peoples of Kampuchea and Laos were protagonists in a heroic struggle waged parallel with that of Viet Nam. With admirable courage, they confronted the aggression of imperialism and its agents. Their triumph represents a significant contribution to the cause of emancipation of the third world. To achieve it the peoples of Kampuchea and Laos accepted sacrifices and bore chastisement that make them worthy of the broadest and staunchest solidarity. The international community is duty-bound to contribute to the reconstruction of Laos and Cambodia with all the necessary resources.\n105.\tThe Assembly is meeting at an especially propitious time for peoples intent on their emancipation and on building a peaceful and prosperous future. The victories of the peoples of Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos open a new phase in which it is possible to stay the hand of the aggressor. The collapse of fascism in Portugal and the liquidation of its former colonial empire point to the advent of a time in which there will be no nation groaning under a foreign yoke.\n106.\tThe results of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe show that it is possible to strengthen the process of detente. We live in an era in which the positions of socialism and being consolidated; in which the emancipation movements of the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America are growing, while the forces of reaction, imperialism and colonialism are forced to beat a retreat. And yet, despite the unquestionable achievements of recent times, the peoples of Africa, Asia and America are still confronted by many obstacles in their uphill march towards full freedom and development.\n107.\tIt is quite obvious that the main centers of imperialism do not resign themselves to their fate and endeavor everywhere to return to their positions of domination and exploitation. That is clearly illustrated by the conspiracies against States exercising their sovereign rights, by the attempts to halt the decolonization process, by encouragement of racist and Fascist movements and the refusal to introduce indispensable changes in the old and unjust structure of international economy as well as the maintenance of hotbeds of tension and constant threats against the process of affirmation of peaceful coexistence,\n108.\tIn Angola the conspiracy of imperialism, its allies and lackeys, has found concrete expression in the brazen interference designed to frustrate true decolonization while threatening its territorial integrity; snatching away from the Movimento Popular de Libertagao de Angola [MPLA1 the fruits of its dauntless struggle against colonialism, while condemning the future State to control by transnational corporations. Cuba renews the expression c>r its full solidarity with the MPLA yesterday heroic in its struggle against the European colonizer, today firm in its defense of true independence.\n109.\tIn the face of the scandalous interference of imperialists, colonialists and racists, it is an elementary duty to offer its people the cETective assistance that may be required for that country to ensure its true independence and full sovereignty. In order to spur the decolonization process, a coherent strategy must be implemented with the participation of all progressive forces, This strategy is essential in order to face up to colonialist and racist machinations against the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe and must oppose colonialism in all its forms and manifestations in every corner of the earth,\n110.\tIn this connexion we reiterate our support for the independence of Puerto Rico, Belize and other colonial Territories in the Caribbean, and once again support the right of Argentina to recover the Malvinas Islands.\n111.\tIn the Middle East imperialism is maneuvering to restore its influence and exercise control over its oil resources through the so-tailed policy of partial solutions. That policy is designed, moreover, to isolate Syria, to perpetuate the occupation by Israel of the greater part of the Arab territories and to deny the rights of the Arab people of Palestine. We wish to state once again that there will be no lasting solution in the region unless it is on the basis of the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the territories occupied in 1967 and of the full exercise by the people of Palestine of its inalienable right to self-determination, independence and sovereignly in its usurped homeland.\n112.\tThe Korean peninsula, yesterday the stage for a cruel bloody war, is still a source of threat to peace as a result of the interfering policy of United States imperialism. If a just solution is to be found the General Assembly must pronounce unequivocally in favor of the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops garrisoned in the southern part of the country, and in favor of the peaceful and independent reunification of that territory without foreign interference.\n113.\tUnited States designs of perpetuating their domination in Micronesia represent a challenge to the decolonization objectives of the United Nations and a threat to peace and security in the Pacific. Our Organization cannot disregard this fact and should adopt effective measures enabling the peoples of Micronesia freely to exercise their right to self-determination and independence.\n114.\tIn the field of international economic relations, my country, as a member of the Group of 77. shares its just demands as put forward in countless forums and which were concreted essentially in the Declaration and the program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 iS-Vt} and 3202 i.T-T/,] and in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States (resolution 3281 (XXfX)], both documents having been approved despite the tenacious opposition of the United States delegation.\n115.\tAt a lime when the capitalist economy is suffering the consequences of the acute recession it engendered, and when it seeks to unload its negative effects on the economies of the developing countries, it is of particular importance for the latter to change their traditionally unfavorable terms of trade and to obtain remunerative prices for their exports in the international capitalist market, to secure access to the necessary financing for their development on favorable terms, and to conduct their economic policies in the full exercise of permanent sovereignty over their natural resources, in particular, vis-a-vis the vast imperialist transnational corporations.\n116.\tIn this context, requests such as those included in the integrated program of primary commodities  price indexation to protect the developing countries in the face of the sustained increase in the price of imports from the developed capitalist countries which generated the inflation, and the set of proposals relating to development aid represent, inter alia. some of the measures which, in spite of the obdurate resistance of the United States and a number of other countries, none the less represent rungs to be climbed on the ladder of the inevitable establishment of a new inter-national economic order.\n117.\tDespite the over-all improvement in the European situation, there still subsist in that continent conflicts and tensions which may well lead to the disruption of peace. Cyprus is still the victim of armed attacks which have amputated part of the national territory, although so far the United Nations has not been able to confront it in the only manner compatible with the obligations enshrined in the Charter. It is high time for us to adopt strong measures in solidarity with Cyprus, a loyal, faithful State Member of this Organization and a founding member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Our support goes unhesitatingly to the legal Government of that country, the only legitimate Government of Cyprus, presided over by Archbishop Makarios. The immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops, full respect for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus all are prerequisites for the Cypriot people to solve by itself, without foreign interference, its domestic problems while finding a harmonious and just solution to the question of relations between the two Cypriot communities.\n118.\tThe Portuguese revolution, beset domestically and from outside by a whole set of hostile forces ranging from Fascists to pseudo-revolutionaries of every ilk, is still arousing concern and interest among all the workers of the world. Insistently they demand an end to imperialist interference in the affairs of Portugal and unrestricted respect for the right of its people to go ahead with the revolutionary changes it has begun.\n119.\tThe consistent policy of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in favor of peace and the elimination of international tension have resulted in important achievements that are above all reflected in the successful conclusion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Its persistence in such endeavors and the sustained struggle of the peoples of the world to tie the hands of the imperialist aggressors may well lead to a situation in which peace and detente acquire a universal and lasting character. The proposal for the conclusion of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests [A! 10241, annex] as well as the proposal for the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons [A/10243, annex], submitted to this Assembly by Comrade Andrei Gromyko, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, confirm yet again the peaceful will of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and its sincere and effective contribution to positive action by the United Nations. These proposals must be given due attention by the Assembly.\n120.\tThe peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean are increasing their action designed to consolidate their national independence, to lead to the recovery of their natural resources and to help them play their rightful part in international life. The efforts of Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Panama, Jamaica, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and other countries in this respect are well known. The Revolutionary Government of Cuba again expresses its support for such actions.\n121.\tThe constitution of the Latin American economic system, the Multinational Caribbean Shipping Company and the joint protection of the price of coffee, sugar and bananas are expressions of a new regional awareness foretelling the advent of a not-too- distant era in which Latin America will unite to form the community conceived by Simon Bolivar and Jose Marti which the realities of the present-day world are turning into a necessary goal. The historic task of Latin America will not be easy. It boils down to conquering its second independence. Its attainment, as far as the immediate future is concerned, calls for the total liquidation of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations and the defeat of the aggressive purposes of reaction and fascism. That is why the nationalist action of Latin America and the Caribbean must place in the forefront solidarity with Panama in its struggle for full exercise of its sovereignty over the Canal and the Canal Zone, firm support for the independence of Puerto Rico and support for the antiFascist resistance of the Chilean people. Panama, Puerto Rico and Chile will serve as a measure of the degree of true solidarity of the world with the emancipating cause of our continent. Support for the Panamanian, Puerto Rican and Chilean peoples in their struggle for freedom is the key that will open the door to new progressive and liberating changes in that part of the world.\n122.\tPanama's entry into the non-aligned Movement and the support of the Latin American group for its aspiration to become a member of the Security Council are signs of growing international support for the just demands of its people and Government.\n123.\tThe General Assembly must give highest priority to consideration of the situation in Chile. It is no longer merely a question of claiming human rights and alleviating the drama that torments the people of Chile. The institution of fascism in Chile, as we have said from the very beginning and as events bear out today, is part of an offensive by the most retrograde forces directed not only, against the peoples of Latin America but also against their brothers in Africa and Asia who are fighting against imperialism, colonialism and racism.\n124.\tLatin American fascism is the natural ally of racism and colonialism. It is in fact at their service. It seeks to act as a wedge that will break the necessary solidarity between the peoples of the three continents. The struggle against it, therefore, becomes of primary importance for all the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Were there no such colonial fascism, Mr. Vorster could not travel around South America; the South African Davis Cup team could not compete unconcernedly in Santiago, nor could the partisans and supporters of apartheid indulge in wild propaganda in favor of their hateful policy from a number of capitals in the southern tip of South America. Therefore the Foreign Ministers of the non- aligned countries, meeting at Lima last August, rightly declared:\n\\\"The Conference took note with concern of the recent visit of the head of the racist regime of South Africa to Uruguay and Paraguay, as well as of the increasing relations of other Governments of Latin America, particularly the Chilean Government, with the South African regime.\\\" [AI10217 and Corr.l, annex, para. 37.]\n125.\tThe case of Chile is still the subject of unanimous concern. Engendered by the most repugnant treason and violence and conceived as a means of reversing the democratic and liberating process undertaken by the Government of President Allende, the Fascist regime makes a mockery of all humanitarian principles, continues its crimes and outrages against the Chilean people and challenges the voices of, protest that are raised in all sectors of democratic world opinion. Not a single international conference of note has been held in the past year that has failed to express its most categorical repudiation of the atrocities committed by the Pinochet junta or that has not called for the termination of his hateful policy of repression and the betrayal of national interests. To bear this out, we have the agreements of the International Labour Conference, the Dakar Conference of the developing countries, the World Conference of the International Women's Year, the Fifth Ministerial Conference of the Non-Aligned Countries, the recent meeting of the Governing Board of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and many other gatherings of a governmental or non-governmental character.\n126.\tLast year the General Assembly gave its President and the Secretary-General a mandate in connexion with the protection of human rights in Chile [resolution 3219 (XXIX)). The efforts deployed by both which we appreciate have proved fruitless. The Commission on Human Rights set up an ad hoc working group to submit a report and visit Chile. Initially, the Fascist authorities supported the decision of the Commission and declared, like demagogues, that they would welcome the members of the Working Group. At the eleventh hour, when its members were about to board a plane for Santiago, they cancelled the authorization for the journey. By refusing the visit of the Working Group, the Fascist junta gave proof of what is was uselessly attempting to deny and it did so, moreover, with the shamefacedness and contempt for the international community which have become a rule of conduct of a regime which today represents, to a degree only matched by its South African allies and mentors, a stigma of our times.\n127.\tIt is up to the General Assembly at its current session to give the insolence of the Pinochet regime the response it deserves. Solidarity with the antiFascist resistance of the Chilean people must be expanded and strengthened until we can put a stop to the activities of the clique which now oppresses them. We are convinced that the General Assembly will know how to do its duty.\n128.\tIt is increasingly clear that the case of Puerto Rico is evidence of the attitude that is today being maintained with regard to colonialism. In spite of the great obstacles it has had to confront, despite imperialist plans to absorb it and annihilate it as a nation, Puerto Rico is an admirable example of national resistance. Its people, which for over three quarters of a century has resisted foreign occupation, is deserving of the firmest and clearest international solidarity. Such solidarity was given unequivocable expression at the recent international Conference of Solidarity with the Independence of Puerto Rico held at Havana barely a month ago,\n129. By resorting to incorrect procedure the Government of the United States was able this year to postpone the debate on the question of Puerto Rico in the\nSpecial Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Those who are opposed to colonialism must considerably increase their solidarity with the independence of Puerto Rico. Cuba will continue to do so unrelentingly, in support of the revolutionary principles governing its international policy and because of its affectionate friendship with the people of Puerto Rico, which has been united with the people of Cuba by over a century of common struggle against the same enemies and under twin flags.\n130.\tOur solidarity with Puerto Rico is not a question of tactical expediency or a negotiable article. It is an unalterable expression of our policy of principle and is prompted by the same spirit instilled in our people by the farsightedness and generosity of Jose Marti. It is sustained by the blood shed by hundreds of Puerto Rican patriots who fought and died on Cuban soil for ou r common freedom. Some official spokesmen of the Government of the United States have declared that the North American authorities would make the raising of the illegal economic and trade blockade against Cuba conditional upon the attitude of Cuba towards the independence of Puerto Rico. The Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba, Commander Fidel Castro, in a speech on 28 September last, gave to such statements the response they deserved. With the unanimous support of our people, Comrade Fidel Castro affirmed the following:\n\\\"We must all know first, we ourselves and secondly, our adversaries that independently of Cuba's economic interests, independently of our foreign policy based on the principles of Marxism and Leninism and on the principles of peaceful co-existence with other States and on mutually beneficial relations with other States a policy which serves the interests of our State and our people- there can never be any improvement in relations with Cuba that is based on the renunciation of a single one of our fundamental principles.\n\\\"Our people, from the point of view of its economic development, needs the broadest trade and technological relations with all countries, without exception; but our country is even more interested in the purity of its principles and its international conduct. If this is not understood or accepted, we shall have all the patience needed. We shall wait and be blockaded with dignity as long as it is necessary to be blockaded. We shall move forward at a faster or slower pace and we shall make more or fewer sacrifices. But our clean banners, the dignity and principles of this country, can never be negotiated.\\\"\n131.\tThe past year has been for the Cuban people a year of great and continued victories, in spite of the persistent imperialist blockade, and we have continued to build socialism. In the field of agriculture, education, construction and public health Cuba's successes are still an example to other countries of Latin America.\n132.\tNext year the Cuban people will put into effect the socialist constitution, which has been discussed broadly and in depth in thousands of assemblies throughout the country, and will establish the organs of people's power. The Cuban revolution will thus be entering a new stage resulting from its definitive consolidation and the guarantee of its irreversible historic continuity.\n133.\tCuba's international position becomes stronger with each passing day; its ties of friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are being strengthened. Its participation in the non-aligned movement is growing, as shown by the recent decision of the ministerial Conference held at Lima to recommend that the sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of those countries be held in Havana. Its solid links with the peoples of Latin America, which the imperialist blockade has never destroyed, are being renewed and strengthened.\n134.\tAt the end of this year our people will hold the most decisive and important meeting of this period  the first congress of the Cuban Communist Party. Our people are preparing for it enthusiastically and in all confidence. The Cuban Communist Party is the heir to and continues the age-old struggle of our people, the organized vanguard of our revolution. Born of the combative union of all Cuban revolutionaries under the supreme direction of comrade Fidel Castro, the Cuban Communist Party represents today the profound aspirations of our people to peace, independence and justice, which in the past century were grouped around the Cuban Revolutionary Party of Jose Marti.\n135.\tWhen they meet next December to assess the progress achieved and make plans for new tasks, Cuban communists will be able to do so with profound revolutionary satisfaction. The road they have traveled has been long and arduous. Victories and defeats were met along the way, which led to bloodshed and pain, but also hope for the uninterrupted march of our people towards its liberation. Many freedom fighters died before they could get a glimpse of the shining future for which they gave their lives. There were countless sacrifices, and exploits and daily anonymous agony, which ended in victory in January 1959 and led to the conquest of independence and the possibility of establishing socialism.\n136.\tThe future, like the present, is not exempt from difficulties which will lead to new action by the Cuban people. To raise the socialist society at the entrance to the Caribbean Sea, under the conditions imposed by the blockade and imperialist hostility, in a developing country poor in natural resources and with an economy almost entirely dependent on agriculture, while firmly maintaining and upholding the high principles of internationalism and revolutionary solidarity, will always be the heroic goal of our historic dimension.\n137.\tOur people will do this. Its unalterable revolutionary will is entrenched in such deeds and sacrifices of several generations of Cubans who for more than a century suffered death with dignity rather than lower their glorious flag. It is inspired by the supreme ideal of creating a new society, for ever free from all forms of exploitation by human beings. It is inspired by the immortal example of Ernesto Guevara, who, on a day such as this, left in the heartland of America his unforgettable message, which calls on the peoples of the continent to resist and fight.\n138.\tOnward to victory!\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "33.\t Mr. President, it is with pleasure that I join the many representatives who have spoken before me in congratulating you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. You bring to this high office qualities of integrity, intellect and experience which have already carried you to the summit of political responsibility in your own country as well as on the wider European stage. The General Assembly is indeed fortunate that its leader for the coming 12 months will be a statesman deeply loyal to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n34.\tThe annual general debates at the General Assembly provide an occasion for a survey of the working of the international system during the preceding year, and for the public expression of the hopes and fears, the expectations and anxieties, of the Governments representing almost the totality of the population of the world. The present debate seems to me an appropriate opportunity to go a little further to look back at the 30 years of the life of the United Nations, and to try to appraise its achievements against the standards set by the founders of the Organization when they adopted the Charter in San Francisco on 26 June 1945.\n35.\tThe United Nations was born amidst the ruin and devastation of the most terrible war experienced in the recorded history of mankind, a holocaust in' which tens of millions of men, women and children lost their lives, among them one third of the Jewish people. Its primary purposes, therefore, were to save succeeding generations from similar catastrophe and to build a better society in which fundamental human rights, equal justice before the law and economic and social advancement would be universally assured.\n36 As is inevitable in human affairs, the record is uneven The most spectacular achievement of this period is unquestionably the virtual disappearance of the classic colonial system. More than half of the present Members of the United Nations, including Israel were colonial dependencies before 1945; four Cape Verde, Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe, and Papua New Guinea achieved independence in 1975 and have been or are being admitted to membership at this session. On behalf of the people and the Government of Israel, I am happy to wish them well.\n37.\tThe United Nations system, through the United Nations Development program and its forerunners and through the specialized agencies, has also registered noteworthy achievements in many branches of economic development, in agriculture, health, labor, transport and other practical fields. The new impetus in the development and codification of international law would hardly have been possible outside the United Nations framework; while the financial and economic organs of the United Nations family, among which one might include the recent seventh special session of the General Assembly which may well presage a new era of international economic co-operation, have become almost indispensable for the proper conduct of the world's business. Those are all positive contributions to the welfare of mankind, even though it is clear that there is still a long way to go.\n38.\tThis is unfortunately not the case in other areas. The United Nations has manifestly not saved this generation from the scourge of war. The graves of the millions of victims of armed conflicts in Asia, in Africa, in the Middle East and even in Europe bear anguished testimony to this massive failure; while the lofty sentiments and exhortations of a multitude of conventions, declarations and resolutions have had little impact on the flagrant abuse of fundamental human rights and freedoms in vast areas of the globe.\n39.\tIt is common form to claim that the fault does not lie in the United Nations system, but in its Members; that the world Organization merely reflects the frailties, the stupidities, the lethargy and the evils of the world itself. This is, of course, true, but it is equally true that a system that encourages contention rather than compromise, extremism rather than tolerance and confrontation rather than negotiation is hardly suited to a world as diverse in race, religion, tradition, geographical circumstances, and social and political practices as is ours.\n40.\tThe experience of Israel is a valid example. We belong to no bloc and no alliance. We can count on little support in this Assembly, not because our cause is unjust, not because our views do not meet with sympathy, but because of considerations of unprincipled expediency. We are assaulted every year in language so venomous and vile as to defy all canons of civilized behavior. In Assembly session after Assembly session in recent years, in conference after conference, resolutions are adopted by automatic majorities, demanding that we submit to this abusive tyranny, that we, in effect, dismantle our State, and that we commit national suicide. No regard whatsoever is paid in these resolutions to truth or to reality.\n41.\tIsrael is a democratic State, where, in accordance with our ancient tradition, all individuals and communities enjoy equality before the law and the plenitude of their human rights; yet a resolution of a United Nations body will assert the very opposite as an incontrovertible fact and condemn Israel on the basis of that falsehood.\n42.\tWhen a World Health Organization expert finds that the medical services provided for the population in the territories under Israeli administration since 1967 are as good as those of any other civilized country and that the people are healthy, a resolution of the General Conference of that specialized agency will declare that they are ridden with disease and bereft of medical attention. When a certified lunatic, not a Jew and a foreigner to boot, sets fire to part of a mosque in Jerusalem, a resolution of the Security Council condemns Israel for the deliberate desecration of that Holy Place. When highly qualified United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization experts establish that Israeli archaeological research in Jerusalem represents a notable contribution to the cultural heritage of mankind, including that of a glorious period of Islamic history, does not contravene the applicable international law and does not endanger other monuments and sites, resolutions adopted by that organization simply ignore those findings and for good measure add sanctions to the routine condemnation. And when Israel, rightly and inevitably, refuses to take notice of these fantasies, as any other Member State would do in its place, it is once again condemned for being awkward and recalcitrant and for flouting the will of the international community.\n43.\tSurely there is something seriously wrong with a United Nations system which is so easily subverted for political blackmail; which, instead of being a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of the objectives of the Charter, has become a propaganda battlefield; and where abuse and not reason has become the language of debate. It is surely not beyond the wit of man to arrest this hypocritical and dangerous course before it is too late.\n44.\tIn the course of my address to the General Assembly last year, I dwelt on the positive features of the separation of forces agreements which had been concluded earlier that year between Israel and Egypt and Israel and Syria in the wake of the Yom Kippur war of October 1973.1 I expressed the view that those two agreements represented the first steps, small and hesitant though they may have been, away from the triple negatives adopted by the Conference of Arab Heads of State or Government, held at Khartoum, on 1 September 1967: no peace with Israel, no recognition, no negotiations.\n45.\tThose who sincerely seek peace in the Middle East will surely find cause for satisfaction in the new agreement between Egypt and Israel which was negotiated through the good offices of the President and the Secretary of State of the United States and concluded in Geneva last week. That agreement marks an important step forward. It has much greater political significance than its predecessor.\n46.\tI should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to some of the major provisions of this agreement:\n\\\"The Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Government of Israel have agreed that:\n\\\"The conflict between them and in the Middle East shall not be resolved by military force but by\npeaceful means. \n\\\"The parties hereby undertake not to resort to the threat or use of force or military blockade against each other. 11\n\\\"This agreement is regarded by the parties as a significant step toward a just and lasting peace. It is not a final peace agreement.\n\\\"The parties shall continue their efforts to negotiate a final peace agreement within the framework of the Geneva Peace Conference in accordance with Security Council resolution 338 (1973).\n\\\"This agreement shall enter into force upon signature of the protocol and remain in force until superseded by a new agreement.\\\"\n47.\tThe significance of the agreement does not lie only in the pledge of the parties to continue to observe the cease-fire and to refrain from all military or paramilitary action, or in their undertaking not to resort to the threat or use of force or military blockade, or in their recognition of the essential role of the United Nations Emergency Force and the necessity that it continue its functions, or in the provision concerning the passage of non-military cargoes to and from Israel through the Suez Canal, or even in the renunciation of war as a means to settle the differences between them; rather its significance lies in the belief that it opens a new chapter in the relations between the two countries. Israel for its part will do all it can to ensure that this new chapter will indeed be one of peace. And beyond that we hope that this agreement will pave the way to better relations and peace with all our neighbors.\n48.\tIt is a proper opportunity to stress here that the agreement, in all its particulars, was concluded, in response to the free will of two sovereign States. If Egypt and Israel consider that the agreement is advantageous to them and, moreover, it is a step not directed against any other party nobody in this General Assembly has the right to censure it or to set himself up as an arbiter of the interests of the parties directly concerned.\n49.\tAs I have already stated, both parties to the agreement have recognized the essential role played by the United Nations Emergency Force and I wish to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the officers and men of the Force, who are performing a difficult and delicate task in an exemplary manner; to Lieutenant General Ensio Siilasvuo, who has been identified with the peace-keeping efforts of the United Nations in the Middle East for many years and who has gained the respect and regard of all parties; and to the Secretary-General, who is ultimately responsible for this successful United Nations enterprise. I wish to include in this tribute the commanders, officers and men of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, who also play an important role in the area, and to the Governments which have contributed their personnel to all three United Nations forces.\n50.\tAs far as we are concerned, the new agreement is not an end, but the beginning of a process of peacemaking. We do not delude ourselves that this will be a simple undertaking, for the making of peace after\nso many years of hostility and \nsuspicion will call for qualities of moral courage, understanding and tenacity far greater than those needed for the waging of war But the beginning must be made-for the sake of this generation and for the sake of the Israeli and Arab children who were surely born to live and create and not to die on the battlefield.\n51.\tSecurity Council resolution 338 (1973) calls for \\\"negotiations . . . between the parties concerned aimed at establishing a just and durable peace in 'the Middle East\\\". From this rostrum I declare that Israel is ready to enter into such negotiations with each and every one of the neighboring States. I note with regret repeated statements made by the leaders of Syria which reject the whole concept of a genuine peace treaty with Israel. Nevertheless, I should like to hope that this is not their last word. And for our part I solemnly reiterate that the Government of Israel is ready and willing to enter into peace negotiations with Syria without prior conditions, as called for by Security Council resolution 338 (1973), at any place and at any time.\n52.\tIn this connexion I wish to emphasize that as far as Israel is concerned the Geneva Peace Conference can be reconvened whenever the parties are ready for it, following adequate preparation. Moreover, in principle, Israel is in favor of any mechanism which will advance the process of negotiation between the parties to the conflict. It will therefore give the idea put forward by the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Kissinger, for an informal multilateral consultation most earnest consideration.\n53.\tAs I emphasized in my statement at the General Assembly last year, it is self-evident that genuine peace in the Middle East must include a just and constructive solution for the Palestine Arab problem, Israel is fully alive to this problem, probably more so than the majority of those who pronounce freely upon it, and we do not require persuasion of the need to solve it peacefully and honorably. Indeed we insist that this be done. For far too long now the Palestinian Arabs have been used as a pawn on the chess-board of inter-Arab politics; throughout the years they have been the victims of Arab extremism. The solution to their problem therefore demands a change of attitude in the Arab world. The Palestine Arab problem should and can be solved in the context of a peace agreement between Israel and Jordan, which constitutes the major part of the area of historic Palestine on both sides of the river as well as being the homeland of the great majority of the Palestine Arabs.\n54.\tThus if the matter at issue is a fair and constructive solution for the problem of Palestine Arab identity. Israel's response is emphatically positive. But it is categorically negative about the absurd pretensions of the so-called Palestine Liberation Organization to speak in the name of the Palestine Arabs. This congeries of feuding terrorist gangs, whose principal victims are the Arabs of Palestine themselves and whose primary aim is the annihilation of the State of Israel and the genocide of its people, is neither a valid representative of the Palestine Arab community nor a valid interlocutor for Israel.\n55.\tIt should cause no surprise that at the spearhead of the frenzied efforts of the extreme regimes in the Arab world to prevent a political settlement of\nthe Middle East dispute, and to disrupt the recent agreement between Egypt and Israel, is precisely the PLO.\n56.\tThere is nothing more fraudulent than the scheme of this faction to establish, naturally on the ruins of Israel, a so-called democratic secular State in which Moslems, Christians and Jews would, as it were, live in amity and equality. This facile slogan, this transparent propaganda gimmick, has somehow found support among naive and well-meaning people. What is the pattern which the progenitors and supporters of this idea propose to follow? For lack of anything more promising they themselves have put forward the example of Lebanon: Lebanon, which since April of this year has been torn apart by a vicious, sectarian civil war between its Moslem and Christian communities. The latest published estimate of the casualties during these past six months is more than 5,000 killed and nearly 18,000 injured. The material damage is estimated at $2,500 million. The PLO knows what it means when it talks about the democratic and secular State of Palestine. So do we. We have only to look at the more than 800,000 Jews who have left, or have been driven out of, the Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa since 1948, or at the tortured existence of the 4,500-odd Jewish hostages left in Syria today, to know what the fate of the Jews of Israel would be if the PLO nightmare were realized. But we know and they know that this will never be.\n57.\tIt is one of the anomalies of our times that Israel, which is rigorously excluded from the Middle East region in all that concerns the civilian pursuits of the United Nations and its specialized agencies such as health, education, meteorology, trade and civil aviation is emphatically held to be a part of the Middle East region when the discussion turns to military matters, including the supply of arms. If one were cynical one might almost suspect that the reason, in both cases, is to weaken Israel in one case by boycott, and in the other by depriving it of the means of defense.\n58.\tBe that as it may, the problem of arms control in the Middle East is real and urgent. The area is being swamped by a flood of new and sophisticated military hardware, such as it has never known in all its long history. Each month that passes raises the level of technology, and the price. Tens of billions of dollars which might otherwise be spent on economic and social development and it must be realized that the population of large parts of the Middle East is among the poorest in the world are drained off to pay for these instruments of human destruction.\n59.\tIsrael is forced to take part in this senseless competition because, given the circumstances in the area, if it did not it would invite immediate aggression. But Israel is ready at any time, even before peace is made, to consult with its neighbors on measures to limit the arms race, with all its dangerous consequences, without materially affecting the relative defensive capacity of any of the parties to the consultation.\n60.\tIsrael supports the proposal for a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East and will be ready to enter into negotiations with all States concerned in order to attain that objective. By negotiations we mean a process of\nintergovernmental consultation similar to that which preceded the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) and other international instruments of like character. We do not think that so grave a matter can be settled by correspondence through the Secretary-General.\n61.\tIsrael welcomes the signature of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which gave formal expression to the spirit of detente. Only the future will tell if this instrument will serve as a guide for the conduct of the nations in the years to come, or whether it will remain a compilation of pious hopes, like so many international instruments which have been adopted since the end of the Second World War.\n62.\tIn this connexion we have of course noted the following passage in the address of the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union to this Assembly on 23 September: \\\"Assessing highly the results of the Conference, the Soviet Union believes that the main task now is to translate the understandings reached into deeds . . .\\\". [2357th meeting, para. 128.]\n63.\tAs far as Israel is concerned, we have two criteria for judgment: one, that detente must apply to the Middle East no less than to Europe and to other areas of the world and so far we have seen no evidence of this; two, that the humanitarian provisions of the Final Act signed at Helsinki must be scrupulously applied. The United Kingdom Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Wilson, expressed this eloquently in his address to the Conference in these words:\n\\\"Our work here will be judged not only by the spirit of 'live and let live' which this Conference asserts. It will be judged by how that spirit is reflected in the lives of ordinary families, by such issues as the reunification of families ... I hope that what we have each today committed ourselves to within Europe can apply also to those within our countries who want to go to start a new life outside Europe, whether in the Middle East or elsewhere.\\\"\n64.\tNone of the noble provisions of the Final Act have yet been applied to the Jewish national minority in the Soviet Union. For them the Helsinki agreement is still a piece of paper, and detente is still far over the horizon. I hope that the Soviet Union will live up to the spirit of this historic agreement and will enable the Jews who aspire to be reunited with their brethren in their ancient homeland to do so without hindrance. For us this is the touchstone.\n65.\tFinally, in addressing the General Assembly I cannot ignore a grave development which affects the Jewish people wherever they may be. This is the mounting of a despicable attack on Zionism by associating it with abhorrent political concepts.\n66.\tLet me state categorically that anti-Zionism is but a euphemism for anti-Semitism. Subscribing to a resolution condemning Zionism means an endorsement of anti-Semitism and the legitimization of aggression against Israel. Let me state with equal emphasis that, on this the thirtieth anniversary of the liberation of the survivors of the gas chambers and the concentration camps, the Jewish people will not tolerate a revival of the cancer of anti-Semitism. One cannot\nhere escape a tragic reflection how many of the 6 million victims of the Nazis would be alive today if it had been given to the Zionist movement to create the State of Israel before that catastrophe?\n67.\tIt is painful to me to see a group of nations, many of which were recently liberated from colonial rule, deriding one of the most noble liberation movements in this century a movement which not only gave an example of encouragement and determination to the peoples struggling for independence but also actively aided many of them during their period of preparation for independence and immediately thereafter.\n68.\tWhat is the essence of Zionism? Zionism, in a nutshell, is the modern expression of the ancient Jewish heritage. Zionism is the national liberation movement of a people exiled from its historic homeland and dispersed among the nations of the world. Zionism is the redemption of an ancient nation from a tragic lot and the redemption of a land neglected for centuries. Zionism is the revival of an ancient language and culture, in which the vision of universal peace has been a central theme. Zionism is the embodiment of a unique pioneering spirit, of the dignity of labor and of enduring human values. Zionism means creating a society, however imperfect it may still be, which tries to implement the highest ideals of democracy political, social and cultural for all the inhabitants of Israel, irrespective of religious belief, race or sex. Zionism is, in sum, the constant and unrelenting effort to realize the national and universal vision of the prophets of Israel.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": " It is a particular pleasure for me to begin my statement by extending to Mr. Thorn, on behalf of the Government of El Salvador and of my delegation, and on my own behalf, our warmest congratulations for having been unanimously elected to serve as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. His broad intellectual capabilities and his brilliant political and diplomatic career are a guarantee that the duties entrusted to this important forum will be carried out successfully.\n251.\tIt is also a pleasure for me to take this opportunity to express a well-earned acknowledgment to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Mr. Abdel-aziz Bouteflika, for the obvious achievements made in his difficult task of presiding over the General Assembly at its previous session, during which he demonstrated his outstanding talent for leadership and his undeniable devotion to peace and progress.\n252.\tIt is a particular satisfaction for El Salvador to express its warmest greetings to the States of Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and Mozambique upon their admission to the United Nations, which will contribute to the strengthening of the Organization, for one of its aims is to become a forum of true universality.\n253.\tThis session marks 30 years of work in the United Nations. This event is an excellent opportunity to analyze the results of the difficult tasks it has accomplished. The world has changed so much during these 30 years that it is fitting to adapt the Charter of the United Nations to new realities and to reorganize and perfect available instruments with a view to translating into fact the principles of coexistence and co-operation as they have developed over 30 years. On the other hand, the promising results of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly, devoted to the establishment of a new international economic order, should be given priority in this stage of turning theory into practice and aims into action.\n254.\tThis anniversary should promote the desire of Member countries to widen the search for formulas capable of solving the serious problems affecting the world community.\n255.\tIn recent years the statements made by the delegation of El Salvador in the Assembly have been primarily devoted to expressing the country's position with regard to the major topics before the Assembly for discussion.\n256.\tThis time, in view of the present political detente and the persistent world economic crisis, we should like to take a general approach and to appeal to the spirit of co-operation that must prevail in order for understanding among peoples and regions to be effective, and to make it possible to deal with today's problems.\n257.\tThe present world political pattern is characterized by increased efforts to achieve peace and development. This can be seen in the degree of understanding among the great Powers, which has surely made it possible to achieve a rather high measure of harmony in international political life.\n258.\tThis rapprochement among the great Powers is in the interest of all the peoples of the world, Therefore, we must all combine our efforts to ensure the maintenance of this understanding and respect and to remove from international relations those factors of conflict which can at any given time provoke a world conflagration. The continuation of the struggle against colonialism, neo-colonialism and the various forms of discrimination and exploitation which still persist as centers of international friction is therefore of singular importance. This struggle will persist as long as oppressive forms of domination continue to exist, because an essential part of man is his adherence to the ideals of liberty, justice and respect of his own dignity.\n259.\tWe were pleased to see the action taken by the third world countries and, in particular, that of the group of non-aligned countries, to secure these values. Also, we should like to emphasize the important role that the United Nations has played with the same end in view.\n260.\tWith regard to the socio-economic crisis, we should like to indicate that the increasing requests of the developing countries have finally been sympathetically received, as can be seen from the important statements made by the representatives of highly developed countries. We welcome with satisfaction the submission of new formulas for international co-operation, and in view of those new possibilities I will merely say that El Salvador is ready to participate in the proposed systems of co-operation, as long as they are based on equity, sovereign equality, inter-dependence and common interest.\n261.\tUnderstanding and co-operation founded on a fair basis will make possible higher standards of living in developing countries and a better life in the developed countries. They are therefore mutually beneficial.\n262.\tThe real implementation of those new formulas might contribute to lessening the gap between the developed and the developing countries and to improving the inhuman living conditions now endured by millions of human beings. None the less, if words are not translated into deeds, the scourge of hunger, which now looms over so many countries, either frequently or continuously, may reach even the doors of those nations which at present consider themselves free of that threat.\n263.\tEl Salvador is one of the countries most seriously affected by the present world economic crisis, It would be absurd to deny that. However, we are working to overcome our difficulties with the means \navailable to us, despite the fact that sometimes the resources available limit our efforts.\n264.\tEl Salvador therefore believes that, without the support of international co-operation and a substantial improvement in the terms of trade, it will be impossible to achieve the proposed goals. That is why my Government views with satisfaction the acceptance by the highly developed countries of the idea of establishing a new system of international economic relations. The results of the seventh special session and the machinery for co-operation and dialog mentioned in its declarations give us good hope that the measures recommended will be implemented.\n265.\tThis is a historic moment, when international detente, the economic crisis and political will expressed in formulas of co-operation must lead to the strengthening of peace and development. This moment must not be allowed to slip by. All are in duty bound to participate, in a spirit of solidarity, in this international co-operation in order to ensure for all the technological and capital resources that are lacking.\n266.\tThat would make possible for both the industrialized countries and countries of the third world to continue along the path of economic and social development in accordance with the particular circumstances of each nation, following the road freely chosen in exercise of their own sovereignty.\n267.\tThis international effort must accordingly be part of an integral long-term Program, since improvisation and the adoption of isolated short- term measures will lead to distortions, and to a senseless waste of efforts and goodwill. In this necessary long-range planning the United Nations must play a primary role, thereby achieving harmony between the universal approach and the domestic political guidelines of the various countries.\n268.\tWithin the broad Program of co-operation appropriate attention should be given to the agricultural needs and to food for the planet, with special consideration for the serious problems of the developing countries. Accordingly, there should be still further change in the present structure of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to encourage it to act as the co-ordinating agency for a more dynamic and genuine international co-operation in its own sphere of competence within the framework of the new international economic order.\n269.\tAnother aspect to which we attach particular importance is the use of financial surpluses and, in broader terms, to the increasing world wealth.\n270.\tWe believe that financial surpluses accumulated by a few States should be placed in credit Programs to make it possible for the majority of countries to overcome the obstacles which have impeded their economic growth.\n271.\tIt is important that there should be a study on redistributing the world's wealth, because some countries have achieved levels of capital growth which they are unable to use in domestic development Programs.\n272.\tIt would therefore be mutually advantageous to establish a system to redistribute world income by establishing fair terms of trade and making the financial surpluses available to the under-developed countries. The Program should include access to markets in industrialized countries. Here serious thought should be given to a rational, international division of labor and, therefore, complementarity between regions, so that each country may produce efficiently the items it is best equipped to produce.\n273.\tAnother important proposal which we also support is for the establishment of a financial fund to help meet the need of the developing countries to maintain reserves to stabilize the prices of their major export products.\n274.\tA suitable formula for co-operation and the co-ordination of economic policies has been found in the establishment of regional bodies which carry out multinational Programs, designed to make possible the better utilization of the natural and technological resources of Member countries, and to plan machinery for integration and mutual development. Such bodies should, of course, take into account the specific characteristics of the relatively least economically developed countries, so that they may be given favorable treatment and can thus, by means of their participation in those bodies, improve their economic conditions. That is why El Salvador has given firm support to the initiative for the establishment of a Latin American Economic System in the spirit of the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)] and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)].\n275.\tThe establishment of a new juridical order for the seas is of vital importance to the future of mankind. Thus, it would surely be regarded as one of the greatest examples of international co-operation ever seen. The designation of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the national jurisdiction of States as the common heritage of mankind, together with the establishment of a world authority to administer that zone for the benefit of all the peoples of the planet, would be one of the greatest legacies that this generation could leave to succeeding generations.\n276.\tAnother advance which we wish to mention is the recognition by the great majority of States of an adjacent zone of the sea of 200 marine miles, as a zone over which the jurisdiction of the coastal State would extend, and over which it would exercise sovereign rights in the exploitation of renewable and non-renewable natural resources found there. We believe that the reaching of such an agreement, regardless of the name given to the zone, would facilitate agreement on the other points. The signing and successful implementation of the Convention on the Law of the Sea would be the most important juridical event of our era and its tremendous impact on peace and the well- being of mankind would be beyond imagination.\n277.\tTherefore all the countries involved in this difficult negotiation must bend their efforts for the common good and the general interest so that this great undertaking is brought to a successful conclusion.\n278.\tMy Government would like to emphasize the fact that some regions are not sufficiently represented in the executive posts in the specialized agencies of the United Nations family. That is because the principle of equitable geographical distribution has not been sufficiently recognized or implemented. Respect for that principle is necessary to maintain a fair balance in the world Organization's structure. Disregard of that principle runs counter to the right held by the different regions of the world to participate, on an equal footing, in the high administrative posts of the specialized agencies and, therefore, restricts their impact and their participation in studying and solving the most important international problems. Therefore, we appeal to all Members of the United Nations to give full support to this principle which is so important for the maintenance of harmony and a fair balance within this Organization.\n279.\tThe positions and views expressed by my country today are a reflection of our determination to participate dynamically and effectively in the world effort to achieve peace and progress. This is a crucial moment which may lead to an era of well-being if we give due support to international co-operation to complement the efforts of each nation to achieve its own development.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "95.\t  Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to extend to you, on behalf of my delegation, my sincere congratulations upon your election as President of the General Assembly at its thirtieth session. I am confident that our deliberations at this session will be brought to a successful conclusion under your wisdom and experience.\n96.\tI should also like, on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to express our appreciation for the sincere efforts and wise leadership displayed by your predecessor, the Minister for\nForeign Affairs of Algeria, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in carrying out his responsibilities at both the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session.\n97.\tI should like to seize this opportunity to thank our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his unflagging efforts in the cause of international peace and security and in his pursuit of the aims and principles of this Organization.\n98.\tOn behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia I should like to associate myself with all those who preceded me in welcoming to our Organization the three new Member States, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and Mozambique. We welcome those three new Members and look forward to the time when we will be able to have both Angola and Papua New Guinea admitted as Members.\n99.\tThis session has a special significance due to the fact that 30 years have elapsed since the founding of the United Nations and its Charter which represents the aspirations of mankind, not only for peace and security, but also for economic and social development and prosperity within the framework of justice, equity and constructive co-operation.\n100.\tIf we were to cast a glance at our various achievements as an international community during the last three decades, we would find certain phenomena that deserve our scrutiny due to the nature of those phenomena which are complex and which give cause for both optimism and caution at the same time.\n101.\tThere is no doubt that the international community welcomes the process of detente between the major Powers which lessons international tensions while banishing the ghost of war and strengthens universal peace. But while we look forward to the day when that spirit of detente will be further promoted to that of entente between States, we hope at the same time that the small and developing countries which form the majority in our Organization will benefit from this development and that it will not be detrimental to the cause of their liberty, national rights and legitimate aspirations.\n102.\tWhile detente has a tangible effect in strengthening peace, still further efforts are needed to strengthen international security because it is contingent upon political and economic factors which together are interdependent and interrelated.\n103.\tI am confident that the contributions and achievements of the developed countries in industry, science and technology during the twentieth century are capable of solving the economic problems confronting the world today if there is genuine goodwill and if human values and ideals are adhered to in such a way as to bring about co-operation and solidarity between peoples devoid of selfishness. It is on such values and with such ideals that we can base our international economies to bring prosperity to all countries, whether developed or developing, whether large or small.\n104.\tThe results of our deliberations during the seventh special session have proved that there exists a large measure of agreement on many of the subjects discussed. While my delegation wishes to express its satisfaction with these results, we consider them merely a basis of sound principles for further efforts\nto achieve justice and economic security in the international community. We look forward with optimism to future meetings which we hope will provide us with a strong foundation on which to implement these principles and build a new international economic order. That can be achieved only through co-operation and not through futile confrontation or fruitless\nrecrimination.\n105.\tThe developing countries are looking forward to the first conference called for by the President of France, to be held in Paris next month and we wish to thank him for his initiative and hope that the same spirit of good will and co-operation will prevail at that conference as was manifested during the seventh special session.\n106.\tThere is no need for me to recall the position adopted by the oil-producing countries, which was made clear during the Conference of the Heads of State of the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries [OPEC], who met at Algiers at the beginning of this year and which culminated in highlighting the readiness of the OPEC States to assume their international responsibilities and to display their willingness to contribute towards a just international economic co-operation.\n107.\tI must stress here that justice and co-operation are a sound basis for progress. Without co-operation and justice it may be impossible to find solutions to the economic problems which beset our world today. It is to the benefit of all that we should find appropriate solutions to those economic problems so that we may give our undivided attention to the other problems that will confront mankind in the not-too-distant future, such as the exhaustion of natural resources, environmental problems, the population explosion, the abuse of science and technology and other problems.\n108.\tMany of the items on our agenda are not new to us. In fact, some of these items have been with us since the founding of the United Nations without our being able to solve them. It is our belief that the reason for this state of affairs is twofold: on the one hand we discuss these items without due regard to justice; and, on the other hand, we treat the symptoms rather than the cause.\n109.\tSince 1947, when the forces of Zionism combined with those of oppression and persecution to expel the Palestinian people from their homeland, the Middle East has not enjoyed a moment of peace. Since that date, our Organization, together with its specialized and other agencies, has not ceased to discuss the question of Palestine under different names and in various contexts. These discussions tended to neglect the core and the substance of the problem. The question was not discussed in its true context, which could have led to a sound solution. From 1952 to 1967 the United Nations dealt with this question within the framework of the question of the Palestinian refugees. This approach, in our opinion, is not the appropriate way in which the Palestinian question can be solved satisfactorily.\nHO. The question of the refugees and their relief is not the core and the substance of the problem. The question of Palestine is one of a people, a land and a country. It is a question of a people whose land has been usurped and which still suffers the consequences of aggression. Only when it is viewed in this light will our deliberations begin to take the right direction towards a just solution. The passage of 27 years did not transform the question of the Palestinian people into a question of refugees, as the forces of oppression and Zionism wanted it to do. The Palestinian people have a just right to their homeland and to self-determination.\n111.\tFor more than 27 years since the usurpation of the land of Palestine\u2014Israel has been committing aggression after aggression and crime after crime. It has been waging an endless war not only against the people and the land of Palestine but also against all Arab peoples, thereby challenging and disregarding this Organization and its Charter and defying the international community, and its human values and lofty ideals, and thus demonstrating that it is unworthy of belonging to this Organization.\n112.\tIsrael is an artificial Zionist entity which harbors no respect whatsoever for religions. It ceaselessly violates the Islamic Holy Places in Jerusalem in an effort to change the character of the city. Israel desecrates Islamic holy places, the most recent case being the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, which is stark testimony to what is taking place in all the occupied territories without the slightest consideration or inhibition as to the feelings of Moslems and all other believers in God all over the world. All this is in violation of, and with complete disregard for, United Nations resolutions.\n113.\tNeedless to say, any attempt at a settlement that does not lead to the liberation of Jerusalem and the removal of the consequences of aggression from the holy city and its Holy Places, and to its return to its rightful owners, the Arab inhabitants, is totally unacceptable,\n114.\tJerusalem and its holy places have a special significance in the heart and mind of every Arab, every Moslem and, indeed, every believer in God. If it is not liberated, no Arab or Moslem can be at peace with himself and his conscience, let alone be at peace with others. The return of Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty is the best guarantee for believers of all faiths and will safeguard their freedom of worship and preserve the sanctity of their holy places, while bringing peace to the area.\n115.\tIt is a step in the right direction and a source of optimism to place the question of Palestine in its right context on the agenda of the General Assembly, so that it may finally be discussed in its true perspective as a question of a people and of an occupied land. This gives us more hope for a just solution of the problem. The invitation extended? by the United Nations backed by the affirmative vote of 105 Member States to the rightful representatives of the Palestinian people to take part in the discussion of this problem in order to clarify its fundamental aspects is tantamount to a universal recognition of the importance of the question and of the risks surrounding it.\n116.\tOne of the consequences of the Palestine question is what is now known as the problem of the Middle East. Israel now occupies other Arab lands in Sinai, the Golan Heights, the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip. If Israel is left unchecked in its\ntotal disregard of United Nations resolutions, peace and security will never prevail in the area.\n117.\tNeedless to say, the removal of the consequences of aggression through Israel's complete withdrawal from all Arab territories is a prerequisite to peace. Full peace and normalization cannot be attained, however, except by responding to the aspirations of the people of Palestine, who remain the real victims.\n118.\tThis question, if viewed in its full dimensions, does not concern and affect the Palestinian people alone. Indeed, it has been taken upon the primary cause of the League of Arab States, the Islamic Conference, the Organization of African Unity, the non-aligned countries, and all peace-loving States that abhor racism, aggression and settler colonialism.\n119.\tThe Arab peoples, and first and foremost the Palestinian people, are peace-loving peoples longing to live in peace and security. However, peace must be based on justice. If peace is sincerely desired for the area, then we have to face facts with courage and take into account all factors that may lead to a just and equitable solution.\n120.\tIt is of no consequence whether this solution is reached step by step, or whether it is attained in Geneva or New York. The important thing is that such a solution should tackle the central issues and deal with the essence of the problem in its true dimensions.\n121.\tThe Palestinian people have a right to return to their homeland and property. They have as much right to self-determination as any other people. These rights of the Palestinian people are a humanitarian necessity, a political necessity and a prerequisite for a just and lasting peace.\n122.\tThe Palestinian people wish to live in peace and without fear. They wish to be peaceful, without being submissive, to build and not to destroy. The Palestinian people are capable of making peace and of accepting peace. However, peace can never be achieved by one party while the other party only talks of peace, while actively pursuing war and destruction.\n123.\tA healthy trend in today's world is the growing number of international organizations that bring together homogeneous communities bound to one another by special relationships which enable them to play a constructive role within the world community, in such a manner as to supplement the role and enhance the efficiency of the United Nations. In the past few years, the Islamic Conference was established, comprising 42 States Members of the United Nations bound together by ties of history, a common heritage and the Islamic faith, with its far-reaching spiritual values and lofty principles that are built on justice and brotherhood for all mankind, cooperation between peoples in the political, economic and social fields, and mutual responsibility for the welfare of all mankind.\n124.\tThe Islamic Conference has made notable and dynamic progress in dealing with various economic and political matters and has established financial, technical and other institutions. It is our hope, therefore, that this Assembly will decide to grant observer status to this organization during the present session.\n125.\tThe Islamic Conference, during its last session in July this year, discussed the persecution of Moslem communities in various parts of the world and decided to take all necessary measures to improve the lot of these communities and guarantee their welfare and just rights. It is our earnest hope that these communities will be given the opportunity to enjoy their full rights in a spirit of justice and equity.\n126.\tDespite the enormous progress achieved by mankind in all walks of life, whether cultural, scientific or otherwise, we still witness, deplore and denounce the racial discrimination practiced in South Africa by the white minority regime, contrary to our human values, our Islamic principles, and the lofty ideals, principles and objectives of the United Nations. For this reason, my delegation fully supports the efforts of our brothers in Namibia and Southern Rhodesia to attain their freedom and self-determination.\n127.\tBefore I conclude, and on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, may I state that we should not only look to the past in appraising what has and what has not been achieved by our Organization, but we should also look forward to the future with optimism about achieving what we desire for our Organization and maintaining its effectiveness in solving the various problems confronting mankind."

        "file_text": " Sir, I have the honor to congratulate you on behalf of the Finnish Government on your important election to the presidency. We greet you as an eminent European statesman who has contributed much to European reconciliation and to international co-operation in general.\n2.\tThe thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations gives us an opportunity to survey the full spectrum of our activities in order to understand better the value of the Organization in present-day international politics. An examination of the main trends in the development of the United Nations gives us confidence in the future, The Organization has been able to enlarge its membership, which now approaches universality. We very warmly welcome this trend: it makes the United Nations unique as a tool for international co-operation; it also improves conditions for the attainment of our primary goal: the harmonization of the interests of Member States in order to preserve world peace and security. In the process of creating these conditions, the United Nations certainly is the forum where Member States can promote their own national interests. At the same time, it offers a forum where we can test our own interests in relation to those of other Member States. Thus, after argumentation there has to be conciliation and compromise. The policies of detente and dialog which are actively pursued by the United Nations should be seen as an acknowledgment on the part of Member States of our interdependence in an era of tremendous global problems.\n3.\tThe Finnish Government continues to give its full support to the United Nations in the efforts to achieve its important objectives. Today, more than ever, the world needs an Organization where the methods applied in the pursuit of political, economic and social harmony can be discussed and decided in the presence of all concerned. This can best guarantee\nthat the underlying realities of new global challenges are not neglected or underestimated. We fully agree with the Secretary-General that:\n\\\". . . the principles of the Charter and the very existence of the Organization, whatever its practical short-comings, have provided an indispensable body of unifying ideas and a central point of contact in a period of rap id change. Despite all the unforeseen developments of the last 30 years, the Organization has shown a remarkable capacity to take on new tasks, to adjust to a changing world, and to meet new and unforeseen challenges within the . . . framework ... [of] the Charter.\\\" [AllOOOllAddJ, sect. J.]\n4.\tThe Government of Finland from the very beginning has supported the initiative aimed at establishing a new international economic order. We are therefore happy that the first concerted effort of both developed and developing countries to translate the program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] into practical and meaningful realities was a success. The resolution on development and international economic co-operation adopted by the seventh special session [resolution 3362 (S-Vll)] contains a number of elements which, when implemented, should be of real economic significance to the developing countries. The new approach to international commodity trade the so-called integrated program for commodities contains several promising features. It should therefore be pursued with speed and resolve. Stable market conditions for commodities should, however, be complemented by diversification, increased indus-trialization and efficient marketing. This will generate the capital necessary for real improvement in developing countries. In addition, supporting measures must be available, at least in the short term. Food aid and massive support for increasing agricultural production and productivity are of paramount importance. So are measures in support of the transfer of scientific and technological know-how, as well as the efficient and unrestricted use of natural resources. All these questions were discussed at the seventh special session, which thus succeeded in focusing on the essential elements of intensified world economic and social development.\n5.\tThe most promising aspect of the special session might, however, ultimately be that it demonstrated a change in thinking and attitudes. There emerged a wider recognition of the need to set in motion a genuine process of change in international economic relations.\n6.\tIn the last few years, a number of important United Nations conferences on global issues have been convened. 1 am referring in particular to the World Conference of the International Women's Year, held at Mexico City in June and July 1975, and to the World\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\nIt is an honor for me to speak once again from this rostrum on behalf of the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru, as well as in fulfillment of the mandate of the ministerial meeting of the non-aligned countries, held in Lima at the end of August of this year.\n44.\tI wish to express, Mr. President, my country's deep satisfaction upon your election to guide our proceedings during the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. Luxembourg and Peru maintain cordial relations and I am confident that the eminent Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs will, with dignity and skill, guide our deliberations on the issues of transcendental importance which this Assembly has before it.\n45.\tI wish also to express my most sincere appreciation to the Foreign Minister of Algeria, Mr. Bouteflika, whose diligent performance as President of the last session has raised the historic cause of the third world to a stature of renewed international vigor and influence.\n46.\tI wish also to thank the Secretary-General for his visit to my country at the beginning of this year. On that occasion, he displayed for us a sample of the efforts which he devotes to the many international problems absorbing the attention of our Organization. I believe it appropriate on this occasion to wish him success m the delicate tasks before him in his office, a success we all hope for in the cause of the strengthening of peace and security.\n47.\tA few weeks ago, I had the singular honor of being the spokesman for the Foreign Ministers of non- aligned countries in presenting to the seventh special session of the General Assembly the results of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non- Aligned Countries held at Lima from 25 to 30 August 1975. On that occasion, I analyzed the economic aspects contained in the Lima Program of Mutual Assistance and Solidarity A/10217 and Corr 1 annex]. Essentially, I pointed out how the results reached at Lima constitute a clearly-defined strategy directed towards strengthening the autonomy of the development processes, as well as areas for concrete action in mutual co-operation and solidarity, in face of the collapse of the unjust international economic order, thus transforming the non-aligned and developing countries as a whole into a dynamic element of greatest coherence in the structuring of the new order.\n48. In the political field, the Lima Program spells out as it does in the economic field, systems for consultation and solidarity for a common protection\nagainst pressures, overt or covert, against our territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence, as well as the machinery for mutual co-ordination designed to strengthen our negotiating capacity in international bodies. We defend today, as we always shall, the right of peoples to their political and economic independence, and to formulate their social and economic Programs in accordance with their own values. We defend, and shall give practical effect to, the right to convert the equality formally recognized in the Charter into specific rights with political content and weight. It is not through a wish for obstinacy or confrontation, but through the exercise of the weight of our voice and our vote that the discussions in this body will be marked, for in it we have a legitimate place and the full right to defend the interests of the peoples of the third world.\n49.\tThe Lima Conference reviewed the international situation and considered its most salient aspects in the light of the lofty aims of our movement. This review enabled us to confirm that non-alignment has become one of the truly significant factors in the international scene, and that it appears as an effective historical option for peoples aspiring to independence, equality, full development and peace. Furthermore, in the present circumstances, marked by a hardening of imperialist policies and a serious economic crisis, concerted policy and the action of countries rejecting the power politics of the Powers is imperative for the vast majority of peoples which seek only the peaceful promotion of their just aspirations and rights.\n50.\tThe non-aligned movement is basically an inter-national anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist position, committed to action directed towards overcoming situations of conflict, and especially an international order based on keeping the majority of mankind at a subsistence level. Our struggle is not related to the present situation; rather, it challenges a whole system the historical validity of which is decreasing day by day as the forces of liberation advance.\n51.\tI will not review the Lima agreements in detail. I shall simply underline the fact that our movement is determined to promote actively the implementation of those agreements, for they all conform with the letter and the spirit of the Charter of our Organization. Therefore, to those who would see in non-alignment a new bloc, we could answer that the things we are fighting are in fact power politics, hegemonic policies, the indefinite postponement of the aspirations of peoples which have contributed and still contribute to the well-being of others, the continuance of sources of tension, and the continuance of imperialist, colonialist and racist policies. These are the obstacles preventing men from living together as human beings and striving together to achieve everything that befits their higher nature.\n52.\tPeru has reaffirmed its unshakable commitment to the enlightened objectives of non-alignment. In this context I shall now turn to those matters which, as Foreign Minister of my country, I wish to put before this session of the Assembly.\n53.\tThe results of the seventh special session take their place within the context of the multidimensional long-term efforts to which the third world countries are deeply committed. The results of the special session are not totally satisfactory to us. There still exists a wide gap between our just demands and the resolutions adopted in this hall some days ago. Therefore we must state that the third world will not abandon its just demands. The Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order adopted at the sixth special session [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)], the principles and action Program agreed by the non-aligned countries at Algiers and Lima, and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] maintain for us their full validity and importance. Those documents are an integral part of the process which is questioning the very basis of the present unjust economic system, rejecting the paternalistic approach which seems to consider aid as a substitute for a just distribution of world wealth, and proposing as an alternative for the development of the third world, principles and measures aimed at radically altering international economic relations.\n54.\tThe thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations, which we are now observing, takes place at a moment in which the vitality and creative richness of our Organization is being tested. Far removed from the solemn attitude that usually accompanies institutional decay, the opposing forces of today provide the vigour and energy necessary to face the challenges facing the United Nations in a world undergoing a far-reaching structural crisis.\n55.\tThe United Nations, which arose out of the Second World War, was obliged for many years to concern itself with security and with the ideological struggles of the great Powers; those were the circumstances in which the Organization was functioning. Those were the years of automatic majorities and the abuse of the veto. In those years the United Nations was nothing more than the most appropriate diplomatic instrument for gauging the desire for confrontation of those striving for global supremacy,\n56.\tIt was only in the middle of the 1950s, when new States were admitted, that the United Nations began to assume a responsibility consistent with future trends, and successfully dealt with the first serious anti-colonial crisis of Suez in 1956. From then on, and throughout the 1960s, the United Nations devoted itself with varying degrees of emphasis to the decolonization of Africa and Asia. This process was accelerated and complemented in the ever more systematic concern with the under-development of the newly independent peoples. Thus the United Nations began to detect the causes of under-development in the very situation of dependence in which the metropolitan Powers had maintained the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n57.\tThe political decolonization sponsored and promoted by the United Nations is increasingly linked with the notion that a situation of dependence inhibits development.\n58.\tThus the United Nations is initiating a process of democratization in international economic relations, first through the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and more recently through the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly, on raw materials, development and cooperation, which set forth the overriding significance of the concern of the United Nations with institutional problems, as it marks its thirtieth anniversary.\n59.\tIn this brief historical summary there is one constant theme: the gradual emergence of the developing world and the appearance of questions crucial to their internal and international interests, that is to say, the overriding and consistent pressure for the United Nations to confront, and not avoid, the problems facing the international community in the difficult relationship between countries which were until recently subjected, and the Powers which had exercised a dominating role which they still wish to perpetuate.\n60.\tThe prelude to and the apparent cause of the increase in tension between the developed world and the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America is the global economic crisis which has already produced a pattern of multiple isolation. As the economies of certain industrial Powers contract, they seem to become increasingly short-sighted, and the precarious political and economic order of developing countries has been weakened with the collusion of transnational corporations, through the reactionary activity of oligarchical minorities and the promotion of militarism, aimed at weakening progressive Governments. This new anti-historical offensive on the part of economic neo-colonialism and regressive forces only heralds the final liquidation of those very systems of dependence.\n61.\tThus we have seen, since the beginning of the year and since the last session of the General Assembly, the triumph of the peoples of Viet Nam, Kampuchea and Laos. The year 1975 therefore constitutes an historic landmark on the road to the general liberation for which the peoples of Latin America, Asia and Africa are striving.\n62.\tThe last quarter of the century will witness the establishment of a process of economic and political liberation, a proliferation of victories in the anti- colonial struggle, which will embrace the full breadth of the Southern Hemisphere. Truly authentic regimes will be set up which are consonant with the real character of the peoples concerned, and which will lay aside those models which recent history has already proved inoperative in the modern world.\n63.\tIt is therefore particularly heartening for the Government and people of my country, wedded as they are to the common revolutionary process, to share the same vision of the international situation as that held by more than 80 non-aligned countries.\n64.\tIn another sphere, the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe signed at Helsinki confirms in traditional terms the consolidation of the process of detente between the great Powers, providing the old European continent with the peace and tranquility it has been denied for so long. It is significant that values such as non-intervention, guaranteed frontiers and free cultural exchange are reflected in this Agreement, which establishes the means for growing political understanding between East and West. Doubtless this will be followed by new steps in arms control and, it is to be hoped, will lead towards the as yet unattainable goal of general disarmament. However, the process of detente is progressing without embracing the third world. Our peoples are absorbing the major impact of the economic crisis since the industrial Powers are transferring the inflationary spiral to us; and, while in the world centers the areas of peace and security are being consolidated, the tensions generated by the interests of the superPowers are moving out into the less well-defined and more vulnerable zones in the developing countries.\n65.\tWe have witnessed the continuation of a critical situation in the Middle East, in which the agreement between Egypt and Israel is a new element. The key to a future prompt solution obviously resides in the criteria recognized by this Organization for years in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\n(1973)\t.\tThose resolutions call for the total withdrawal of occupying forces from Arab territories to the 1967 borders and the legitimate recognition of the sovereign rights of the people of Palestine. These points are particularly urgent. Any mediation discounting these principles will only achieve precarious results. Therefore we will support any solution satisfying the interests of the parties directly concerned.\n66.\tWe view with concern the crisis in a non-aligned country Cyprus, whose integrity and sovereignty must be preserved. General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) and Security Council resolutions 365\n(1974)\tand 367 (1975) are instruments which govern the negotiations carried out by both communities under the auspices of the Secretary-General. My Government hopes that these negotiations will be successful. In this connexion my country is highly appreciative of the confidence placed in the Peruvian Ambassador, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who has been appointed the Secretary-General's Special Representative in Cyprus.\n67.\tIn reiterating its full support to the struggle for freedom and against racism in Angola and all southern Africa, my Government warmly welcomes those peoples which have just achieved their independence in Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and Mozambique and welcomes them to this Organization. We also express our satisfaction that Papua New Guinea and the Comoro Islands have achieved independence.\n68.\tPeru deplores the resurgence of colonialist and racist practices in southern Africa. We have noted with concern that early independence for Angola may be thwarted and we expect concerted action in this Organization to facilitate self-determination of the Zimbabwean and Namibian peoples. We hope that the practice of apartheid in those Territories and in all of South Africa will soon be abolished.\n69.\tMy Government points out this resurgence of colonialism with real concern, for in our own continent situations threatening independence also persist. We thus support with deep conviction the anti-colonial and nationalist causes of the people of Latin America and reaffirm our unconditional backing of our sister nation of Panama with regard to the enclave existing in its territory, while condemning the vestiges of colonialism in many parts of the continent. This support is not, nor has it ever been, a mere additional expression of views. The reform of the international system itself proposed by my country three years ago includes a direct challenge to colonialist attitudes, as well as systematic support for the currents of liberation in our country. The most tangible and influential aspects of this anti-colonial policy have been and continue to be the strengthening of sovereignty, the consolidation of practical machinery of control and the promotion of solidarity among our countries with regard to natural resources, which have traditionally been the object of colonial exploitation by transnational corporations and are now the source of Latin American hope for a new order once economic independence has been achieved. This is the perspective for the struggle and conviction that inspires our continent and it entails efforts for united action and will indicate new areas of co-operation among sister States.\n70.\tDespite the existence of a positive evolution in trends towards liberation, only today are we able to understand that, beyond the inefficient and rational administration of social factors, there exists a greater and more serious historical constant of systematic exploitation: women. The concern and civil backwardness which this exploitation implies has led to a growing awareness and resulted in the World Conference of the International Women's Year held this year at Mexico City. The principles and plan of action adopted there to promote true equality of women and their integration in the process of development cannot be isolated from the general evolution of contemporary political currents.\n71.\tOn the contrary, those principles and goals, both politically and ethically, may generate trends towards liberation capable of breaking the standstill in the world situation. If the principles of equality and integration formally adopted by the women's Conference are truly implemented, mankind would be able to recover a new understanding of values which have been tenaciously repressed through violence and poverty. The quality of life that new generations will ask for will depend to a large extent upon the creativity, information and standards of behavior which doubtless involve liberated women, either individually or as a future factor of history.\n72.\tAfter the appearance of anti-hegemonic policies in various regimes of South-East Asia, and shortly after the victory of liberation movements in IndoChina, vast oceanic areas have become involved in movements and competition of a military nature. The reorganization of military bases as a consequence of changes in the strategic interests of the superPowers, undermines the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] and also threatens the imminent creation of a zone of peace and co-operation in the South Pacific, as was agreed at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries held in the capital of my country from 25 to 30 August 1975.\n73.\tThe establishment of zones of peace has been until now the only option left to the third world in seeking to protect itself from the soaring nuclear escalation and the consequent military imbalance which continues to prevail without any possible or feasible means of control.\n74.\tLast May there was an opportunity to evaluate the first five years of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]. This was a treaty which, since its opening for signature, had been hailed as an undeniable symbol of the march of mankind toward that other great United Nations cause: disarmament.\n75.\tHowever, the collective renunciation of nuclear weapons made by the developing countries, and the simultaneous guarantee of a maintenance of a monopoly of atomic weapons on the part of the great Powers, was based on a clear and expressed counter-commitment, that is to say the implementation of a process of general disarmament which would guarantee security for all. The facts are not encouraging. Not only has there not been a single effective step toward general disarmament, and even less toward nuclear disarmament, but rather the growth of arsenals and the increasing sophistication of instruments of mass destruction have been accompanied with close co-ordination between the super-Powers by an audacious disarmament rhetoric which attempts to convince world opinion that control measures reached thus far have been substantive and not simply psychological.\n76.\tThey would have us believe that measures as vague as the prohibition of biological and meteorological weapons, as well as the peaceful uses of the sea-bed and outer space, compensate For the continuation of nuclear weapons testing and the undeniable vertical proliferation of nuclear armaments. In the face of this fact, the moral obligation of non-nuclear countries deriving from the non-proliferation Treaty is seriously at stake.\n77.\tIt is in view of the sinister disarmament situation described above that developing countries are seeking a way to break the state-mate of the nuclear status quo.\n78.\tPeru's presence in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament is a recent event, and it demonstrates our deep and genuine desire to divert the resources devoted to the tools of war to the pressing requirements required to develop peoples; at the same time we must not forsake a complex evaluation of this question. We must seek new opportunities to obtain the implementation of the principles of general and complete disarmament, long ago expressed in this body. We therefore hope that it will be possible to convene a world disarmament conference soon and with universal participation, and that it will be able to work effectively, transforming the present loosely- knit semi-rhetorical exercise into a political negotiation, capable of committing all parties to a cause in which there can be no losers. In order to reach that desired goal of true negotiation, my Government, together with the non-aligned countries, would look favorably upon the early convening of a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament.\n79.\tThis request of ours stems from the realistic conviction that the struggle against the arms race in Latin America does exist. Implementing an initiative of the Government of Peru on the limitation of the acquisition of weapons among States members of the Andean Group is a reality. It has left the stage of pure concepts and principles and is now moving towards a more difficult but more fruitful stage, in which problems and implementation are being spell out. With the meetings already held in Lima and in Santiago and those scheduled for the future, it will be possible to move away from the momentary influence of an artificial climate of warmongering and tension, in which these interests combine with profit-\nseeking transnational corporations connected with the media and the weapons industry.\n80.\tJust as the results of the recent special session on development must lead to the establishment of a new and more just international economic order so will the disarmament meeting which we advocate contribute to the democratization of international political relations. Both trends would converge in the achievement of collective security at the world level, solidly based upon an equitable economic redistribution and mutual political tolerance, as required by the next phase of international construction.\n81.\tIt is clear that, just as security is the essence of the concern of developed Powers and the key to their deepest political process, in the third world the priority goal of Governments is solidarity and reciprocal co-operation in order to guarantee economic independence. Importance has naturally been attached to the Helsinki Conference as it responds to the central interest of the developed world while, at the same time, the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Lima, is a clear demonstration of the historic trend towards unity and a common economic strategy shared by countries of the third world. These two Conferences, these two trends, would seem to diverge because the areas in which they coincide are still minimal and therefore the possibility for rapprochement between these two areas, which still define their own interests with their backs to one another, is also minimal.\n82.\tUntil the circumstances or the institutions can be directed to seek, preferably, areas of convergence, these two trends may evolve, dangerously, in opposite directions. Future negotiations, therefore, must be focused upon the most pressing problems with regard to unity and the global perspective, that is to say, they must encompass development as well as disarmament, because world security and historical evolution of mankind is involved in both dimensions.\n83.\tTherefore, drawing from the spirit of the Helsinki and Lima Conferences we must strive to solve problems relating to security and to development so that they may be dealt with in two great world conferences, one on disarmament and one, which we propose, and we invite the Assembly to consider, would be devoted to the just restructuring of the economic and social order of relations among States.\n84.\tWe firmly believe that we shall thus be taking fundamental steps to establish a new world coexistence on the basis of the link between three great problems affecting mankind: peace, security and development. The relationship between security and development is most obvious, since the greater expenditure on weapons, in the name of apparent security, the more the world becomes insecure. Fewer resources are devoted to the development of mankind and the satisfaction of the needs of peoples, and thus situations of poverty, oppression and injustice, generating insecurity for all, are maintained and even aggravated.\n85.\tThe progress made at the last session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, at Geneva earlier this year, has led to increased recognition of the sovereign rights of coastal States within zones of national jurisdiction not exceeding 200 miles with the exception of continental shelves extending beyond that distance, and without prejudice to the interests of all States in international communications. At the same time, the foundations have been laid for the establishment of an international authority charged with the administration of the area of the seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, as the common heritage of mankind.\n86.\tMy country, together with others of the region, has sustained in a firm and worthy manner for over a quarter of a century the thesis that the defence of sovereignty and jurisdiction over the sea, its soil and subsoil up to 200 miles is a substantive element of the new legal order and the recognition of a cause which is inexorably linked to the security, welfare and development of peoples.\n87.\tNevertheless, we can see on the part of some Powers an effort to weaken the nature of national jurisdiction and the areas over which it would extend and at the same time to favor the unrestricted exploitation of the international area, in order to allow those selfsame Powers to maintain their economic, political and military hegemony.\n88.\tHowever, due to the action of the third world countries, a new international law of the sea is being formulated which will regulate the use and exploitation of the seas and contribute to the promotion of development and security of peoples as inseparable requirements and conditions for justice and peace among nations.\n89.\tIt is not untimely now to point out how deeply our people shares this Organization's mission of peace. Peru has until very recently contributed troops to the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East, and has always lent its support to all United Nations efforts. May I take this occasion to pay a heartfelt tribute to those soldiers from my country who unselfishly spilled their blood upon the hot sands of the Sinai desert in the cause of maintaining peace in that region. My country today confirms its boundless commitment to the principles of the Charter, adopted at San Francisco, which are still at the heart of this already mature institution. In this perspective, it is fitting to consider the reforms of the organs of the United Nations which are appropriate to this new phase, including voting reforms, in order to ensure an effective democratization of political decision-making at the international level, particularly in the Security Council and with regard to the anachronistic institution of the veto.\n90.\tWhat we seek and to this the vast majority of countries which comprise the non-aligned movement are devoted is that the discussions which are central to mankind, in order to define the parameters of its immediate future, should genuinely take place in this body; that a scheme for total disarmament be negotiated at last; that practical stages and areas of agreement will be reached so that the integrated development of the third world can complement and vitalize the new international economic order; that the establishment of standards of behavior for transnational corporations be speed up; and that problems which impede the final liberation of women and the related problems of the future quality of life should be moved from the desks of academia and brought here before the United Nations.\n91.\tWithin this context, the agreements reached at the meetings of the ministers of the non-aligned countries acquire special significance because they are designed to ensure that the legitimate aspirations and postulates of the third world reach world public opinion without being distorted. It is therefore imperative to reorganize the present mass media channels, which are the heritage of an antiquated colonial system, so that they will not be an obstacle to the free and truthful flow of information among the developing countries, and thus ensure that understanding and cooperation among the peoples of the world will not suffer.\n92.\tThe concerns which I have summarized on the international situation indicate, as I am sure is apparent, a certain optimism which would seem difficult to reconcile with the overburdened agenda of this session.\n93.\tOur vision is optimistic because it is born of the intimate experience of a vast complex of problems at the national level. The Revolutionary Government of Peru is preparing to deepen and consolidate, in this great second phase, under the guidance of its President, General Francisco Morales Bermudez, the initial achievements of the early years of the Peruvian revolution.\n94.\tPeru is a country in which Government and people are united in an endless struggle against the structural situation of under-development. It is a country in revolution which has raised the banners of social justice and independent, self-sustained development. Our revolution, with the renewed urgency of its ideological postulates, is inscribed within a Latin American, third world and non-aligned context, which defines the meaning and direction of our foreign policy.\n95.\tI would reiterate what I confirmed two weeks ago in this very Hall: the Peruvian revolution of today is the same as that which began to make history in my country on 3 October 1968. It is the same because it holds the same titles to revolutionary legitimacy: a yearning for liberty and justice and for the structural changes which will bring about a new Peruvian society predicated on the principle of social democracy based on full participation, the bases of which are a political system of participation for the Peruvian people, a pluralistic economic system with a priority sector of social property; and a social system founded on moral conduct and values which underscore justice, liberty, solidarity, creativity and respect for the dignity of the human being.\n96.\tJust as the change in Peru's internal structure has been deep-rooted in order that its people may share in the process and benefits of change, the future international order must be structured in such a way that the interests of the third world can be promoted through its effective presence and participation in the decisions and implementation measures which will make it endure.\n"

        "file_text": "Since the founding of the United Nations a period of time has elapsed which we normally call a generation.\n68.\tThis is a singularly appropriate occasion to consider what the United Nations has accomplished during these past three decades and what remains to be done. I am pleased to see as the President of the General Assembly the Prime Minister of a country which is not only associated with my country in close friendship but whose outward-looking attitude and whose willingness for international co-operation are exemplary. The spirit with which your country and you personally, Mr. President, participate in this co-operation both in Europe and in the world presents an example as well as a challenge, Please accept my warm congratulations on your election to this responsible office.\n69.\tAt the same time I wish to express my thanks to the outgoing President, Mr. Bouteflika, the Foreign Minister of Algeria, who held this office during a very difficult period in the history of the United Nations.\n70.\tThe first 30 years of the life of the United Nations have witnessed fundamental changes in the world from which this Organization has not been excepted. We are all familiar with the graph which depicts the population explosion; a curve which runs almost horizontally for thousands of years, then begins to rise and in the middle of this century suddenly shoots up almost vertically. The graphs depicting the advancement of science and technology, the growth of production and consumption, world trade and communication and, not least, the destructive force of weapons, are no different.\n71.\tEverywhere developments have been explosive. Within that same period the number of nations has trebled. The original Organization had 51 Members, now it has over 140. The world was then dominated by a rigid regime of bipolar confrontation of two blocs; now it is a complex, multipolar world in which multifarious forces and aspirations are asserting themselves. This process is sharply reflected within the United Nations. Nothing has had a greater influence on its development than the emergence of the third world as a separate independent element of world politics, freed from colonial dependence and vested with the same rights and obligations as all other States.\n72.\tOver and above their different views and attitudes, the nations which make up our world find themselves forged more and more into a community of destiny. The destructive power of modern weaponry, which has grown to immeasurable proportions, has produced a single, global security interest, and the abrupt expansion of productive power has created a single global economy. Security and economic growth and stability cannot be guaranteed today by any one State alone and in isolation. Whether it is a question of preventing a nuclear catastrophe, of fighting international terrorism, of overcoming inflation and recession, or of preserving ecological and environmental conditions on this planet, the problems that have to be resolved are everywhere beyond the resources of any individual nation and can be met only if all States and all groups of States work together.\n73.\tThe problems have become global. The irresistible trend towards ever greater interdependence is the distinguishing feature of the new age; it is the course of world history. For the first time mankind as a whole is moving towards a common future: either to survive together or to perish together, to prosper together or to decline together. The world as a whole lives under the iron law of interdependence: its parts cannot prosper unless the whole prospers.\n74.\tSlowly, this development is beginning to be realized and appreciated. This is indicated by the close co-operation among the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in seeking to overcome the consequences of the world economic crisis, by the constructive consensus reached by the General Assembly at its seventh special session, which tried to achieve an equitable balance of interests between industrialized and developing countries, by the reaffirmation of the will for detente and co-operation between East and West as expressed at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, and by the initiation of the European-Arab dialog.\n75.\tWe all know the only alternative to common progress is common chaos. We are called upon resolutely to choose the course of co-operation and consistently to develop the foundations of that cooperation which have so far been laid by the United Nations. The task is to strengthen the awareness of interdependence and, as a consequence, to assert the policy of co-operation once and for all in the face of the powerful forces of traditional doctrines and ideologies, to assert it both externally and internally. Because it is also necessary that the individual citizen, too, should develop an understanding for the new constraints of interdependence and that he should muster the will for international solidarity. For the possibilities open to Governments in pursuing such a policy of solidarity reach only as far as the people themselves appreciate the need for it and are therefore prepared to support it. The present crisis of the world economy gives us a chance to draw the necessary conclusions from these considerations and insights.\n76.\tIt would be wrong if the wealthy countries were to resort to the attitude of \\\"every man for himself'. It would be wrong if the destruction rather than the further elaboration of the international economic system were to be regarded as the way out of the difficulties with which we are confronted in the development process. It would be equally wrong if part of the industrialized countries were to refuse to join in the necessary world-wide solidarity between industrialized and developing countries by referring to the colonial past of others and to their own non-colonial past true or alleged.\n77.\tInterdependence postulates the common weal universally. This must be the guideline for our action and this goal can be reached only through a policy of an equitable balance of interests.\n78.\tIn spite of all setbacks and catastrophes our century has so far also been one of unparalleled progress for mankind. The challenges facing us in our shrinking world are extraordinary both in terms of their novelty and of their magnitude. But also extra-ordinary and unparalleled in history are the means we have at our disposal to meet those challenges. If we use them rationally and co-operatively and do not squander them in irrational conflict, we shall be able to master those tasks.\n79.\tThe founders of the United Nations set the world the three big tasks laid down in our Charter: to maintain peace, to respect human rights and the right of self-determination, and to promote economic and social progress. What was a vision in 1945 has turned into reality today: the global interdependence of one world.\n80.\tThe three great challenges of our time are: we must proceed from economic egotism to a worldwide reliable regime of co-operation among equals; we must proceed from the proclamation of human rights to their world-wide application and to the implementation of the right of self-determination wherever that right is still being denied; and we must proceed from the management of crises to a just and thereby lasting peace.\n81.\tOur first goal is to establish a reliable regime of economic co-operation. The seventh special session, which has just concluded, marked a promising beginning in our endeavor to establish a system of economic co-operation which is based on the simple realization that we are all in the same boat. During the very intensive but business-like negotiations the Assembly gave an example of a world-wide spirit of co-operation. This will make it easier to embark on the road towards a just balance of interests. For a number of problems the foundations for solutions have been laid. Some questions still require clarification, while the consequences of others need to be studied. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has joined in the consensus because it is based on the idea of reasonable and necessary reform, but not on revolutionary changes in the international economic order.\n82.\tThe present world-wide recession has made all of us keenly aware of the relationship which I earlier called the iron law of interdependence: the parts cannot prosper unless the whole prospers. The growth rates of national economies have become interdependent. This applies also to the relationship between industrialized and developing countries. Higher growth rates in the industrialized countries mean higher growth rates in the developing countries, and lower growth rates in the industrialized countries mean lower growth rates in the developing countries. The fact that all of us recognized and accepted this interrelationship made the satisfactory result of the seventh special session possible.\n83.\tIt is also in this spirit of co-operation that my country will enter the forthcoming producer-consumer dialog. In a world economy which can only grow and develop through joint efforts all partners have to bear their particular share of responsibility. Thus, because of their economic significance and weight, the industrialized countries have to assume a special responsibility. My Government is conscious of that responsibility and acts accordingly.\n84.\tIn close co-ordination with the other industrialized countries having a free market economy my Government endeavors to set in motion a process of economic upswing without, however, providing inflationary impulses. By opening up markets and intensifying co-operation with the developing countries this economic upswing is especially intended to benefit the developing countries. We are against exporting our difficulties by taking restrictive measures and we consistently uphold a policy of further opening up markets, especially with regard to imports from the developing countries.\n85.\tAs the role of the developing countries on the world economic scene grows, there is an increase in the responsibility which they, too, have to bear in all fields, including commodities and energy. Together we want to break and reverse the trend which in the past has continued to widen the gap between the rich and the poor. One objective is to achieve the general growth of the world economy; the other objective is to overcome inequality. We feel that these aims can best be achieved by basing the economic relations between States on the principles of the market economy, irrespective of their domestic economic systems.\n86.\tI turn now to the question of self-determination and human rights. In a system of co-operation among equals which our Organization intends to bring about, a central role falls to the application of the right of nations to self-determination. A true world community of States and peoples will emerge only if the nations are integrated within that community on the basis of free self-determination. Only in such a world can the readiness to assume responsibility for the whole fully develop. The right of nations to self-determination is therefore a fundamental principle of our system.\n87.\tDuring the first decades of the United Nations the basis for a universal international community was created through the implementation of the right of self-determination of the former colonies. At this year's session of the General Assembly too, three new States have joined our Organization, and 1 wish to take this opportunity to bid Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe a warm welcome to our Organization, which is becoming truly universal.\n88.\tThe process of decolonization is drawing to its close. There are only a few regions left in the world to which the outdated system of colonialism still clings. But that system's days are numbered. We trust that in southern Africa, too, those days will come to an end without violence and devastation. The Federal Government therefore welcomes the decision taken by the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity, held at Dar es Salaam in April 1975, that in the solution of pending problems preference should be given to negotiations. It welcomes also the efforts made by the leaders of both the black and the white communities in Southern Rhodesia to establish a new and just order through negotiations and thus to avert the danger of a civil war and bloodshed.\n89.\tThe Government of the Federal Republic of Germany strongly advocates the granting of the right of self-determination to the people of Namibia. The Government of the Republic of South Africa itself has stated that it does not consider Namibia to be South African territory. It must finally and quickly draw the conclusions from this and lead Namibia to independence without delay and more quickly than has so far been envisaged. The Federal Government has repeatedly and urgently brought its attitude to the attention of the Government of the Republic of South Africa and will continue to do so. With no less urgency it advocates the abolition at long last of the inhuman system of apartheid practiced in the Republic of South Africa, a system which we condemn.\n90.\tThat last question leads me to the subject of human rights. The United Nations, which has achieved so much in promoting the application of the right of self-determination, has also been able to lay essential foundations on which to secure respect for human rights. By means of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [resolution 217 A (III)] and the human rights Covenants [see resolution 2200 A (XXI)] based on it, the United Nations has defined the term \\\"human rights\\\" and received acceptance of that definition all over the world. It is now up to us to see to it that human rights are implemented everywhere in practice. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany will support all proposals aimed at strengthening the role of the United Nations with regard to the implementation of human rights.\n91.\tHuman rights must apply everywhere; they must apply in all continents. And, as a European, I add that they must apply also in all parts of Europe. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has drawn the conclusion from this and made the implementation of human rights a major subject,\n92.\tFreedom of movement is one of the basic rights guaranteed both by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and by the human rights Covenants. And, indeed, if co-operation in Europe is to be extended more and more, people must no longer be prevented from meeting freely. The decisions taken at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe abound with specific promises of improvements in Europe both as regards this right and as regards other human rights. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany will gauge the worth of the results of the Conference particularly by the manner in which and when those promises are fulfilled.\n93.\tI turn now to the safeguarding of peace. Peace is the prerequisite for progress in all other spheres. It therefore remains a primary task of the United Nations to safeguard peace.\nIn this respect I would refer to the peace policy of the Federal Republic of Germany. Being fully aware of this perspective, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has from the very beginning pursued a policy aimed at the maintenance of peace. This goes for our own national policies as Well as for our co-operation within the European Community, that great and promising union of European States, and for our membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the defense alliance whose purpose it is to safeguard peace. By pursuing a consistent policy of the non-use of force, the Federal Government has promoted detente in Europe and thus laid the foundation for growing and mutually fruitful co-operation with our neighbors in the East. Let me mention here in this connexion the Treaties of Moscow, Warsaw and Prague. The same is true of the Treaty on the Basis of Relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic done at Berlin on 21 December 1972.\n95.\tOn the occasion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, additional arrangements were concluded in a spirit of mutual understanding with the Polish People's Republic concerning outstanding questions. These arrangements are intended, after a past full of misery and distress, to bring about the reconciliation of the two peoples and to lead to long-term co-operation between partners.\n96.\tThe Federal Government includes in its policy of the non-use of force and detente our most painful problem also: the division of Germany. It is our aim to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will regain its unity through free self- determination.\n97.\tI reaffirm our belief that history has not spoken the last word on the division of the German nation. The nation's will to achieve its unity will preserve its historical strength. The conclusion of the Treaty on the Principles of Relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic is evidence of our determination to exhaust all possibilities of peaceful co-operation also in the relationship between the two German States.\n98.\tBuilding on its bilateral policy of detente and on the treaties it has concluded in this connexion, as well as on the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, signed on 3 September 1971, the Federal Government has played an active part in the work of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, because no nation in Europe senses more keenly than the German people the danger emanating from the division of our continent. The participating States want the results of the Conference to have effect throughout Europe. Indeed, security and co-operation must prove their worth particularly in that city which in the years of the cold war so often was the scene of dangerous tensions which affected the whole world the city of Berlin. Berlin remains the barometer of detente. Detente presupposes mutual confidence.\n99.\tDistrust and fear will only revive the former state of tension in Europe. This is why the Federal Government has begun, without delay, to implement the confidence-building measures decided upon at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. It was the first Government taking part in that Conference to announce to all other participants military maneuvers in accordance with the provisions of the Final Act of Helsinki, However, the results of the Conference are important not only for Europe. Detente in Europe should, and can, release political and economic energies which have so far been bound up in sterile conflicts. If this happens, we will have added strength to face the big challenge of our time: the reduction of the gap between rich and poor countries.\n100.\tIn the matter of disarmament and the non- proliferation of nuclear weapons, of great importance for the safeguarding of world peace is a persistent policy of arms control and arms reduction. The Federal Government takes an active part in the negotiations in Vienna which are to lead to mutual and balanced force reductions in central Europe. It is our aim to achieve a stable balance of forces since only on the basis of equal security for all concerned will detente and trustful co-operation be possible.\n101.\tThe Federal Government lends the same active support to all measures likely to contain and ultimately to stop the world-wide arms race. Balanced and controlled disarmament is one of our most urgent tasks. The United Nations can and must make a major contribution to its fulfillment.\n102.\tLikewise, one of the most pressing challenges to this interdependent world is to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The dissemination of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes will quicken considerably in the years ahead. It has been estimated that the number of nuclear reactors available in 1980 will be 15 times greater than the number in use in 1970. The operation of those reactors would make possible the potential production of up to 26,000 kilograms of plutonium in the non-nuclear-weapon States every year as from the early 1980s in other words, enough to make 50 atomic bombs a week. So the task we have to solve is to use the advantages of peaceful nuclear technology without at the same time proliferating nuclear weapons.\n103.\tAs one of the leading producers of nuclear installations for peaceful purposes, the Federal Republic of Germany realizes that it has a special responsibility in helping to find a solution to this problem. Consequently, in every case in which it exports nuclear installations it adheres strictly to the provisions of the non-proliferation Treaty, of which it is a member, and to the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. In addition, it subjects itself to the commitments under the Euratom Treaty. It actively supports proposals aimed at further strengthening these safeguards and developing uniform criteria for the export of fissionable material and nuclear equipment.\n104.\tLet me say a word about regional crises. The policy of detente between East and West helps to consolidate peace in Europe. But in our neighborhood the sources of crisis smolder on, and the most dangerous of them is the Middle East conflict. Nowhere is it more obvious that present-day problems can no longer be resolved by war, that war is no meaningful alternative to a political settlement, that war is no longer an ultima ratio but an ultima irratio.\n105.\tFour sorrowful wars have failed to hammer out a solution in the Middle East, and a fifth Middle \n142\nEast war could have disastrous consequences. The Federal Government, therefore, welcomes with great relief the Egyptian-Israeli interim agreement of 4 September. This agreement is the result of statesman-like action on the part of all concerned. Further steps will have to follow if the momentum of this constructive development which has been set in motion is to be maintained. Standing still would mean taking a step backward and would in the end even wipe out the progress made so far.\n106.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany supports all efforts to bring about further steps along the path of negotiations. An informal multilateral discussion of the problems to be solved, as suggested by the Secretary of State of the United States [2355th meeting], could indeed be useful in promoting a subsequent peace conference.\n107.\tThe path towards a just balance of interests in the Middle East has been sketched out by Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). This means, among other things, that any peace settlement that is to last must respect Israel's right to live within secure and recognized boundaries; it must give effect to the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people; and it must include the termination of the occupation.\n108.\tThis is the attitude adopted by the Federal Republic of Germany, in full agreement with its partners in the European Community. The Federal Government is most anxious that equitable and lasting peace should prevail in the Middle East, which is a neighboring region to us. It therefore seeks to make every contribution possible, both bilaterally and within the framework of the European Community, towards bringing about such peace.\n109.\tIn Cyprus, too, a negotiated solution must quickly be found. The Federal Government, therefore, regrets that the fourth round of talks between the representatives of the two communities, which was scheduled for 8 and 9 September in New York, had to be postponed because of the lack of concrete proposals. The tragic events of 1974 were the upshot of letting things drag on for years and years without reaching the necessary compromise. Now, at least, a lesson should be drawn from this. The deadlock caused by the fact that each side is waiting for the other to be the first to make concessions must be broken. The Federal Government therefore appeals to all concerned to resume the negotiations as soon as possible. Any solution must preserve the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus.\n110.\tCyprus needs a federal structure that will accommodate the interests of both communities. Accommodating the interests of both communities also requires correcting the present demarcation line between them. The Federal Government seeks, both bilaterally and together with its partners in the European Community, to give diplomatic assistance in the search for a solution and humanitarian assistance to ease the misery of the refugees.\nJ11. As in the Middle East, the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations in Cyprus, too, are making an indispensable contribution towards maintaining an atmosphere in which constructive efforts to find a solution can be made. The same applies to the endeavors of the Secretary-General to facilitate discussions between the two communities. I wish to express to the Secretary-General and to his staff the appreciation and the thanks of the Federal Government.\n112.\tI turn now to the question of strengthening the United Nations. In the efforts to establish a regime of co-operation in the spirit of global interdependence and joint responsibility, the United Nations must play a central role. In the past 30 years the United Nations has made an essential contribution preventing crises and to containing or overcoming existing ones. It has helped to accelerate the process of decolonization. It has spread the demand for the implementation of human rights throughout the world. And it has fully brought home to the public the crucial task of our time, the economic development of the third world, and has evolved a consistent strategy and a coherent strategy for tackling this task.\n113.\tWith the growing awareness of global interdependence, the role of the United Nations, the only universal Organization in this world, must continue to increase. The prerequisite for this will be that we do all we can to achieve and maintain universality. We must continuously adapt the structure of the Organization to the changing situation and tasks in the world. The countries of the European Economic Community [\u00a3\u00a3C], in a declaration of 17 June 1975, have again stressed their support of the United Nations and have spoken out in favor of the strengthening of its role. The President of EEC, the Italian Foreign Minister, Mr. Rumor, reaffirmed this willingness in an impressive way yesterday in this forum [2357th meeting]. The Federal Republic of Germany fully endorses this commitment regarding the United Nations. Only if the nations of the world will join in a spirit of genuine co-operation can the tasks of the United Nations be successfully mastered. Only if we succeed in bringing to bear everywhere that spirit of genuine co-operation within the United Nations will we be able to tackle the tasks confronting us to safeguard international peace; to implement everywhere the right of peoples to self- determination as well as their human rights; and to promote the common weal universally through economic and social progress. The Federal Government is determined to support all efforts towards that end.\n"

        "file_text": "\n66.\t  We are genuinely pleased to applaud the wisdom shown by the General Assembly in the election of its President. In addition to his outstanding human and intellectual qualities, Mr. Thorn has valuable experience in the management of the particular problems of an economic community within which developed States and new States are associated, a personal experience rare in our times, despite the fact that peace and normal conditions in the world largely depend on finding formulas and devising compromises which will remove the tensions that today disturb relations between the advanced countries and the developing peoples.\n67.\tWe rejoice, therefore, at the presence of Mr. Thorn as President of the Assembly. We also wish to welcome to the world Organization, as independent and sovereign States, the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe.\n68.\tThese two circumstances are not necessarily isolated; they reflect certain predominant trends of our times, the significance of which is not yet appreciated in its true dimensions. And this explains why, as the. annual sessions of the General Assembly succeed one another, we note the progress of the idea that the general debate is an anachronistic institution within which it is thought evidence is given of the alleged absence of political maturity and precision of ideas usually attributed to the representatives of tropical countries, in contrast with the seriousness and economy of words of which the spokesmen of the developed countries and the Nordic cultures boast. Possibly at times there is some basis for this idea but it would be a dangerous mistake to seek the solution to a procedural question without previously considering the substantive problem which today affects the United Nations, that of finding a new political and economic balance in the world in which there is room for the new realities which arose tumultuously after the Organization came into being. The multitude of postponed problems, of problems which have deliberately been left unsolved, is the reason which confers on the general debate this aspect of growing confrontation and pugnacity which alarms many and which could hardly be done away with by depriving this Assembly on its status as the appropriate forum for avoiding tensions created by unresolved disputes or those which are difficult to solve within power situations created in an authoritarian manner at the end of the Second World War.\n69.\tFinding this new balance is all the more necessary since it is well known today that at each session of the\nAssembly pessimism regarding the world Organization becomes more noticeable among the Powers which so decisively contributed to its creation and whose behavior at times gives the impression that they consider it a hindrance to the satisfactory development of their foreign policy.\n70.\tWe do not rule out the possibility that the nations which emerged to autonomous life in the midst of the great commotions which transformed the political map of the world after the Second World War, do in fact lack the experience and wisdom which in the past the great Powers ascribed exclusively to themselves  virtues which were the result of holding, throughout centuries, a leading position in international affairs. But it is surprising how quickly the optimism of yesterday has become the pessimism of today. The aspirations of the new States, which are today maligned as being exorbitant, were not difficult to foresee when, in August 1941, aboard a British battleship, two great Anglo-Saxon statesmen signed the Atlantic Charter, wherein they stated:\n\\\"Being met together, deem it right to make known certain common principles in the national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopes for a better future for the world.\n\\\"First, their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other;\n\\\"Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the clearly expressed wishes of the peoples concerned;\n\\\"Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them;\n\\\"Fourth, they will endeavor, with due respect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity;\n\\\"Fifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing, for all, improved labor standards, economic adjustment, and social security. . .\\\"\n71.\tThe statesmen on board the British ship HMS Prince of Wales called in those terms for the support of all peoples and societies which for centuries had been subjected to a colonial or dependent regime. They had in mind the decisive contribution of that support to triumph over an enemy whose political philosophy expressed the brutal refusal by the powerful to recognize the rights of peoples of other races and of underdeveloped countries. As a foreseeable consequence of these declarations and the realities they recognized, new States gradually joined the United Nations, and the outcome has meant that the world Organization, which was founded with 51 Member States, is now made up of 141 sovereign nations which as a whole represent the broad spectrum of problems that arise at different levels of economic and political development.\n72.\tToday these problems seem new because they arise within the arena of world politics, but they are not so very different from those faced in their internal life by the great Powers whose spokesmen signed the Atlantic Charter, when the democratic spirit of their national constitutions compelled the rulers to grant guarantees and better remuneration to the social classes which traditionally had been the victims of inequalities imposed by their governing minorities. It was also stated then and history bears witness to this that the proletarian classes lacked training and responsibility to be able to become involved, through their vote, in the great affairs of State, and periods of pessimism were felt by these classes at each step of their way up on the political and social power scale.\n73.\tPossibly at the initial stages as occurs today internationally there were reasons to distrust the responsibility of social sectors which for the first time participated in the political decision-making process. But the passage of time saw to it that what was unknown became clear and the various types of philosophy which were used to consecrate the established order became unrealistic; the ruling classes, which were so opposed to their participation, ended by discovering that there was no harm in improving the consumption capacity and level of income of the major sectors of their population, and sought agreements which would give society greater stability and make it possible to submit the crucial problems of the nation to the periodical vote of their citizens.\n74.\tIt therefore does not seem justified that some Western Powers and some Eastern Powers should express surprise when, within the world Organization, there arise discrepancies that are typical of all processes aimed at destroying century-old inequalities and increasing the decision-making power of peoples which, in an international order that was distorted by the traditional imbalances of power, have been deprived of autonomy and of the opportunity to acquire the necessary virtues and responsibility to exercise that power with prudence and objectivity. It can hardly be regarded as a solution to the difficulties confronting the United Nations today to contribute to the decline of its prestige simply because in that body differing currents of opinion are reflected, or because in it forces are emerging which had no say in the interpretation given by the Powers victorious in a world war with regard to the purposes and scope of the Organization. Nor can it be a solution to threaten to suspend payment of the quotas through which contributions are made for its maintenance, or to take the course, as is occurring, of resolving international conflicts outside the framework of the world Organization, without consulting it, and seeking a stage on which it is possible to deal with international problems as simple questions of national interest or of balance of military power.\n75. It is true that it would be unfair to assert that the power and prosperity that are today enjoyed by the great Powers are something gratuitous, something not connected with the tenacious and intelligent efforts exerted by their peoples through the generations and the sacrifices they endured in the past in order to reach the levels of pre-eminence and prosperity that they today enjoy. It would be equally foolish to ignore the mistaken decisions or the grave omissions made by societies which, through the centuries, have kept themselves in a state of stagnation and, without taking advantage of them, have allowed opportunities for progress to pass by, opportunities which history has frequently offered them to achieve the well-being which they have only begun to desire and exerted themselves to acquire when they have seen it displayed in the showcases of the affluent societies. Those backward societies constitute a heterogeneous whole, with interests that are not always in agreement because of their varying degrees of development and dependency, and it is therefore inevitable that their discrepancies are accentuated when they try to find joint solutions to specific problems. Hence, it is somewhat arbitrary to attribute complete homogeneity to what is called the underdeveloped world.\n76.\tBut, recognizing, as we must, that the nations now suffering the consequences of economic backwardness are not without blame, any explanation of how the profound gaps which today separate them from the developed countries would be incomplete if we were to omit the decisive role that force and the abuse of force played in the distribution of political and economic power, of poverty and well-being, in the world inherited by our generation.\n77.\tThe enormous accumulation of wealth concentrated today in a few regions of the earth, wealth which the institutional mechanisms existing in those areas make it possible to distribute with a measure of equity among the inhabitants thereof, is not the exclusive product of the virtues, the ingenuity or the economic ethics of which they so often boast; it is also the result of the consolidation, on an international scale, of an order of relationships among the peoples of the planet, between the areas south and north of the Equator, between the temperate zones and the tropical zones. In that order, the equivalent values for their products were determined, to a great degree, by coercive and often predatory procedures. The mechanisms of the world market which, according to hallowed economic doctrines, were supposed to be automatic and impartial, were at a very early date distorted by the interferences of power, and thus a world took shape that was riddled with inequalities, a world that could be perpetuated, as was indeed done, on the basis of philosophies that prided themselves on the virtues of strength or the superiority of certain races which benevolently shouldered what a renowned poet once called \\\"the white man's burden\\\".\n78.\tA situation thus came into being in which a limited number of nations made up a privileged world establishment, while at the same time vast areas of the earth found themselves despoiled of an increasing share of the economic value of their labor and deprived of the ability, thanks to the meager income permitted to them, to improve, through distributional mechanisms, the deplorable living conditions of their peoples.\n79.\tWe are therefore witnessing an acceleration of the processes of change required to correct situations which in the contemporary world are manifestly obsolete. These corrections require that the essential concessions be made in large measure by the Powers in which the wealth has been accumulated, not by the nations which, by being ill-paid for centuries for their resources, have made possible the concentration of prosperity and well-being in a few regions of the planet. The desirable fairness and prudence in the course of those processes of change cannot be demanded in equal measure alike from those who must take these decisions from a position of power and affluence, and those countries that entered the United Nations under the dead weight of all their former dependencies and with the negative inheritance left to them by a history of subjugation and scanty remuneration for the fruits of the labor of their peoples.\n80.\tIf it is sought to find a new and a sounder political and economic balance in the world, and to create \\\"consensuses\\\" that will facilitate the functioning of the United Nations, it cannot be presumed that such \\\"consensuses\\\" must mean the resigned acceptance of the established order by representatives of the underdeveloped and tropical parts of the world, or the renunciation in advance of the pressure which, by their votes in this Assembly, they can exert for the solution of grave problems for which, all too frequently, the remedy offered has consisted of routine resolutions that mean only an indefinite postponement of the matter. Responsibility cannot be the task exclusively of the small countries; it is rather the natural function of the great countries. The atmosphere of confrontation in the United Nations that concerns us today is due, in no small measure, to the persistent reluctance of the great Powers to accept the necessary compromises in a world which, politically and culturally, cannot allow a continuance of the unjust inequalities which in past times seemed natural and even proper for those who notoriously benefited from them.\n81.\tOne cannot think otherwise when the way the world economy functions is constantly reflected by the colossal indebtedness of the third world, and the great creditor Powers resist a serious study of the possibility of renegotiating the debts, just at a time when the results of the United Nations Development Decades present so discouraging a balance and offer additional evidence of the lack of willingness on the part of the developed nations to contribute appropriately to a more balanced distribution of wealth and economic progress throughout the world. This is in sharp contrast to the excessive sensitivity which those nations show when typical murket conditions or the combined efforts of producers of raw materials or fuels succeed in winning a substantial improvement in their international remuneration. It is not compatible with the aspiration to create more stable conditions in the world that the efforts of good will made by the developing countries to reach agreements between producers and consumers of the main raw materials meet with a response of indifference or frank hostility from the major consumer countries, and that the latter feel they are victims and proclaim that the world economy is in danger when the producers of raw materials unite to defend the international level of their prices.\n82.\tThe major problem of establishing more equitable terms of trade between the prices of industrial products and of raw materials and fuels, like that of preventing the export of inflation from the affluent societies from seriously affecting countries which do not have the same operating and marketing facilities for re-exporting that inflation and improving the value of their exports, cannot be eluded indefinitely, and if procedures such as indexing, for example, are not satisfactory or acceptable, the proper conduct for the developed countries is not to evade the problem with declarations devoid of practical effectiveness but rather to take the initiative in suggesting alternatives which will result in effective progress in correcting the inequalities which today profoundly distort the international economy. The resignation of nations which accepted ridiculous prices for the labor of their peoples has altered substantively and every day it seems more difficult to maintain a situation in which the well-being and waste of highly developed nations depend to a large extent on the meagre income which the world market, affected by monopolistic mechanisms, allows the developing countries to keep for their growth and well-being.\n83.\tEqual concern might arise because of the resistance encountered in respect of the general system of preferences which, if genuinely and loyally applied, would lead to a new international division of labor throughout the world. Countries which have already succeeded in developing a highly sophisticated technology, which gives them a monopoly in vast segments of the most complex and advanced industries of our time, persist in reviving an obsolete protectionism to prevent access to their markets of the industrial products of countries whose development is going through the initial phases of industrialization. As an argument for reviewing this regressive protectionism, claims and resistance by trade unions of some backward industries of the great Powers are alleged, with the additional demand that the developing countries avoid any confrontation in the United Nations. It is hardly an edifying spectacle when some trade unions of the great Powers lobby their Governments to prevent their making essential reforms. The fact that the racist reactions and the most anachronistic motivations of former colonialism have been transferred to and seek to perpetuate themselves in the conduct of trade unions of the nations which, because of their might, have the greatest responsibility for the preservation of peace, is not an encouraging symptom with respect to the possibility that the problems of the modern world will be managed with the equity and wisdom they require.\n84.\tTo all of this must be added the behavior of the press in certain affluent societies. That press started by giving itself the right to decide what news is important and what is not and has finally deceived itself into believing that only what is published in its pages is important. Only the negative aspects of the developing countries are of interest to them, and they consider themselves authorized not to mention events which imply positive advances in the progress of our societies. Contraband, illegal traffic in drugs, crimes, riots, frequent and irregular changes of Government, statistics on malnutrition, mortality and other consequences of backwardness these constitute the only news which they consider to be worthy of editorial mention or to be brought to the attention of their readers.\n85.\tOf course, it would be unfair to make the Governments of those affluent societies responsible for the conduct of their press, which fortunately enjoys the constitutional prerogative of freedom. My country considers that freedom of the press is essential, and we associate it with the progress achieved by mankind in establishing machinery to defend citizens and reflect public aspirations, which frequently have no spokes-man within the rigid framework created in society by vested interests. But we cannot underrate the harmful effects of what the press of the affluent societies does or fails to do at times when those responsible for foreign policy in those societies are determined to carry out sound reforms of the international order.\n86.\tOwing to the distorted image which this press presents of the underdeveloped world, further aggravated by the presumptuous superiority with which it criticizes anything reprehensible that happens in the developing countries, one would be tempted to wonder whether perhaps that press was edited on some unknown planet rather than in the same affluent societies in which successful attempts are made on the lives of high officers of the Government; crime has grown to unprecedented levels; racial and political violence has acquired hitherto unknown characteristics; and drug abuse is so rampant as to warrant the setting up of powerful illegal organizations of their nationals with abundant funds to finance the traffic in drugs and exercise an unwholesome influence abroad, resulting in the export of corruption to other societies.\n87.\tThe realities which are today apparent in the civil life of certain affluent societies are hardly edifying and hardly entitle their press to judge the conduct of the developing countries with such a notorious lack of moderation, equity and prudence.\n88.\tResponsibility in international behavior, so insistently demanded of the new countries which have recently entered the world Organization, must first be demonstrated by the great Powers conducting their foreign policies independently of the private interests and the pressure groups of their own societies. World peace and the decisive task of creating a new international order cannot depend on parochialisms which, in the guise of national interest, are frequently expressed in the conduct of the public authorities of those countries. The trade unions' appeasement of their backward industries goes in tandem with their ambiguous position towards the multinational corporations, as is shown by the debates that have been held in various United Nations forums.\n89.\tThese transnational corporations are the new and formidable institutions of modern economy; and their power, which goes beyond all national frontiers, must be subject to controls and be institutionalized in some manner. The desirability of so doing is not in the interests of the underdeveloped countries alone: the Governments of the great nations have a similar interest in not allowing a world economic power to expand unchecked to gigantic proportions without institutional limitations, since this might imply similar threats for the autonomy of the decisions of their own Governments. It is therefore surprising that there should be a lack of interest on the part of the highly developed countries in the timid efforts made in various forums of the world Organization to regulate the conduct and activities of the transnational corporations.\n90.\tWe are of course aware that iL is no easy mailer to solve the problems that I have listed here, and that each of them is influenced by powerful vested interests which hamper, and will continue lo hamper, the actions of States in their attempts to formulate a foreign policy in which the needs of mankind and the need to preserve peace throughout the world will predominate. Similarly, we must recognize that some countries whose action is decisive are gradually modifying the traditional premises of their foreign policy, and that some of their eminent men, who bear the heaviest responsibilities, are wisely and imaginatively alert to the repercussions of contemporary conflicts, and are even trying to anticipate the unknown difficulties that will confront mankind in relation to the possession and control of resources, the existence of which, until recent times, has been largely unknown. 1 am referring to the vast riches of the sea and of its various geologic strata, which, all of a sudden, seem to be the solution to many problems. At the same time, the matter of this wealth and the areas where it is to be found is becoming a fertile ground for conflicts among nations, according to the intelligent and timely observation of United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who emphasized the far-reaching implications which the decisions or the indecision of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea have and will have [2355th meeting, para. 134].\n91.\tThe same can be said of another scarce natural resource having exceptional and unique characteristics: the earth-synchronized stationary orbit of satellites.\n92.\tWe can no longer postpone a legal definition of outer space and of earth-space communications, because past experience and foreseeable developments in the next few years highlight the notorious lacunas in existing conventions on the peaceful exploration and use of outer space. Those conventions did not take into account, for example, its exploitation for gain, or the legal and physically immutable existence of segments of that earth orbit permanently placed within the territorial skies of various equatorial countries which are States Members of the United Nations, as is the case with Colombia, which is situated between approximately 70 and 75 degrees west of Greenwich.\n93.\tSince the time is drawing near when in due course we shall see the \\\"use or occupation'\\\" of such positions by commercial enterprises wishing to place such \\\"fixed radio communications stations\\\" within the territory of sovereign countries, the Government of Colombia considers it urgent to regulate the assignment of sites for fixed satellites, because it might very well happen that individuals or legal entities would claim a suigeneris kind of \\\"private sovereignty\\\" within sovereign countries, which is unacceptable to the latter.\n94.\tColombia does not object to free orbital transit or to communications requiring the devices envisaged and authorized by the International Telecommunications Convention, as long as those devices ply the territorial sky in a gravitational flight, from any practical height to infinity. But a clear exception is to be made in the case of devices which are to be fixed on a segment of their stationary orbit, because we consider that segment as one of our \\\"natural resources\\\" a resource which has always been part of our full sovereignty,\n95.\tThis session of the Assembly we are attending today is not, therefore, of a routine nature: it is taking place at a time when the world situation is such that there are grounds for faith in the wisdom of those who govern, but there are also many reasons for pessimism and fear. As the representative of Colombia , I can only express in this forum, whose prestige has been enhanced by the words of eminent personalities, the hope of my fellow citizens that in the Western and Eastern Powers the forces of self-interest will not prevail which wish to prevent removal of the obstacles which are dangerously thwarting the search for a new and more satisfactory balance between the affluent and the impoverished worlds, between the rich peoples and the vast pauperized masses of the planet, on whose discontent one cannot build a lasting international order. Let us hope that no one will yield to the temptation of thinking that power and force constitute effective instruments for the perpetuation of old policies of privilege. In the nuclear age there will be no time for a new Atlantic Charter intended to win the support of peoples whose endorsement was not won in time, in order to incorporate them into an international community less exposed to the tensions, inequalities and conflicts which today make the world tread a tightrope.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "243.\t Chile comes to this thirtieth session of the General Assembly inspired by the same spirit of cooperation which prompts all its acts in matters of international policy. Its greatest wish is to consolidate friendly relations with all States, subject only to the condition of non-interference in internal or external affairs and the maintenance of mutual respect and consideration. Its most heartfelt wish is to work for economic and social progress and for the establishment of conditions leading to international peace and security.\n244.\tChile, one of the founding Members of the United Nations, and one which collaborated most actively in the preparation of the document in San Francisco that gave life to the Organization, now reaffirms its strong adherence to the principles and purposes of our Organization and to each provision of its Charter. Chile still sees in the Charter the main safeguard for the maintenance of peace and security in a disoriented world where, despite extraordinary technological advances, poverty, hunger and backwardness have become even more obvious, and in a world where, despite the statements made by the great Powers of their desire for peace, weapons capable of destroying all mankind in a few minutes are still being accumulated. This stage of great contradictions, as described by a great American statesman, makes an unprecedented opportunity and dangers without parallel.\n245.\tUnder the mantle of an apparent detente, what has been called social imperialism continues to exploit the threat of nuclear war to obtain concessions from peace-loving Powers, and continues to give its support to subversive movements and terrorist violence, seeking to intimidate small or medium-sized nations.\n246.\tWe are not, of course, opposed to the purposes of the so-called international detente, but we are extremely concerned by the fact that, in the shape it is taking, it may be no more than a narcotic, an anesthetic to conceal from the peoples the real situation in which we are living,\n247.\tNo one should be astonished, therefore, when countries such as Chile zealously seek to give greater effectiveness to regional bodies and to renew their treaties of mutual assistance, as was done a short time ago in San Jose, Costa Rica, by the American States.\n248.\tWe are also concerned by the growing politicization of the General Assembly, a body which was not created as a forum for ideological confrontations, but rather to serve as the highest instrument of international co-operation.\n249.\tIn all sincerity I express my concern at this dangerous trend, which might even jeopardize the future of this Organization. Small but sovereign and proud countries, such as Chile, have placed all their trust and faith in the Organization. We must see to it that they are not disappointed. The responsibility lies with the Member States themselves, and I appeal to them to return to the world Organization the true role assigned to it by its principles and purposes and the machinery created to implement them.\n250.\tI shall now refer to some of the specific items on the agenda for this session and shall state, in general terms, Chile's position on them.\n251.\tMy Government feels that the Middle East problem must be solved in accordance with the texts of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. These texts, and especially resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), adopted by the Security Council, contain the three elements essential to the solution so ardently sought. First of all, it is essential that Israel withdraw its troops from the territories of the Arab countries it now occupies. After that, a just solution must be found, within the framework of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, for the plight of the Palestinian people, a solution recognizing that people's right to self-determination and national sovereignty in other words, its right to have a homeland once again. Finally, a solemn commitment must be undertaken to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of all the States in the region. Those elements influence each other and constitute a whole. If a just and lasting solution is to be reached, therefore, they must be taken as a whole. We admit that the timing of each element will not be easy to work out, but that is far from impossible.\n252.\tWe therefore welcome the agreements recently reached concerning the disengagement of forces in the Sinai peninsula as a first step towards a final solution for all the States in the area of a problem that has threatened peace and security.\n253.\tMy Government has been traditionally in favor of the universality of international organizations. In conformity with that attitude we vote in favor of the admission of ad new States Members that fulfill the requirements expressly set forth in Article 4 of the Charter.\n254.\tWe extend a most cordial welcome to the three new States that have joined the Organization: Cape Verde, Mozambique, and Sao Tome and Principe. We sincerely wish them a peaceful political and economic development.\n255.\tThe admission of three new States is truly a landmark in the decolonization policy of the United Nations. As a member of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, Chile is very pleased at the success of this policy, and we hereby renew our most enthusiastic support for it.\n256.\tWe are, however, fully aware that there still exist, especially in the African continent, colonial situations that require a just solution. In that connexion we wish to express our solidarity with the position adopted by OAU with regard to these problems.\n257.\tIn the spirit of brotherhood and peaceful coexistence that inspires its international policy, Chile invited, in early September this year, the countries of the Andean Group to conduct a joint study of the best way to achieve a limitation on military expenditure and to use the funds thus saved for the economic and social development of our peoples. The Santiago meeting, as a continuation of the one held in Lima, saw substantial progress in this field. The subjects to be studied in the immediate future were defined in greater detail and specific form was given to the ways and means of reaching general agreement on this important matter. There was a consensus that the other Latin American countries should be invited to participate in future meetings.\n258.\tDuring the conference held in Chile, my Government submitted to the other five participants a draft treaty for the strengthening of peace which, if accepted, would be open to signature by all the countries members of the Organization of American States.\n259.\tWe took that initiative to consolidate in the Andean region an atmosphere of security and peace that would be conducive to an arms limitation agreement. The essentially new element of that draft treaty is that, on the basis of the various types of aggression described in the annex to resolution 3314 (XXIX), the obligation not to commit the acts listed in that resolution is given a solemn and contractual character.\n260.\tI have the firm hope that Latin America can make rapid progress on the road to arms limitation and that it will be in a position to set an example for the world in this field.\n261.\tOn the same lines, my Government has given its full support to and has accepted resolution 3255 B (XXIX), adopted at the last session, concerning the prohibition of the use of incendiary weapons. It is, furthermore, a pleasure for me to announce that Chile will in due course ratify the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI), annex].\n262.\tChile is a party to the Antarctic Treaty and to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America. We are in favor of the establishment of other nuclear-weapon-free zones, and we welcome with special interest the initiative taken by Fiji and New Zealand in proposing the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the South Pacific [.s^e Al 10192, annex]. We have a vital interest in that ocean, on which my country has an extended coastline, and we maintain and wish to strengthen all our relations with the other countries with coastlines on that great sea.\n263.\tI am pleased to point out to this Assembly that in February last the Presidents of Bolivia and Chile decided, freely and spontaneously, to renew the diplomatic relations that had been interrupted 12 years ago. The exchange of ambassadors has made possible the establishment of a direct and active dialog for the purpose of analyzing the wishes of each country, including Bolivia's wish to obtain a sovereign outlet to the sea supplementing the free transit facilities it currently enjoys.\n264.\tThe problems are complex. They require thorough study, in an atmosphere of great tranquility that will allow for the consideration of solutions that will be mutually desirable and will facilitate the economic development of both countries. We are confident that the good will prevailing within the Governments of Chile and Bolivia will enable us to achieve realistic and final agreements.\n265.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has entered a decisive stage with the drawing up of an informal single negotiating text to serve as the basis for negotiations which should lead to the adoption, in 1976, of a treaty providing standards for all the uses of seas and oceans.\n266.\tThe delegation of Chile a maritime country par excellence which has worked actively on this subject since its inception in the former sea-bed Committee, has untiringly striven to give fresh impetus to the international negotiations and, as a member of the bureau of the Conference, was in favor of the drafting of this basic document, which allows us the optimistic expectation of a happy outcome.\n267.\tThe single text gives shape to two main legal concepts that constitute the two axes of the international solution: the exclusive economic zone of 200 miles and the international regime for the sea-bed as an expression of the concept of the common heritage of mankind.\n268.\tThe support given by universal consensus to the concept of a jurisdictional zone of 200 miles with a primarily economic content is a matter of justified satisfaction for Chile, for we were the first country to proclaim, 28 years ago, this dimension for our oceanic jurisdiction.\n269.\tThe economic zone will permit less advanced countries to develop their coastal fisheries for the benefit of their peoples; this is a project we have been able to complete successfully with Ecuador and Peru, the two countries with which we signed the South Pacific Agreement.\n270.\tThe international regime for the sea-bed will permit economic exploitation of this new frontier of mankind for the benefit of all peoples, with special regard for the developing countries. It is evident that the basic document will need substantial improvements by means of negotiations which, I am certain, will be successful.\n271.\tI now wish to refer to the repeated and slanderous accusation of violation of human rights hurled against Chile in a number of international forums and in this very Organization. A campaign, organized with no regard to cost and without parallel in the means at its disposal and the variety of systems it utilizes, has tried to centre the world's attention on a specific country because of the sole fact that this country has defeated an ideology that purported to be \\\"progressive\\\" and which had taken the country to the edge of an abyss.\n272.\tEven though as declared by Pope Paul VI last year \\\"No nation is today free of guilt where human rights are concerned\\\", it is not my intention to dwell here on the cases and the information which day by day we read about concerning arrests, political trials, murders and the suppression of civil liberties in so many nations. But what I must say is that as long as international bodies lose sight of the universal character of human rights and seek to judge certain individual countries, while at the same time assuring others who commit the same offenses of impunity, they cannot expect their agreements to have true value or to be truly respected. Even less so when those who sponsor or enter into such agreements are Governments which long have maintained repressive regimes of tyranny in which all human rights are systematically trampled underfoot.\n273.\tChile is still living under an emergency juridical regime that is not the result of our wishes or philosophy, but rather the sequel of the previous political regime, whose purpose was to impose a totalitarian doctrine on the country. It is the natural defense against terrorist action daily abetted and directed from abroad.\n274.\tThe truth is that even in the most solidly established democracies, terrorism and extremist movements have introduced a new phenomenon against which conventional penal measures are ineffectual. In a world where there is no hesitation in kidnapping or murdering innocent victims, where attempts have been made to assassinate a great President outstanding for his kindness and rectitude, we hear, paradoxically, a louder clamor of concern for the lives of the criminals than for those of the victims.\n275.\tSociety must defend itself from this cruel and bloody onslaught or perish. In the face of this dilemma, we see everywhere in the world, as the logical defense of society, the appearance of preventive and emergency legislation that to a certain extent restricts freedom and traditional legal guarantees.\n276.\tThe emergency juridical regime is not a creation of the present Chilean Government; it results from the application of constitutional norms that have been in existence for many years. They do not allow arbitrary acts. Quite to the contrary, they give guarantees to she persons to whom they are applied for reasons of public safety. Even though the exercise of some rights is suspended, there is no denial or violation of human rights, an accusation which has been unjustly leveled at us and which I categorically reject. Courts of justice are working in completely normal condition and independent of the Executive; and the emergency regime is being progressively and steadily relaxed. These limitations on certain freedoms have been accepted by the overwhelming majority of the population, who see in these provisional measures the unavoidable steps to overcome the chaos and the lack of security in which they had lived until September of 1973.\n277.\tI must recall here that these kinds of restrictions are contemplated in international documents. Such is the case, for instance, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex], ratified by Chile but not in force because many of the countries now slandering us have not given it their approval. Article 4, paragraph 1, of that text states:\n\\\"In time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed, the States Parties to the present Covenant may take measures derogating from their obligations under the present Covenant to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with their other obligations under international law and do not involve discrimination solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin.\\\"\n278.\tIn applying those emergency measures in a situation that had endangered the very life of the nation, Chile strictly followed this indispensable safeguard clause, without which the Covenant would never have been agreed upon.\n279.\tFully aware that we had been able to avoid the abyss at the last moment, of having avoided in the nick of time a civil war that would have claimed hundreds of thousands of victims, of having adopted the most indispensable security measures to maintain peace in the country, the authorities opened their doors, without any restrictions whatsoever, to every international committee, journalist or politician who cared to visit us. I must confess that we were too naive. Our experience was that many of the pseudo- \\\"observers\\\" came to us with preconceived ideas and that the only purpose of their visits was to confirm their negative prejudices. In Chile they said one thing to us, and once they had left they said something entirely different.\n280.\tNevertheless, in spite of that experience and because we are convinced that we have nothing to hide to such an extent that our frontiers remain open, with no visa requirements, to any tourist who wishes to visit us we accepted at the beginning of this year that an Ad Hoc Working Group of the Commission on Human Rights should come to Chile. Such a gesture has not been made by any of the Governments which vilify us, and is unprecedented in the history of the United Nations. The Chilean authorities, who from the beginning were ready to collaborate with the Group, were prepared to give it the necessary facilities for the discharge of its mission.\n281.\tHowever, in the discharge of the primary obligation of every Government to protect domestic peace, the Chilean Government felt, much to its regret, that it was essential to cancel the authorization for the Working Group's visit in the circumstances and in the manner that had been proposed. That decision, the decision of a sovereign State, was made for reasons given by my Government at the appropriate time, which I shall now try to summarize.\n282.\tIn the first place, a number of bodies in the United Nations system had prejudged the matter to be studied during the visit, without awaiting its outcome. In spite of the fact that the visit was imminent, the International labor Conference and the World Conference of the International Women's Year hastened to condemn Chile for alleged violations of human rights, totally ignoring the work of the Commission on Human Rights and disregarding in advance the work to be done by its Working Group. Those facts led to the logical conclusion that a political treatment would be given to the Commission's report, based on the prejudgments that had inspired the condemnations I have referred to, with no regard to the report's contents.\n283.\tSecondly, on the eve of the arrival of the Working Group the authorities detected an intention in the country to receive it in an atmosphere of internal unrest. That movement, which was encouraged and directed by foreign broadcasting stations, was aimed at filling the embassies with pseudo-political refugees and promoting sabotage and attacks on persons. It was thus an attempt to give the Working Group a false image, totally unrelated to the true situation prevailing in the country.\n284.\tThirdly, I must point out that the procedural terms of reference of the Working Group were not clearly established. There is nothing strange in that, for in the entire history of the United Nations, Chile was the first country which had accepted the idea of a visit by a Working Group to ascertain whether human rights were being respected in its territory. Other States accused of violations of those rights refused to receive similar missions.\n285.\tMy Government feels that its action in welcoming the Inter-American Committee on Human Rights and a permanent committee of the International Red Cross, which enjoyed the greatest possible freedom of action, should be duly appreciated.\n286.\tThese facts should lead us to ponder the need for the working groups of the Commission on Human Rights to be able to act in a manner different from that planned. On the one hand, a decision is necessary for the establishment of machinery of a universal character, permitting the study in situ of all allegations of violations of human rights throughout the world, without discrimination. On the other hand, the terms of reference of working groups sent to accused countries should be prepared and known in advance and for that purpose rules of procedure of general application should be prepared to direct their activities. Thus, when in future countries agree to such visits as in the exceptional case of Chile there will be guarantees and procedures established in advance for the due protection of their security and the adequate respect of their sovereignty.\n287.\tIn that connexion, the suggestions made during the general debate by a number of delegations, particularly those made by the representative of Belgium [2361st meeting], could be taken into account.\n288.\tFurthermore, I cannot fail to mention our difficulty in understanding the attitude of some countries which, during the discussions that led to the International Covenants on Human Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex], refused to implement them and thus give them international effectiveness, or that of those countries which have not yet ratified them, and are now the very ones that accuse Chile of not fully implementing them.\n289.\tIf I have referred to the emergency regime that my Government was compelled to establish, that does not mean that that regime will be permanent quite the contrary. It is being relaxed progressively and without interruption. What is more, the Government itself has sought this result through reforms of previous legislation and has granted to persons prosecuted by military tribunals a series of recourses that did not exist before September 1973, thus improving their legal situation, always protected by the rules of law. Today the same recourses granted by ordinary courts of justice can be requested and obtained. However, the Supreme Court still maintains its supervisory role over all the courts of justice in the land and exercises that right with full independence. Moreover, many prison sentences have been commuted into internal exile, and many persons who were detained by virtue of the state of siege have now been freed, among them prominent leaders of the previous Government. That is a matter of public record, since many of those persons spend their time abroad vociferating against Chile.\n290.\tProvided that peaceful conditions in the country are not affected, that terrorist and subversive activities are not encouraged by powerful broadcasting stations of Eastern Europe and the Caribbean and that the shipment of arms from abroad is stopped, we shall be able to bring the emergency regime to an end in accordance with the very best Chilean traditions.\n291.\tThat should not be interpreted as a return to a specific type of juridical structure which is now in crisis. It is obvious that even the most stable and traditional democracies are actively seeking new constitutional forms that will allow societies to adapt to the needs of modern times, to the process of technology and to the great moral, economic and social problems that man himself has created. New forms for society are now being sought in all countries because the political, social and economic structures are not consistent with today's realities, nor are they capable of tackling the problems of today's society.\n292.\tWe do not believe, for our part, that democracy, freedom and participation, which to us are fundamental concepts, are of necessity linked to a given juridical structure.\n293.\tIt is not the very foundations of democracy which have proved to be inoperative, but the machinery which expresses them. Democracy should not be, as some claim, a synonym for weakness or demagogy. On the contrary, it needs a responsible authority capable of guiding the community to see to everyone's well-being and to ensure the fundamental spiritual unity of the people in keeping with human rights and with the essence of national tradition. Without that authority democracy loses its reason for existence.\n294.\tThe Government of Chile has noted with great concern the consequences of the present international economic situation. The world economy has now embarked on a phase of remarkable instability. The new prices of oil have undoubtedly served to highlight the weaknesses of the system of economic relations among nations of the world. The present crisis affects international trade and monetary relations and it renders more acute the problem of the distribution of the world economic product.\n295.\tWe share with satisfaction the consensus reflected in resolution 3362 (S-VII) which opens new paths and lays down standards for international economic development and co-operation in solving the above-mentioned problems, achieving greater world economic balance and improving the prospects for progress in developing countries.\nMr. Thorn (Luxembourg) resumed the Chair.\n296.\tThe above-mentioned agreement reflects the new spirit which inspired the States Members of the United Nations to reach those goals which have been discussed for far too long. In this context, we associate ourselves with what was said by the Minister for External Affairs of Brazil [2355th meeting] on the desirability of negotiating, between developed and developing countries, a general agreement which will serve as a political and juridical pattern for concrete negotiations, correct distortions and fill the gaps left by existing agreements.\n297.\tIt is essential, as envisaged in the resolution, to arrive at binding agreements to protect the real prices of the exports of raw materials from developing countries.\n298.\tChile is one of the countries which have been most affected by the present crisis, owing both to the lack of fuel and to the extraordinary fall in the price of copper, which is its main export product. The effect both factors have had on us is the approximate equivalent of 50 per cent of the value of Chile's exports.\n299.\tWe are aware that the solutions of an international character to which I have referred cannot be implemented as rapidly as circumstances require. That is why the internal efforts made by countries are of vital importance. That is why Chile is now implementing an economic and social policy which requires sacrifices from all sectors of the nation. Remarkable efforts have been made to contain the hyper-inflation which was unleashed in 1973, in which prices rose by 1,000 per cent. We have now been able to reduce it by one fourth of that figure.\n300.\tOur open-door policy as regards foreign trade, accompanied by an exceptional increase in non- traditional exports and an increase in the internal production of foods, has made it possible for us to handle the most difficult periods in the present crisis. In parallel, we attach great importance to the idea of establishing a collective security network to face the fluctuations in the balance of payments which result from diminished income from the sale of raw materials. This subject is now being studied by the central banks of the continent and their success can be ensured by the participation of the international economic community.\n301.\tDuring this year we have continued our efforts to strengthen the progress of regional integration by ratifying the Protocol which creates the Council of Foreign Ministers of the member nations of the Latin American Free Trade Association. At the same time, we are actively participating in the streamlining of the machinery of the subregional Andean Pact for the purpose of making it conform to the new requirements of the international economic situation.\n302.\tWe have noted with attention the growing interest in arriving at international agreements on raw materials. Chile appreciates the great responsibility entailed by the possession of one of the greatest riches of the world copper mines. This reserve accounts for 22 per cent of the world total and the new prospects could bring it up to 30 per cent in the near future.\n303.\tThe great importance which the export of Chilean copper has in world markets has prompted us to participate in agreements with other exporting countries, such as Peru, Zaire and Zambia, for the purpose of co-ordinating policies and seeking common solutions to the problems which beset us. We welcome with deep interest the ideas expressed by the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger, and by the President of France, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, aimed at seeking a harmonious settlement in connexion with this commodity, which is of fundamental importance for the economic development of mankind. Therefore we state our wish to co-operate in the search for solutions which, while protecting the national heritage, will also be consistent with the general interest.\n304.\tConcerned over the world food crisis, we have made great efforts to increase our domestic productivity. As a result we have achieved as an average a growth of 20 per cent in our 14 major crops; this will make it possible for us to cut our food imports to half what they were in 1973,\n305.\tThe President of the Republic of Chile, after two years in office, has singled out the essential points of his five-year plan of social action. It is the fundamental goal of social development, he has stated, to make effective equal opportunities for all the people, the only differences being those which stem from lesser or greater personal aptitude.\n306.\tMy Government, in line with this concept and in full conformity with the preambular paragraphs of resolution 3362 (S-V1I), has set in motion a vast Program of social reform, improving educational as well as health prospects, dwellings, provisional standards and labor legislation. The growing number of workers' enterprises, the provisional reform, the law on compulsory training, the social status of the enterprise, a very modern law on co-operatives and a vast Program for minimum employment are some of the outstanding elements in this dynamic and effective social Program.\n307.\tIn addition, an unparalleled effort in the supply of food has been made which makes it possible to distribute 1,400,000 breakfasts and luncheons daily to students. We have now set up an important social housing Program. We have set in motion an ambitious Program of supply and distribution which consists in establishing premises for the sale of products essential for the home in the poorer sectors of the population. We have also implemented a vast Program of education and care of young children, aimed at feeding and educating children from the most needy homes. I should refer in particular to the nutritional Program, the broadest carried out in Chile, which makes it possible to give milk to 95 per cent of Chilean children from low-income families. This pro-gramme has made it possible to reduce infant mortality to the lowest figure so far reached in my country.\n308.\tChile can point with pride to a policy which, on the basis of the efforts of all its people, has enabled it to overcome the most serious crises in the last few decades. This effort, which in many forms is also being carried out by other nations, particularly the small ones, should be appreciated in its true scope by the international community.\n309.\tI should like to refer finally to a principle which since the San Francisco Conference has been considered as essential in our Organization non-interference in the internal or external affairs of States. I wish to speak about it because it is my conviction not only that that principle is not being applied but that intervention and failure to respect it become more manifest day by day on the part of certain States. This is not consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. This in no way promotes \\\"friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self- determination of peoples\\\" one of the objectives contained in Article 1 of the Charter. Article 2, paragraph 7, which prohibits the United Nations from interfering \\\"in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State\\\", is completely disregarded.\n310.\tWhat is forbidden to the Organization is with even more reason forbidden to Member States. This was recognized in the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV), annex], after a lengthy and detailed debate.\n311.\tIn the preamble of the Declaration it is stated that \\\"the strict observance by States of the obligation not to intervene in the affairs of any other State is an essential condition to ensure that nations live together in peace with one another, since the practice of any form of intervention not only violates the spirit and the letter of the Charter, but also leads to the creation of situations which threaten international peace and security\\\". In addition, the third principle defined direct or indirect acts of intervention in the internal or external affairs of States and qualified such acts as being \\\"in violation of international law\\\".\n312.\tThe same principle expressly states:\n\\\"No State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind. Also, no State shall organize, assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate subversive, terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another State, or interfere in civil strife in another State.\\\"\n313.\t1 should like to single out the following events, among many which have been taking place over the past two years and which are obvious acts of interference in the internal affairs of my country: insolent and arrogant declarations from governmental spokesmen who pronounce judgment on the internal problems of Chile and who instigate the overthrow of duly constituted authorities declarations which have been repeated even in this general debate; direct and public assistance by foreign Governments to the financing of armed subversive and terrorist activities in Chile; daily broadcasts from powerful foreign broadcasting stations intended to promote, support and instruct subversive movements whose purpose is to change by violent means the Chilean regime; utilization of economic pressure in order to have Chile subject the exercise of its sovereign rights to certain political conditions acts of interference which have taken place particularly during the renegotiation of my country's foreign debt; discrimination against Chile in trade and financial negotiations.\n314.\tThis is how some Member States are complying with the Declaration which they undertook to respect. We are not astonished by this attitude on the part of those States which systematically utilize intervention as a means of imposing their own political ideology. We are astonished, however, when it comes from States which proclaim the principles of the United Nations as the guidelines for their international policy and which therefore should be the first to abide faithfully by them.\n315.\tThe Government of Chile wishes, through me, to express clearly and sincerely its views on some of the items on the agenda of this session, on the future of the Organization and on problems which directly concern the country which I am honored to represent. This country, Chile, which has been serving the cause of peace and international collaboration in such an outstanding manner since its independence; this country, which participated actively from its creation in the former League of Nations and which contributed with enthusiasm and faith to the preparation of the Charter of the United Nations; this country which has been a sovereign State for 165 years is now the victim of attacks for the sole reason that it has recovered its traditions and its national characteristics.\n316.\tThese attacks, far from making us fearful, are received with the courage that characterizes the Chilean people, a courage and pride which we inherited from the heroic Spanish conqueror and the indomitable courage of our Araucanian aborigine. Those who attack us today, those who attempt to interfere in our internal affairs, should at least know of our history and know that the Chilean has never been subjugated to a foreign Power, has never accepted unfair and discriminatory international treatment.\n317.\tIn particular I should point out to the representatives of countries of the third world the grave danger to their full independence, often achieved after cruel struggles, represented by the reappearance in international relations of foreign interference in the internal affairs of States. I should also like to address myself to representatives of the developed Powers, large and medium-sized, to remind them that if they really wish to establish peace, security and international co-operation they should also follow closely, not in theory but in practice, the fundamental principles of international coexistence and, in particular, respect for the sovereignty of other States.\n318.\tAt the same time that we express our pleasure at our wise choice in having elected Mr. Gaston Thorn to preside over our debates during this session of the General Assembly, thus paying tribute to his brilliant diplomatic tradition and his personal merits, acknowledged by all, and to his admirable country, may I also, on behalf of Chile, express the fervent wish that in our debates the fundamental purposes of the Charter of the United Nations may always be present."

        "file_text": "2.\tMr. President, my delegation is pleased to add to the many congratulations you have already received on your election to the presidency of this the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. Your country has always been numbered among the firm upholders of the principles upon which this Organization was founded, and many of your distinguished countrymen have served it with altruism, loyalty and great distinction. You yourself, Mr. President, have unreservedly placed your considerable diplomatic skill and your unrivaled knowledge of public affairs at our disposal on many occasions, and the continual effort which the Organization makes to promote world peace owes much to the quiet but helpful influence of yourself and your famous country.\n93.\tYou follow in office the distinguished Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, whose great services to this Organization are already bearing fruit. It was his devotion to the vital interests of the developing countries, his clear-headed grasp of the issues which affect their well-being, and his firm defense of the peoples of southern Africa, not yet free, that have sharpened the commitment of all delegations to honor the principles of the United Nations by defeating the policies of racist regimes everywhere. Mr, Bouteflika has earned the gratitude of the still silent millions in Africa and elsewhere whose accredited Leaders cannot yet speak for them in this Assembly.\n94.\tI must also place on record our appreciation of the outstanding and tireless efforts of the Secretary- General, especially during the last year, in the furtherance of international peace and security.\n95.\tMy delegation welcomes to this thirtieth session the representatives of those three States that have 196\nbeen recently admitted to membership. Their admission marks yet another triumph for the Organization in accelerating the decolonization process in the fulfillment of the fundamental principle of the inalienable right of all peoples to self-determination. We note, however, with some anxiety that in Angola rival liberation movements are still snarling at and scuffling with each other in the dust of the Portuguese empire. We would urge the leaders of those factions to compose their differences in the interests of national unity so that the great Powers may no longer fight their wars by surrogate or \\\"to the last African\\\".\n96.\tIt has recently become very fashionable for some Powers to test each other's nerves outside their frontiers, at the expense of tropical nations whose slender resources are thus destroyed in quarrels which are none of their making. Peace is still indivisible, and those of us who might strive to prevent another world war do not accept that the best alter-native to that disaster is to be silent when great Powers use the peoples of Africa and Asia to test the efficacy of their weapons. The problems of the developing world cannot be solved by its extinction, and this Organization must rule that option out at once and for all time.\n97.\tThe presence in this Assembly of Mozambique and the former Portuguese Atlantic Territories of Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe and, indeed, the imminent admission of Papua New Guinea remind us that more than half the States now represented in this Assembly have emerged from colonialism, and are poor and developing. This clearly reflects the faith which all nations, large or small, developed or developing, rich or poor, have in this Organization as the proper forum for co-ordinating global efforts at solutions to international problems. But another equally important reminder to us is the intrinsic value of equal representation in this Assembly. In recent months, and even years, a rather specious doctrine has been enunciated in great-Power circles in respect of the membership of this Organization. It is now being seriously contended that some countries are worth more than others and that the numerical reality of the developing world must somehow be chiseled down to reflect the economic and military significance of the large Powers. It is interesting to note that this doctrine never existed in the period of the so-called cold war. During that unhappy period, those on both sides of the barrier threw their nets far and wide to bring new Members in to support their respective views and countries were caught in their nets like so many surprised, gasping fish. Even today, the two Viet Nams and the two Koreas are still hooked on the bait which dangles on the end of the veto.\n98.\tMoreover, in the years before the admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations, the delegations of all the small nations were ambushed, cosseted, flattered and cajoled into committing themselves to one side of the argument or the other, and told how important their countries were. Now that those turbulent times are happily over, and third- world countries are speaking and voting for themselves in the defense of their own vital interests, we are now hearing that their voting rights should be modified and that their persistence in their own defense may lead to the ineffectiveness and eventual dissolution of the Organization.\n99.\tMy delegation rejects both the argument and the cynicism on which it is based. In my own country, everyone is equal under the law. Our citizens freely elected their own Parliament as they have done for three centuries and the doctrine that some of our citizens should enjoy privileges over other citizens merely because they pay more taxes or because they bear greater burdens in the development of the society is not only unknown but would be held to be outrageous. Since our foreign policy is a reflection of our domestic arrangements, it is not possible for us to connive at what appears to be an attempt to undermine the democratic structure of this Assembly. Those who wish to deny our equality with them must first surrender the veto, or at any rate place it at the disposal of the Assembly. Small countries will not surrender either their equality or their rights to those Powers whose conception of world peace is conditioned by. their neuroses and who now find that the developing world is dragging them, kicking and screaming, out of the eighteenth century.\n100.\tI wish to stress that it is not only the principle of equality that my delegation upholds and defends. We also take our stand on the principle of the universality of this Organization. It is not only that Member States, of whatever size, have an undoubted right to be heard in this Assembly; it is also proper that members of this Assembly should not be partial in their judgments of one another. If any Member State, of whatever size, breaches the Charter or any other instrument, or ignores the weighty judgments of this Organization, such a State should certainly be heard in its own defense, but at the same time there should be an impartial reaction to each case.\n101.\tSimilarly, Member States should seek to strengthen this Organization by their encouragement of other nations, not yet members, to join it. It is therefore wrong for some of us to thwart the admission of sovereign States because they may be ideologically committed to one or other of the great Powers. It is also wrong to inhibit countries from becoming independent States by implied and even overt threats of dismemberment. My delegation looks forward to the independence and sovereignty of the people of Belize, and we would urge upon their neighbors not to put obstacles in their way but to trust to the good sense of the Belizeans to make their own contribution to the peace and stability of Central America,\n102.\tMy delegation welcomes the limited non-belligerency arrangements recently concluded between Israel and Egypt, My Government has always pleaded in this forum for a cessation of the Middle East struggle, not only because of its obvious dangers to that region and to world peace, but also because of our concern that the continuation of hostilities would impoverish the peoples of that area and so prevent their enjoyment of a normal prosperity. We have always acted and spoken with restraint because we felt that if we could not help a search for peace then at least we should not hinder it.\n103.\tThe Governments of the United States, Egypt and Israel deserve the congratulations of all people of goodwill for the persistence and courage with which they have handled a problem of such monumental difficulty. My delegation feels, however, that the pursuit of peace in the Middle East, valuable as it is, should certainly include a solution which ignores neither the elemental interest of the Palestinian people nor the right of the Israeli nation to survival. We would therefore appeal to all States to continue to be restrained in their approach to this problem and to show goodwill to all those on either side of the dispute who are still searching for peaceful and equitable solutions.\n104.\tIn like manner, my delegation takes welcome note of the recently published Helsinki Declaration. European States, in our view, have not in this century been exactly guardians of world peace, and this recent expression of their solidarity deserves the polite attention of an embattled world. But the basic fallacy which this and similar solemn declarations of political intent obscure is that it implies the possibility of achieving imaginative ends by the mere demonstration of the will. Actually imagination and will, or, to put it another way, decency and power, are in conflict. They pull in opposite directions and cannot, without the most disastrous consequences, be harnessed together. If the development of power is judged in terms of decency the judgment must necessarily be false and it has always been the fate of European political arrangements to attempt this impossible feat. But it is obviously better for States to live in peace than in pieces. One could wish, however, that these States would exercise the same restraint when their interests clash among peoples in Asia, Africa and Latin America. It would be a somewhat senseless pursuit to wreck the world just to see who finally owns the wreckage.\n105.\tThe deteriorating situation in southern Africa still gives cause for grave concern. My Government fully supported all the initiatives recently made by the distinguished heads of State of Zambia, the United Republic of Tanzania, Botswana, Mozambique and others in seeking a peaceful solution to this problem. Within that context my Government gave sympathetic goodwill to their dialog with the Republic of South Africa while at no time retreating from its declared opposition to racist regimes wherever found. It did seem that there was a slender chance of finding a solution which fully met the known aspirations of the African populations in Rhodesia and Namibia and at the same time permitted multiracialism to flourish among those peoples.\n106.\tThose hopes have been disappointed largely because the Government of the Republic of South Africa was illogically preaching detente abroad while practicing detention at home. The patent insincerity of its position has given the Smith regime an opportunity to promote and exploit differences which have sprung up between the nationalist leaderships. It is the duty of this Assembly to reassert in this new development its determination to hound these racist, regimes out of international society. It is also its duty to warn them solemnly that divisions in the nationalist camps, though regrettable, will neither postpone the overthrow of these detested regimes nor deflect world opinion from its support of African liberation. At the same time, it must be the responsibility of all States to urge upon nationalist elements in the various countries of Africa how inimical to their success disunity is.\n107.\tMore than enough has been written and spoken about the establishment of a new international economic order. My delegation has had its point of view succinctly put by our distinguished Prime Minister, Mr. Errol Barrow, before the seventh special session recently concluded. That session was noted for its atmosphere of compromise and evident willingness of both developed and developing countries to agree on practical programs of action for the creation of the new order. From that forum this Assembly has received some valuable insights into the real problems of the developing world and it remains only for States which were lavish in their sympathy to match that gesture by positive action.\n108.\tMy delegation once again wishes to emphasize that the poverty of the developing nations and the economic malaise of the richer ones have a certain organic unity. It would be pointless, therefore, to seek for solutions which are partial and time-serving. Nor will it help the developing nations if action is delayed by yet more analyses of problems and yet more identification of criteria. The richer countries can no longer hope to maneuver between cynical indifference and sentimental rhetoric.\n109.\tBarbados has long maintained that one aspect of establishing a new economic arrangement between the developed and developing countries is the creation of a new legal order for the sea. The urgency of this matter is no longer a moot point, and it is a great disappointment to the Government of Barbados that after many years of study of the issues involved, followed by three sessions of a world Conference convened by this Assembly, there cannot be concluded a new Convention on the Law of the Sea, which would have gone a long way towards stabilizing world peace and security.\n110.\tWe do not overlook the fact that some degree of consensus has emerged and indeed would hope for more during the next session scheduled for next March; but once again we urge most vigorously that conclusion of a convention be expedited. Already there are signs that some States are acting unilaterally in some areas for the exploitation of the resources of the sea. Such action will not bring about a proper and rational use of the sea and its resources. An early conclusion of an international convention on the matter is essential.\n111.\tThree decades have gone by since this Organization came into being, and for that period much can be recorded to its credit. The Organization is pledged to secure and promote international dialog as a substitute for a third world war, We have so far avoided that, although we have experienced grievous failure in achieving total world peace.\n112.\tWe have been critical of the failure to achieve the stated goals of the First and Second United Nations Development Decades and have depicted a very bleak economic picture for developing countries, and particularly the least developed of these. But we do not ignore the steady efforts of the numerous agencies of this Organization to push back the frontiers of ignorance and disease. Even where their successes have been only partial, they have been able to make some inroads upon the many difficult problems facing the human family.\n113.\tMy delegation cannot join in the fashionable denunciation of the Organization by those who wish to see it fail because their national interests would be better served or so they think by its demise. We assert that if this Organization were destroyed or even rendered ineffective, all States would very soon feel the want of it, and would immediately have to gather! together something from the wreckage of self-interest. The mere existence of this international forum has so great a bearing on the character of the contemporary world that it would be an act of the greatest folly not to maintain and strengthen its usefulness.\n114.\tOur duty is to the future. We live in a most difficult yet exciting era. The world has recognized the irrelevance of the old system, and the demand for a new one has become unanimous. The challenge has been issued and Barbados is confident that for the sake of peoples everywhere this Organization will meet its responsibility with courage, dedication and decisive action.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\n210. In the first place, Sir, I should like to express the satisfaction of the Government of the Republic of Argentina and my own personal satisfaction at your election to the position of President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. You represent an area of the world with which my country maintains traditional relations. I am happy to emphasize that your personal qualities reflect a valuable culture which has enriched my country and the legacy of which is still alive today.\n211.\tWe wish to express our great appreciation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Mr. Abdel- aziz Bouteflika, from whose dynamism and ability we benefited in the course of two intense sessions of the General Assembly and with whom I recently had the privilege of sharing the historic days of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non- Aligned Countries, held at Lima.\n212.\tI also wish to express our deep satisfaction at the entry into the United Nations of the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the People's Republic of Mozambique new countries with which Argentina will maintain ties of friendship and close co-operation within its policy of maintaining active relations with Africa. Their presence in this Assembly brings us closer to the ideal of universality which we have always advocated, and of which I shall have an opportunity to speak at greater length at another time.\n213.\tWe are living at a very special time in history. The irreconcilable enemies of the past meet today, setting aside their own ideological divergences, to find common paths which will make it possible to consolidate the future of their peoples. Detente has brought about a basic state of peace which has undoubtedly transformed relations among countries, but we are still far from the world of peace, idealism, justice and order to which the United Nations Charter points.\n214.\tThat is why there still continue to exist serious hot-beds of conflict which, tragically, lead to armed confrontation, with all its sequel of irreparable damage. That is why there are still oppressed peoples who must await their turn to exercise their right to self-determination. That is why there are still enclaves of occupation which infringe the territorial integrity of nations on various continents. War, colonialism and territorial usurpation are thus an everyday component of international reality.\n215.\tBut, at the same time, it is fair to maintain that that atmosphere of detente has made it possible to start new and fruitful courses of exchange which are the very basis of our frequently mentioned interdependence. Economic co-operation, which does not imply that anyone accepts given political ideas, grows daily, possibly because we have at last realized, with all its implications, the significance of the limited area of the earth which we share.\nMr. Rinchin (Mongolia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\n216.\tIn the hope of encouraging the trend towards positive dialog, the United Nations was established. In 1945 nobody thought that confrontations would disappear merely because a group of countries established an organization with universal purposes and goals. That consideration, valid at the outset, still applies, but the course of 30 years of life and experience shows us, in 1975, that on many occasions important agreements have been reached owing fundamentally to the vitality and political resources of the United Nations.\n217.\tTherefore, it is only just to recall the achievements of the United Nations and from them to draw the strength to weave the pattern for the future. To that end no organization can serve us better than the United Nations, which today is celebrating its thirtieth year of existence. The United Nations, whose majorities and minorities have faced each other on historic occasions is the only instrument that we have for mutual understanding and common progress.\n218.\tMay this sounding-box serve so that all States Members can state their views frankly, however divergent. May this august Assembly serve in the search for means of understanding and joint action in all those fields in which it is possible to arrive at a compromise. May it serve to hold on high for all time the essential standards which govern international coexistence.\n219.\tLet us be fully aware of our own strength, both individually and collectively, so as to alter unjust situations with which we are all concerned. Let us therefore seek to build with specific elements a more secure structure so that we may not feel we are sheltering under a non-existent ceiling. In sum, let us do everything within our power, without sacrificing our own principles, to reconcile our ideas and act jointly.\n220.\tIt is in this spirit that the Republic of Argentina, in these difficult moments, renews its support for the United Nations. We shall always be ready to give our support to our common task, which we all know is the irrevocable mandate with which mankind must sooner or later comply.\n221.\tSince the time of the League of Nations we have consistently maintained that the principle of universality must be applied in integrating the world. This approach, which is closely connected to a rejection of ideological barriers in international relations, is a basic component of the foreign policy of Argentina.\n222.\tThe universality of the United Nations is an essential condition for achieving the purposes of the Charter.\n223.\tOur delegation will therefore support the admission of all peace-loving States, as laid down in Article 4 of the Charter, and we shall oppose any measures in that field which might mean a weakening of the Organization.\n224.\tArgentina is proud to form part of a group of States within the United Nations which meets under the name of the Latin American group. We have in it heirs of the most diverse races and cultures on earth as well as representatives of different systems of government. My country, without abandoning its national convictions, realizes that it is on a secure and real basis of primary union that we will be able to forge a better future and co-operate effectively to create a better international system.\n225.\tRegional integration is a model which daily acquires greater vigor. On every continent we see the emergence, with difficulties and varying degrees of success, of this new design of co-participation.\n226.\tStatesmen of the old Europe to which you belong, Mr. President, with clear foresight set the example after the last world war by rising above traditional antagonisms and bloody confrontations to channel a handful of Powers along the fruitful path of co-operation and complementarity.\n227.\tThe fact is that the-shortening of distances and the pressing need for resources of every kind force us to come together. Only in that gathering of nations, which, we reiterate, we know to be very complex indeed in its realization, would it be possible for us to maintain our independence as sovereign entities capable of defending the vital interests of our own peoples.\n228.\tBut we have not wished only to seek understanding on the basis of geography and history. That is why we belong to the movement of non-aligned countries, in which the motives for association include very different components. I need hardly say that there, too, we maintain our beliefs and will not endorse criteria which differ from those inspired by our national traditions. At the same time, we are determined to associate ourselves in clear and decisive fashion with ideas active in the world of today and shared by distant and dissimilar countries under the mantle of non- alignment, and that is because the search for agreements among countries that have no capacity to destroy the world is an imperative that stems from our very origin.\n229.\tIt was precisely because of that independent and sovereign vocation of a young State which, from its own beginnings, had to battle against the powerful, that General Juan Peron brought into being the third- world position, which he introduced into the world at the most critical moment of the cold war. The courage and vision he demonstrated in those days serve to inspire and sustain the Argentina of today.\n230.\tWe have before us a full agenda, with many important and varied items of a political , economic, social and legal nature. The position of Argentina on these items has been stated repeatedly at this very rostrum. I therefore deem it unnecessary to repeat them here again. Suffice it once more to reaffirm, in the awareness that I speak for all the people of Argentina, the validity of the principles of the United Nations Charter, which we shall continue to strive to bring to life.\n231.\tFor this to be possible, we shall have to eradicate injustice and domination from every corner of the earth; we must do away with the scourge of discrimination and colonialism, and bring to a halt the arms race, for which the great nuclear Powers are responsible but which also is felt at the regional level, generating the consequent tensions and resulting in an unnecessary waste of resources that should be used for promoting development. Lastly, subject peoples should be given assistance to enable them freely to decide the destiny of their countries.\n232.\tIn this connexion, we cannot fail to express our satisfaction at the signing of the recent agreement between Egypt and Israel, achieved through the expectation and decision of two sovereign States which are seeking a solution to their long-standing problems by the arduous path of negotiation. We appreciate the efforts made by both sides to bring about a happy conclusion. Everything that is done to maintain peace in that so sensitive area through the use of peaceful means should be able to count on widespread support. We realize that this step is only a beginning and that many more steps must be taken in order to reach the final goal of establishing a just and lasting peace, with recognition of the legitimate rights of the peoples concerned.\n233.\tWe consider that the balanced set of principles and reciprocal obligations laid down in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is still the principal basis for the attainment of that objective.\n234.\tWe are a people convinced of the merits of negotiation. We apply this to what concerns us most directly. As is well known, my country suffers from the usurpation by a foreign Power of a part of its territory, namely the Malvinas Islands. For that question to be settled, there is no solution other than the return of those islands to the territorial patrimony of the Republic, since their occupation by force was carried out against every law and was never consented to by our country.\n235.\tIn tilth respect, I reaffirm the will of my Government to negotiate with the Government of the United Kingdom in accordance with the provisions of the resolutions and agreements adopted by the General Assembly.\n236.\tIn this connexion, I trust that the United Kingdom will finally decide to comply with the United Nations resolutions and negotiate, as early as possible, a definitive settlement of this dispute.\n237.\tThe Republic of Argentina is reassured by the recent decision taken at Lima at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries with regard to the Malvinas Islands. The solidarity in our cause is proof of the identity of interests that binds all its members together.\n238.\tIn the Lima Program for Mutual Assistance and Solidarity [AII0217 and Corr.l] the right of my country was clearly recognized and the application, in this specific case, of the principle of self-determination was excluded, in view of the fact that the British occupation constitutes a violation of the principle of territorial integrity specifically laid down in resolution 1514 (XV).\n239.\tThe Lima Declaration strengthens the purpose of Argentina to secure, in the briefest possible time, a return of the Malvinas Islands to the national patrimony by the course indicated in resolutions 2065 (XX) and 3160 (XXVIII).\n240.\tMy delegation wishes to express its satisfaction at the results of the work of the seventh special session, devoted to development and international economic co-operation. That session was a significant milestone because of the undoubted progress made in the areas covered by its agenda. What is even more important is that that progress was achieved through a dialog that made it possible to determine more accurately where we are and where we want to go.\n241.\tThe developing countries evinced a desire to reduce areas of friction and concentrated their efforts on specific items that offer opportunities for effective international co-operation with the industrialized world.\n242.\tThe developed countries, for their part, demonstrated a praiseworthy capacity to adjust to new conditions through a renewal of ideas and a constructive spirit, all of which leads us to believe that we shall be able to proceed from words to deeds.\n243.\tMuch needs to be done to bring us closer to the rule of international social and economic justice, which is a permanent objective of the foreign policy of my country. But we must clearly understand that only to the extent that we go forward to greater justice in international economic relations will it be possible for us to go beyond a policy of sterile confrontation to one of fruitful co-operation.\n244.\tFor us, the idea of co-operation is not incompatible with acceptance of the conflicting nature of relationships between the developed world and the developing countries. What is more, recent experience shows that we can move forward in the direction of co-operation on the basis of a recognition of the diversity of interests, and even of the fact that confrontation is not sterile when it engenders positive attitudes leading to solutions that benefit all.\n245.\tIn that context what is necessary is to do away with the distorting factors as a result of which those who have the most receive not only the products of their own efforts but also additional benefits that accrue because the rules of the game accentuate the structural disadvantages that are typical of the developing countries. These rules basically include the mechanisms which determine international prices, the monetary and financial system, the transfer of technology, and external debt servicing. Those factors cause the developing countries with alarming frequency to receive less for their efforts than their real value.\n246.\tThe world economic recession imposes excessive burdens on the economies of the developing countries which, unlike the developed countries, lack the resources and means to correct these imbalances. It is the urgent duty of the international community to find measures to assist the developing countries in eliminating the bottlenecks from which they suffer in the external sector of their economies and which the world crisis has aggravated. We are studying the various proposals which have recently been made in regard to an increase in foreign private investment, the important role of which in the integral development of our peoples we are the first to recognize. Furthermore, without any ideological pre-conceptions, we are open to any positive contribution to our development.\n247.\tAnd now I should like to bring before the Assembly a concern which I am sure is shared by many of those who are listening to me: it relates to a growing tendency to accord less and less attention in international organizations for financial and technical cooperation and assistance to those States which have reached a certain relative degree of development. In mentioning this concern we are certainly not objecting to the justified efforts being made in these forums for the benefit of the neediest, still less trying to undermine them. Argentina has always supported, and will continue to support, special measures in favor of these countries. But what we do insist on is that those which have reached a certain degree of development, as is typically the case in Latin America, should not be left out in the activities of these organizations in which many times our continent led the way on the paths now followed by the international community.\n248.\tLatin America is in a position to assist not only with ideas but also, as we have proved, with specific contributions within the concept of an essentially dynamic and multiplying international co-operation. Proof of this is the initiative taken to give a new dimension to technical co-operation whereby the abilities and experience of the developing countries could be used to the full. We are very happy that, for the first time within the framework of the United Nations, provision has been made for an intergovernmental meeting on a world scale to promote this new form of co-operation.\n249.\tThe world has become aware that resources are limited and that it is therefore necessary to avoid their waste by using them rationally. The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm in 1972, represented official recognition of this new state of affairs and offered solutions on the basis of the fruitful principles of co-operation. Given the problem of a scarcity of resources, cooperation is no longer an alternative but the only way, since it is only by joint effort on the part of the international community that we shall arrive at an effective solution.\n250.\tThe United Nations Water Conference, to be held in 1977, will be an important opportunity for the international community to put to the test the principles which were defined at Stockholm. My country trusts that it will be successful and will represent another milestone in this process of growing co-operation.\n251.\tThirty years of activity by the United Nations in the economic and social fields provide us with sufficient perspective for judging the effectiveness of the units which constitute it in this regard. We have observed with some anxiety that greater efforts have been invested in creating new bodies than in solving old problems. We must adjust the structure of the system to present needs, which in turn will constitute the focus of the concerns of the international community in the remainder of this century. We believe that the time has come to make the objective of economic and social development the central concern of the United Nations, because increasingly the reduction of the existing disparity between the developed and the developing worlds will represent the best guarantee for the maintenance of international peace and security.\n252.\tThe same determination and effectiveness which the system has shown in pursuing the objective of eliminating colonialism as a political phenomenon must from now on be displayed in the work of liberating peoples from the less obvious but no less pernicious forms of economic dependence.\n253.\tThe almost unanimous recognition by Member States of the need to advance slowly but surely towards the establishment of a new international economic order allows us to hope that this process of liberation is already under way.\n254.\tFor it to become a reality we must clearly be aware that no reordering or restructuring of the system can make up for an absence of political will which is indispensable if we wish to make this Organization serve the cause that cannot but respond to the needs of this critical-time in the history of mankind."

        "file_text": "81.\t It is my privilege and pleasure, on behalf of my delegation and myself, to extend to you, Mr. President, our warm congratulations and good wishes on your election as President of the thirtieth regular session of the General Assembly. You have assumed this high office at a very significant moment in the history of this world Organization, when we are at a turning-point in the thirtieth year of its life. We are fortunate indeed to have the benefit of your outstanding ability, wide experience and dynamism in directing our deliberations during this important session. Your election is also a tribute to your country and its people and to its traditional policy of conciliation and co-operation. I assure you of my delegation's full support in the discharge of your onerous responsibilities.\n182.\tYour predecessor, the Foreign Minister of Algeria, Mr. Bouteflika, will be long remembered both for his able direction of the twenty-ninth session and for the constructive achievements of the seventh special session. Under his leadership we were able to accomplish much that is valuable and of lasting significance.\n183.\tTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, we should like to express our appreciation for his ceaseless energy and total dedication to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. His wise counsel and his gentle persistence in drawing attention to the fundamental problems facing mankind have enhanced the prestige of the United Nations. We extend to him our continued support.\n184.\tAnyone who has the privilege of standing at this rostrum to address the General Assembly must be keenly aware of a special sense of responsibility, because the United Nations is an instrument for shaping the destiny of mankind. How we fulfill this responsibility will depend upon the perception of our common mission and our firm resolve to implement our decisions. Our mission, as expressed in the Charter of our Organization, is to secure peace and justice for all mankind. Our duty is to the peoples of all nations and our objective is the molding of a world based on peace and co-operation, not on its division into three or more worlds separated by conflict and inequality. The growing awareness of interdependence between peoples and nations, each conscious and responsive to the basic needs and legitimate aspirations of the other, marks the hopeful beginning of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n185.\tThree decades ago our founding fathers conceived of this Organization as a means for harmonizing the views and actions of States in a common effort \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\" and \\\"to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\\\". An embittered world, shattered by the destructive fury of war, was soon enmeshed in the hostile confrontation of opposing military alliances. The cold war threatened to nullify the hopes enshrined in our Charter. Vast numbers of people still lived under colonial subjugation  and for them the Charter could have no meaning until they were freed from foreign domination.\n186.\tMany old empires have since been dismantled and colonial rule has been ended in most parts of the world, signifying the victory of the forces of national liberation. The United Nations has made its own contribution to expediting this process. More than half of the delegations present here represent countries liberated from colonial rule. We have watched with profound satisfaction the Organization move steadily closer to its goal of full universality. We are happy to welcome among us this year delegations from the sovereign States of Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe. We are confident that their participation in our work will add to the strength of our Organization. We look forward to welcoming Papua New Guinea in the very near future.\n187.\tWe have before us a heavy agenda, which illustrates the principal problems facing the world today. Some items have remained on the agenda year after year, testifying to their complexity and intractability. Other items are relatively new, which is an indication of the growing awareness of a rapidly changing world. It is not my intention on this occasion to express our views on all these problems. My delegation will have other opportunities for making our views known during this session. The very fact that these global problems are before us is evidence of the reality of the interdependence of peoples and nations, and a recognition that the United Nations constitutes the appropriate forum for their solution through our collective efforts. Mere recognition of this fact is not enough, however, and, in the words of the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization \\\"... we must now go forward from deliberation to action, from confrontation to co-operation and from eloquently expressed allegiance to principles to the far more difficult task of making those principles a reality.\\\" [AllOOOIIAdd.l, sect. XXI.]\n188.\tMany newly independent nations of the world, including my own, repudiated the concept of the cold war and chose the path of non-alignment and peaceful coexistence. Today there is widespread understanding and acceptance of the policy of non-alignment and its relevance and importance. In the United Nations the non-aligned countries have consistently worked to democratize international relations and to move from confrontation and deadlock into new fields of co-operative endeavor. The foreign ministers of the non-aligned countries, meeting in Lima last month, pledged themselves afresh to continue their efforts to achieve a new world order based on justice and equality.\n189.\tThe maintenance of peace must be our first objective, and problems related to this question must continue to occupy our minds with a sense of urgency. Peace reigns today in Indo-China after many years of war, and this is indeed a matter of great satisfaction for all of us. However, the legacy of the past seems to cloud the vision of some. The rejection by the Security Council of the requests of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam to join the United Nations adds to the sorry record of United Nations inertia on Viet Nam. There is no doubt about the eligibility of those States for admission; we should welcome them to this Organization, which will benefit from their co-operation. The international community should do all it can to heal the wounds of war and assist in the reconstruction of the shattered economies of the countries of Indo-China. India is willing and prepared to make its contribution to this effort.\n190.\tThe situation in the Middle East remains critical. There can be no enduring peace in the region until Israel vacates all the Arab territories it occupied by aggression and until the national rights of the Arab people of Palestine are restored. Meanwhile, an agreement has been reached between Egypt and Israel for a limited further Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai. This will be an important and positive development, provided it contributes to the reduction of tensions in that area and leads to the speedy resolution of the basic problems. However, the intransigent and obstructive attitude of Israel, which is receiving a considerable amount of sophisticated military hardware, gives cause for serious concern. It is the clear duty of the United Nations, in conformity with the provisions of the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, to explore all avenues open to it for securing the removal of the Israeli presence from Arab territories. It is also our duty to continue our efforts to restore to the Palestinian people their national rights. We firmly believe that the unity of the Arab countries, together with the continued supporting action of the international community, would enable them to regain their lost territories and secure the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people.\n191.\tIn Cyprus, too, there is still an uneasy stalemate the continuance of which may well endanger its territorial integrity. Prolonged neglect of the underlying causes of inter-communal differences has led to external interventions and the virtual partition of the country, resulting in thousands of people leaving their homes in search of safety. At the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly last year, we unanimously adopted resolution 3212 (XXIX), which established an agreed framework for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the island and the settlement of the problems between the two communities. Progress in its implementation, however, has been slow, even though the leaders of the two communities have held talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General. Given good will and practical good sense, the problem can be resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the two communities and without prejudice to the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus. We have every confidence that the Secretary-General will persevere in his efforts to bring the two communities together to seek a mutually acceptable solution.\n192.\tThe continuance of multilateral military alliances conceived in the context of great-Power rivalry and the induction of vast quantities of military hardware into countries belonging to these alliances is a source of continuing tension and instability in the Indian Ocean area. The expansion of the Diego Garcia base, against the declared wishes of the littoral States of the Indian Ocean, is of serious concern. We urge the great Powers and other major maritime users to respect the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, in conformity with the Declaration adopted by the United Nations in 1971 [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. We also call for the early dissolution of the military pacts conceived in the context of great-Power rivalry and the dismantling of foreign military bases established in that context.\n193.\tWe have continued to make every effort to strengthen our friendship and understanding with the countries of our region. India is ready, within the limits of its means, to contribute to the development of our region through trade and closer economic links. We have .continued to implement the Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972-'' both in spirit and in letter. It is our earnest hope that we shall achieve in the near future the objective of peace and co-operation among the States in the subcontinent.\n194.\tThe decolonization of the Portuguese empire has proceeded with commendable rapidity. We rejoice in the notable successes achieved by the national liberation movements. However, the process of national liberation is as yet incomplete, and we must address ourselves to the problems in the remaining Territories whose people are still living under colonial and foreign domination.\n195.\tThe transition of Angola to independence has been marked by violent clashes between liberation movements. We have followed these developments with concern, because in the last analysis it is the people of Angola who will be the victims of the struggle for power between political parties. We hope that the Organization of African Unity will find it possible to establish a basis for peace and co-operation among the different liberation groups.\n196.\tIn southern Africa we are nowhere near a solution of the triple problem of securing the independence of Namibia, the rule of the majority in Zimbabwe and the eradication of the policy of apartheid. These are all interrelated questions and they have to be tackled together. The presence in Namibia of the administration of the white racist regime of South Africa has been declared illegal. The United Nations has been standing ready to take over temporarily the administration of Namibia pending transfer of power to the people. And yet the South African Government flagrantly continues to defy the United Nations. There is no clearer case for intervention by the United Nations and we would call for effective and resolute United Nations action against South Africa.\n197.\tThe illegal minority regime of Smith in Zimbabwe evidently continues to be bolstered by the support of the South African Government. There is no honorable way out for this regime except to release all political prisoners, convene a constitutional conference of the legitimate leaders of the people and make arrangements for the inevitable transition to majority rule. The United Kingdom has a special responsibility in this regard and we hope that it will play an effective role. Unfortunately, even the imposition of sanctions by the Security Council has not brought about the desired result, although they may have had some impact. There are reports that the Smith regime is arranging meetings with national political leaders with the purpose of dividing them and compelling them to agree to unacceptable settlements. It is clear that the United Nations should continue to lend all support to the liberation movement in Zimbabwe.\n198.\tThe question of apartheid has been before the United Nations in one form or another since 1946, and the appeals of the General Assembly have had no effect whatsoever on the racist regime in South Africa. This regime has remained indifferent to the diplomatic isolation in which it finds itself. We deplore that the trade boycott and arms embargo imposed by the United Nations have been ineffective. As a result, South Africa continues to pursue its pernicious policy of segregating the tribal people in separate bantustans, forcibly removing them from their homes and subjecting them to humiliating restrictions. South Africa's continued enforcement of the apartheid system in total disregard of United Nations resolutions led to the rejection of the credentials of its representatives and their consequent exclusion from the current session of the General Assembly. Even this has had little effect on the white racist regime in Pretoria, or indeed on its supporters. There is no alternative but to strengthen the hands of the fighters for freedom and liberation from this iniquitous regime.\n199.\tI have referred to matters that are at present, the focus of international tension where critical situations prevail. Certain hopeful developments in Europe may also be noted. We welcome the signature on 1 August by 35 Governments at Helsinki of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which establishes the basis for the preservation of peace and future co-operation in that continent. Since Europe has been the historical spawning ground for world wars in the past, this agreement has great significance. However, detente in Europe can have real meaning for the rest of the world only if this process is extended to other continents, and particularly to the crisis situations of today.\n200.\tThe full potential of detente cannot be realized until there is a transfer of real resources from military expenditure to areas that are of vital concern for the general well-being of mankind. The very first resolution adopted by the first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations concerned disarmament. That was only natural, as the question of disarmament was an important preoccupation of the League of Nations and it was inevitable that its successor, the United Nations, established in the wake of the last world war, should as a matter of first priority concern itself with disarmament. In the 30 years since the creation of this Organization and despite the regular annual appeals for disarmament, especially nuclear disarmament, there has been virtually no progress. Instead, we have been witness to an incredible arms race involving the stockpiling of nuclear weapons and other means of mass destruction on a scale that brings into question the sanity of such measures. The global expenditure on the arms race is on the order of $300,000 million per annum, when the world is crying out for resources to relieve hunger, poverty and social injustice. We are nowhere near even considering any serious measures concerning nuclear disarmament, which clearly deserve the highest priority. We have had world conferences on food, population, the environment, industrialization, the law of the sea, the role of women and so forth, but we have not yet been able to agree on a world conference on disarmament. This is truly a tragic commentary on the state of the world, which has lost its awareness of and sensitivity to the dangers facing it.\n201.\tPeace is the foundation for progress. At the same time, an enduring peace cannot be achieved until the growing economic disparities in the world have been overcome. We are now in the middle of the Second United Nations Development Decade, and, despite the various measures recommended by the United Nations, the vast majority of developing countries are still facing unfavorable trade patterns and extremely heavy debt burdens. Such inequalities among nations are the cause of our present discontent. These have to be reversed if we are to move on to true interdependence as between equals, which is the compelling need of today. It is true that the reality of the interdependence of all nations is coming to be recognized more and more, but the problems it poses are only just beginning to be appreciated. The Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, adopted at the sixth special session [resolutions 3201 (S-Vl) and 3202 (S- VI)], and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, adopted at the twenty-ninth session [resolution 3281 {XXIX)), are important milestones in our journey towards the goal of interdependence. They call for measures of unprecedented scope, the most important of which, if I may say so, is bridging the gap between the minds of the developed and the developing countries.\n202.\tThe seventh special session has made a serious attempt to identify problems in detail, to locate some available resources, to pursue further studies of important questions and above all to engage in negotiations with a view to exploring whether a meeting of minds is possible. The achievements of that session should neither be overestimated nor underestimated. Developing countries cannot look upon the final document of the seventh special session [resolution 3362 (S-VII)] with unmixed satisfaction. However, it is an opening, and if the decisions are implemented in good faith and speedily, further fruitful dialog can be continued on the outstanding issues so that the world economic imbalance can be redressed and the terms of trade for developing countries can be really improved. The status quo should change in the direction of a new and equitable economic order, and proof of this has surely to come from the concrete actions of the developed countries.\n203.\tThe problem of under-development is as important in the economic and social field as decolonization is in the political field and constitutes a challenge facing the United Nations in the years to come. The United Nations is a unique instrument for fostering co-operation based on equality, and its structures and procedures need to be adapted with wisdom and vision to meet the unprecedented challenges of the future.\n204.\tI should like to conclude by recalling the words of my Prime Minister in her address to this Assembly on 23 October 1970, when she emphasized India's profound commitment to peace and the evolution of a new world order. She said:\n\\\"We have always affirmed that the way of the world should be not power but peace, not confrontation but co-operation. The world is not for destruction; it is for development. . . .\n\\\"The irony is that we have the means and we see the vision, but we lack the will and the trust to take the one big step forward. . . .\n\\\"In the years to come let the United Nations strive to bring about an era of international transformation by consent, a new era of justice and peace.\\\"4\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I express to you the congratulations of the Government of Sweden on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Your experience and the distinction you have shown as Prime Minister of Luxembourg, and your gifts as an eminent statesman will be of great significance in this session. May I also express to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, Sweden's appreciation of his untiring efforts in promoting the ideals of the United Nations.\n90.\tThis autumn, the United Nations can look back on three decades of service to the cause of peace and international co-operation. This year, nearly three times as many nations are represented here in New York as at the first meeting in San Francisco. The United Nations' sphere of activity has constantly been expanded. The fundamental issue of a more equitable and rational distribution of the world's resources has become central to the work of the Organization.\n91.\tThe United Nations has furthered the security and well-being of all the peoples of the world. Cooperation here has been an important element in efforts to overcome grave conflicts. The Middle East, the Congo, Cyprus and Kashmir are but a few examples. For all its imperfections, this co-operation has none the less been necessary for maintaining international peace and security. International opinion has been articulated in this forum and this, no doubt, has helped in preserving world peace.\n92.\tMy compatriot, the late Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold, once stated that the United Nations \\\"had become the foremost platform and principal protector of interests for the many nations that feel strong as members of the international family but are weak in isolation.\\\" This is still true. We know that there are still a few rich and powerful countries that dominate this world technologically and economically, politically and militarily. One of the important tasks of the United Nations is to impress upon those States the need to use their superior resources in a way that takes full account of the interests of weaker States. It is also important that these latter States not be made the losers through agreements concluded between the great Powers in the name of detente.\n93.\tIn today's international situation it should be in the interests of the great Powers to anchor their settlements in the United Nations, and in this way let all States share in decision-making and responsibility. The Secretary-General issues a warning in his report on the work of the Organization that, as important matters are decided outside the United Nations and over the heads of its Members, doubts will increase about the value of the United Nations as a guardian of peace. We share this concern.\n94.\tMore than 100 of the Member States now belong to the third world. Their problems quite naturally dominate the work of the Organization. The questions of health, hunger and unemployment, so vital to the majority of mankind, have now been given greater \nweight. In the framework of this Organization demands for equitable relations between the poor and the rich countries have been formulated under the sign of a new economic world order. These questions might usefully be discussed also in other forums. But the Swedish Government considers it important that the work in this field also should in the future be pursued mainly under the auspices of the United Nations.\nMr. de la Flor Valle (Peru), Vice-President, took the Chair.\n95.\tIn a number of areas this Organization provides both an instrument for negotiations and a forum for the formulation of political guidelines. The seventh special session proved this point. Even if fundamental conflicts of interest remain, developed and developing countries negotiated in a spirit of cooperation. They agreed on a text, which will be the framework for our future efforts at agreement. Thus, the endeavors of the developing countries to eradicate poverty and to achieve greater economic independence, increased control over their own resources and a broader influence on decision-making on global economic issues have achieved new momentum. This is due not least to the solidarity among all the developing countries.\n96.\tWe in the industrialized part of the world must now go further in meeting the justified demands of the poor countries. In doing so we cannot be blind to the fact that a changed economic world order will have practical consequences for us in our own everyday life. Such consequences we must learn to accept. International solidarity demands it. Change, not status quo, is also in our own long-range interest. As long as injustice, exploitation and misery prevail for the majority of mankind there can be no future in peace and freedom.\n97.\tIf the United Nations is to play its legitimate, pre-eminent role, it must be fully representative of the entire international community. Sweden is convinced of the necessity for universality. The participation of all States, both large and small, and particularly of those that are embroiled in conflict, is essential if the United Nations is to make an effective contribution to international peace and security.\n98.\tEfforts to keep out States that wish to be Members of tile United Nations are regrettable. Therefore we must deplore the fact that a great-Power veto in the Security Council has prevented the two States in Viet Nam from being admitted as new Members of the United Nations. The Vietnamese people have been fighting for national independence for decades. They have been subjected to the terrible suffering of modern warfare. This year the people of Viet Nam have at last won peace and independence. It is high time that they also be represented in this world Organization.\n99.\tWe welcome the States which have become Members of the United Nations this year: Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe. All three States were formerly under Portuguese colonial rule. Their long and arduous struggle for freedom and independence has at last resulted in a victory of his-toric significance. The will and the solidarity of the oppressed have proved their strength. The fact that we now have these three new Member States in our midst is also due in no small measure to the prompt and consistent decolonization policy of the new Portuguese regime. This policy deserves the appreciation of the rest of the world.\n100.\tSweden has been a member of the Security Council for almost a year. During that time decisions have been made on the Cyprus issue, one result of which has been new negotiations. We appeal to the parties concerned to proceed on the road to compromise so that the people in that much afflicted country may finally return to peaceful, normal life, while preserving the independence and territorial integrity of the island.\n101.\tIn the Middle East a new interim agreement has been concluded between Israel and Egypt. We have greeted that agreement with satisfaction in the hope that it may constitute a step on the road to lasting peace in the area. Such peace cannot, however, be established until all parties concerned have reached a comprehensive settlement in accordance with all the provisions contained in the resolutions of the Security Council, and taking into account also the legitimate interests of the Palestine Arabs and their justified demands for national self-determination. It is therefore of great importance that the momentum for peaceful change is used for further negotiations. The Security Council should prolong the mandate of the peacekeeping forces in Sinai, which play an important role in reducing the risk of armed conflicts.\n102.\tWith regard to southern Africa, the Security Council has not been able to agree on further measures against South Africa's apartheid policy and that country's unlawful occupation of Namibia after its refusal to meet the demands of the Council. In the Swedish view, the Council should increase the pressure on the Government in Pretoria. We are of the opinion that the situation constitutes a threat to the peace within the meaning of the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and that therefore sanctions are justified. Accordingly, when the Security Council dealt with the question of Namibia we voted in favor of the proposal for a compulsory weapons embargo.\n103.\tRacial segregation in South Africa is one of the most striking examples of how human rights are still being disregarded and trampled underfoot in many parts of the world. Another particularly distressing example is the grave violation of fundamental human rights in Chile under the present dictatorship. The refusal of the military junta to admit a study group from the United Nations Commission on Human Rights reveals that their rule cannot stand up to investigation. This month, two years after the overthrow of the popularly elected President Allende, people throughout the world are demonstrating their wrath at the oppression in Chile and their solidarity with its victims. The mobilization of international opinion against the rule of terror by the junta must not abate.\n104.\tBut also in other countries, under less scrutiny in the United Nations, people are being deprived of their fundamental rights. The international community must react against all forms of oppression and terror, wherever they take place. The struggle against torture and inhumane treatment, one of the items on our agenda, must this year make real headway. The United\nNations must continue to work for the abolition of capital punishment in all countries. We are constantly being reminded of the necessity of this task.\n105.\tMoreover, let me emphasize the deplorable lack of respect for political dissidents, of which we receive daily evidence. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights endorses the right of every human being to hold whatever opinions he wishes, to express whatever thoughts he wishes, without interference. None the less, people are being thrown into prison in a great many countries, their only crime being that they have expressed inconvenient thoughts. Amnesty International is an organization that deserves much credit for the way in which it has focused the attention of the world on the fate of many of these people. In Sweden's view, the United Nations has an important task in this field.\n106.\tCondemnation of this kind of persecution is not unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Respect for human rights is essential to friendly relations and co-operation between States. This principle has been endorsed in the document signed at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at Helsinki this summer. That Conference has shown that the situation in Europe has been further stabilized and that concrete co-operation between States can be developed in spite of differences in ideology and social systems. The fact that a continent whose internal conflicts have led to world war twice in this century has embarked on such cooperation is in the interest not only of the participating countries but of the world as a whole. We know that further progress on this road depends on the continued efforts at detente between the big Powers.\n107.\tI would like to emphasize that the contacts and co-operation between the European and North American States must not be isolated from the global context, must not be regarded as co-operation for the mutual benefit of these countries alone. Increased political and economic co-operation between the leading industrialized countries designed only to further their own interests would consolidate the inequitable distribution of power and resources. Following the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the participating States should be able to shoulder greater responsibility for peace and equity between all the peoples of the world.\n108.\tInternational solidarity goes hand-in-hand with solidarity at home. A foreign policy pursued in the spirit of solidarity is furthered by a national policy that also has solidarity as one of its corner-stones. Social and economic security, equality between men and women, the participation of all citizens in decisions affecting their daily lives at work and in society as a whole are reforms that create social cohesion. But they also promote solidarity between nations.\n109.\tIt would not be right for me to conclude these remarks without drawing attention to the area where, in our view, the United Nations has made least progress. I refer to the field of disarmament.\n110.\tWhen the United Nations was founded, in the shadow of the Second World War, one of its fundamental aims was to promote international peace and security by disarmament. So far, no decisive steps have been taken to reach this goal. Despite the intensive negotiations of the past decade, no real disarmament has been achieved. Military arsenals are still at a very high level. In some countries they continue to grow.\n111.\tThe military balance of terror can perhaps at present be described as a kind of guarantee for peace. But in the long run, it is no reliable foundation for a peaceful world order. The high level of mutual military preparedness and the huge arsenals of arms can themselves constitute risks of incidents and clashes. If we are serious when we speak of a climate of political detente, then we should also pay greater attention to the opportunities for real disarmament which this very situation may afford. It is also obvious that if the process of political detente is to last and deepen, it must be sustained by measures aimed at reducing standing forces and, most importantly, at initiating genuine disarmament.\n112.\tIn a closely related area international humanitarian law it appears that some progress is within reach. I am thinking of new rules concerning the protection of the civilian population during armed conflicts, as well as prohibition or limitation of the use of certain particularly cruel weapons. We believe that the prohibition of employing such weapons, based on humanitarian motives, may also in certain cases be a first step towards real disarmament in the form of bans on production and proliferation.\n113.\tThirty years ago, the very first nuclear charge was exploded. Since then the world's arsenal of nuclear weapons has been constantly growing. For a long time, it has been large enough to wipe out our entire civilization. In addition, arsenals of conventional weapons have reached levels that were quite inconceivable at the end of the Second World War. While the risk of a devastating war has thus increased, enormous human and material resources have been swallowed up that could have been used for effective economic and social policies for the well-being of our peoples.\n114.\tTo attain results in the field of disarmament, a heavy responsibility rests primarily on the two nuclear super-Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union. We welcome the ongoing efforts made by these States to limit the most destructive weapons by means of bilateral talks, But, at the same time, we have to note that these talks have so far made no contribution to real disarmament. On the contrary, some agreements reached actually permit rearmament up to certain levels.\n115.\tBy voluntarily refraining from procuring nuclear weapons, many non-nuclear States have demonstrated their belief that it is still possible to raise an effective barrier against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Putting an effective stop to proliferation depends on several conditions. One is that the peaceful use of nuclear energy everywhere, and thus also in the nuclear-weapon States is subjected to as efficient measures of international control as possible. Another is that the States which have not done so now adhere to the non-proliferation Treaty. But most important of all is that the two leading great Powers as a matter of urgency make definite commitments in the nuclear disarmament field. Particularly, I wish to emphasize the urgent necessity of a complete ban of all nuclear-weapon tests. Sweden has long been working to achieve an agreement in this field and will continue to do so. In 1971 we submitted in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament a draft treaty aimed at achieving a complete test ban. This question will have a prominent place on the agenda of this Assembly, a fact which we welcome.\n116.\tThe main responsibility for achieving real disarmament lies with the super Powers. But it is the duty of all States and of the entire international community to press for energetic endeavors to this end and to contribute to the success of such efforts. Only in that way can we build a safer future for mankind. We welcome the emphasis that the Secretary-General puts on the compelling need for disarmament in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization. We support the suggestion that the United Nations should be enabled to play a more prominent role in the efforts to make real progress towards a world free from fear.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t Sir, may I extend to you my congratulations on your election as President of this thirtieth session of the General Assembly. Your election to this office is a recognition of your personal qualities and an expression of appreciation for your services to your country and to the international community, as well as an acknowledgment of the role of your country, Luxembourg, in the international field. I wish to extend my thanks also to your predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, for presiding over the last session efficiently, actively and successfully.\n2.\tJordan would like also to welcome the admission of the three new Members to our Organization namely, the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, and the People's Republic of Mozambique and wishes them success and prosperity.\n3.\tI should like also to express our appreciation and admiration to the Secretary-General, who has invariably proved to be competent and sincere in the pursuance of the goals of the Charter and the aims of the United Nations, and has always taken up the responsibilities of his office with enthusiasm, faith and wisdom.\n4.\tThis session is held in an international situation characterized by two major aspects: detente and tension.\n5.\tThe first aspect detente is a process that has grown slowly, but clearly, in the relations between the two super-Powers and in the various international regions directly affected by those relations, particularly Europe. The second tension is a trend that for years has dominated the relationship of the North with the South that is, of the developed industrialized countries with the poorer developing States, a relationship that we hope will ultimately vanish.\n6.\tInternational detente is a trend which we hope will expand in scope and take root; we hope to see its link with responsibility in international relations and with global justice reinforced and enhanced. The only essential element without which no secure and safe international community can exist is the safety of the world from a destructive confrontation between the two giant camps, and that is the one basis for international relations. Thus, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe was a culmination of concrete and calculated steps to build international detente, and a major advance in the cause of international peace.\n7.\tWhile Europe is the main arena of this detente, it is our hope that detente will expand its scope, as long as there is agreement between the super-Powers not to freeze the status quo, with all its faults and injustices, but rather to lessen the drive towards destructive confrontations so far removed from reason and moral checks.\n8.\tThe main source of tension in our contemporary world has, however, shifted to relations between the industrialized States and the overwhelming majority of the countries of the world that suffer from poverty or economic under-development. The basis of this tension may not be new, since it is a reflection of the unequal nature of the relations that have prevailed in several phases of the modern history of the world between the militarily mighty and economically strong nations on the one hand and the peoples under their domination and exploitation on the other.\n9.\tDuring the last decades the modern world and the United Nations have both witnessed the decline of colonialism as an institution through the virtual fading away of the last remnants of direct colonialism. Yet the world and the United Nations have yet to witness the establishment of equal and equitable economic relations between the developed industrialized countries and the developing nations that constitute the majority of the world. This fact was! recorded in all sincerity and clarity by the United Nations at the sixth special session on raw materials and development, which resulted in historic and decisive documents dealing with the subjects of development and healthy international economic relations [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-V1)\\. The countries with the strongest economies and the greatest industrial capability expressed their reservations, thus aborting the possibility of the speedy and successful implementation of those documents. The recent seventh special session grappled with the same issues but in an atmosphere of greater objectivity. This encourages optimism about the future. It was obvious from the seventh special session that agreement can be reached between developing and developed countries on a common Program of action oriented to narrowing the vast gap between the two groups, activating the development process in the developing countries, and making drastic reforms in the international economic order regarding all aspects of international trade, the transfer of resources, the world monetary system, industrialization and food.\n10.\tThe world today requires effective and active movement towards the implementation of this historic Program. For this is the only way to prevent the contradiction between the positions of the industrialized world and the developing world from turning into a confrontation that can only hurt mankind and be detrimental to normal and friendly international relations. The efforts, over the past two years, at the World Food Conference at Rome, the World Population Conference at Bucharest and at other conferences that dealt with industry, natural resources, the environment and technology were ambitious attempts to establish a useful dialog and to increase the grounds for agreement. However, as is obvious to us all, partial or sectoral efforts, regardless of their occasional successes, are no substitute for a steady, systematic and over-all quest for the establishment of a new international economic order taking into consideration the interdependence of our modern world and the needs of the overwhelming majority of mankind for food, work and dignity in the framework of healthy and equitable international relations. That is what the seventh special session decided.\n11.\tThe agenda of this thirtieth session is full of items and issues relating to every aspect of our international life. Many are old and have been recurring year after year; others reflect our changing conditions. As the agenda items relating to economic and technical issues increase, we still find ourselves faced with the old ones reminding us that the United Nations has yet to decide fairly on many of the world's gravest injustices and dilemmas. We have been, and still are, discussing yearly the issues confronting Africa struggling against the continued presence of pockets of racism and colonialism in that dear and great continent. The brave and struggling people of Zimbabwe still face the unyielding intransigence of the racist regime in Rhodesia supported by the racist regime in South Africa, in spite of the flexibility shown by the nationalist movement and its willingness to respond to positive initiatives. There is cause for optimism among the peoples of the world about the results of this struggle in the increased international isolation of these two racist regimes and the disintegration of colonialism in Africa during the past two decades.\n12.\tMy country sees a striking resemblance between , this situation in Africa and that in the Middle East.\nIn the Arab world of which the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is an integral part the past five decades have witnessed the decline of the colonialist presence. As colonialism receded, there remained in the Middle East a racial base of aggression posing an immediate and even a daily threat, not only to the security of the Arab States surrounding it, but also to their very existence. The Assembly is aware that since 1967 Israel has been occupying vast territories after having committed an aggression against three Arab States, namely, Jordan, Egypt and Syria. As a result of this aggression, Israel now occupies an area\nthree times its size, inhabited by over 1 million Arabs. A large part of Egypt and of Syria is now under occupation and the whole territory of Palestine is under Israeli military occupation.\n13.\tThere is no need to recall that with the occupation of all of Palestine, the whole Palestinian people, the people who had inhabited that land for tens of centuries, was divided into two parts: the refugees living outside Palestine, whose plight was created by Israeli violence in 1948; and those living in the Palestinian homeland under the occupation of the aggressive Power. This unnatural and horrifying situation has prevailed in the region since the Israeli aggression of 1967 against the Arab countries. Its origins, however, go back to 1948, when Israel uprooted hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homeland, their properties and their dignity.\n14.\tEver since its establishment, the United Nations has witnessed the development of events in the region. The United Nations has made many attempts to remedy this abnormal and unjust situation. The General Assembly has since 1948 adopted repeated resolutions recognizing the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties. Yet Israel has with intransigence and arrogance defied those resolutions. Last year, the General Assembly adopted an historic and comprehensive resolution acknowledging the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and linking that right with their right to return to their homeland [resolution 3236 (XXIX)]. It also defined the elements of a just peace in the Middle East which are linked with the rights of the Palestinian people as an independent people to sovereignty, a homeland and aspirations. At the same time, the General Assembly acknowledged a fact that was the subject of complete Arab unanimity at the summit conference in Rabat that same year, namely, that the Palestinian Liberation Organization is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n15.\tThe United Nations was aware of the need to tackle the consequences of Israel's aggression against the Arab countries in 1967 and the fall of Arab territories under occupation. The United Nations did outline the basis for an internationally acceptable peaceful solution. Yet, since the adoption of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), Israel has been attempting to undermine the most important of its balanced elements, namely, the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of land by force and the necessity of withdrawal from the occupied territories.\n16.\tEver since the adoption of that resolution, Israel has obstructed all international attempts, within the United Nations or outside it, aimed at its implementation. It obstructed the Jarring mission, frustrated the various efforts of the Security Council and resisted the attempts of third parties, even those that maintain the closest relationship with it, to make any progress.\n17.\tAfter the October 1973 war, brought about by the continued occupation, Security Council resolution 338 (1973) was adopted. But Israel persisted in its policy of obstructing any international effort aimed at achieving a real peace in the region based on complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories.\n18.\tMeanwhile, Israel continued to consolidate its occupation and to absorb the occupied territories materially, culturally and in every other way. It planted colonies and settlements in the heart of the occupied lands. It continued changing the demographic and physical character of the territories and exploiting their economy. Even the Holy Places, so abundant in the land of Palestine, were not spared. The occupying Power violated the historic religious character of the Islamic and Christian shrines, defacing them and mutilating their features.\n19.\tThe first target of this policy, so alien to international law, was the holy city of Jerusalem. Ever since the occupation authorities annexed the occupied Arab city of Jerusalem to Israel, they have set out to change its character, stifle its spirit and wipe out its identity, in defiance of the repeated resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly deploring such ugly actions.\n20.\tA stark example of what has become of the Holy Places and the historic sites in Jerusalem is what has happened and is still happening to the Al-Aqsa mosque. For after the arson in this great Islamic monument, which took place under the occupation, the Israeli authorities set out to demolish historical buildings in its vicinity and to carry out excavations underneath the walls, thus shaking its very foundations. All this was done without any respect for its status or regard for the principles of international law, which prohibit tampering with historical monuments and the infringement of religious rights under occupation. Recently, Israeli violations were extended to another great religious and historical edifice, namely Alharam Al-Ibrahimi in the city of Al-Khalil (Hebron). Measures taken by the occupation authorities against this shrine have been increased with the aim of erasing the Islamic character of the mosque, progressively banning Moslem worshippers from prayer and eventually transforming the mosque into a Jewish synagogue. Thus, Israel is moving relentlessly towards changing the historical, national and religious character of the occupied territories, while adopting an obdurate stand against all efforts and endeavors to realize a just peace.\n21.\tIt is no wonder, then, that Israel has come to suffer increasing international isolation and lessening world support, even on the part of those States which had previously maintained the closest relations with it. Nor should anyone wonder that this has been firmly and strongly reiterated at the Islamic Foreign Ministers' Conference, the summit conference of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], and the Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned States. Israel therefore stands at a crucial crossroads, and the United Nations itself faces the responsibility of taking decisive and effective measures to implement its own principles and resolutions.\n22.\tThe Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan considers that the path leading towards a just peace is clear. It has already stated its established policy and is fully and finally committed to it.\n23.\tIsrael should evacuate all the Arab territories occupied by force as a result of the aggression of June 1967, above all, Jerusalem. A just peace will only be established when the Palestinian Arab people\nexercise their right to self-determination in their homeland and recover their national rights in full.\n24.\tThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is most intimately connected with the Palestinian cause and the cause of the Palestinian people. The people of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan have made the greatest sacrifices throughout the history of this cause and it is committed to defend it until its brothers, the Palestinian people, recover their rights and exercise self-determination in their homeland.\n25.\tThe General Assembly has at this session heard the Israeli attempts to alter the nature of the Palestinian question and of Palestinian rights.\n26.\tThe Israeli contention was that the land of Palestine extended to both banks of the river Jordan and so, according to this logic, the majority of the Palestinians have been neither uprooted nor expelled from their homeland.\n27.\tThis is the meaning of the statement by Israel at this session of the Assembly [2368th meeting] and of the attempt by the representative of Israel to reduce the question of Palestine to a call for negotiations between Israel and Jordan. The land of Palestine is the land of Palestine, and the land of Jordan is the land of Jordan. The close relationship between these two brotherly peoples, the Palestinian and the Jordanian, cannot deter the Palestinian Arabs from their rightful claims to their homeland or from the attainment of their legitimate right to return to their land and properties from which they were expelled.\n28.\tThere is no substitute for the termination of the Israeli occupation of the land of Palestine and there is no substitute for the return of the Palestinian people to their homeland from which they were evicted. The entire people of Jordan stands in full support of the brotherly Palestinian people in its just struggle for those goals. Israel must understand this reality if it is to find the road to a just and durable peace.\n29.\tWe call upon all the countries of the world, and upon the United Nations, to support these legitimate rights, to help to terminate the occupation and to assist the establishment of a just and durable peace in the Middle East.\n30.\tMy Government, while giving the highest priority to this issue to which we are physically and spiritually committed, does not overlook other global questions of concern to the United Nations and to the peoples of the world.\n31.\tWe hope that the current session of the General Assembly will provide an appropriate forum for a useful dialog on the questions of disarmament. Perhaps the atmosphere of international detente, which was reflected in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, will be again expressed in concrete steps, agreed upon by the parties directly involved, for arms control and disarmament.\n32.\tWe support all sincere steps taken in this connexion, whether technical, political or legal, as we support the expansion of the area of the world to be denuclearized. My Government has made its contribution in this field as regards the Middle East by accepting, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolution [resolution 3263 {XXIX)], the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle\nEast. My Government has made the commitments to the Secretary-General required by the resolution, having signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex].\n33.\tThere is a question that concerns the international community and that pertains to the completion of the process of terminating foreign domination in Africa. This question is that of Western Sahara. During last year a positive step was taken concerning this issue when the parties concerned agreed to take the matter to the International Court of Justice to decide its legal aspects. That was a constructive step towards peacefully arriving at the desired objective, which is the termination of foreign domination in that area.\n34.\tWe hope and expect that no measures prejudicial to the status quo in the area will be taken before the verdict of the International Court of Justice is announced. In the meantime it must be emphasized that, while my country maintains traditional and strong bonds of friendship with Spain, we see no end to this question other than the final and complete termination of Spanish rule in Western Sahara.\n35.\tAs for other matters on the agenda of this session, my delegation will do its utmost to make whatever contribution it can to consolidating the efforts of the United Nations and achieving its goals, whether they be the gradual development of a constructive and developed international legal order; the creation of new and more equitable international economic relations; or the development of the United Nations institutions better to discharge international tasks and to serve the purposes of the Charter.\n36.\tDuring the last years, the United Nations has passed more than one test in which it faced the question of its raison d'etre and its competence to serve the purposes for which it was created. While the United Nations has repeatedly shown some inadequacies and some inability to decide on issues of justice, it has continued through the years to assert the need for its existence as a unique institution for proper international relations, a forum for continuous dialog between all international parties and a parliamentary meeting place for all States, big and small. It also continues to be an institution for joint action to maintain world peace and security, and to launch into the world forces of intellectual and moral advancement, even though those forces may take a long time to mature and prevail.\n37.\tWe, in my country, and in the larger region from which I come, are aware of the agonizing short-comings of the United Nations, However, we also know that without the United Nations the world would collapse in open chaos and overt conflict over interests and ambitions without any moral or idealistic restraint.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "68.\t  Mr. President, the choice of the General Assembly for the presidency of the thirtieth session has fallen upon you, and in our view it is of particular significance. Luxembourg and Madagascar have for some years now had relations of trust, and we have been able to appreciate, in the Organization to which both our countries belong, your statesmanlike qualities and the interest that you have shown in questions affecting the third world. We still remember how you welcomed the Charter of the Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] when a delegation of members of the Group of 77 presented it to your Government. We are convinced that you will continue to display the same understanding of our problems and that this understanding will become a positive factor in our proceedings.\n69.\tTo your predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, we should like to convey our fraternal gratitude for the extremely responsible and outstanding way in which he represented first of all Africa, then the third world, and finally the whole international community. The two sessions of the General Assembly over which he presided will remain in the annals of our Organization as sessions which were most fruitful in terms of positive developments and as most promising also for those who have chosen not to despair in spite of prevailing conditions.\n70.\tI should like now, on behalf of my Government, to convey our warmest congratulations to the delegation of Cambodia, which, after five years of revolutionary struggle, has recovered its lawful seat which so-called representatives had usurped with the assistance and connivance of imperialist interests.\n71.\tIt would be natural that in an anniversary year we should mention the victory over the genocidal tendencies of racism and the defeat of the false Fascist ideology, and also the hopes which the peoples of the United Nations have placed in our Charter. We cannot forget our immense sacrifices, and those sacrifices are particularly praiseworthy because we were defending values which were often imposed upon us. Not to associate ourselves with this anniversary would be tantamount to denying the principles common to us all. However, we wonder what kind of peace, what kind of justice and what kind of development were in store for the peoples which the technocrats of 30 years ago wanted to associate with their new vision of the world.\n72.\tWe do not reject what has been fairly accomplished. But at the present stage of the struggle for the recognition of the rights of peoples and of nations, if we stop and take stock of the situation we shall be found to observe that the peoples subjected to hegemonism and monopoly have recovered their natural cohesion. They have become aware of the tremendous significance of their sovereignty and their independence. They have made progress towards liberation with respect to imperialism and reaction.\n73.\tThese facts certainly originated in the events which marked the renaissance of international life. Nevertheless it is true that these facts are of particular value at such a critical time in our history. No one, I am sure, would deny that the established order is now gone forever. No one could remain indifferent to the need for progress in international relations and for true democracy in the building of a new society. There are two opposing and divergent currents, therefore, in our world today, which this year have led to intensive consultations in the political and economic fields, to a re-evaluation of respective strengths and interests, and to a new determination with regard to political measures to be taken.\n74.\tThese initiatives were reflected by bilateral or multilateral agreements and by the convening of several conferences. We were entitled, therefore, to expect genuine peace to replace our present precarious peace a true peace in which the world would be free from uncertainty, where the rights of peoples and nations would no longer be trampled underfoot' by arbitrariness or the conspiracy of silence, and where nations would be able to engage in the free choice of their political and economic destiny.\n75.\tNow it appears that we are allowing ourselves to be increasingly influenced by contradictions, and we are not able to give a satisfactory response to changes prompted by reactionary alliances and impulses. The adoption of a new international code of ethics is necessary. Therefore, we must examine and define objectively what any State, any international or regional organization, can and must do in order to make a positive contribution to the establishment of a system of values and relations which would take account of current realities.\n76.\tWe do not think that some people are justified in taking offense when we claim that we have inherited a world order which is at least two centuries old. These are the contradictions which underlie the structures of political, economic, military and technological power; and the development of these structures has given rise to privileges and domination which, in their turn, have led to the division of our world. Let us not forget that the equality of rights, opportunities and advantages were in the past denied in the name of this now obsolete world order. Let us not forget that the inequalities inherent in this order caused a situation where international security depended on one or two countries, a group of countries or a continent. The security which was then offered to us was presented as a series of partial actions, poorly co-ordinated and difficult to integrate within the process of the search for a peace which would benefit all and not just a few.\n77.\tIn spite of our differences, we cannot disregard the fact that the maintenance and safeguarding of international security remains the fundamental objective of our Charter. That security cannot be considered at this time as the aggregate of measures designed solely to defend and promote national or regional security.\n78.\tBut what security can we expect from a world where the most powerful nations are devoting more than $300,000 million for producing and developing conventional weapons, perfecting their missiles and other military equipment, and multiplying their nuclear tests? The strategy of certain mutual destruction and the doctrine of nuclear deterrent still hold sway and are now even legitimatized by agreements. International public opinion cannot remain indifferent to this situation, which is morally indefensible and the genocidal tendencies of which are obvious.\n79.\tIt is difficult to accept the fact that, in promoting a \\\"nuclear civilization\\\", the most powerful nations seem to be pushing the world towards its own destruction by organizing and extending violence on a gigantic scale. That is why we maintain that all security depends on a disarmament which will give priority to the abolition of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery, as well as of weapons of mass destruction. We remain convinced that true detente, extended to all nations, whatever their size, requires as a pre-condition the carrying out of a disarmament of this kind. We have no intention whatsoever of minimizing the resumption of certain negotiations, the signing of a document on European security, and the entry into force of the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction resolution 2826 (XXVI), annex]. We must however, recognize that the present arrangements and agreements remain limited and are often discriminatory. It would therefore appear judicious to supplement them, to expand them, in order to integrate them within a global approach to disarmament.\n80.\tIf the forthcoming world disarmament conference recognizes this objective as enjoying the highest priority, then we can contemplate in a positive way the creation of a specialized agency where all States will have the opportunity to examine and to decide democratically questions relating to disarmament and control over armaments. It is no longer possible to conceive that the security of the world should depend on isolated initiatives; and because the great Powers have ceaselessly professed to us their good faith and sincere intentions, let us ask them to apply in their own relations the greatest degree of mutual confidence and to recognize that the United Nations remains the appropriate framework for the most significant negotiations. It is on this condition, and on this condition alone, that the areas of insecurity which persist can become zones of peace and co-operation, and that zones of peace which are still being challenged will finally be respected as such.\n81.\tIt is an open secret that it is because of this lack of mutual trust among the great Powers, and even among their clients, that the Indian Ocean has become a private preserve for the confrontation of irreconcilable interests. The frontiers of national security of the great Powers have been extended well beyond what seem to be normal. Distrust has prompted them to undertake a systematic policy of mutual surveillance and indeed presence in regions where their immediate interests are not in jeopardy.\n82.\tThe focus of tensions has therefore been removed elsewhere. In order to ensure their presence the better, the great Powers have strengthened or reorganized their zones of influence, have sought to obtain others, and have virtually divided the Indian Ocean, as indeed was the case with Africa and other continents at the end of the last century.\n83.\tThis situation can only damage the interests of the littoral and hinterland States, whose security and sovereignty are threatened by the activities which have quite rightly been considered as contrary to their national or regional interests. They thought it was urgent to appeal to international public opinion so that the great Powers might reconsider their negative attitude and agree to respect and apply United Nations resolutions relating to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)].\n84.\tIt is in this spirit that the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, which met last month at Lima, adopted a resolution in which three fundamental problems of concern to the region were examined: namely, the elimination of all foreign military bases; refusal of facilities to warships and military aircraft of the great Powers; and the demilitarization and denuclearization of the zone.\n85.\tThese questions were approached in a positive manner, and we can therefore consider that, on the basis of these three general principles, practical measures will be produced to put an end once for all to the re-emergence of foreign military presence in the Indian Ocean, and to ensure the establishment of a true climate of detente and co-operation in the area.\n86.\tThe importance we attach to the Indian Ocean does not stem from any arbitrary will for confrontation for its own sake. It reflects the fact that we consider Africa, the Indian Ocean and Asia as an organic whole, where events are politically interdependent both in their causes and their effects. Having disarmed in South-East Asia, imperialism is preparing to retreat to the west, towards the coast of Africa, where colonialism still maintains its last bastions, to provide a kind of refuge perhaps for those known to some people as defenders of the so-called free world.\n87.\tI think this is the place to denounce the obvious collusion between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and the minority racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia. Under the camouflage of gradualism, realism and dialog, the Western Powers and their allies are permitting these regimes to entrench their infamous privileges and to have recourse to formulas which at best would make it possible for the Africans of Zimbabwe, Azania and Namibia to enjoy very doubtful representation.\n88.\tLet us concede that the apartheid regime, anathema to all those who claim to be part of universal civilization, must finally disappear. This will give no justification to the thesis of separate development, which the South African and Rhodesian minorities are trying to make us accept, in the name of racism which has not yet laid down its arms. The problem in southern Africa is, above all, a question of human dignity, which the Western Powers are pretending not to understand, quite wrongly forgetting what the triumph of fascism would have caused them in terms of suffering.\n89.\tIt should also be pointed out that what can be done in the immediate future in southern Africa is to decide on the place and role of that minority . But are people unduly concerned about what the majority represents? Has thought been given in a responsible way to the fact that this representation, so dear to Western democracies, requires us to oppose generalized attempts at bantustanization and to other attempts at giving the appearance of consultations which actually lead to protection of the interests of colonialism and imperialism?\n90.\tIn other circumstances and other places, the Western Powers have insisted on respect for human rights. We believe that the same tenacity which they have shown in settling questions of meetings, contacts and facilities to be provided for individuals should be applied when they come to negotiate with the regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia with regard to the supply of arms and equipment and the future of the oppressed peoples of southern Africa.\n91.\tWe cannot condemn what is now happening in that part of Africa without bearing in mind that colonialism, neo-colonialism and imperialism form a trinity which makes bold to present to the world seemingly attractive solutions in order the better to lull our vigilance with regard to situations which are seriously questioned by international public opinion.\n92.\tIn the Comoros, for example, all seemed set for that Territory to accede to international sovereignty in the best possible conditions and according to the express commitments of the administering Power. The will of the people was made known. The inevitable passions had been calmed. However, because of a will imposed from the metropolitan country everything was once again called into question. Who benefits from the present uncertainty? Certainly not the people of the Comoros who are asking only to preserve in harmony and unity their sovereignty and territorial integrity. We would have been the first to take pleasure at seeing the people of the Comoros here among us. We very much regret that the policy of maintaining a presence and the difficulties caused by quarters encouraged or tolerated by the administering Power have prevented us from sponsoring the admission of the Comoros to our Organization, an admission which the OAU so keenly desired.\n93.\tThe same applies to the question of Djibouti, where the people were \\\"invited\\\" to take a decision on their future in a climate of confusion which did not permit them either to judge, in complete freedom, the importance of their choice or to understand the regional implications of what they were doing. In our common organizations we have heard the arguments of the parties which should be most concerned. Nothing prevents the people of Djibouti from exercising their right to genuine self-determination and independence in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).\n94.\tMany more examples could be given. We note that the administering Powers consider their delaying tactics as necessitated by respect for the democratic process. We believe it is time to be able to defend one's own interests without having recourse to a facsimile of liberalism or condescending paternalism.\n95.\tOn the question of Palestine, we note that some Powers are adopting the same attitude because of the fundamental similarity between the phenomena of colonialism and foreign occupation. They do not mind allowing the Palestinians to be refugees; but when we come to examine the problem in a specific context and reference is made to their legitimate aspirations, reservations prompted by circumspection and prudence prevail over the former considerations.\n96.\tThe rights of a frustrated people continue to be opposed by requirements for a security which is for ever being defined. The expansionist and exclusive ambitions of one State cause some to forget the principles of our Charter and respect for our resolutions. Delaying tactics, half measures and ambiguities become the order of the day where political courage should be displayed.\n97.\tIt is not surprising, therefore, that the Palestinians are now ready to rely only upon themselves in the attainment of their objectives in order to ensure their own national identity in a country which is theirs. For our part we have always maintained that security in the Middle East is to be determined primarily by the_ recognition by all States of the rights of the Palestinians to independence and national sovereignty and also by the end of the occupation of the territories conquered by Israel.\n98.\tWith the passage of time the interests of the great Powers in the region have been allowed to distort the necessary conditions for a just and lasting peace. With regard to principles, however, no compromise is possible; Israel must understand that its intransigence, its territorial and military ambitions, its aggressive practices, its unyielding insistence on absolute security are incompatible with the search for a global solution.\n99.\tIn the absence of true progress towards a settlement that would resolve all the outstanding problems, we see no alternative for the international community but to have its resolutions and decisions enforced as rigorously as possible. To that end, account should be taken of the measures proposed by the OAU and the non-aligned movement because they reflect our common and legitimate desire to break the deadlock in which we have been placed by lack of determination and commitment.\n100.\tIn another part of the area we find ourselves in a deadlock again. This time a different one it is true. In Cyprus, after the breaking off of the talks in Vienna, the hardening of the respective positions makes ever more unlikely the process of normalization, a normalization which requires that all the parties to the dispute give their support to the principles of peaceful settlement and abide by the provisions of General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX).\n101.\tThe fundamental objectives of our policy on Cyprus should remain the preservation of its territorial integrity, its sovereignty, its independence and its policy of non-alignment, and also the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the end to interference in its internal affairs. In other words, we believe that the two communities, whose national rights must be recognized, should alone be allowed to determine the constitutional and political future of the country. They must enjoy complete freedom in their contacts and talks, so long as they comply with the provisions of the Security Council regarding the inadmissibility of secession, merger or union with any other country.\n102.\tBefore ending this chapter on political and security matters, I should like to repeat the position of my Government on the Korean problem. The people of Korea who have suffered from war, division and occupation, are also entitled to peace and security. In this regard, our Organization bears a particularly heavy responsibility because it allows its authority to be usurped and to serve ingloriously as a cover for foreign intervention in the south of the country.\n103.\tWe do not think that this responsibility should be lost from sight and the multiplicity of proposals which would transform the prevailing armistice is significant. However, we cannot agree to the proposals made in quarters tending to perpetuate a situation which has so far failed to allow the Korean people as a whole to exercise their right to self-determination or to settle their own problems in complete freedom and sovereignty.\n104.\tThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly held out the olive branch of peace and concord. As an Organization, we must no longer hide behind legal arguments and the legalities of institutional procedure in order to postpone the dissolution of the United Nations Command. This dissolution, ipso facto, entails the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under cover of our flag.\n(05. We are convinced that the transformation of the temporary armistice into a lasting peace treaty will create the necessary conditions for the reunification of Korea. That process should in no way be impeded by unilateral initiatives such as the application for the admission of South Korea which, in putting forward its application, deliberately went back on the commitments it undertook in the joint communique of 4 July 1972 by North and South Korea.1\n106.\tThis survey of the world political situation, which could not possibly be exhaustive, shows us that the path towards the full achievement of international security is a difficult one. In spite of certain obviously limited signs of detente; in spite of the many different attempts made by our community; in spite of the cautious initiatives of the great Powers, there are still many shadowy zones of insecurity in the world today. It would seem to us right to devote our best efforts to eliminating these zones, but in so doing, we also run the risk of relegating to secondary priority other objectives in our Charter, particularly those connected with economic and social co-operation.\n107.\tThe events of recent years have taught us that our deliberations should result, both internationally and nationally, in a general awareness of the problems posed by development, which has become the focus of our attention. Development for us cannot be conceived of as a series of sectoral and disparate actions. The failure of the \\\"strategies\\\" which have been policy for more than 20 years in most countries of the world and also internationally, is symptomatic to the extent that we recognize development as a whole, applying to all men and to every man.\n108.\tIt is in this spirit that Madagascar agreed to the adoption of an integrated approach to the problems of development, the solution to which would determine the survival of the majority. There is no need to enumerate once again the just claims made by the developing countries at the seventh special session. We were not entirely satisfied, but we do recognize the efforts of certain industrialized countries towards a constructive joint approach.\n109.\tThe incipient progress which we have made should not cause us to lose sight of the urgency and acuteness of the problems entailed by mass poverty. It is important, therefore, that the international community should act, and act promptly, instead of allowing itself to be led by its technologists, its technocrats, into a maze of discussions as to indicators of progress or the necessary pre-conditions for an inventory which would be more than problematical.\n110.\tIndeed, the economic and social situation in the world remains marked by poverty, by the failure to meet the most elementary needs, and is aggravated by a system of exploitation connected with a power structure which has been established mainly in the industrialized and imperialist countries. This situation must change. Many people recognize this, but differences remain as to means of action and approaches.\n111.\tThus the concept of \\\"external limits\\\" imposed by the biosphere on human society, and that of \\\"screening\\\" illustrated by the extremist image of a necessary distinction between those who have to die, those who will survive and those to whom assistance will make the difference, are still arguments put forward at the present time. These ideas testify to an extremely conservative vision of the world which relies solely upon quantitative aspects of growth and which is in keeping with imperialist designs and have the effect of reaffirming the hegemony of privileged minorities.\n112.\tTo believe, however, that under-development is nothing but a \\\"stage\\\" in economic development might persuade third-world countries to attempt, at all costs, to increase their gross national products in order to overcome their lag and ensure prosperity in keeping with the needs of their peoples. Remarkable rates of growth have been recorded; nevertheless, poverty remains, to the indignation of the international community.\n113.\tIt is not just a matter of aping the economic development of the developed nations today but of finding solutions based upon the natural environment, the cultural heritage and the spirit of initiative peculiar to each society. Mass poverty should not be considered exclusively from the national standpoint, because this would cause self-sufficiency to take too simplistic a path.\n114.\tIndeed, in Madagascar we recognize that, in order to bring the working masses and the underprivileged out of their more than marginal conditions, we must above all rely on ourselves according to the principle that each State has the sovereign right to choose its own system of development, taking account of its own psychological, sociological and political realities.\n115.\tAs a pre-condition our efforts require the mobilization of all the resources of the nation an action which would have no point without the participation of women. Indeed women constitute one of the pillars of the Madagascar socialist revolution, and we consider it essential to promote not only their dignity but also the task of making them more sensitive to current major problems, their integration in the global development effort and their contribution to the strengthening of peace, particularly in this International Women's Year.\n116.\tWe also believe that, in the united straggle against poverty, international co-operation requires a harmonized approach, the provision to each nation of appropriate and adequate means in support of its own efforts and the promotion of a common ideology for achieving genuine development.\n117 We are particularly interested in reducing mass poverty because of our socialist policy for bringing about an economic and social development both human and harmonious. The charter of the socialist revolution, proclaimed last month by theiHeaa of State and Government of Madagascar, made the focus of its concern the promotion and protection ot the interests of the working masses, by eradicating man's exploitation by man, social injustice and inequality.\n118.\tThis presupposes for us the establishment of new socio-economic structures which will make possible the responsible and coherent organization of the masses and the action of the revolutionary power in the process of the democratic distribution of wealth and the factors of production and also in the question of giving highest priority to the restoration of the rights of the most underprivileged.\n119.\tWe sincerely believe that this action will be part of the overall search for security for the greatest number, which, in the final analysis, is a pre-condition of national security. When this is guaranteed and effective, the nation will then be able fully to participate in the establishment of a new world of peace and progress.\n120.\tThe growing complexity of problems relating to development, disarmament and international security; the will of all nations to make their contribution to this; their interdependence and the multiplicity of options makes it necessary to define common ground. And, in the final analysis, it can only be the United Nations which can do this, and its role should be strengthened in order to permit it to become the true crucible from which the new international order will emerge.\n121.\tWe recognize that the United Nations, over the last 30 years, has in spite of everything played a positive role in the maintenance of relative world peace, in the liberation of many countries from colonialism, in the exploration of new fields of co-operation and the development of international law. However, the great Powers have given up neither the obsessive defense of their own interests nor their rivalries, and have in fact gone so far as actually to promote the establishment of fundamental instability in relations among nations.\n122.\tThis attitude, which has now been outstripped by the acceleration of the historical process and profound structural changes in international society, has prevented the normal functioning of our institutions and the achievement of genuine progress towards our objectives.\n123.\tAccordingly, 30 years after the end of the Second World War, general and complete disarmament remains an illusion. We believe in general and complete disarmament, but, unfortunately, it has been manipulated by the military Powers. The elimination of racism and colonialism is hindered by the priority accorded by imperialists and neocolonialists to principles of a bygone era. As for development, it has been left to improvisation, since the center has persisted it its exploitation and domination of the periphery.\n124.\tWhat we call for is a new international order; this claim is entirely justified. It is quite right to call for a review of the Charter, based on the present Charter but adapted to the need to respond better to the true needs of peoples, to the emergence of new ideologies and the defining of new priorities in fields of activity. This obviously presupposes the acceptance of the principle of democratization in representation, decision-making, execution and even the definition of structures.\n125.\tThe United Nations has for far loo long been likened to a forum where middle-sized and small nations can put forward their views and their complaints without being assured, of course, that they will be taken into account by the great Powers. We know the results of this approach. If we want our Organization to cease to be the witness of sterile verbal confrontations, we feel that it is urgent to give it greater responsibilities. Thus, in a defined and renewed institutional framework, all nations will be able fully to discharge their responsibilities in the face of a many-faceted crisis which affects and will continue to affect our common civilization.\n126.\tWe do not wish to restrict the sovereignty of Member States, because every nation, and even every group of nations, has the right and the duty to take initiatives conducive to peace and co-operation. But we believe that the universal acceptance and institutionalization of these initiatives must take place in the United Nations, which, after all, is the reflection of democratic will.\n127.\tThis democratic will, which emerged from the victory of progressive and revolutionary ideas, has replaced, at least at our level, the well-known political will which has often been lacking. It emerged decisively at the sixth special session. It showed that it is capable of positive compromise, while its detractors saw in it nothing but a form of diktat. It put a final end to political hegemony, which some had abused with the aid of outmoded institutions and instruments which have gone forever.\n128.\tBut it would be poor judgment on our part to wish to impose this democratic will gratuitously. For us it remains the point of departure for a true co-operation no longer based upon servility, obsequiousness or capitulation and therefore more lasting and healthier and more likely to serve the cause of all peoples of the world entitled to peace, development and justice.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "75.\t Mr. President, first I should like to congratulate you on your election to your high and demanding office. The part of the world from which I come could not have been better represented in the presidency of this Assembly than through you, Mr. Thorn, as an experienced and out-standing spokesman of our part of the world.\n76.\tMay I also express our appreciation of the dedicated and untiring efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in promoting international peace and co-operation.\n77.\tA number of speakers before me have already dwelt at some length on the recently concluded seventh special session of the General Assembly. Most references have been of a positive nature, some even to the extent of characterizing the session as a turning- point in the relations between the rich and the poor countries. My Government shares this hope. Through the unanimous resolution of the seventh special session [resolution 3362 (S-Vll)], a foundation has been laid for attacking the problem of injustice and inequity through co-operation rather than through confrontation. The decisions of this special session were based on the realization of the fact that the development process is the joint responsibility of us all.\n78.\tMy Government attaches the greatest importance to the fact that consensus was reached. Now we have to prove that consensus works. The implementation of the decisions taken at the seventh special session is vital in this respect. We have to prove to those still remaining skeptical that the consensus was genuine. Then, and only then, will we have taken that important step towards a new and more equitable economic world order which we all wanted the special session to be. Then, and only then, can we sustain the spirit which prevailed in this hall during the last few weeks.\n79.\tMy Government considers the call for a new international economic order an urgent one which also affects our national priorities. Our response must properly reflect this urgency. For that reason the Norwegian Government has submitted to Parliament a comprehensive report, containing concrete proposals relative to our over-all economic relations with developing countries. In this report the Government also reaffirms its commitment to the targets for transfer of real resources, reaching a transfer of 0.7 per cent of our gross national product this year, and 1 per cent in 1978, all in official development assistance on a grant basis. This report also defines the policies called for on our part in order to live up to the demands of the sixth and seventh special sessions in the fields of trade, industrialization and international economic relations in their wider sense.\n80.\tThe unanimity with which the decisions at the seventh special session were taken gives us hope that, in the process of implementation, national, political and economic limitations will be overcome. My Government fears, however, that we can be faced with other limitations to which sufficient attention has not yet been paid. I am thinking of the organizational and structural short-comings of the present world community. Many of the justified demands of developing countries are often frustrated not only through a lack of political will in the developed world but also through short-comings of the present organizational system. My Government is of the opinion that this is a problem to which the Members of the United Nations will have to pay ever-increasing attention in the years to come. For the United Nations to play an effective role in the process of development, an overhaul of the system is called for. This is a prerequisite for the attainment of the session's declared objectives. The present international machinery for dealing with the development problem has become so complicated that not even the experts any longer have a clear view of its structure. The organizational development has occurred piecemeal and more as a result of a process of proliferation than on the basis of any co-ordinated assessment. As Sir Robert Jackson writes in the introduction to the report of the capacity of the United Nations development system \\\"... the machine as a whole has become unmanageable in the strictest sense of the word. As a result it is becoming slower and more unwieldy, like some prehistoric monster\\\".\n81.\tTherefore, it was only logical that the special session, after having reached a broad agreement on matters of substance, also decided to establish the Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System,\n82.\tIn its work this Committee should be able to benefit from the considerable amount of work already carried out in this field by the Group of Experts on the Structure of the United Nations System, appointed by the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session. The fact that these 25 experts from all over the world have agreed unanimously on a report is in itself encouraging. In all main respects, Norway is able to support the proposals put forward by the Group of Experts. We have in particular been glad to note the proposals for strengthening the role played by the Economic and Social Council. These proposals are in accordance with the idea put forward by Norway and Finland at the twenty-ninth session with the aim of making the Council a sort of permanent security council for economic and social questions.\n83.\tI have dwelt here on institutional and organizational aspects of our efforts to build a more just world order. This is also necessary. There may be little use in adopting the principle of a new international economic order unless we have a clear idea how to realize this order in terms of practical policies and how it is to be organized, administered, directed and planned.\n84.\tThere is, therefore, every reason to subject the whole of the international organizational structure to a thorough review in all sectors in relation to, and on the basis of, existing needs because, as I see it, the large and ever-widening gap between the tasks confronting us and the means of co-operation for the solution of these tasks is a fundamental problem facing the world community today. We must commit ourselves to narrowing this gap, we must commit ourselves to solving more and more problems through \nmultinational means. We cannot accept that such commitments can only be undertaken in the aftermath of world wars.\n85.\tI speak here as a representative of one of the smaller Members of the United Nations. We, the smaller nations, have a vital stake in the creation of a better-organized world. We need a framework within which we can be treated as equal partners and share in the management of this increasingly interdependent world of ours. We, the smaller countries, are particularly dependent on the general observation of rules of conduct and codes of behavior in international society. But we have also a vital interest in efficient management. And for this reason we must be prepared to show restraint and moderation. Increasingly, we shall have to adopt procedures for selective participation in order to manage the many complex and complicated problems on our agenda.\n86.\tIt goes without saying that the organizational evolution will be different according to whether it is a question of managing world peace and security, of tackling the problem of world poverty, of conserving resources and protecting the environment, or of safeguarding fundamental human rights.\n87.\tIf we take world peace and world security, this is today primarily dependent on the political and military equilibrium between the super-Powers. Whether we, the smaller countries, like this or not, the responsibility for avoiding major wars will basically continue to remain with these Powers.\n88.\tThis very necessary recognition of the basic factors on which world peace depends should not, however, lead to resignation on the part of the smaller nations. These countries also have ample opportunities for engaging themselves in the efforts to build a more solid basis for peace.\n89.\tOne such opportunity lies in the strengthening of the peace-keeping capacity of the United Nations and participation in the United Nations peace-keeping forces. The strengthening of the United Nations role in this field should also be in the well-conceived interests of the major Powers. Recent developments in the Middle East are, I think, a good example of how regional efforts, combined with great-Power engagement and United Nations peace-keeping efforts, may turn events in a positive direction in a conflict which for such a long time has represented a serious threat to international peace and security. Here I should like to associate myself with the many previous speakers who have paid tribute to the leaders of Egypt and Israel for their decisive readiness for negotiation and compromise, and also to the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Kissinger, for his outstanding contribution to the agreement reached.\n90.\tAnother opportunity for engagement for peace lies in regional co-operation. Today important regional efforts are, for instance, being made to build bridges across ideological and political barriers in the interest of detente. I am especially referring to the conclusion in Helsinki in July of this year of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Even though this Conference has taken place outside the United Nations framework, its results may be of significance for the Organization's ability to maintain peace. The negotiations during the various phases of the Conference are also another good example of how smaller States may play an important role as a supplement and as a necessary corrective to the co-operation between the major Powers.\n91.\tIn his report to the General Assembly on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General underlines the urgency of making real progress towards disarmament and arms control. In particular he reminds us that the danger of nuclear proliferation not only remains, but has increased.\n92.\tIt is of crucial importance that the United States and the Soviet Union continue their efforts to reach agreement on further limitations in the field of strategic weapons systems. Progress in this field will also increase the willingness of other nations to accept limitations on their freedom of action.\n93.\tBut the whole world community must now give increased priority to the awesome problem of nuclear proliferation. All countries must adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], A complete ban on all nuclear tests must be introduced. An increasingly more comprehensive system of international control of peaceful nuclear activity must be established.\n94.\tWhile the responsibility for averting a large- scale war lies primarily with the major Powers, the many new tasks confronting the world community require new forms of organization of a global character. For instance, the efficient and just management of the world's resources or the protection of the environment will make far greater demands on the development of the organizational set-up than we have hitherto been accustomed to.\n95.\tAmong these new tasks there is especially one to which I should like to draw attention: the resources of the sea and the on-going negotiations on the international law of the sea.\n96.\tMy Government attaches great importance to the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. New technology, new economic needs and resource perspectives, new strategic and political priorities have caused new legal concepts to evolve. Therefore, it is essential that the various and also competing forces should be channeled through the machinery of orderly international negotiations, so that just and balanced solutions may be formed and a reasonable accommodation of opposing interests achieved.\n97.\tSuch solutions must comprise arrangements for the exploration and exploitation of the resources of the deep ocean floor beyond limits of national jurisdiction, and in a manner which should give life to the concept of \\\"the common heritage of mankind\\\". In our view, this requires the creation of a strong international machinery with broad regulatory powers. And that machinery will in the future be called upon to make some momentous decisions, especially in regard to the balance between exploitation and environmental concerns. In order to be effective, the machinery must give adequate representation to all interested groups of States.\n98.\tNegotiations so far have demonstrated that there is broad support for the extension of the sovereign rights of coastal States over natural resources in an economic zone limited to 200 nautical miles. This principle will form the basis for a system of resource management, but does not in itself provide exhaustive solutions, There will still be an important place for international management in order to achieve conservation of the living resources and provide the world with a continuing supply of protein from the seas. We must develop more effective machinery for inter-national collaboration in this field, adjusted to the new concept of the economic zone, and designed to give rational harvest, long-range productivity and optimum utilization.\n99.\tIf the Conference on the Law of the Sea fails, it will be very difficult to establish effective international regimes, in particular for the international sea-bed area. It will also mean a serious setback in our efforts to develop adequate machinery for formulating international legal rules that respond to present-day needs.\n100.\tFor this reason, my Government would urge the General Assembly to take every possible step to facilitate the work of the Conference, so that it may conclude next year by the adoption of the new convention on the law of the sea. For that reason also my Government supports the recommendation of the Conference to provide for the possibility of holding two substantive working sessions during 1976, depending on the rate of progress. We realize that two sessions may impose a burden on some delegations, but we ask them to consider the idea against the alternative of a failure of the Conference. Such failure may compel coastal States to take unilateral action in order to protect the renewable resources of the seas and the coastal populations whose livelihood depends directly on those resources.\n101.\tThat is the background against which we must determine our priorities. My delegation is in no doubt: the Conference must be given an opportunity to ensure that the new law of the sea convention is adopted in 1976.\n102.\tAfter 30 years of existence the United Nations is about to become a universal organization in the true sense of the word. The principle of universality has this year been strengthened by the admission of new Members to the Organization. I should like to join in the many expressions of good will addressed to Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe and Cape Verde on their accession to membership in the United Nations. I should like to express the hope that the remaining colonies will soon join the ranks of independent States, or find other solutions in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants.\n103.\tWe had hoped to be in a position to extend a welcome also to the two States of Viet Nam. These States should now finally be allowed, free from outside interference, to reap the fruits of peace. We shall press for an immediate solution to be found, opening the way to full membership for these States. A solution must be found also to the problems of membership of the Korean States.\n104.\tNorway adheres to the principle of universality. In our opinion, the success of the Organization will depend to a large extent on whether all the nations, regardless of political regime, will have the right to participate in the work of the Organization and also be subject to the obligations imposed by the United Nations Charter. My country will therefore oppose any attempts to exclude or suspend a Member State from the United Nations system in contravention of the Charter.\n105.\tIn the same way that peace is indivisible, so in an interdependent world is the dignity of man. The systematic racial discrimination practiced by the white minority regimes of southern Africa is, in the view of my Government, particularly intolerable. The continuous oppression of the African population in Namibia, Southern Rhodesia and South Africa also represents a threat to peace in that part of the world. It is hard for me to understand that the white minorities are not able to draw upon the bitter experiences of other colonial regimes which tried to resist the wind of change blowing over the whole African continent. The struggle of African liberation movements in that area is a struggle for the most fundamental of human rights, the right of self-determination. We support their struggle, while at the same time appealing to the white minority regimes to abandon racial discrimination and negotiate solutions leading to majority rule.\n106.\tNorway is in favor of introducing a compulsory arms embargo against South Africa, and has been practising such an embargo for many years.\n107.\tWith deep regret my Government notes that in the field of human rights very little progress has been made during the last decade, in spite of the tireless efforts of private organizations like Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists to arouse the conscience of the world community, The world community should no longer tolerate that countries invoke the principle of non-interference in internal affairs when basic human rights are violated, as, for instance, did Chile when refusing to admit representatives of the Commission on Human Rights. In particular the world community should react strongly against the still widespread practice of torture and inhuman treatment in camps and prisons all over the world. As an intermediate step the General Assembly should adopt the declarations from the recent Geneva Conference on this and related issues.\n108.\tJust before coming to the rostrum I was informed that six of the death sentences imposed in Spain are to be carried out today. If that information is correct I would, on humanitarian grounds, make a last-minute appeal to the Spanish Government to show clemency.\n109.\tIn the field of human rights, too, the world community is facing an institutional problem. We must aim at establishing the appropriate machinery to enable the United Nations effectively to uphold basic human rights, as laid down in the Charter, in all parts of the world. Here I should like to reiterate the full support of the Norwegian Government for the proposal for a high commissioner for human rights within the United Nations system.\n110.\tHuman rights, however, is also a matter of the fundamental underlying values on which the whole system of international co-operation should be based. The best and most authoritative basis for those fundamental values is to be found in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. It is our duty to ensure that we all live up to the ideas expressed therein, not only in words and high- sounding declarations but also in practice.\n111.\tWe feel that human rights must be given an additional material dimension. The decisions of the seventh special session will be really meaningful only when they are translated into the realities of the daily life of the common man."

        "file_text": "125.\t  Mr. President, may I, first of all, address to you the heartiest congratulations and best wishes of the Government of Tunisia on the occasion of your election as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. Our congratulations are not a mere formality or a matter of habit. We are, in fact, convinced that you are one of the most qualified statesmen to occupy this important office. After what has been said by those who have spoken before me, it would be inappropriate for me to embarrass you by listing your many qualities, your ability, your clear-mindedness and your experience. I shall merely mention, as representative of a State that has the best of relations with Luxembourg, that you are devoted to the highest humanitarian values, to the spirit of justice, equality and sincere cooperation, particularly between the major Powers and the developing countries, in order to bridge the gap between them. Your familiarity with these problems is, in view of the circumstances of the present session, the best guarantee of success for the mission the international community has entrusted to you. Tunisia pledges to you its fill and complete cooperation.\n126.\tI should also like to extend our congratulations to your predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of our sister Republic of Algeria, on his eminent services to the international community and in defense of the causes discussed by the General Assembly during the past year.\n127.\tIt is a particularly pleasant duty for me to pay a tribute to the constant efforts of the SecretaryGeneral to increase the chances of peace in the world and to give the Organization its proper role and place. I should like particularly to mention his tireless efforts to settle certain problems in the Middle East, the Western Sahara and Cyprus.\n128.\tWe are convinced that the thirtieth session will be just as important as the previous session in the life of the United Nations.\n129.\tThe international situation during the past year has not been clarified in a way which would prompt us to believe that mankind has finally moved towards detente and peace. Indeed, confusion continues to surround most of the problems that we have been considering for a number of years. We are still confronted either by certain problems for which a just settlement has not been found or by others left in a state of stagnation, awaiting settlement; still others have deteriorated and become particularly acute.\n130.\tOne perceives, however, a glimmer of hope here and this inclines us to be more sanguine about the future.\n131.\tThe constant shuttling back and forth between hope and fear, the considerable differences in the political, economic and social conditions of the lives of people on the different continents have the effect of disrupting whatever balance has been achieved in the world and which disfigures its map, in a sense, and is a threat to world peace.\n132.\tIt is not my intention to dwell on all those matters which appear on the agenda of this session. My delegation will have occasion to state the views of Tunisia on those subjects in the various Committees. But I should like to state our views on a number of issues at the present time.\n133.\tThe past year has been marked by important political events and has led to the entry into our Organization of some new States which have just acquired independence, namely, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and Mozambique. The independence of those countries and their entry into the United Nations is a victory for freedom and dignity and a defeat for colonialism and hegemony.\n134.\tWhile addressing our congratulations to the delegations of those three fraternal countries, may I express the conviction that these nations will strengthen our Organization and will make a firm contribution to those who are still struggling for their liberation?\n135.\tOur congratulations and best wishes for prosperity go also to Papua New Guinea and to the Comoros, which recently declared their independence. It is our hope that we shall soon see them occupying their rightful place in our Organization.\n136.\tSpeaking about newly independent States, our thoughts go to a country whose independence will be declared next month. It has known the ordeal of a divided land and has had intractable problems, of a kind which no other country has ever had so near to independence.\n137.\tFrom this rostrum, may I express to our brothers in Angola our sympathy and our compassion. We urge their leaders to stop their fratricidal struggle and to close their ranks as they take over the destiny of their country. We urge them to spare the blood of their brothers, and to protect their country from division so that it will not again fall to foreign domination. May they heed this appeal and may their country soon become an active Member of our Organization.\n138.\tWhen will the day come when colonialism, having completely disappeared, will no longer be discussed? The liberation of peoples is an irresistible current; it is in a sense a law of nature and of human evolution.\n139.\tThe sufferings of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia in southern Africa because of the reactionary policies of apartheid arouse our indignation and require that we multiply our efforts to put an end to those retrograde and sterile ideas.\n140.\tThe Tunisian Government feels that the persistence of those regimes in their policy constitutes a flagrant challenge to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and shows scorn for the universal conscience\n141.\tIt is necessary for all peace and freedom-loving peoples to do what they can to put an end to anything which might increase the political, military or economic potential of those regimes and to exert pressure to bring them to negotiate with the liberation movements, the only legitimate representatives of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia.\n142.\tDuring the last session we considered the question of the Western Sahara, which is part of the problem of decolonization. Today we are moving towards an equitable solution. A United Nations Visiting Mission has been to the area; the International Court of Justice has handed down the advisory opinion which was requested of its furthermore, Spain has made known its determination to withdraw from the area. Morocco and Mauritania have had the good sense to move towards consultation and cooperation with a view to a peaceful settlement, to the satisfaction of both parties. It is our hope that that process will proceed apace and that no obstacle will be allowed to stand in the way until it is possible for the parties concerned, under the auspices of the United Nations, to reach a peaceful and final settlement, guaranteeing peace, stability and goodneighborly relations.\n143.\tTurning now to the question of Cyprus, we appeal to the parties to follow the same course towards a settlement of the problem. In the opinion of my delegation, dialog and accommodation are the most effective ways of bringing their views closer together, regardless of differences. Therefore the Tunisian Government encourages the negotiations under way between the Turkish and Greek communities under the auspices of the SecretaryGeneral. To be sure, while the fate of the island depends essentially on the Cypriots themselves, and while no one has the right to try to shape their destiny without their consent, we believe none the less that a federal system within the framework of a single State might be the most effective way of guaranteeing the interests of the two communities and safeguarding the essential conditions of coexistence and cooperation between the two parties.\n144.\tHowever that may be, the Tunisian Government supports any solution leading to the coexistence and cooperation of both communities and will not fail to give its support to any settlement acceptable to both sides in the conflict, to whom we wish conciliation and concord within the framework of a common Cypriot nation.\n145.\tMay I now take up the most serious problem in the world today: the question of the Middle East. Is there any need still to say that that is the most serious problem for our current session? Statement after statement by Member States has acknowledged that the Middle East is the sour of international disputes and the starting point of complications, the consequences of which go beyond the area and threaten peace in the world. For many years now that question has regularly appeared on the agenda of our Assembly, which has considered it and tried to resolve it or at least to make it less acute.\n146.\tThe most important result which the United Nations has reached in this connexion is perhaps the decisions at the last session to recognize the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people [resolution 3236 (XXIX)] and to grant it observer status [resolution 3237 (XXIX)]. At the same time the General Assembly affirmed that the solution resides not only in the separation of the armed forces in conflict, or in the partial or complete withdrawal from the occupied territories, but in a settlement of the fundamental problem, which is the Palestinian problem. Recognition of that fact and the inclusion of that cause in the agenda of the General Assembly is essential.\n147.\tAs President Bourguiba has constantly proclaimed since 1948, any solution which does not lead to a full settlement of that problem, and fails to recognize the right of the Palestinian people to self determination, would be incomplete and doomed to failure.\n148.\tBy recognizing the existence of the Palestinian problem, by considering it a problem of struggle for national liberation, and by including it on the agenda as a separate item, the Organization took its most important step since its creation, with a view to correcting the errors of the past committed at the expense of the Palestinian people and to embarking on a wise course of action by examining the Palestinian question in an appropriate manner.\n149.\tBut if we consider what has been done since last year we realize that nothing concrete has been accomplished chiefly because of Israel's stubbornness in refusing to take the facts into account and in defying world public opinion and the resolutions of the United Nations. Israel continues to practice the law of the jungle and occupies the territories of others. It continues to ignore the Palestinian people and denies it its right to live as an independent and sovereign people; it has even gone so far as to disregard the international document to which it owes its existence.\n150.\tBy taking that attitude Israel refuses to follow the dictates of reason and obstructs the search for an appropriate solution. Moreover, that country, while it claims to be devoted to peace, is in fact preparing for another war and is equipping itself with sophisticated weapons, some of which have never been used.\n151.\tSo it is that the problem remains intact. It has even become more serious, and the complications which have emerged in the area are the result of the fact that interest has focused, regrettably, on the consequences and on what can be done about them, and not on the causes.\n152.\tI do not wish to yield to pessimism, which would hardly be helpful, but I must admit that the situation in the Middle East hardly encourages optimism or calm. It is the duty of all, therefore, to combine our efforts to convince Israel to give up its dangerous racist views and to make it understand that security is not compatible with arrogance and stubbornness and that a people's right to live in an area cannot be ensured by waging war on the other peoples of the area and by kindling their feelings of hostility.\n153.\tThe Palestinian people are determined to assert their right to exist. There will be no peace for Israel, there will be no peace in the area, until that people has obtained its right to its homeland, as an entirely sovereign people.\n154.\tWhat I have just said is not said in a spirit of intransigence and does not mean that we are opposed to a step-by-step policy of wisdom. Everyone knows that Tunisia has always favored peaceful solutions and has always believed in the effectiveness of step-by-step policies, rejecting the blind stubbornness of an all or nothing policy. However, step-by-step policies require, to our way of thinking, certain conditions, without which they cannot achieve their objectives.\n155.\tThe first of these conditions is to define the objectives, for without such a definition we are likely to get lost in unfamiliar ways and dead-end streets and not attain our goal. In other words, we are convinced that any attempt to bring about a settlement of the question of the Middle East, be it in a bilateral or multilateral! framework, must be made within the context of an overall settlement; that is to say, it must be aimed not only at the evacuation of Arab territories occupied since 1967, but also at recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to its homeland.\n156.\tOn the basis of those considerations we believe that the disengagement agreement concluded in September 1975 may be an effective step towards peace and could create a climate favorable to negotiations, thereby promoting peaceful coexistence between the Arab States and an Israeli State freed of its obsession with hegemony and expansionism that has finally accepted the existence of a people, the Palestinian people, and their right to live in the land of their ancestors. That will happen if, as some of the parties concerned say, it emerges that the September agreement is in fact to be followed up by negotiations on the evacuation of the Golan Heights and on the evacuation of the West Bank of the river Jordan.\n157.\tHowever, if negotiations do not begin very soon with Syria and with the PLO, and if those negotiations once under way do not lead within a reasonable period of time to positive results that cannot be regarded as a freezing of the situation as a result of Israel's intransigence under cover of continuing negotiations, the September agreement may produce quite the opposite of what was expected. Instead of being a dynamic force for peace in the area, it might well constitute an obstacle to that peace. In the same way, instead of creating a climate favorable to negotiations and peaceful coexistence,: it might cause further disappointment in some quarters and profound despair in others, prompting everyone to believe that war is still the only way of bringing about a just and lasting settlement.\n158.\tThe September agreement is based on two types of commitment: one between Egypt and Israel in accordance with which the latter pledges itself to give up certain sectors of Egyptian territory, in a move that it appears has procured it considerable advantages; the other between certain Arab States and the United States in accordance with which the United States commits itself to negotiations with the parties concerned with a view to a parallel evacuation of the Golan Heights and the West Bank.\n159.\tIf the United States did begin negotiations with a view to the evacuation of the Golan Heights and the West Bank and if those negotiations did lead to positive results, then we should be entitled to say that the September agreement was an historic event with considerable consequences.\n160.\tBut, as we all know, it is not the provisions of the agreement that matter, but the real intentions of the signatories; and those intentions will be bound to be revealed when the agreement is carried out. However, early indications do not justify optimism. Israel has in fact exploited this period of peace to prepare for war. It has demanded weapons from the United States that will give it a certain military superiority, so that it can impose its will on everyone; and that leads us to believe that its intention is to create a de facto situation that will satisfy its greed and that some have already called a Pax Israelina.\n161.\tThat situation will never be accepted by the Arabs, even if it means war for centuries to come.\n162.\tPeace in the Middle East will never be the kind of peace that Israel is trying to impose by force of military superiority; it will be a peace arising from agreement among all the parties concerned.\n163.\tThat is why, while we appreciate the importance of the agreement of September 1975, which might be a decisive stage in the development of the Middle East question, we will pass final judgment on it only when the second stage is under way, that is, when the three contracting parties can put their respective commitments, which, by the way, are not so much as mentioned in the text of the agreement.\n164.\tIt seems that negotiations concerning the Golan Heights will begin in October. If that is so, how long will they take? And what will the results be? Until we get replies to those two questions it will be difficult for us to pass final judgment on the agreement. However that may be, Tunisia, as already stated, considers that the crux of the problem, namely, the Palestinian question, is still before us. Tunisia will always stand by the Palestinian people and the PLO, regardless of circumstances, until that people have regained their legitimate rights.\n165.\tThe continent of Europe was this year the scene of one of the most important events since the Second World War: the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Tunisian Government has already said how impressed it was with the results of that Conference. Tunisia is a small developing country and can only welcome the efforts made to bring about the success of that Conference. We welcome also the new spirit which it seems will now imbue future relations among the States of Europe.\n166.\tWe hope that the decisions adopted by the Conference will be implemented fully and sincerely and that they will strengthen confidence and cooperation in Europe, because we are convinced that whenever it emerges anywhere in the world peace, just as much as war, trends to spread to other areas.\n167.\tHowever, we believe that peace in Europe will be limited and threatened, so long as other areas of the world have problems of war and aggression, and poverty, particularly when those areas comprise the countries bordering on Europe, as is the case with the Mediterranean countries. The Conference, as a matter of fact, did not live up to the expectations of the peoples of the area south of the Mediterranean. We believe that the criteria adopted for Europe should be considered for other areas of the world as well, inasmuch as security cannot be maintained in the western part of the Mediterranean while war is being waged in the eastern part. Similarly, cooperation cannot have full meaning if it is confined solely to Europe and not extended to all countries having close relations with Europe.\n168.\tAlthough Tunisia did not take part in the Conference as we would have wished, it will not fail to make every effort, with fraternal and friendly countries, so that the spirit which prevailed at the Conference may extend to the entire Mediterranean region, whose inhabitants wish it to become an oasis of peace and a centre for cooperation in the interests of all. The EuropeanArab dialog will perhaps provide an opportunity for finding ways and means of establishing in the Mediterranean lasting peace based on cooperation.\n169.\tI should like to take this opportunity to say that my Government very much welcomes the good results achieved at the seventh special session of the General Assembly, which studied the problems of development and international economic cooperation. That session began a movement towards the establishment of a new international economic order, which would be based, not on the criteria of relative power, but on the common interests and aspirations of one and all for peace, prosperity and economic balance. Although the results are not entirely in keeping with the desires of the developing countries, the session none the less did produce a consensus on the measures to be adopted with regard to matters on which the existence and development of a considerable part of\nMi\nmankind depend. I might, for example, mention the establishment of a system capable of improving the terms of trade and promoting more balanced and expanded international trade; the transfer of real resources in order to make solidarity among nations effective, by means of more direct participation on the part of the well-to-do countries and less unfavorable terms for the financing of the development Programs of the third-world countries; the acceleration of the industrialization of developing countries, which is a necessary condition for their development, by means of the relocation of certain industries in accordance with the Plan of Action adopted at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of NonAligned Countries held at Lima Isee A/10217 and Corr.I, ]; and the satisfaction of the food needs of three quarters of the world's  population by increasing agricultural production and food aid from the welltodo countries, along with certain changes in the way in which that aid is offered.\n170.\tThe Tunisian Government welcomes the spirit which prevailed throughout the session. It was characterized by understanding and cooperation, which will have a most definite effect on future international economic conferences. We hope that all States will ensure that the decisions adopted in the course of the session are implemented in the same constructive spirit and that efforts are continued to bring the views of the developing and the industrialized countries closer together. That would guarantee the kind of cooperation needed to establish a new economic order based on justice and interdependence.\n171.\tOver the past 30 years, mankind has experienced a considerable upheaval and an unprecedented development. The technological revolution has extended to most countries. Men are increasingly thirsting for knowledge and progress. They are demanding ever more insistently social justice and the safeguarding of human dignity. The political and economic facts of life have changed considerably, both nationally and internationally. The United Nations has played a central role in this evolution, but it has not always kept pace with it, hampered as it has been by texts and machinery created before those major changes took place. That has made us keenly aware of the need for changes in its structure and the need to adapt it to the new situation. We are aware of the need to introduce certain reforms in order to make that structure as effective as it should be.\n172.\tLast year from this rostrum I had occasion to say that we did not wish to diminish the responsibility of the major Powers, nor did we wish to divert the Organization from the objectives that are its raison d'etre, but we must observe that the international responsibilities of other nations are increasing in scope and number. If we do not wish the Organization to be overtaken by events it is our duty to associate all the other nations more closely than before with the process of decision-making in this Organization and to place them in a position from where they can supervise the implementation of those decisions on an equal footing with the rest. That will make it possible for our Organization to become universal and able effectively to solve international problems.\n173.\tIf we survey the past 30 years we must note that the Organization has not always put an end to aggression, nor has it always adopted sanctions against the aggressor. Israel and South Africa, for example, have flagrantly and consistently defied the Organization. without having had to fear the slightest sanction. On the contrary, those two countries have increasingly defied the dictates of the conscience of the international community by practicing new forms of collaboration and new forms of mutual support in order to pursue designs condemned by mankind as a whole. The Organization does not yet have the means which would make it possible for it to implement the decisions of its various bodies, which accounts for the disappointment and the failures of a number of international institutions. That is why we must begin to study the various ways and means of strengthening our Organization so that its decisions will not remain a dead letter.\n174.\tWill our Organization find the ways and means to give it strength and courage to make it possible to develop in harmony with the requirements of the day? Will Member States reach that unanimity which will generate a common and sincere will to move towards peace and development? That is our sincere desire, in the interests of our Organization and of all mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "126.\t  On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Bhutan, I have the\nhonor to congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. We are especially glad that the leader of a small country, like our own, is at the helm of the affairs of this important session. My delegation is confident that with his statesmanship and experience, the qualities which he has already demonstrated during the past weeks, he will guide our deliberations to a successful conclusion. I should also like to extend to him and to the officers of the Committee the assurances of my delegation's co-operation and support in carrying out the heavy responsibilities in the weeks ahead of us.\n127.\tAllow me also to convey my delegation's appreciation to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, for the leadership he gave us during the twenty-ninth and the seventh special sessions.\n128.\tThere are today challenges and opportunities which face this world body. The opportunity is to create new life styles based on deep motivations flowing from a search for a better and freer life. The challenge is to accept and adjust to the consequences of the evolution of unequal relations and treatment. On the positive side, there are important recent events and successes contributing towards the fulfillment of the objectives of this Organization. The transfer of power by Portugal to the former colonies in Africa is no mean achievement. With the exception of Angola, all the former Portuguese colonial territories have achieved independence. With the independence of Papua New Guinea on 16 September, 10 of the 11 original Trust Territories have also gained independence. The manner in which these States reached independence is a source of great satisfaction. It is, therefore, with great pleasure that my delegation welcomes the admission of Cape Verde, Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe to membership in the United Nations.\n129.\tThe General Assembly recently adopted resolution 3366 (XXX) by 123 votes to none, with 9 abstentions. My delegation supported that resolution, which requested the Security Council to reconsider immediately and favorably the applications of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam for admission to the United Nations. We regret that the Security Council again failed to make the recommendation. The Kingdom of Bhutan firmly believes in the principle of universality of this Organization and each new Member, we feel, adds to the strength of this body. We hope that those who are still outside this family of nations will succeed in gaining membership in the near future, so that our Organization becomes not only representative but also more effective.\n130.\tIt is regrettable that the attitude of the illegal minority regime not to accept majority rule has so far prevented the fulfillment of the legitimate aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe. There also has been little improvement in the situation in Namibia and the United Nations continues to face the challenge. One of the serious problems in South Africa is, of course, the continued practice of apartheid and racial discrimination which is in direct contradiction of he principles of human rights and the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations. All these reaffirm our\nbelief that we all must make concerted efforts to make the United Nations decisions more effective.\n131.\t\\\"We are gratified that there have been some encouraging developments in the complex problem of the Middle East. We sincerely hope that a lasting solution can be found soon. We believe that negotiations provide the best hopes for a peaceful settlement. Slowness or absence of further progress will undoubtedly increase the risk of renewed conflicts. The consequences of such a conflict will be disastrous for the people in the area and will pose a serious threat to international peace and stability. We are convinced that all the parties to the conflict sincerely desire a peaceful settlement and the basis for such a settlement does exist in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We do not subscribe to the occupation of territories by force and continue to support the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, which need to be restored. At the same time the realities ill the area have to be recognized so that all the States can live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.\n132.\tThe past year has seen some signs of further relaxation of tension all over the world. A gradual process of reconciliation has been set in motion even in South Asia. This region, of which we are the smallest part, has been plagued by a large number of problems, some man-made and some due to natural causes. In our opinion consistent efforts towards a just and durable peace will provide the opportunity to concentrate our attention to the great task of nation-building. We hope the countries in the region will make further efforts for mutual accommodation and reconciliation on the basis of equality and co-operation. The Kingdom of Bhutan is fully committed to the principles of non-alignment and to the aims and objectives of the Charter to work towards peace and stability, Our policy is friendship with all and malice towards none, with mutual respect for sovereignty and independence.\n133.\tIt is a matter of gratification that the people in Indo-China have at last found freedom from interference aFter all the traumatic experiences they have undergone throughout these fateful years. The people of these countries, we hope, will now be able to settle down to enjoy a period of reconciliation and reconstruction in order to build a sound and stable future fashioned according to their own genius.\n134.\tThe problem in the Korean peninsula, however, continues to threaten stability in the area. The consensus reached during the twenty-eighth session, which called on the parties to seek peaceful reunification without outside interference, gave us some hope for beginning a year of understanding and fruitful negotiations. My delegation is still of the firm view that the people of Korea should be allowed to solve the problem by peaceful and independent means.\n135.\tDuring the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly my delegation supported resolution 3212 (XXIX) and we also believe that Security Council resolutions 365 (1974) and 367 (1975) provided a sound basis for negotiation between the two communities. Bhutan, being a member of the non-aligned movement, supports the Political Declaration of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries held at Lima last August [\nAII02I7 and Our.I, annex, p. i], which called upon all parties to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus and the immediate unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops and for continuation of constructive dialog between the two communities. In this regard, we appreciate the role played by our Secretary-General and the efforts he has been making to help the two communities to solve the problem with greater understanding and a sense of co-operation, We can assure the Secretary-General that his efforts for international peace and stability have our full support.\n136.\tBhutan is also a hinterland State of the Indian Ocean. The maintenance of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace is of much concern to us. My delegation has consistently supported the moves and the relevant resolutions at the United Nations. The presence of big-Power rivalry will only build up tension, which will not only disturb stability in the region but will also cause division among the affected areas. In view of this we firmly believe that the area should be free of foreign military installations and foreign bases built in the context of big-Power rivalry. In order that the declaration may be respected by all States, we would support the idea of convening a conference of all littoral and hinterland States with the co-operation of the major Powers and the major maritime users.\n137.\tOn the question of global disarmament, my delegation still finds the progress rather slow. We recognize the overriding importance of the United Nations responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, especially in the face of \\\"ultimate weapons\\\" threatening the end of humanity. We are, however, glad that the big Powers have also realized this problem more than ever, as has been stated by the leaders concerned recently from this rostrum. The situation indeed needs to be rectified and we appreciate the proposals that have been made here recently. We support the reduction of the military budgets of the States concerned by 10 per cent and the use of the funds thus saved for assistance to developing countries. Taking these points into consideration, my delegation will welcome the convening of a world disarmament conference to discuss all the options and work towards complete disarmament with the participation of all countries. The need for full preparation towards this end hardly needs to be emphasized at this stage.\n138.\tThe global economic situation still suffers from unfavorable destabilizing factors and endangers the economies of the developing countries. The developing countries continue to suffer from depreciation of the terms of trade due to inflation and the inadequate transfer of real resources. As a result, the developing countries are forced to take adjustment measures which are often harmful for the economic and social development in these countries. In fact, in the most severely affected countries a negative growth rate is in the offing. The International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] has apparently failed to provide the expected remedy.\n139.\tWe are, however, encouraged by the definite signs of co-operation now emerging on these matters. The sixth special session stressed economic inter-\ndependence on a world-wide scale and also defined the basis for a new international economic order. The Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] could be regarded as a landmark in the economic and social progress of our Organization. Unlike the sixth special session, the recent seventh special session enjoyed a climate of compromise and negotiations which enabled us to adopt the resolution [3362 (S-VII)] unanimously. Having thus laid the corner-stone, we must progress in the direction of gathering momentum for development in the larger perspective of world economic co-operation.\n140.\tBhutan is an agricultural country and we have to import the essential materials needed for the sustenance of our economy. We have high potential to expand production for exports. Our minerals, forest produce and potential for hydro-electric power are being harnessed to meet our needs. The life-blood of our economy is road transport. Being a land-locked country, the increased transportation cost adds to our problem.\n141.\tIn this respect, my Minister for Foreign Affairs, during the recent seventh special session, in this statement emphasized the peculiar problems of the land-locked and least developed States of the developing countries. The problem of the land-locked States has also been brought to focus recently by the Secretary-General's report on special measures related to the particular needs of the land-locked developing countries [Al 10203}. We hope the problem of these developing States will receive attention, as has also been recommended in the resolution of the seventh special session.\n142.\tWe in Bhutan, under the wise guidance of His Majesty King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, have been directing our energies to modern lines of economic and social development with the central aim of raising the living standard and opening to the people new opportunities for a richer and more varied life. Our friendly neighbor, India, with which we have cordial relations, has been helping us generously despite its own pressing commitments. Our goal is to achieve self-reliance and harness our natural resources with the use of modern technology to promote the institutions, values and attitudes of a happy and just society.\n143.\tMy delegation hopes that a new law of the sea will emerge from the forthcoming session of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to be held here in New York. We fully realize that on such a complex legal subject the harmonization of views of all countries would be difficult to achieve in so short a time. It is, however, a matter of gratification that an informal single negotiating text, on which there is no agreement, has seen the light of day. Geographical and historical factors denied the land-locked and other disadvantaged States the enjoyment of the advantages of States bordering on the sea. Nevertheless, we hope the legitimate rights and interests of all States, whether coastal or land-locked, will be recognized so that all nations can participate in the sharing of the resources of the sea and the ocean floor. We believe in the establishment of a strong sea-bed regime to regulate the exploration and exploitation of the sea. Keeping these considerations in view, my delegation would be willing to work towards an acceptable new law of the sea that\ncould guide all the nations in exploring and exploiting the riches of the vast sea,\n144 My delegation supported the establishment of an ad hoc group to review the Charter of the United Nations. A mere review of the Charter, we feel does not and cannot mean the complete revision of the Charter, nor do we feel the need to do so. In this thirtieth year of the United Nations, however, we believe that the time has come to have a look at some of the provisions in the light of present needs and realities.\n145.\tMy delegation firmly believes that with the constructive attitude of all its Members, big or small, rich or poor, the United Nations is still a viable body and the only one that exists to help man in the pursuit of peace and in the elimination of poverty, sickness and other problems. The narrow confines of national interest of all of us here will have to be made more flexible to accommodate the lofty ideals of the United Nations. The hopes of all mankind depend on how soon we act on these problems and how we face this challenge.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "128.\t Allow me, Mr. President, to extend to you my sincerest congratulations on your election as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n129.\tThe events which have taken place since the twenty-ninth session testify to the fact that time works in favor of the cause of peoples and revolution, that revolutionary struggles and national liberation have been brought to a higher level.\n130.\tIn the present year, sovereign States and peoples have won important victories in the struggle against imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism, first and foremost against American imperialism and Soviet social-imperialism, in the defense of their freedom, their independence and their sovereign rights, and for their free and independent development.\n131.\tThe heroic peoples of Viet Nam and Cambodia have conquered on the battlefield the American imperialist aggressors and their lackeys, and they inflicted on the United States a most overwhelming defeat. The American imperialists, regardless of all the means and methods for waging war and aggression that they used, in spite of the constant support received from the Soviet social imperialists, who constantly acted as traitors and tried to undermine the just struggle of the peoples of Indo-China, were not able to bring those peoples to their knees and were forced, in shame, to leave Cambodia and Viet Nam.\n132.\tThis victory of world-wide historic significance of the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples offers valuable lessons for all peace-loving peoples. This victory shows that a people, no matter how small, if it fights to the end and is determined to receive its rights, can conquer any enemy and can even defeat an imperialist super-Power. That is concrete proof of the triumph of the war of the people over the aggressive\nstrategy of imperialism and forces of reaction. In Viet Nam and in Cambodia it was demonstrated once again that freedom is not something that can be given as a gift, but is won; that it is not weapons that determine the fate of war but man; that people can conquer and defend their rights not by haggling, not by compromise, but by their struggle, their determined efforts, their courage and determination, and their revolutionary spirit and spirit of sacrifice.\n133.\tThanks to their struggle for liberation, the peoples of Mozambique, of Cape Verde, and of Sao Tome and Principe have thrown off the age-old colonialist yoke of Portugal and have set themselves up as young independent States. We welcome the admission of these young States to the United Nations and we wish them every success in their struggle to consolidate the victories which they have won, in their free, independent and democratic development, in their struggle against the neo-colonialist maneuvers and tactics on the part of the two super-Powers. We express our full solidarity with the determined struggle that the peoples of Namibia, Azania and Zimbabwe are conducting against the ferocious policies of racial discrimination and apartheid, against colonialism and neocolonialism.\n134.\tThe course of events always brings out more forcefully the important role of the developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America and their ever-increasing weight in international life. The peoples of those countries are standing up with even more courage in their fight against the policies of aggression and economic expansion, against plundering and imperialist exploitation, to defend their freedom, independence and sovereign rights, to obtain their economic independence and to exercise their full sovereignty over their natural wealth and raw materials. The two imperialist super-Powers, which are the greatest exploiters and plunderers of the developing countries, the main parties responsible for the poverty and backwardness of those countries and for the injustices of which they are the victims, under the cover of \\\"friendship\\\", \\\"aid\\\" and \\\"co-operation\\\" have striven to weaken their struggle and break their will for development and progress. But, whether the two super-Powers like it or not, the developing countries have shown increasing strength and ability to resolve their development problems themselves in complete freedom and independence, in accordance with their national interests.\n135.\tThe seventh special session, as well as a number of other international activities which were organized before this session, testify to the fact that the developing countries will not allow others to toy with their rights; nor can the imperialist Powers derive profits by undermining their interests and imposing on them unfair and unjust economic and trade relations.\n136.\tIn the future as in the past, the People's Republic of Albania, with all its strength, will support the just struggle and just claims of the developing countries, the measures that they have adopted and will adopt to gain control over their national wealth and raw materials. We welcome the continuing strengthening of solidarity and co-operation among the developing countries in their struggle to enjoy their rights. In their fight they enjoy the friendship and the support of all their friends. They enjoy the support ot that\ngreat country, the People's Republic of China, a powerful socialist country which has been sincerely and disinterestedly helping the peoples of the world in their efforts to develop and progress, in their opposition to imperialism, social-imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism.\n137.\tUnder the unceasing blows of revolutionary forces and national liberation forces, of the forces of denaocracy and social progress, the imperialists, social-imperialists and all other reactionaries have sustained continuous assaults. The general crisis of capitalism has undermined the entire system. Production has gone down in many principal sectors. Inflation has increased. Unemployment has acquired new proportions and, in many countries, has reached the highest levels that it has ever reached since the end of the Second World War. Contradictions within their alliances and political, economic and military groups have become ever more serious. The United States is no longer able to bridge the numerous gaps in these alliances and in these groups and they are encountering increasing opposition on the part of their allies and partners. The Soviet Union and the other revisionist countries are also undermined constantly by a great number of difficulties, by contradictions both internal and external. The Soviet social-imperialists are oppressing the peoples of the Soviet Union, and are instilling in them a spirit of aggressive nationalism and \\\"Great Russia\\\" chauvinism. They continue to occupy, and to grind under their iron heel, those countries, and the peoples of those countries, they consider to be allies.\n138.\tIn order to overcome the serious situation in which they find themselves, the two imperialist superPowers are making a feverish effort to modify the course of history. They have intensified their policy of aggression, expansion and hegemony and are perfecting methods of blackmail, aggression and violent intervention in the internal affairs of others. They have practiced duplicity and demagogy and are constantly plotting against peace-loving peoples, thereby creating sources of tension and of potential war throughout the world and endangering international peace and security.\n139.\tAfter the serious defeat which they suffered in Indo-China, the American imperialists are doing their utmost to regain control, to maintain their well-known pretensions to \\\"grandeur\\\" and to America's \\\"leading role\\\" in the world, pretending to be more \\\"reasonable\\\" more \\\"peace-loving\\\", more \\\"humanitarian and more \\\"tractable\\\" in their dealings with other countries, and more \\\"accommodating\\\" with their allies While pretending to \\\"review their policy they are, in fact, regrouping their forces and planning further adventures and attacks on freedom and on the independence of sovereign States and peoples.\n140 The Soviet social-imperialists, also victims of megalomania and guilty of great-Power arrogance, are also taking advantage of the difficult moments which their rival, the United States, i? experiencing boasting ever more noisily of their power and their leading role in the world. In order to conceal their frenzied \\\"heEemony\\\" they spare no praise for their so-called policy of \\\"peace\\\", \\\"friendship\\\" and \\\"international co-operation\\\".\n141.\tThe two parties the Soviet Union and the United States are trying stubbornly to gain recognition for their right to determine what is happening in the world, and they are trying to have others believe that there is no political, economic or social problem of our times which can be solved without them. And if their policies and solutions are not accepted, if one objects to their diktat, their control and hegemony, then great dangers shall threaten mankind.\n142.\tThe United States and the Soviet Union, in order to camouflage the dangers which their rivalry and bargaining entail, in order to expand and establish their hegemony, their militarization and constant preparations for war, are doing what they can to instill a sense of euphoria, a sense of false peace by constantly repeating their demagogic references to \\\"detente\\\", \\\"co-operation and security\\\", \\\"general and nuclear disarmament\\\" and so forth. In this way they are trying to propagate a feeling of demobilization among the peoples of the world, to slacken the vigilance of others, to weaken and stifle opposition to imperialism, social-imperialism and reaction. But the sovereign peoples and States of the world judge according to deeds and not words.\n143.\tThe two super-Powers have today become the largest manufactures and traffickers of weapons in history. They are involved in an unbridled arms race and they constantly increase their arsenals and perfect means of mass destruction, as part of their efforts to bring about war and aggression, to intimidate and frighten the peoples of the world, to force other countries to shelter under the American or Soviet umbrella and to accept Soviet-American domination in the world as something inevitable. The American imperialists and the Soviet social-imperialists have sold arms to the four corners of the world, but they do so in the interests of their own policies of aggression, in order to support and maintain reactionary regimes, in order to make those countries which receive weapons bow to their policies and to incite others to wage war. For their part, the Soviet Union and the United States are armed to the teeth, but they recommend that others disarm. On the question of disarmament, the Soviet social-imperialists wish to play the role of standard bearer. They have grown accustomed to delivering, year after year and in all international bodies, all manner of speeches and proposals on the subject of the limitation of weapons, a 10 per cent reduction in the military budget of the permanent members of the Security Council, and on general and complete disarmament and so on.\n144.\tOf course, the peoples of the world will not fall into such traps laid for them by the two superPowers under the guise of disarmament. They cannot agree to disarm when their enemies are constantly arming themselves. It is not only impossible but also dangerous to think that general and complete disarmament can be brought about by a world conference, as the Soviet social-imperialists would have us believe, or by carrying out other plans which the two superPowers propose out of sheer demagogy. The representatives of the Soviet Union singing their old refrain have submitted a new proposal to the Assembly this year, that of a treaty banning all nuclear tests. In the course of this session also, as happened in previous sessions, they are trying to promote sterile\nand vain debates and to use those debates to boast about the major contribution they are making to \\\"limiting the arms race\\\", to \\\"detente\\\", and to the beginning of \\\"general and complete disarmament\\\". Everybody knows that in making those proposals the Soviet Union, just like the United States, has carried out the largest number of nuclear tests, and did so precisely after the conclusion of a treaty on their partial cessation. The two super-Powers, whenever they make a proposal on the testing of nuclear weapons, do so solely to gain superiority or monopoly in that area. The present Soviet proposal in no way lessens the danger of the use of the great nuclear arsenals which the two super-Powers have created for themselves. Nor does it make it impossible for them to increase those arsenals or to perfect weapons. Why then does the Soviet Union, while banning the nuclear tests, try to legalize underground tests for so-called peaceful purposes? Does that not mean that it truly does wish to act as it has in the past but under a different label, thus tying the hands of other countries which are anxious to defend themselves? The peoples of the world have had their fill of speeches and meetings on the subject of disarmament. Concrete results however are lacking, and there will not be any concrete results forthcoming because of the aggressive policies of the two imperialist superPowers. Confronted with the threats of the two superPowers, the peace-loving States and peoples of the world have a right and a duty to increase their power and their ability to defend themselves in order to deal with any situation and to cope with any attack or act of aggression.\n145.\tThe United States and the Soviet Union are now endeavoring zealously to convince us that the conclusion of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe marks the beginning of a new era: the era of peace, tranquility and stability, cooperation in all areas, and the beginning of general harmony.\n146.\tThe fact is, though, that there has been no change in Europe, however small, which might even justify such an assertion, and there is no reason to expect that such positive developments will ensue in that area simply because of a Conference such as the one at Helsinki, which began and ended as a Soviet-American plot, or because of the repeated proclamation of certain standards and principles which have long been recognized but which the imperialist Powers have never respected and will never respect. The bitter past reminds the peoples of Europe that they must be ever watchful not to be misled by the two super-Powers.\n147.\tTo be sure, the peoples of Europe want peace and genuine security on their continent. But in order to achieve that noble goal it is indispensable that concrete and effective action be taken, that there be radical changes in the present situation in Europe, and that general declarations on peace and security formulations and general declarations into which the two imperialist super-Powers have injected their poison\u2014be rejected. There can be no security in Europe when, 30 years after the end of the Second World War, a number of European countries are still militarily occupied by the two super-Powers; when the European peoples are continually being threatened\nby the aggressive policies of those Powers; when the United States and the Soviet Union, in order to divide and dominate Europe, maintain many military bases and troops there and constantly increase their war arsenals; when they maintain and perfect the military and political structures of the aggressive blocs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] and the Warsaw Pact, and organize military maneuvers; 'or when they engage in large-scale political and economic pressure and blackmail, and undermine and subvert the European countries.\n148.\tThe two super-Powers convened the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, not because they were anxious to bring about peace and security in Europe, but to promote their designs for hegemony, to legitimize their spheres of influence and their privileges in various countries of Europe, and to compel participating countries to recognize them as the arbiters in all European questions. Despite their alleged desire to bring about European security, what they really want is to maintain the status quo between themselves and to establish a certain balance in Europe in order to support their aggressive policies in other parts of the world.\n149.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe was not a free assembly of the countries of Europe: the United States and the Soviet Union went there and did whatever they could to gain for themselves vital decision-making powers on all essential points. It was continually seen at the meetings in Helsinki and Geneva that the European States had very few opportunities to express their concerns freely or to say openly where the dangers threatening the people of Europe were coming from or who should ensure security on the continent. The participants at those meetings constantly ran into pressure, diktat and blackmail at the hands of the two super-Powers. Undeniably, any decision about moving from one stage to another, or about reaching a compromise, was preceded by meetings of the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States. Even the very few problems which were raised by certain countries but which did not fall neatly within the framework established by the two super-Powers were set aside or completely transformed as a result of the pressure brought to bear.\n150.\tThere can be no doubt that the two imperialist super-Powers will exploit the documents of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe for speculative purposes, for their maneuvers  and new political plans, and that, in the guise of implementing the decisions contained in those documents, they will intensify their pressure on other countries. Those who still harbor illusions and think that the documents adopted at Helsinki nevertheless represent something concrete will be greatly disappointed. Even now, before the ink of the signatures at the bottom of those documents has dried, a number of countries and political circles are entertaining serious doubts, openly questioning the usefulness and value of those documents; and the enthusiasm that some had about them is beginning to wane.\n151.\tThe Government of Albania has long asked the following questions: \\\"What will become of Europe after the conclusion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe? What will the decisions\nof that Conference bring to Europe? What guarantees will the European peoples have that they will no longer in the future be victims of aggression, as was the Czechoslovak people in August 1968?\\\" Today we see even more clearly what we already knew: Europe remains one of the main areas of rivalry and bargaining between the two imperialist super-Powers an arena where there are many bitter contradictions which themselves pose a potential danger of major conflagrations an arena in which the problems handed down from the Second World War remain, and where new and complicated problems are arising amidst increasing tension.\n152.\tThe Albanian people is small in number. Throughout its history it has experienced more suffering and misfortune than any other European people as a result of foreign exploitation and occupation. Through its own efforts but at the price of the blood shed by its youth, the Albanian people threw off the Nazi Fascist yoke and created the new independent and socialist Albania, which it has been defending against the constant threats of the imperialists and social-imperialists. Hence we have a vital interest in seeing the establishment of lasting peace and genuine security\n, in Europe. The Government of the People's Republic of Albania fully understands the concerns and preoccupations of the peoples of Europe over the dangers threatening them, as well as the justified desires of many European countries to eliminate those dangers. Our Government has openly and frankly expressed its views on the problem of security, and from the very beginning had declared its opposition to the convening of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Indeed, we did not even participate in it, convinced as we were that that position was in accordance with the interests of the Albanian people and of the peoples of Europe at large. As the much beloved leader of the Albanian people, Enver Hoxha, has said:\n\\\"The People's Republic of Albania has its own views and develops its own constructive policies openly, in broad daylight. No question is alien to us, and no one can silence us. Every State and people has the right freely to express its own views and to oppose those of others when it disagrees with them, just as others have the right to oppose its views when they disagree with them. It would be completely wrong to remain passive and silent when some are acting to the detriment of other peoples or States, or to accept, as some would wish, that just because a State or a people is small it is pretentious for it to speak out to defend its rights and those of its friends, or to express its views in the presence of the 'major' Powers. False modesty and the opportunist way of thinking of a slave are alien to the policies of the Albanian State and the rule of the proletariat.\\\"\n153.\tThe People's Republic of Albania has struggled, and will continue to fight, together with other peoples of Europe to bring about peace and security in that continent; and with determination we will adhere to our policy of safeguarding and strengthening our national independence and respect for the independence of other countries. We will never allow the peoples of neighboring countries or of other countries in Europe to be wronged in any way on our territory.\nWe have stubbornly fought and will continue to do so every hostile act against our freedom and independence. We will thwart and expose courageously and without any hesitation the aggressive policies of hegemony of the United States and the Soviet Union and whatever efforts they might make to capitalize on the documents of the Helsinki Conference. The People's Republic of Albania and the Albanian Government respect all those countries and Governments that pursue independent policies in accordance with their interests and sovereign rights and with the interests of peace and general security. We are prepared to build good relations with all countries respecting the rights of Albania on the basis of the principles of complete equality, respect for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference in the internal affairs of others, good-neighborliness and mutual advantage.\n154.\tWe are firmly of the opinion that the question of genuine peace and security in Europe will inevitably be resolved when the European people themselves take the matter in hand, as they should. Today more than ever before it is essential to multiply efforts to thwart and destroy the plans of aggression and subjugation of the United States and the Soviet Union, to isolate the American imperialists and the Soviet socialist-imperialists and to make it impossible for them to dominate Europe.\n155.\tTo our way of thinking, if concrete steps are to be taken in the direction of establishing an atmosphere of understanding and reciprocal confidence and sincere co-operation on a footing of equality with all European countries, it is necessary to put an end to spheres of influence in Europe and to liquidate the military aggressive blocs of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Each country must take measures to see that there are no foreign bases or foreign troops on its territory, that it does not give any facilities or privileges of any kind to the United States or the Soviet Union and must see to it that on its territory it does not allow any activities directed against any other country, Genuine security in Europe can be brought about only if it is not detached from the struggle to resolve disturbing problems on a world-wide scale. Europe cannot be an isle of tranquility and stability in a world fraught with turmoil and conflict. The European countries cannot be calm and safe when around them in the Mediterranean and in the Middle East and in other areas of the world the United States and the Soviet Union systematically cause tension and provoke conflicts with very dangerous consequences.\n156.\tQuite rightly, among the peoples of the Mediterranean countries there is a growing anxiety and concern over the serious and perilous situation created in that area as a result of the rivalry between the two imperialist super-Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union. In order to guarantee their dominant and strategic positions and in order to expand their military, political and economic penetration, they are increasing the number of their warships in the Mediterranean and are doing whatever they can, by using pressure and blackmail, flattery and demagogy, to compel the Mediterranean people to accept the present situation and to oblige a number of countries in that area to make concessions, to accept military bases on their territories and to be bound as closely as\npossible to the chariot wheel s of one or the other of the imperialist super-Powers.\n157.\tFor the peoples and the countries of the Mediterranean, the only reliable alternative is courageously to oppose the policies of aggression and hegemony of the two imperialist super-Powers, to call for the withdrawal of their aggressive fleets, to do away with the military bases on their territories and not to allow the United States and the Soviet Union to use the ports in their countries as bases for the implementation of their plans. The interests of the Mediterranean peoples require concrete action by each country of that region so that no one bows to the influence of the two super-Powers and so that no one will be caught in the web of their complicated plots.\n158.\tIt is now ever more obvious that the tense and threatening situation in Cyprus and the disturbing consequences which it entails for those in the area are the result first and foremost of the policy and machinations of the two imperialist super-Powers.\n159.\tSo long as the United States and the Soviet Union are able to interfere in the internal affairs of Cyprus, the people of that country and their neighbors will know only misfortune and suffering. The United States and the Soviet Union have never been and never will be in favor of a genuine solution of the problem of Cyprus. Thus it is that their \\\"initiatives\\\", \\\"programs\\\", \\\"mediation\\\" or \\\"sponsorship\\\", direct or through others, are merely plots and intrigues to prevent stability on the island, to maintain quarrels and conflicts and to make it possible for them to take advantage of dissensions to advance their interests of the moment.\n160.\tThe Albanian people has always borne in mind the welfare of the friendly peoples of Cyprus, Greece and Turkey and sincerely hopes that Cyprus will not be a constant victim of the ambitions of the two superPowers. We condemn any foreign interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus and demand that an end be put to that activity so that the two communities living on Cyprus can themselves, with patience and goodwill and without foreign interference, settle their own affairs in accordance with their own interests and aspirations, in full harmony on the basis of equal rights. The People's Republic of Albania has always favored the existence of a free and independent State of Cyprus, and respect for its territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n161.\tThe peoples of the Balkan peninsula have learned a great deal from their bitter past when the imperialist Powers, moved solely by their own selfish interests, made that region a powder keg. Today they cannot fail to be aware of the great dangers to them from the American imperialists and the Soviet socialist-imperialists, who are extending their claws towards the Balkans in order to satisfy their expansionist greed and carry out political, economic and military penetration in that region, and are trying to rekindle former quarrels and old conflicts and turn some Balkan countries against others.\n162.\tBecause of the complicated situation and the dangerous political and military circumstances created by the two super-Powers in the Balkans, the peoples of that area have an overriding duty to increase their watchfulness, and every Balkan country must see to it\nthat with full responsibility, patience and goodwill it builds with the other countries of the peninsula friendly relations by fighting against and rejecting any form of foreign interference in its internal affairs and any form of foreign interference in its policy, and by taking concrete action to strengthen its independence and national sovereignty. The attitudes and acts, whether deliberate or carried out under the pressure of specific circumstances, which are designed to favor the political hegemony of the two superPowers in the Balkans, violate the interests of the peoples of the Balkans and render a disservice to the cause of peace and stability in that area, Balkan understanding and co-operation can be brought about by eliminating a number of well-known factors which cause tension and disagreement, doubt and distrust among the countries of the peninsula.\n163. The Government of the People's Republic of Albania has been and remains convinced that the best and surest way to defend the interests and the rights of the Balkan peoples and peace and stability in that a.rea is resolutely to oppose the aggressive policies of Ihe United States and the Soviet Union and to develop bilateral relations among the Balkan States on the basis of the principles of good-neighborliness, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of others, non-interference in the internal affairs of others and mutual advantage. The People's Republic of Albania has always moved along those lines and it always will. We hope that the spirit of sincerity, mutual respect and true understanding will prevail in relations among the Balkan States and that the imperialist Powers will not be allowed to complicate the situation in the Balkans.\n264. The dangerous situation in the Middle East is a subject of constant and major concern not only for the Arab peoples, but for all peace-loving peoples in the world. Genuine peace is very far from having been established, because the two super-Powers have never wanted and do not want peace and stability to be established there. The United States and the Soviet \\\"Union talk a great deal of their efforts to bring about a settlement of the problem in the Middle East, but at the same time American-Soviet rivalry for hegemony and expansion in that area is moving ahead.\n165. The two super-Powers, which are now known as the two greatest and most dangerous enemies of the Arab peoples, are using ever more subtle tactics and manoeuvres to deceive those peoples, to prevent the liberation of their occupied territories and the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people. In order more easily to attain their ends, the American imperialists trumpet the fact that they are about to reconsider their policy in the Middle East, that they now have a more friendly attitude toward the Arab peoples and that they are more willing to help the Arab countries. The Soviet social-imperialists, for their part, are using diabolical tactics to convince the Arab peoples that, without the assistance and support of the Soviet Union, they will not be able to assert their rights. The American imperialists and Soviet social-imperialists now use flattery, now pressure, in trying to divide the Arab peoples, to turn some against others, to support and encourage Israel's aggressive policy as a means of creating this situation of \\\" no war, no peace\\\" in the Middle East.\n166.\tThe Israeli Zionists, American imperialists and Soviet social-imperialists are today carrying out their aggressive policies first and foremost against the Palestinian people, and their primary objective is to put an end to their cause, to perpetuate their tragic plight, so that they will be a refugee people for ever, without a homeland and without sovereign rights.\n167.\tThe Albanian people and Government have supported and will consistently support the just cause of our brothers, the peoples of Egypt, the Syrian Arab Republic and Palestine and other Arab peoples; and we are convinced that those peoples, thanks to their resolute struggle and their fighting unity, will win a complete victory over the Zionist aggressors and the plots of the two super-Powers; that they will liberate their territories and realize their national aspirations. The key to a just and comprehensive settlement of the problem of the Middle East has been and still is the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people. If that is not brought about, there can never be peace or stability in the area.\n168.\tAfter the victory of the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples and the significant changes which have taken place in Laos, a favorable situation has been created in Indo-China and in all of South-East Asia for the liberation and independence of peoples, and for the strengthening of security and peace in that part of the world. Nevertheless, American imperialists have not given up their designs on Indo-China and South-East Asia. Furthermore, the social-imperialists, under the cover of their support and assistance, and in accordance with the well-known imperialist practice of \\\"filling a void\\\", are trying to satisfy their greed in that part of the world.\n169.\tThe rivalry of the two imperialist super-Powers and their struggle for hegemony is ever more noticeable in other parts of the Asian continent, the Indian Ocean and the Gulf zone. Within that framework, the Soviet social-imperialists are intensifying efforts to impose on the peoples and countries of Asia their notorious plan for \\\"collective security in Asia\\\", even proposing as a model the plot they hatched jointly with the United States under the label of \\\"European security\\\". They are thereby trying to carry out their designs for hegemony in Asia, to legalize their intervention in the internal affairs of Asian countries and to disguise their efforts to create alliances and political, economic and military blocs in that area. But the Asian peoples are aware that, wherever there is rivalry or collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States, or wherever the United States and the Soviet Union are extending their claws, there can never be peace or security, but there will be tensions, conflicts and constant danger. As a result of their activities of widespread aggression, the Soviet social-imperialists are revealing their true selves with every passing day. While they are trumpeting the idea of collective security in Asia, they never cease their hostile and hysterical slandering of the great people of the People's Republic of China, and their undermining and subversion in practically all Asian countries. They spare no effort or diabolical maneuver to turn one country against another, in accordance with the policy of \\\"divide and conquer\\\". But recent history has shown the Asian people that they must not believe in the fine words of the imperialists and the social-imperialists, that they\nmust tear off their masks, and nol accept their poisoned bait, but reject it.\n170.\tThe serious situation on the Korean peninsula is a threat lo peace and security in the Far East because of the stubborn determination of the United States to maintain its military occupation forces and to pursue its colonial policy in South Korea, thus preventing the Korean people from realizing their sacred national aspirations for complete liberation and the unification of their country.\n171.\tThe People's Republic of Albania supports, as it always has, the just struggle of the Korean people against American imperialism, and calls for an end to interference in their internal affairs. We support the just views and constructive proposals of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the immediate evacuation of American troops from South Korea and the reunification of the country. We resolutely condemn the \\\"two Korea\\\" plot hatched by American imperialism. The Korean nation is one and indivisible; Korea must be one country, reunified. The United Nations, which American imperialists have involved for years in their aggressive actions against the Korean people, must without delay change its attitude, make good the injustice done to that people, and take the necessary decisions so that the United States can no longer intervene in its name in the internal affairs of Korea.\n172.\tThe delegation of Albania supports the application of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Viet Nam for membership in the United Nations, and their undeniable right to membership. On that matter this Organization has a duty to act in full accordance with its responsibilities and with the will of the Vietnamese people, by taking the appropriate decision of admitting the two Vietnamese States\nto membership. The despicable maneuvers of the United States to exclude the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam from the United Nations are an obvious manifestation of their hostile attitudes towards the Vietnamese people, and reflect the tendency of American imperialism to exploit the United Nations for its own aggressive purposes,\n173, The People's Republic of Albania, guided by the just Marxist-Leninist policies of the Labor Party of Albania, by their friendship and international solidarity with all those who are fighting for their national independence and freedom against imperialism, social-imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism, will do everything it can resolutely to strengthen that friendship further and uphold the just cause of these people, to oppose strongly the policy of hegemony of the two super-Powers and to bring about a just peace and genuine security in the Balkans, in Europe and in the world. The Albanian delegation to this session of the General Assembly as in the past will not be backward in contributing to the settlement of the problems which are of concern today to the peace-loving and justice-loving peoples of the world and to all progressive mankind.\n' Official Records of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, vol.

Your outstanding contribution to the cause of peace and co-operation among nations, both within the councils of Europe and beyond, make it appropriate indeed that we should now have the benefit of your wisdom and experience in guiding our deliberations at this particular stage of world development.\n36\tTo the outgoing President of our Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Mr. Bouteflika, I wish to convey my deep appreciation for the dedicated and effective leadership he displayed, both during the twenty-ninth session and the seventh special session of the Assembly. The achievements of those two sessions will certainly be recorded as important milestones in the annals of our Organization.\n37\tAs one of the initiators of the African-Asian Conference, held at Bandung in 1955, and as one of the founding members of the non-aligned movement, two ( historic forces in contemporary world politics that have contributed so much to the liberation of peoples from colonial subjugation, Indonesia naturally derives\nimmense satisfaction whenever the struggle for national freedom gives birth to new independent nation-States. Today, it is with great joy that we welcome the attainment of independence and the admission to membership in our Organization of the Republic of Cape Verde, the People's Republic of Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. The entry of these States into the United Nations, which we hope will soon be followed by that of Angola and the Comoros, heralds a time when the entire continent of Africa will be freed from colonial domination.\n38.\t1 am particularly pleased to be able to extend Indonesia's congratulations and good wishes to our immediate neighbors, the people of Papua New Guinea, on their attainment of independence. For Indonesia, so closely linked through culture, history and geography to Papua New Guinea, this is indeed a most happy event. I am confident that our two peoples will develop even closer ties of friendship and co-operation in the future. My delegation eagerly looks forward to the day when Papua New Guinea will assume its rightful place in this Assembly as a full-fledged Member of our Organization. I also take this opportunity to express my Government's sincere appreciation for the manner in which Australia, as the administering Power, has assisted the people of Papua New Guinea in the exercise of their right to self-determination.\n39.\tWith the restoration of peace in Indo-China, the Governments of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam have indicated their desire to join in the work of our Organization. As a South-East Asian nation and one subscribing to the principle of universality of membership, Indonesia fully supports them in this desire and regrets the fact that they have so far been prevented from taking their seats in the General Assembly. It is my delegation's hope that this situation may soon be corrected, for in our view both the objectives of the Charter and the interests of the international community as a whole would be well-served by the admission of the two Viet Nam to membership in the United Nations.\n40.\tThe privilege of participating in this thirtieth session of the General Assembly is enhanced by the truly historic significance of this moment for the United Nations, for Indonesia and for the entire world. As we join in commemorating the passing of three decades since the founding of our Organization, the Indonesian people are also celebrating the thirtieth year of their rebirth as an independent nation.\n41.\tIn mentioning the link between the founding of the United Nations and the attainment of Indonesia's independence, we not only perceive a parallel in time but, above all, a correspondence of values. Both the United Nations and Indonesia came into being in the aftermath of a war that \\\"brought untold sorrow to mankind\\\". It is natural, therefore, that the similar circumstances of their birth should engender commitments to similar precepts. Both the Charter of the United Nations and the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia contain ideals and principles which are fundamentally in accord with one another, such as the principles and ideals of independence, justice and international peace and security.\n42.\tMoreover, Indonesia's struggle for independence, its efforts to achieve and maintain its territorial unity and integrity, and its growth as an independent nation are closely intertwined with the history and growth of the United Nations.\n43.\tIt was the United Nations intervention during Indonesia's war of independence which hastened the end of the armed conflict between Indonesia and the Netherlands. And it was through the United Nations also that Indonesia's territorial integrity was completed when the question of West Irian was resolved at the twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly. On the other hand, may I be excused for being less than modest in also pointing out some of Indonesia's contributions to the effective strengthening of the role of our Organization.\n44.\tForemost on my mind is the fact that 20 years ago Indonesia, together with Burma, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, took the initiative to convene the African-Asian Conference at Bandung. That historic Conference gave birth to the ten Principles of Bandung, which have since been acknowledged as the sound bases for just and peaceful relations among States and which have inspired the principles on which the non-aligned movement was founded. The Bandung Conference heralded a new era, particularly for peoples still living under colonial domination. The \\\"wind of change\\\" which was already blowing across the continents of Asia and Africa, was strengthened as a result of the Conference, and accelerated the process of decolonization, thus opening the way for the rapid expansion of the United Nations.\n45.\tIn another area, often described by our Secretary-General as one of the most striking and remarkable developments in the history of the United Nations, Indonesia's contribution has also been quite significant. I refer to the United Nations peace-keeping efforts, and to the Indonesian contingents which were on the front-lines in the Congo, in Gaza and in the Sinai, and which have given their share in human sacrifices to the cause of international peace.\n46.\tThus the ways in which Indonesia and the United Nations have both contributed to, and benefited from, each other throughout the years clearly demonstrates the special attachment with which my country views its relationship to this world body. Indonesia not only holds the United Nations in high esteem; indeed it owes it a debt of gratitude. To my Government, there is not the slightest doubt as to the indispensability of this world Organization, especially in the present period of rapid and radical change. 1 therefore wish to underline the observation made by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization, that. . there is no rational alternative in international relations to the principles and procedures of the United Nations\\\" [A/IOOOII Add.I, sect. XXI}.\n47.\tAs I remarked earlier, the Assembly is meeting at a time of truly historic significance, where world developments are characterized by rapid change, requiring the necessary adjustments. Nowhere is it of such vivid relevance as in the region of South-East Asia, where an end has finally come to the bloody ordeal inflicted upon the peoples of Indo-China for 30 long years.\n48.\tThe end of the wars in Viet Nam and Cambodia ushers in a new era in South-East Asia, one which will provide expanded opportunities to all nations of that region to devote their energies and talents to the task of national development, free from external interference and manipulation. It also opens up the prospect for the rearrangement of their mutual relationships in peaceful and mutually beneficial co-operation and on the basis of respect for one another's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n49.\tIndonesia, like all other nations of the region, has welcomed the advent of peace in Indo-China, not only as an end to bloodshed but as a necessary beginning to a period of durable peace and stable progress. But efforts to develop a new pattern of relationships and a structure of stability and harmony in SouthEast Asia do not depend on the expectations and actions of the South-East Asian countries alone; they will also be affected, to a critical degree, by the perceptions and policies of the major Powers having a presence and interests in the region. Unless those Powers come to see it as in their own interest to adopt a commonly agreed posture of greater restraint in their involvement in South-East Asia, other than to support the legitimate development impulses of the countries of the region, there will be a danger that the situation may relapse into a new cycle of intra-regional conflict and strife and into new power polarizations instigated and manipulated from the outside.\n50.\tStill, the prevailing atmosphere in South-East Asia today is one of renewed hope and a sense of opportunity never before felt during the past three decades.\n51.\tThis atmosphere of hope and promise is regrettably absent in another vitally important part of Asia. The latest developments on the Korean peninsula have reduced the prospects for an early resumption of the dialog between the two parts of Korea. Efforts to achieve peace and reconciliation, for which high hopes were raised when a joint communique was signed in July 1972 between North and South Korea, have stalemated, and preparations for renewed confrontation are now being alleged by both sides.\n52.\tIndonesia cannot but view these developments with grave concern, for not only do they render the problem of the peaceful reunification of Korea increasingly intractable, but they also have a most damaging effect on efforts to establish peace and stability in the larger region of East Asia and the Western Pacific. It is clear that the role the United Nations can and should play in finding a peaceful and durable solution to the Korean problem will be of great importance.\n53.\tThis year, the General Assembly will again be seized of the question of the presence of foreign troops under the United Nations flag in Korea. My delegation reiterates its view that the United Nations should end its military presence in Korea and that it is indeed high time that the state of war, which technically still exists between the United Nations and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, be terminated. But, as the United Nations military involvement is based on a Security Council resolution, Indonesia believes that the appropriate way would be for the Assembly to request the Security Council to take the necessary action and to formulate the modalities tor the termination of such a presence.\n54.\tIn this context, Indonesia attaches great importance to the maintenance of an atmosphere conducive to a continued and direct dialog between North and South Korea as the two principal parties to the conflict. My delegation considers it necessary, therefore, that any substitution of the Armistice Agreement by a more permanent peace arrangement should be accompanied by the establishment of alternative machinery by which an atmosphere of peace and tranquility, so necessary for the conduct of negotiations, could be maintained or improved.\n55.\tAll our efforts, however, must proceed from a recognition of the basic realities prevailing on the Korean peninsula. Unless these realities and the relevance of proposed measures are constantly kept in mind, I am afraid we will continue to be engaged in a futile exercise of supporting or rejecting contending resolutions, with no prospect of compliance by either side, and no result other than the further aggravation of the situation.\n56.\tIn the Middle East, the intensified efforts made over the past few months to bring peace and a just solution to a conflict which has persisted for almost as long as the United Nations itself has yielded another gratifying break-through.\n57.\tIndonesia welcomes the second interim agreement reached between Egypt and Israel, providing for a further withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied Egyptian territory. Indonesia extends a special tribute to President El-Sadat of Egypt for the vision and courage he has displayed in making this agreement possible. Equally, an expression of appreciation is due to the Secretary of State of the United States for his efforts to bring the positions of the two parties closer together.\n58.\tWe are all aware, however, that this agreement is but another step on the long road towards a just and durable peace. No pretext should be found to delay the exertion of further efforts to secure a comprehensive solution to the Middle East conflict. Such a solution, to be lasting, must meet the legitimate demand of the Arab nation for Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories; of the Palestinian people, for the restoration of their fundamental rights including the right to self-determination; and of Moslems the world over for the return of the Holy City of Jerusalem to Arab custody.\n59\tMy delegation remains convinced that Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) continue to provide the most relevant basis on which to proceed to secure justice as well as security for all nations of the Middle East.\n60\tThe development of events in Cyprus is another area of continuing concern to the international community. My delegation regrets the slow pace at which efforts to achieve an over-all solution of the Cyprus problem have proceeded so far. We hope that the talks, initiated in Vienna, will be continued in a spirit of mutual tolerance and accommodation so as to achieve a final political solution which would guarantee the rights of each community and would enable them to live in harmony with one another. Indonesia wishes to reiterate its stand that Cyprus should remain an independent, sovereign and non-aligned country and that its territorial integrity should be respected.\n61.\tThe adoption in 1971 by the General Assembly of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] gave rise to hopes, especially among the littoral and hinterland States, that within some foreseeable future an end could be put to the growing military rivalry in this region among the super-Powers.\n62.\tThose hopes, far from being fulfilled, have steadily diminished with each passing year, as new developments take place in complete contradiction to the objectives of the Declaration. Instead of the military build-up being arrested or decreased, a growing escalation of military rivalry can be observed in the region.\n63.\tThis state of affairs is contrary to the purposes of detente and its purported extension to other regions of the world. Indonesia expresses its serious concern over these developments and hopes that further positive action can be taken at the current session of the General Assembly with a view to ensuring full and effective implementation of the objectives of the Declaration on the Indian Ocean.\n64.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea constitutes one of the most delicate and complex international endeavors yet undertaken to create a just international order in this sphere of our globe. The forthcoming session to be held in New York next year will constitute a decisive stage in the progress of these endeavors.\n65.\tIndonesia observes with satisfaction that the efforts to ensure that the resources of the sea are utilized for the benefit of all mankind have begun to bear fruit. It should be borne in mind, however, that an international convention on the law of the sea must be based not only upon considerations of the economic well-being of all nations; it must also give due consideration to the political and security interests of the developing countries.\n66.\tMy delegation wishes to express in this forum its sincere gratitude to all friendly countries which have given their endorsement to Indonesia's concept of the archipelagic state,\n67.\tIt may be recalled that, historically, the freedom of the seas has been abused by certain major Powers to establish and perpetuate their colonial domination of the countries of the third world. An end should be put to such abuses and any future conventions on the law of the sea should unambiguously ensure respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political unity of States without prejudice to the legitimate interests of the international community.\n68.\tDevelopments on the continent of Africa provide us with mixed feelings of great satisfaction and of continuing concern. On the one hand, the international community this year could again welcome with great joy the birth of a number of independent nations in Africa and their admission to our Organization. On the other hand, conditions in southern Africa continue to harbor the evils of colonialism, racism, apartheid and minority rule in their most blatant and repulsive form.\n69.\tA racist minority regime in Zimbabwe continues to usurp the fundamental rights to independence and human dignity of the black majority, while the infamous\nsystem of apartheid persists in keeping the people of South Africa under the most degrading conditions of colonial domination. We must continue to support the-people of Zimbabwe in their struggle for independence. With regard to Namibia, it remains Indonesia's view that the United Nations must fulfill its responsibility towards the Territory and end its illegal occupation by South Africa. The United Nations must also ensure the territorial integrity of Namibia.\n70.\tIn facing the situation in southern Africa the forces of progress and justice must increase their efforts in order to compel these racist regimes to abide by the will of the international community.\n71.\tOne of the fundamental trends of our time is the phenomenon of the continuing process of detente. An important manifestation of this detente was the signing, last month, of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe by the leaders of 35 countries in Europe, the United States and Canada. Thus, at least on the continent of Europe, the atmosphere of suspicion and enmity inherited from the cold war era has been substantially eased and the prospects for more constructive relations definitively enhanced.\n72.\tWhile noting this hopeful progress in East-West relations, one cannot ignore the limited scope of the present detente, both in substance and in geographical extent. The Final Act signed at Helsinki, however welcome as a preliminary step towards global peace, has a relevance that is limited to Europe only, leaving largely unchanged many explosive situations in other parts of the world. Furthermore, the process of political detente has yet to extend itself to the realm of military detente, particularly in the field of disarmament.\n73.\tThe Secretary-General has on several occasions expressed his deep concern, one fully shared by my delegation, about the disheartening situation in which the disarmament negotiations now find themselves. Not only has the nuclear arms race between the big Powers virtually continued unabated, the proliferation of technology required to produce nuclear arms among non-nuclear Powers is now proceeding at such an alarming rate that it may soon get out of hand. Moreover, the world-wide spread of the most sophisticated conventional weapons, due to a considerable increase in the arms trade, has now created new dangers, which may eventually prove fatal for international peace and security. It is most distressing to note that global arms expenditures are now running at an appalling $300,000 million a year, while some 500 million of our fellow human beings live on the verge of starvation. Indeed, thousands upon thousands have died from starvation.\n74.\tIndonesia joins all nations and all men of good will in supporting the most urgent appeal made by the Secretary-General that all nations, great and small, nuclear and non-nuclear exercise self-restraint, slow down their arms race and limit traffic in arms.\n75.\tThe task of fashioning a comprehensive program of disarmament has now become imperative. The habit of paying only lip-service, year after year, to the desirability and importance of preventing arms proliferation must stop. Indonesia continues to urge the convening of a world disarmament conference.\nWe are convinced that such a conference would result in a broader perception of this multifaceted problem, and provide an impetus for intensifying the pace of our efforts to arrive at effective measures to control the arms race and to achieve genuine disarmament through the planned reduction of existing arsenals, both nuclear and conventional.\n76.\tAs I remarked earlier, this Assembly meets at a moment of historic significance, where a convergence can be seen of several decisive trends in world developments.\n77.\tThe steadily widening gap between rich and poor, the increasing interdependence of nations and of problems, coupled with the growing confluence between demands for social justice and the economic imperatives imposed by such global problems as international poverty, hunger, overpopulation, dwindling resources, world-wide inflation and recession have lent a dramatic and urgent dimension to man's continuing search for economic and social progress.\n78.\tThis and the growing awareness of the inseparable link between economic development and the maintenance of international peace and security have in past years led to an increasing preoccupation on the part of the international community with problems concerning its economic future and, indeed, its very survival. In turn, it has recently brought forth an unprecedented dialog between the developed and the developing countries on how to shape a New International Economic Order capable of providing greater peace, equity and sufficiency for all.\n79.\tEfforts to address ourselves to the great economic issues of our time in a more concerted and systematic manner in fact began in 1970 when the General Assembly at its twenty-fifth session solemnly adopted the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], which embodied a comprehensive set of policy measures for international economic co-operation with a view to reducing the disparities among nations.\n80.\tThe high hopes that were cherished at the time of the adoption of the Strategy were soon to be dissipated as implementation fell far short of expectations. The unfavorable trends in the world economy, instead of being reversed, actually worsened rapidly, expressing themselves in a series of crises, upheavals and violent fluctuations that rocked the very foundations of the international economic system and threatened meaningful international co-operation in other fields as well.\n81.\tFortunately, the sixth special session of the General Assembly held last year the first special session ever held to deal with economic and social issues  provided the turning-point in this process. Apart from its Declaration and program of Action [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and3202 (S-Vl)], the greatest achievement of the sixth special session, in our view, is its success in bringing about a more acute awareness of our interdependence as nations and of the inter-connexion of global problems, thus creating a more favorable atmosphere for sincere and serious common endeavors by the international community.\n82.\tWith its momentum, a series of intensive global undertakings became possible, building up until just\ntwo weeks ago when we concluded the seventh special session with the adopt on of a concession\n[resolution 3362 (sVl,)] covering a broad new program to promote development and inteSioTai economic co-operation. \n83 The results of the seventh special session are indeed only partially successful in meeting our objectives, and no one can be expected to be completely satisfied with them. But, as\\\" you, Mr President have rightly pointed out in your acceptance speech [2351st meeting], these results indeed represent the first practical expression of the necessity of transforming the international economic system in terms of a highly important political undertaking to achieve a more equitable sharing of the world's riches and to strike a new balance of interests between the industrialized and the developing countries in favor of the latter. This political undertaking, this political will, must now be sustained and given concrete expression in our further actions to implement this consensus.\n84.\tIn my delegation's view, the consensus resolution will be of operational significance and indeed facilitate the intensive work now being undertaken or envisaged by the various bodies of the United Nations system in realizing a New International Economic Order in their respective fields. This of course includes the task of restructuring the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system itself.\n85.\tIt is of equal importance to my delegation that the effective implementation of this consensus resolution should also impart a new impetus and positive impact to the various negotiations we are going to conduct or which are already in progress, both within and outside the forums of the United Nations. I am referring in particular to the multilateral trade negotiations, the forthcoming fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the projected Paris conference on energy, raw materials and development.\n86.\tIndonesia, being a producing and exporting country of a wide variety of raw materials, both mineral and agricultural, has special reasons for being highly interested in the deliberations of those conferences. Their decisions will have an inevitable bearing on our national economy, which is highly sensitive to the performance of our export trade in commodities. It is of vital importance to Indonesia, therefore, that those conferences succeed in translating the consensus resolution of the seventh special session into concrete and specific commitments and actions.\n87.\tThe commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations provides us with the opportunity to reflect on the role our Organization can and should play in world affairs in the years ahead.\n88.\tAlthough its critics have been many and vocal in the past even up to this day there has grown an increasing realization that despite its obvious imperfections the United Nations, as the only genuine world forum, must continue to be supported and strengthened. The realities of present day International developments, moreover, make it .mperaUve for a nations to do so as the only sensible avenue open to us in our efforts to cope with the critical problems of our time.\n89.\tInterdependence and the universal scope of those problems dictate the necessity for us to develop a truly global capacity to respond.\n90.\tI believe that the United Nations is the natural focal-point from which to develop such a capacity and that it can and should become the principal instrument of nations to secure at least the minimum conditions for peace and civilized life on earth.\n91.\tIt is meeting this great challenge that will be the principal task of the United Nations in the decades to come. This will obviously require change and readjustment in its organization, both structurally and procedurally. Its present inadequacies cannot be denied. But neither should we ignore the opportunity for dynamic adjustment which the United Nations has at this unique point in its development.\n92.\tThe general areas in which such change and adjustment should be effected are, I think, apparent to all of us, and to some extent the directions and forms of such change have already been identified. Above and beyond this, however, a new sense of purpose must be instilled into the conceptual approaches and programs of the United Nations, in keeping with the demands of an increasingly interdependent world of nations and of problems.\n93.\tIt is of the utmost importance that there be change in the nature and extent of commitment of the Member States to the United Nations. For too long have the Member States used the Organization as a forum in which to pursue their own national ambitions, rather than as a collective instrument to achieve common goals. Of course we cannot expect the nation-States of the world suddenly to abandon concepts of national sovereignty and national interests. But what can be asked of them is to re-examine and redefine their national ambitions in the light of the long-term global interests of mankind as a whole. Indeed, we cannot expect mankind ever to unite behind a common ideology or a supra-national Government. But I think there are sufficient grounds for hope that it will now respond to a common concern for its own survival, based on the awareness of inevitable interdependence and the compelling need for global co-operation.\n94.\tIt is only when these fundamental requirements are met that the United Nations may be able to develop the capacity to face up to its primordial task: to secure peace not just as a negation of war but peace that is a result of harmonious and just relations between nations; to attain security that is not a dictate of the strong but a security that embraces both progress and the equal opportunity for all to achieve a materially sufficient and morally acceptable life.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "33.\t  Mr. President, allow me first of all to congratulate you on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. I am confident that you will carry out your task in the best possible manner in view of your experience, knowledge and wide renown. We earnestly wish you success.\n34\tIt also pleases me to extend thanks to Mr. Abdel- aziz Bouteflika, the Foreign Minister of Algeria, for the efforts he exerted during his presidency of the twenty-ninth session, which greatly contributed to the significant results achieved by that session. To him and to our sister State of Algeria I convey my greetings.\n35\tSignificant events have occurred since the last session in the area of the struggle of peoples for liberation and independence. The Vietnamese people have achieved victory and were able to realize their will after a fierce war for which they sacrificed millions of lives The Cambodian people won victory also and realized their wishes of selecting the system and path they wanted. The struggle of the peoples of Mozambique, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe was crowned with victory, and I welcome the admission of these countries as active members of the international community and expect them to play their part in supporting the forces of freedom and progress. I denounce the policy aimed at preventing the admission of the two parts of Viet Nam to the United Nations. We consider that this admission would be an enrichment of the heroic human experience.\n36.\tDespite these victories, there are peoples still suffering from the yoke of colonialism and still subject to the most abominable forms of racial oppression. I find it my duty from this rostrum to hail the just struggle waged by the people of Angola, Namibia, Rhodesia and South Africa, as well as the various liberation movements in the world, for their freedom and for the eradication of the vestiges of the racial colonialist regimes that are still exploiting their lands and resources. I also declare our full support for the just struggle of the Korean people in realizing their national unity.\n37.\tIn Cyprus, that neighborly island which was the scene of sanguinary events, we demand the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions and the safeguarding of its unity and territorial integrity. We view with great concern the imperialist attempts and maneuver \naimed at transforming the island into a base of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n38.\tSince I am still talking about the right of peoples to self-determination, I find it imperative to refer to the Western Sahara, which is part of Arab soil, whose fate concerns the whole Arab nation, and which is still being occupied by Spanish troops. 1 appeal to the friendly Spanish Government to expedite its evacuation of this Arab territory, I declare my support for the efforts made by the Moroccan Government to solve the dispute involving the future of the Sahara in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the decisions of the Conference of Arab Heads of State or Government, held at Rabat in October 1974.\n39.\tThe policy of international detente achieved a significant positive step when it succeeded in convening, at Helsinki, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which laid down principles to be adopted by the participating members for enhancing the prospects of peace in Europe. While supporting and welcoming this significant step, may we ask what peace can be achieved when a neighboring region, namely, the Middle East, is a flaring hotbed of tension? May I also remind the Assembly of the strategic location of this region and its deep bearing on European security?\n40.\tThe October war of liberation of 1973 was a strong proof of such a link. Any talk about international detente and European security will remain idle unless the causes of tension are eliminated. Such elimination can be achieved only through the evacuation by the Zionist forces of all the occupied territories and through the realization of the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine, including the right to return and to self-determination. I shall revert to this subject later.\n41.\tThe suffocating economic crisis suffered by the capitalist world economy and its impact on international trade and the world monetary system have been reflected in the economies of the third-world countries, as if these countries have always had to pay for the mistakes of others.\n42.\tIt is high time for the international Organization to deal with these problems seriously. The peace aspired to in the United Nations Charter cannot be secured as long as there are rich countries and poor countries, dominating countries and exploited countries; unless the gap between the rich and the poor countries is narrowed; and unless the exploited countries are allowed to recover their full rights and their sovereignty over their wealth and resources.\n43.\tFor the sake of propagating the international justice we all seek it is essential to establish a new world economic order that would make it possible to improve the machinery of the prevailing trade exchanges and allow the developing countries to sell their raw materials at remunerative and stable prices proportionate to the prices levied by the advanced countries when they re-export such materials in the form of manufactured goods. Such an order would help the development plans of the developing countries. Another means that would help these countries economically and socially would be for the advanced countries to provide the developing countries with financial and technological assistance, while leaving them free to select the course they want to pursue for their development.\n44.\tIn this connexion, we support the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly at its sixth and seventh special sessions, and those adopted by the non- aligned Conference at Lima. We point out in particular the Program of Action adopted by the Assembly at its sixth special session [resolution 3202 (S-Vl)], which was reaffirmed by the seventh special session and the Charter of the Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)], and we demand the implementation of their provisions.\n45.\tI find it imperative to refer to the fact that any international economic conference whose agenda is limited to discussing the energy crisis and does not extend to discussing all raw materials, as provided for by the resolutions of the Conference of Developing Nations for Raw Materials held at Dakar in February 1975, shall be doomed to failure as was the fate of the attempt made last spring.\n46.\tAnother subject that requires a quick solution is reforming the current international monetary order that was shaken as a result of the inflation and recession in the industrialized countries in recent years, a situation which caused major fluctuations in the exchange rates of the main currencies and the floating of most of them. This has had an adverse effect on world trade, particularly on the economies of devel-oping countries, and this order has become incapable of handling international payments in a stable and equitable manner.\n47.\tThe major shifts that took place in the balance of power in the world during the last 10 years and the liberation of many developing nations and their emergence on the international scene make it necessary to reconsider this order, so that the developing countries receive the standing they deserve within the international monetary and economic establishments. Any reform in the international monetary order must take into consideration the stabilization of the main currencies of the international payments system in order to secure stable sources of such currencies for the developing countries which export raw materials.\n48.\tThe explosive effects of the tense situation in the Middle East region may not be confined to that region alone. The situation, rather, threatens world peace at large, for the following reasons.\n49.\tFirst, the Middle East region is in a strategic position. It is the cross-roads of three continents and is situated on two oceans and three seas; through it pass the most vital international communications routes. Secondly, there is the intertwining of international interests in this region. All of us remember how the war of October 1973 placed the super-Powers on the brink of a devastating nuclear war. Thirdly, there is the economic significance of this region due to the enormous quantities of oil stored therein. All of us remember the great crisis suffered by the world economy because of the October war.\n50.\tSince one of the main purposes of the Charter is to deal with anything that jeopardizes world peace and security, the tense situation in the Middle East ranks foremost among the problems to be solved. It is high time for the international community to put an end to Israel's acts that are based on domination, expansion and challenge to the Charter of the United Nations and the flouting of United Nations resolutions.\n51.\tWhen Balfour made his declaration in 1917 promising the Jews a national homeland, the Jews then residing in Palestine did not own more than 2.5 per cent of the total area of Palestine. The partition resolution adopted in November 1947 [resolution 181 (II)] gave them 56 per cent of that area. They are at present dominating the whole of Palestinian soil.\n52.\tThe Jews residing in Palestine in 1918 did not exceed 56,000 persons, that is, 8 per cent of the total population. Owing to the immigration organized and encouraged by world Zionism and the Government of the Mandatory Power, the number soared to 31 per cent in 1947. The population of Israel today is about 2,5 million, while immigration to Israel is still continuing.\n53.\tIn view of the increase in population and the small area of land, Israel has committed the worst and most heinous crimes against the Arab inhabitants by forcing them to leave their lands and properties. Accordingly, the largest exodus known in history has taken place: a whole people has been forcibly driven from its homeland and replaced by other people.\n54.\tI mention these facts to prove that they are an extension of the past and highlight Israel's expansionist and aggressive nature, which has not changed but has rather been reinforced. Israel's determination to keep its hold on the Arab territories occupied following the 1967 war is proof of what I am saying.\n55.\tIsrael's history is a series of challenges and defiance of the Charter of the United Nations and contempt for its resolutions, starting with resolution 181 (II) and the resolutions relating to the return and compensation of the refugees to those relating to\nJerusalem, protecting the Holy Places and prohibiting any changes in the archaeological sites in the occupied territories. Israel recently took steps to change the features of the Al-Ibrahimi Mosque in the city of Al-Khalil and divided it into two parts, getting a hold of the larger part, thus proving once more its disdain of spiritual and human values.\n56.\tI am not here to list the resolutions violated or disregarded by Israel; these are facts of which all representatives are aware and which our people are witnessing every day.\n57.\tAnother matter that is no less dangerous than the former is Israel's violation of human rights. Israel is exercising the worst type of oppression and racial discrimination against the Arab inhabitants residing in Palestine. Such practices exceed by far those pursued by Nazism for eliminating its opponents. This policy, which is deeply embedded in the souls of Israeli rulers, is even being applied against the oriental Jews residing in Israel.\n58.\tThroughout the history of the United Nations no State has flouted the Charter of the United Nations and resolutions as Israel has. Until when can this silence be maintained? Does not this silence towards Israel constitute a dangerous precedent that will encourage other States to follow suit? What would be the situation in such a case and what would be the fate of the United Nations and world peace?\n59.\tIsrael's case is different from that of the other Members of this Organization. Israel's admission to the United Nations, based on General Assembly resolution 273 (III) of 11 May 1949, was linked to two conditions: first, an undertaking to honor the obligations of the Charter of the United Nations from the day it became a Member of the United Nations; and secondly, implementation of resolution 181 (II), of 29 November 1947, and resolution 194 (III), of 11 December 1948, relating to the need to allow the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes.\n60.\tThe then Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs solemnly pledged to accept those two conditions. But, needless to say, Israel has not fulfilled either of them. The undertaking to honor the obligations of the Charter was a false undertaking. The resolution on the return of the refugees has remained mere ink on paper, although the United Nations has been reaffirming it every year since 1950. The same applies to resolution 181 (II). Israel occupies areas equaling four times the area granted to it under that resolution.\n61\tIsrael, which was admitted to the United Nations by resolution 273 (III) and under the two conditions I mentioned, does not deserve to be a member of the international community. It is constantly violating the United Nations Charter and resolutions; hence, the conditional resolution endorsing Israel's membership must, after an experience of over a quarter of a century, be reconsidered in the light of Israel's non-compliance with the obligations of the said resolution.\n62\tIn 1967 Israel perpetrated a new aggression and occupied territories belonging to three States, including the Golan Heights. It is refusing to withdraw from the Heights under the pretext of its need for secure boundaries\\\". It is very strange to talk about secure boundaries in the age of missiles and sophisticated weaponry. Did those \\\"secure boundaries prevent the Egyptian and Syrian armies from penetrating the occupied Arab territories during the October war? Which of the two sides needs secure boundaries? Is it Israel, whose history abounds with aggression, or the Arabs, who have always been the victim of aggression? What would become of the political map of the world and what would be the fate of world peace if each State advanced the pretext of secure boundaries to commit aggression against its neighbors and acquire territorial gains?\n63.\tThe slogan of secure boundaries raised by Israel is in reality a slogan behind which it conceals its expansionist intentions in order to keep hold of the occupied Arab territories.\n64.\tWe have tried on many occasions through the United Nations to compel Israel to withdraw from those territories. We have exerted strenuous efforts towards the implementation of the United Nations resolutions, especially those relating to Jerusalem and the securing of the national rights of the people of Palestine. The majority of world public opinion stood on our side in support of our just struggle. However, all those efforts were in vain. Israel has persisted in its intransigence and determination and keeps pursuing its aggressive and expansionist policy, building colonies and chasing the Palestinians to exterminate them.\n65.\tIn the face of all this we had only one recourse: the October war, which we fought with willingness, honor and courage. We were determined not to stop until we realized the objective of liberating our territories and securing the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine. Certain factors emerged during the war which led to the adoption of Security Council resolution 338 (1973). Our country accepted it in a telegram that I sent to the Secretary-General in which I stated that our understanding of the resolution was based on the following two principles: first, Israel's complete withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since June 1967; and secondly, the recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people.\n66.\tMany thought that the Israelis learned from the lessons of the October war. However, the facts disprove that belief. The Israelis have once more begun to talk in the same manner and to use the same language they used prior to the October war. They are reaffirming their unwillingness to withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories, notably the Golan Heights, which the Israeli statements and declarations are considering a \\\"part of Israel\\\". The Israelis are adamant in refusing to recognize the Palestinian people, thus ignoring not only the existence of that people, but also the international will that recognizes their existence, as manifested in General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX).\n67.\tI find it important to point out that the Arabs who refused to accept the consequences of the 1967 war refuse today to lose what they achieved in 1973. They are determined more than ever to safeguard and defend their rights, depending on the Organization's support and backing. Thus, it would not be safeguarding the Arab rights only, but also the Charter, its principles and the principles of freedom and dignity.\n68.\tWe are not warmongers; rather, we are working for peace. The peace we want is one that would ensure a comprehensive solution for our cause on the basis of the United Nations resolutions. Our view proceeds from the fact that any attempt that does not deal with the core of the problem that is, the people of Palestine and their expulsion from their homeland would be doomed to failure and would, in any case, be no more than a temporary truce.\n69.\tIt was with this understanding that we signed the disengagement agreement concerning the Golan Heights. We made a point of mentioning explicitly in the agreement that the agreement is only a step towards implementing Security Council resolution 338 (1973). We have never believed in the soundness of partial steps or the \\\"step-by-step policy\\\", as designated by its initiators, because such a policy ignores the unity of our cause and represents the situation as a border dispute between Israel and Egypt, or between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic, or between Israel and Jordan, while the situation in fact is between the Arabs as a whole and Israel, for an indivisible cause, namely, the restoration of the national rights of the people of Palestine and the recovery of all the occupied Arab territories.\n70.\tIt is for that reason that these steps are fraught with danger and are moving us far from peace, not bringing us closer to it. They give the impression that peace in the region is within reach, while actually the stalemate and calm that prevail bear the seeds of a new flare-up. The peace we are striving to attain with the help of this Organization and with the support and backing of all peoples is that just peace that restores to us all our occupied territories, and to the people of Palestine the international rights. We reject any atttempt to impose settlements that impair the rights of our people. Accordingly, we view the recently signed Egyptian-Israeli agreement as moving us farther from the road to peace. Besides, any consideration of that agreement as a step forward implies an attempt to mislead or means that the ingredients of peace in the region are not fully comprehended.\n71.\tI find it necessary to declare from this rostrum that attempts to face us with the alternative of either accepting the continuation of the stalemate which eventually would lead to war or accepting partial and individual agreements concluded at the expense of the rights and interests of our people will be doomed to failure and will not distract or hinder us from seeking the means leading to a real, just and durable peace. Irrespective of the circumstances, we shall not fall into the trap of the recently concluded Sinai Agreement. That agreement is merely one of those attempts to mislead. It is a move to force our people to surrender to the will of the aggressor. That agreement has given the aggressor everything, while it has given the victim of aggression nothing more than a feeling of bitterness and injustice, with all the dangers intrinsic in the accumulation of such feelings dangers that would inevitably lead to the tearing up of all covenants and agreements, thus bringing the region to the brink of a new war. The world will then realize that such an agreement was not a step towards peace, but was rather a temporary truce in a situation that threatens the whole region with explosion.\n72.\tThe search for a just and durable peace in the Middle East must be made outside the deceptive framework of the Sinai Agreement and the ensuing commitments and undertakings given by its godfathers to supply Israel with the most destructive weapons How can our people believe that that agreement will bring peace closer, while part of it is designed to supply Israel with missiles which bring within range the capitals and towns of the Arab countries surrounding the center of aggression? How can we be convinced that this agreement is a step towards peace when Israel is receiving for it, through blackmail, billions of United States dollars?\n73.\tWhat sort of peace can such Agreement bring about, since it was concluded outside the framework of the United Nations? How can that agreement be a step towards peace when Israel is still occupying our national soil, and when there is a party that is enhancing its offensive forces in order to become the mightiest striking force in the region and thus carry out its expansionist and aggressive policy? How can we consider that agreement a step towards peace when it has paved the way for a United States presence in the area and when it has made the United States a main party to the conflict, with all the dangers implicit in such presence dangers that threaten the future of our people, who can clearly recall how the United States became involved in Viet Nam?\n74.\tWe are against that Agreement because it is against the will of our people. The agreement is an attempt to undermine the solidarity of our people, impair its unity and isolate it as a preliminary to doing away with all the gains achieved by the October war of liberation. We are against that agreement because it permits the aggressor to persist with its expansionist and aggressive policy and gives it security in Sinai, so that it may throw all its weight, and practice its terrorist acts, against the other Arab fronts. We are against that agreement because it ignores the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine to self-determination and the establishment of its national entity in its home-land. We are against that agreement because it was concluded outside the framework of the United Nations. We are against that agreement because it boosts Israel's arrogance and intransigence in not complying with the United Nations resolutions, and above all because it was concluded against the will of our Arab people.\n75.\tWe have recently been hearing talks about possible negotiations concerning the occupied Syrian territories. I declare from this rostrum that any talk on this subject within the framework of the step by- step policy is not founded on a practical and realistic basis. The reason is that the occupied Syrian territories are part of one cause, namely the cause of Palestine and the occupied Arab territories. We refuse to be dragged into the policy of dividing the cause. We want a just and durable peace. However, such a peace can be realized only within the framework of the following two principles: first, Israel's unconditional withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the June 1967 aggression; and secondly, Israel's undertaking to carry out the United Nations resolutions relevant to the Palestinian cause, notably General Assembly resolutions 3236 (XXIX) and 3237 (XXIX).\n76.\tAny talk of peace in any other sense is nothing but an attempt to delude world public opinion and deceive the international community. While on the subject of the Sinai agreement, I wish to recall the fate of the agreements on Indo-China, particularly the Paris agreements on Viet Nam. The peoples of the world cannot allow the aggressor\n regardless of the material force he owns to persist in imposing his will.\n77.\tPeace depends on the ardent desire of Member States to see that the resolutions they have adopted are fully implemented. It is their duty to lend us their support and backing, and thus enhance the prestige of the United Nations in the interest of such peace.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": " In speaking for the first time at this session, I should like first of all to express, on behalf of my delegation and in my own name, our sincere congratulations to Mr. Thorn on his unanimous election to the presidency of this session. We believe, and we are convinced, that under his wise guidance, thanks to his high qualities and his talents as an eminent diplomat and politician and the experience he has had, our deliberations will be guided objectively and will meet with success which will give concrete shape to the efforts undertaken by the Organization since its foundation in 1945, for the benefit of true peace and security and the well-being of all mankind.\n281.\tWe also pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, for the very dynamic and effective manner in which he conducted the work of the twenty- ninth session and the seventh special session. From this rostrum we extend to him our sincere wishes for personal well-being and future success.\n282.\tIn a similar way, and through him, we also convey our congratulations to all the other officers of the Assembly on their election. We trust that their joint efforts, together with ours, will contribute to the taking of fair decisions which will give this session a place in history in view of the very serious political, economic and social crises which are now assailing our world, each of which requires a just, decisive and relevant intervention by the international community.\n283.\tAlthough the efforts made by our Organization and the successes obtained by it over the past 30 years are doubtless many, it is true that the present situation in the world still continues to require more intensive action by the United Nations which is a body for peace. Indeed, in the area of decolonization and since its establishment the United Nations has made unflagging efforts which culminated in the accession to independence of the new States of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Today we celebrate the accession to independence of the new States of Mozambique, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, the Comoros and Papua New Guinea; we greet these heroic peoples, who have come to join the community of free, independent and sovereign States. My delegation harbors the hope that the international community will fulfill its duty to give them both the moral and the material support they require for the task of national reconstruction which entails even greater sacrifices.\n284.\tWe welcome the efforts made by these new States which, with courage and strength, have achieved the independence of which they had been deprived by the colonial and imperialist Powers throughout many centuries. Their accession to independence and the admission of Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe to the great family of the United Nations is one more reason and incentive to peoples who are struggling for their full emancipation. My delegation pays a tribute to the new Member States which have just won their place in this great family, making even more effective the universal character of our Organization. We are convinced that their participation in our work and their political maturity will serve as an encouragement which will strengthen the action which the United Nations is called upon to take. We welcome them and we express the hope that they will find here the warmth which they did not enjoy over the centuries.\n285.\tNone the less, despite all these achievements which tend to crystallize the purpose and objectives of the United Nations, there are still many obstacles to overcome in order to achieve decolonization effectively and fully. The dignity we attribute to the human race can never be effective until it is accompanied by full political and economic independence. On the other hand, independence in only one part of the earth and the fact that there are even today Territories living under the colonial and neo-colonial yoke are an affront to our expressed declarations of independence and universal human rights.\n286.\tWe regret to see in our day, when the concepts of independence, equality, sovereignty, dignity and democracy are universally accepted, the colonial Powers continue to maintain, under regimes of oppression, exploitation and sabotage, colonial Territories acquired more than four centuries ago for the sole purpose of maintaining their power of domination and exploitation.\n287.\tThis is the position in which the colonial Territories of Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Western Sahara, Djibouti, and others find themselves, situations which have never been ignored by the international community but which, nonetheless, the arrogance and obsessive despotism of the colonial administering Powers try to disguise, thus publicly defying the world community.\n288.\tIt is a pity that, when we are celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations, when we are congratulating each other on the successes obtained for the benefit of mankind, the situation in southern Africa remains unchanged.\n289.\tNamibia, an African Territory under the legal administration of the United Nations, which is the only authority recognized by the international community, continues to be occupied illegally and by force by the minority racist regime of South Africa, which arrogantly continues to flout each and every one of the many resolutions that have been adopted in this world body. \n290.\tThe situation in this African Territory is as clear as it is well known to all. We profoundly regret that countries of our Organization which have such high aspirations for freedom and such profound ideals of democracy, deny the most elementary rights to millions of human beings in order to protect their own selfish economic interests by respecting a small group of so-called South Africans which they hypo-critically condemn daily before the international Community. Despite that, the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea remains convinced that, by the unanimous stand of all the Members of our Organization, the Security Council will take on the role which it is called upon to play and will discharge its responsibilities by adopting against the racist South African regime appropriate measures already provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter, which we so highly value and respect because, among other things, it is the only legal document that should also prevail in the Namibian Territory in order to respond and to give satisfaction to the people of Namibia, to the SWAPO front, to the family of the United Nations, and to all those of us who are aware of the illegal presence of the so-called South African Government.\n291.\tAt the same time and equally important, the relations between the South African and Rhodesian racists are growing ever closer, thus complicating still further the problem of Zimbabwe. We are very sorry to note that the diabolical maneuvers of the minority racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia, with the complicity of a good number of countries that claim to be peace-loving and freedom-loving, are yielding results that are most unfavorable to a just and equitable solution of the Rhodesian problem. We appeal to the brave people of Zimbabwe and say to them that to abandon the principle of unity would be tantamount to abandoning the ideals of freedom, and consequently would perpetuate the racist policy of Ian Smith.\n292.\tWith the passing of the years, the increase in the number of resolutions of the General Assembly, and the earnest efforts both bilateral and multilateral carried out by each and every one of the freedom- loving and peace-loving countries have served only to entrench further the policy of apartheid of the racist South African regime to prevent by all means the exercise of power by the African majority in that part of the world, basing themselves on the irrational concept of a superiority of color, and with the support of a small number of countries that are fictitious prototypes of independence, freedom, peace, justice and democracy, which allows them not only consistently to defy world public opinion but also to fatten themselves on the blood of millions of human beings who are claiming what is rightfully theirs.\n293.\tDespite the attitude of certain colonial Powers regarding the problem prevailing in southern Africa, we continue to believe that the presence of the Vorster regime in Namibia, Rhodesia and South Africa is not only illegal but is all the more repugnant in the United Nations since the representatives of the various peoples are accredited in it. Consequently, we hope that the Security Council will re-examine the problem and will recommend forthwith the expulsion of South Africa from the United Nations in response to its Charter and taking account of the fact that South Africa's participation is an insult to our Organization.\n294.\tMy Government has never ceased to condemn and will go on condemning, the continued presence of colonialism in Africa and in other parts of the world for the purpose of giving an appropriate response to the deplorable situations which I mentioned before as was stated by the Head of State of Guinea, the great comrade Macfas Nguema Biyogo Negue Ndong, at the historical Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity held recently at Kampala:\n\\\"The great colonial Portuguese empire in Africa, which lasted more than four centuries, has fallen! and we are confident that the white minorities which have seized power in southern Africa and in Rhodesia will disappear from the international scene even though they may be protected by the major Western colonial Powers defending their selfish economic interests in that African region and forgetting the African interests which are paramount, We are automatically opposed to any dialog with the racist regime of southern Africa, ... and we recommend to the liberation movements of the African peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe the intensification of the armed struggle, since regrettably there is no other alternative to attain independence and to safeguard their interests in that region.\\\"\n295.\tWe are happy to see that concrete solutions aimed at the restoration of peace and security are now under way in the Middle East. The Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea continues to express its solidarity with the Arab countries involved in that conflict, and will not be fully satisfied until there is an immediate and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all Arab territories occupied since 1967, and until it can see the Palestinian people exercising its national rights under the direction of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Any negotiations which may take place on this matter should be based on the criteria to which we referred earlier.\n296.\tAlthough the present world is marked by detente, co-operation and understanding among nations conducive to favorable conditions for the solution of problems raised by the cold war and military confrontation, it is all too well known that international peace and security are being constantly threatened in various parts of the world. This is so because the process of detente is restricted and precarious since it does not extend to all geographical areas of the world, in such a way as to foster an effective democratization of relations among States and play a part in the solution of the major problems and in the hotbeds of tension, in order to achieve a lasting and stable peace that may lead to the well-being of the world community,\n297.\tIn contrast with the policy of non-alignment advocated by the countries of the third world and other countries which love peace and freedom, there still exists a division among peoples based on their ideological convictions. There are confrontations and struggles to achieve a hegemony of power and influence, a situation of tension which has become aggravated owing to the arms race carried out by the major Powers. My delegation hopes that the international community will make every effort to solve the problems deriving from the cold war, as has already been done by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. This will no doubt have a positive influence to easing those tensions.\nThe Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea understands international peace and security to\nmean not only the absence of hostilities among Potions, but also the full exercise by all peoples of their fundamental rights and freedoms. Thus, situations threatening international peace and security are those created by colonialist, imperialist and racist regimes, the\neconomic exploitation practiced by economic Powers over developing countries, the increasing Presence of military bases of the major Powers scattered all over the world, as well as the proliferation of nuclear weapons for war purposes and the constant Zeal shown by the Powers in perfecting their military technology.\n299.\tMy Government, which has no ambition to dominate nor is a producer or consumer of these nUclear devices and is out of sympathy with the idea of the installation of military bases, considers that the solution to this problem of disarmament is as simple as it appears complex, if, with goodwill, the major Powers concerned were only to co-ordinate their efforts and rationalize their policies in order to eliminate the causes which have given rise to this nuclear weapons race.\n300.\tWhat is worse the same situation of an arms race threatening international peace and security has far more harmful effects on truly effective international peace and security. We feel that a goodly portion of the funds intended for budgets covering the manufacture and testing of these nuclear devices could be put to better use if allocated for the development plans of developing countries thus reducing the serious difficulties which these countries face in their attempts to improve their economies. My delegation believes that an orderly and comprehensive development of the world community and a scrupulous respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the peoples of the whole world would constitute the best strategy to achieve lasting international peace and security.\n301.\tIn Cambodia, Viet Nam and Laos, once again in the course of history justice has prevailed over force. Scarcely a year ago the reality of today appeared to be incredible when, from this very rostrum, it was said that we were dealing with an item concerning \\\"a Government in exile which represented no one\\\". That Government was the Government of National Union of Cambodia, headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, to whose delegation we address our sincere congratulations for having recovered the place which was wrested from it by the colonialists, neo-colonial- ists and imperialists who were unable to do anything despite having so much material power.\n302- In that same area, neo-colonialist and imperialist forces experienced an unprecedented and complete failure. In Viet Nam, the criminal effects produced by a hail of deadly bombs which destroyed thousands Qf human beings and the country itself, weJ\\\"e not able to thwart the firm will and determination of the Vietnamese people in their pursuit of the ideals of freedom and independence. This victory should\nevery freedom-seeking people to the fact that it ^jjj never be defeated as long as it has the support 0f the popular masses. And along the same lines, these victories should serve as a lesson to everyone who believes in the use of force as a means of imposing his conditions to the detriment of the interests of the people.\n303.\tThis is why the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, as it has done previously, expresses its solidarity with the peoples of those countries, and it hopes to contribute, as far as its means will allow, to national reconstruction and the safeguarding of their national independence; and it also hopes that all peace- and freedom-loving countries will do the same.\n304.\tWith regard to the applications for admission submitted by the two Viet Nam, we believe that the cold war has gone out of fashion, and the fact that mistakes were made in the past in our Organization should command our attention so that we may do away with these mistakes by admitting the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam to our Organization. We hope that the Security Council will respond to the will of this Assembly by giving favorable consideration to the above-mentioned applications.\n305.\tThe United Nations is undergoing new experiences all the time. They happen so quickly that Members should give them their full attention. Those recent experiences take the form of the victories over colonialism, neo-colonialism and imperialism achieved by the people of Cambodia, Viet Nam and Laos following long and bloody battles. The artificial and imperialist division of Korea still continues without any solution. Will it be necessary to resort to armaments once again to obtain the reunification of Korea, after wiping out its people, who have already expressed their determination to unify?\n306.\tAs is well known, the problem of Korea consists in the peaceful and independent reunification of the country, which the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea not only unreservedly supports, but also advocates the total and immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces which occupy the southern part of the country under the flag of the United Nations, Those forces are not only interfering in the internal affairs of Korea, but are also making it more difficult to start the negotiations planned for that purpose. We are convinced that the General Assembly will take the proper decisions on the understanding that this peace agreement must be maintained, thus creating favorable conditions for the achievement of a peaceful and independent reunification.\n307.\tSimilarly, the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea expresses its solidarity with the people and the Government of Cyprus in their struggle to retain their independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We continue to believe, as in the past, that the immediate withdrawal of all foreign military forces, which hamper the restoration of peace in that part of the world and render difficult a dialog between the two countries, would contribute to a rapid settlement of the problem.\n308.\tThe United Nations is essentially a democratic organization and, as such, its effectiveness is contingent on the democratic will of its Members, for which reason all decisions taken in this forum should be applied by all of its Members. \n309.\tWe believe that the signatories of the Charter of the United Nations, in providing for the veto of the major Powers, did not do so for the purpose of making it as an instrument for bargaining, or for opposing democracy within the Organization, as it is being used today by the Western Powers. Hence, the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea condemns the deplorable triple veto in the Security Council by the United States, France and the United Kingdom on the South African question. This improper behavior by Members of the United Nations responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security, has considerably undermined the effectiveness of our Organization.\n310.\tSince the United Nations is a democratic Organization, as I have already pointed out, we believe, with reference to the specific case of the admission of a State which has been supported by more than 130 States that in view of the particular importance of the admission of new members, such admissions should not be the object of a veto on the part of any member of the Security Council. The capricious veto of this or that permanent member of the Security Council should not become an obstacle to the taking of important decisions such as the one we are dealing with now. In this respect, we believe that the Security Council has become a body in which the Western Powers impose with impunity the law of \\\"might makes right\\\", in their desire to maintain zones of hegemony and of influence in order to protect their selfish interests, thus endangering international peace and security.\n311.\tThe universality of the United Nations is a principle which should be paramount for our Organization, and we believe that the veto, or any other decision which opposes that principle and runs counter to the majority opinion of the General Assembly, also runs counter to the principles and purposes of the United Nations. A review of the Charter of this Organization is therefore imperative, since our Organization is not a mere instrument which has resulted from the will of one or two States, but rather it is the democratic outcome of the sovereign will of the 141 States which compose it. Yet, the obligations imposed upon us by the Charter have frequently been trampled upon by the Member States themselves, sheltered always by the veto in the Security Council, when it has come to taking possible reprisal measures. In that sense, an undisciplined Organization risks losing its effectiveness and the respect it should deserve.\n312.\tAn assessment of the situation and the evolution of the international economy clearly shows that the world is still governed by the formulas of an ancient economic system which is essentially discriminatory and whose structures reflect a society of past ages. This fact has led to the present economic crisis and logic demands that radical changes be made to adapt the system to the circumstances of today.\n313.\tAn economic system which does not take account of the sovereign rights of States freely to choose their political, economic and social system, and the principle of permanent sovereignty of States over their natural resources and other economic activities, including nationalization and the raising of prices of products in order to obtain an equitable and remunerative level, to ensure mutual and just benefits for all States, can only lead to strife and chaos in the field of international economic relations.\n314.\tEconomic imperialism practiced by economic Powers has the same adverse consequences as political imperialism. These two practices have led to most of the poverty of mankind today. The Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea therefore not only advocates the political independence of peoples, but also their economic independence. This is our conception of the full sovereignty of States. To give concrete shape to this policy of economic liberalization in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has brought down on us the attacks, insults and anti-government propaganda broadcast to the world by the press of the Western imperialist Powers. None the less, we are fully convinced that the objectives we pursue and which are also pursued by the United Nations can only be attained by granting political and economic independence to all peoples of the world.\n315.\tThis independence, according to the philosophy of revolutionary policy of my country, does not mean that countries cannot co-operate with each other and assist each other to their mutual benefit. The Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea firmly supports the struggle of the countries striving to achieve their economic independence. My delegation is convinced that the new international economic order, the world plan of action and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States already adopted by this Assembly, and their effective implementation by all States Members of this Organization, represent an essential factor for the normalization of world economic relations, since those instruments attempt to rationalize that economic policies of States in such a way as to arrive at a balance of power between developing and developed countries.\n316.\tMy delegation is also fully convinced that closer and more effective relations between the United Nations and national and regional economic organizations in the area of economic co-operation in all fields would greatly contribute to the harmonious economic development of those regions. On the other hand, developed countries have a duty to render all necessary assistance to the countries which are now being built up, instead of exploiting them and wanting to maintain economic and political supremacy over them. Close economic and technical co-operation between developed and developing countries would be a major contribution to a normalization of today's deteriorating economic relations.\n317.\tThe talk today is of an over-populated world and of the hunger which threatens the world population. We believe that, indeed, the world population is growing at a dizzy pace, whereas food production is diminishing because the interest of the developed countries in sincerely co-operating with the developing countries is nil. In fact, there would be no food problems if the developed countries, without undue conditions, transferred their agricultural, industrial and other technology, to the developing countries, whose potential for productivity is enormous. Consequently, the lack of food is governed by the absence of integral development by the world community.\n318.\tIn the Republic of Equatorial Guinea we have peace and order within the guidelines laid down by the leader of the Guinean revolution, President-for-Life, Marias Nguema Biyogo, to the revolutionary people of Equatorial Guinea through the Partido Unico Nacional de Trabajadores. The revolutionary urban and rural masses are devoting all their efforts and carrying out every possible activity to build the country and to improve the economy affected both by inflation  which is besetting the whole world and by the neo-colonialist maneuvers designed to boycott its economy.\n319.\tThe progress we have made is shown by the increase in the number of schools and hospitals, in urban development, and in the expansion and modernization of a system of communications throughout the country as well as modern harbor installations which facilitate export and import operations. These are obvious realities which the neo-colonialist Western press had tried to ignore.\n320.\tIt is a pleasure to take this opportunity to emphasize once again that we are, by political choice, opposed to colonialism and imperialism. We reiterate our firm support of the Non-Aligned Movement since our only doctrine consists of our respect for human beings and for their fundamental freedoms, the protection of our independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as the construction of our economic independence. The peaceful and revolutionary people of Equatorial Guinea is fully mobilized so as to achieve these goals.\n321.\tThe enemies of the Guinean revolution, together with the subversive Western press, have launched campaigns of insults to confuse international opinion by means of baseless claims that there are no consumer goods in Equatorial Guinea. Indeed, we think that the lack of some foreign manufactured products is quite normal since all countries of the world are both importers as well as exporters. Moreover, this lack of foreign manufactured goods in our country helps us to achieve the Program of self-sufficiency now being carried out under President-for-Life Macfas Nguema Biyogo, in the sense that we are reducing harmful and unnecessary imports created by the colonialists. In spite of this, the people of Equatorial Guinea down to the last corner of the national territory has supplies of consumer and other essential goods, thanks to the very strict control established by the Government when it discovered that foreign enterprises were attempting to boycott our economy by unnecessarily excessive imports without having enough capital to underwrite such operations or, much less, to promote exports. This is the truth which the Western press does not dare publish.\n322.\tThe People's Revolutionary Government of Equatorial Guinea and its President-for-Life have faced criticism in the colonialist, imperialist press. This does not frighten us, and we understand that this is quite a normal thing. After the colonialists and imperialists lost their political and economic interests in Equatorial Guinea, they had no other alternative but to resort to the imperialist press, thinking that, through it, they could put a stop to the revolutionary process already under way in Equatorial Guinea and that they could thus re-establish their colonial interests.\n323.\tIn their dark and desperate actions they have referred to situations as fictitious and purely imagined as the terror which is alleged to exist in Equatorial Guinea. These articles without entering into details  which are entirely lacking in truth, merely underline the imaginary character of the situations they write about. Human rights and fundamental freedoms are scrupulously respected and guaranteed in Equatorial Guinea, but we do not believe that to ensure the security of our State and to defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity shows a lack of respect for human rights.\n324.\tThe Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, in respecting the sacred principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, cannot serve as a spring-board nor can it yield to subversion. As has been stated in other international forums anyone who wishes to see what is going on and wishes to experience the revolution in Guinea will find the doors open in Equatorial Guinea.\n325.\tBefore concluding I should like to extend our sincere congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his untiring efforts at the head of our Organization in the areas of decolonization, the maintenance of peace and security in different parts of the world, economic and social development, and finally of the countless problems which he faces. All we can do is to wish him the greatest success in the very difficult mission which the world community has entrusted to him.\n326.\tTo conclude, I should like to reiterate our fervent wish that the thirtieth session of the General Assembly may arrive at very fruitful conclusions for the well-being of all mankind."

        "file_text": "2.\t  I come here to this high rostrum as a head of Slate to speak on behalf of a nation which, serenely and surely, is traveling the path of history. I do so in order to bring the concerns of the Government and people of Bolivia about some of the most pressing problems that mankind faces in a world as yet beset by crises, conflict, fear and poverty.\n3.\tI should like to begin by most cordially greeting the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn, who is so ably presiding over the thirtieth regular session of the General Assembly. 1 should also like to greet the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who, brilliant statesman that he is, presided over two sessions.\n4 f should also like to greet the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose tireless work is all the more admirable and useful for purposes of this Organization, because he is imbued with deep humanism and with a serenity with which he has tackled the gravest difficulties. Mr. Waldheim has made a positive contribution to the United Nations. Soon after taking office he proposed that the question of international terrorism in its broadest context should be considered. It is regrettable that this urgent item has not as yet been taken up.\n5 I should also like to join in the welcome extended to the new States of Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe and Cape Verde. The peaceful political transition of these three States is a clear example of the maturity of their peoples, as well as of the sincere decision of the administering Power to decolonize. 1 am certain that the presence of these newest States will strengthen our Organization and will provide a new and powerful impetus to the peoples of Africa.\n6.\tI should like to welcome Papua New Guinea, whose independence has already been achieved. 1 should also like to greet in advance Suriname, soon to be independent, a Caribbean territory which is therefore an integral part of Latin America.\n7.\tOne of the crucial subjects of our time is peace among men. Without international peace and security, it is an illusion to dream of the total development of mankind, of the full satisfaction of its material and spiritual needs, of mankind meeting its common destiny in a more just economic order.\n8.\tIt is ever more essential to stop the arms race, to reduce arms traffic and sales abroad, to channel nuclear energy for the benefit of the peace and well- being of men rather than to use them for their total destruction. No international co-operation can attain positive results if we do not ensure an era of permanent and constructive peace.\n9.\tIn this context, the Bolivian position is clear. We do not believe in the absolute victory of weapons. We are aware of the power that some nations wield in that area. We know that the nuclear bombs that are being manufactured would alone be enough in the 1980s to destroy life on our planet. Despite this paradoxical advance, we are certain that mankind will stand to gain little or nothing if it is not capable of avoiding the dangers that threaten it now. As developing countries see it, the essential question is how to avoid self-destruction, how to prevent the supreme holocaust, how to protect the service of collective well-being, the marvelous creations of man's genius.\n10.\tTo forestall those risks, firearms are not enough, A new spirit is required taking account of man in relation to his eternal destiny and his selfless nature.\n11.\tEvery year more than $3,000 million is being squandered on military expenditure. It would be wonderful if mankind used those resources to combat ignorance, disease and hunger!\n12.\tThe food and energy crisis, world inflation, social conflicts, terrorism, pollution, ecological imbalance, the manufacture, traffic and use of drugs, the gap that separates poor peoples from wealthy nations, are, among other things, the most pressing problems faced by contemporary society.\n13.\tIt is incumbent upon the United Nations to ensure world coexistence, to find practical ways and means to harmonize relations between exporters of industrialized goods and producers of raw materials.\nthat is, of historically specific entities, and consequently of its obligation to urge the wealthy countries to accord just treatment to the less advanced ones.\n15.\tDuring the colonial period Bolivia, which was then called Alto Peru, produced so much gold and silver, according to the chroniclers of the time, that a bridge could be built from the fabulous Potosi to the Iberian Peninsula.\n16.\tLeaving fantasy aside, it is true that for a long time Alto Peru maintained the splendor of the old world.\n17.\tDespite sacrifices of many centuries and the enormous drain on natural resources, the compensation to which it was legitimately entitled was never forthcoming.\n18.\tSince 1825, the date when we began our independent life, Bolivia has generated, on an annual average at present prices, -wealth amounting to $300 million; it created wealth of more than $40,000 million. However, its total investments hardly reached $1,000 million. We are therefore far from having the resources that the country requires to tackle the first stages of its development.\n19.\tTherefore, with respect to this revealing picture, we may well ask: Where is this wealth and to whom did it go? Which foreign economies did it benefit? Why did it have to impoverish some and enrich others?\n20.\tWe legitimately believe that we must be compensated for the injustices and exorbitant demands of which we were the victims in the past.\n21.\tIt is time to imbue international relations with a new character, to replace dependence by interdependence, paternalism by solidarity, assistance by mutual co-operation.\n22.\tIn the area of co-operation for development, cause and effect require careful study. So far, despite the fact that we are at an advanced stage of the Second United Nations Development Decade, we are still involved in uncertainty and skepticism, All this is generated by an acute crisis of confidence in the machinery underlying the system of international economic relations.\n23.\tBolivia would like to place on record its support for the efforts of the United Nations to solve the painful problems that limit the development of the economically less advanced countries.\n24.\tWe support unreservedly the principles, purposes and resolutions that were adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly held in April 1974 as well as at the seventh special session, whose deliberations were concluded recently.\n25.\tThe Government and people of Bolivia are identified with the purpose of establishing a new international economic order. In this context, they hope that the Declaration and the program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VJ)] which enshrine this important goal will be implemented, together with the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)].\n26.\tIn celebrating the J50th anniversary of the founding of Bolivia, from the House of Freedom in Sucre, the city which transmitted the ideas of emancipation to America, I addressed a message in which 1 expressed the position of my country concerning many of the problems that are of interest today to the international community.\n27.\tIt must be noted that this is not the time for regrets, but the time for action. It is no longer the time for rhetoric. We must create, construct and organize a new and more just world, as everybody demands.\n28.\tMankind has a common destiny. It cannot be conceived as fragmented, divided by differences, hatred or the irritating inequalities that separate peoples. We are duty-bound to work in unity, in cooperation, in solidarity and to establish a dialog among ourselves. Otherwise our civilization may plunge into the holocaust of war or jeopardize indefinitely the benefits of peace, freedom, progress and justice.\n29.\tWe cannot allow, without concern, wealth to be increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few. Neither nations nor men have the right to accumulate a disproportionate amount of wealth. A situation in which some flaunt offensive opulence while others suffer painful poverty is not acceptable.\n30.\tIn order to eliminate this international economic and social anachronism we must find a solution to the problem. We must pass from words to deeds. The equality of the peoples must be attained, in global terms, in the social, economic, cultural and political fields.\n31.\tIt is difficult to destroy the barriers of underdevelopment and dependence without using the resources of science and technology. 1 repeat my proposal that we must take action to convert these resources into a common heritage of mankind. The idea has been launched; it is no longer a Bolivian idea. The important thing is to begin, and to create the instruments to implement, sooner or later, this transcendental objective.\n32.\tThere is another burning problem which mankind faces today, namely, the presence in many countries of a few transnational enterprises whose methods are neither scrupulous nor honest. They interfere in internal affairs. They make a mockery of sovereignty. They use bribes and slander, they promote corruption and they exploit to the utmost our non-renewable natural resources, In their search for profits they act against the interests of the people and contribute irresponsibly to the deterioration of international relations.\n33.\tIt is imperative to fix standards to regulate the activities of transnational enterprises and monopolies, and to establish the sanctions befitting their deceitful practices.\n34.\tStates which engage in economic aggression deserve similar condemnation. Bolivia, as a producer country of tin, is a periodic victim of that treacherous activity.\n35.\tIt is difficult in this forum to pass over the question of raw materials. The countries which are producers of raw materials will have to act in their own defence by forming an unshakable common front. It is only in this way that we shall be able to form a common front against the manipulation of prices: unstable and low for raw materials and excessively high for manufactured products.\n36.\tWe recognize that the United Nations, through the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [IJNCTAD], attempts to enact a policy of the stabilization of equitable and just prices. Regrettably, resolutions take too much time and the developing countries are tired of waiting. If efforts are not co-ordinated and if definite progress is not made among the producer and consumer countries there will be no other course for the former than to organize, without delay, prompted by the absolute necessity of attaining positive results.\n37.\tA general policy for raw materials could take specific form in the following way: first, an association of producer countries; secondly, stepped-up industrialization; and thirdly, creation of funds to regulate reserves.\n38.\t1 should now like to speak about my country, which has been described as varied, wonderful and fertile. On its land everything can be produced, so fertile is the soil, so diverse the climate throughout this very large country. With regard to the wealth in its subsoil, nature has been very generous to my country. Although we have been given much, we hope for much more as a result of capital and work, in order to channel this abundance into the well-being and progress of our people.\n39.\tBolivia has enacted modern legislation providing for guarantees and incentives, legislation which in a rational way reconciles the interests of foreign investors with the objectives and priorities of our nation.\n40.\tMy country is a land of links and contacts. It is at the crossroads of two great oceans; the Atlantic and the Pacific. It is a part of two river basins: the Amazon and the Plate. It has adhered to all the regional mechanisms for integration. It is a member of the sub-regional Andean Pact, the Latin American Free Trade Association, URUPABOL, and the Treaty concerning the Plate River basin.\n41.\tThis firm and unconditional attitude taken by Bolivia is an embodiment of the purest ideals of the liberators. For the Government and people of Bolivia the concept of integration does not mean merely establishing a policy of no tariff barriers, of economic co-operation and increase of trade. The enterprise should be more ambitious: seek to establish the political, economic and cultural machinery that will create the great American homeland of which Bolivar dreamed.\n42.\tUntil recently my country lived under the unjust system of a dual society: on the one hand, the exploited and illiterate majority, totally alienated from civilization and the most elementary benefits of progress; on the other, a feudal oligarchy, which had all the privileges, wielded political and economic power and was insensitive to the suffering and poverty of the people.\n43.\tThe Bolivian revolution was directed against that system of oppression and injustice. We have instituted agrarian reform, the tin mines have been nationalized, we have decreed that we shall have sovereignty over our natural strategic resources, and the rural worker has been enabled to participate in the political life of the country.\n44.\tHowever, some of these achievements for example, agrarian reform were for a long time stratified in the mere distribution of titles to land. Now the Government of the Armed Forces is establishing, within the process of the continuity of the Bolivian revolution, the modern bases for farming and animal husbandry and the agricultural industry.\n45.\tTo that must be added our policy of establishing agricultural co-operatives and engaging in rural education, an endeavor without precedent in the life of the Republic.\n46.\tThus, structural changes of major importance are taking place in Bolivia. The Bolivian revolution continues as a vanguard in Latin America of the processes of liberation.\n47.\tI represent a Government whose legitimacy is demonstrated through the militant support of the majority of the national community. That support, which is reflected in political stability, in social peace, in internal order, in constructive work, makes it possible for the people freely to express themselves and to demonstrate their best talents and aptitudes.\n48.\tBolivia, as we have already said on various occasions, guarantees that everyone can express himself fully and in any way he desires. With the strength it has gathered from the past and the energy it has at present, its desire is to ensure that every Bolivian can work, produce, study and fulfill his material and spiritual aspirations.\n49.\tThe Government of Bolivia is the political expression of broad national agreement. It enjoys the active participation of all elements of society, and mainly of the professionals and the rural and other workers. The armed forces of our nation are the pivot of the system, of the new model, through its historical training in uniting and mobilizing the entire population for the good of the country and for the benefit of development.\n50.\tIn various countries of America and the rest of the world where the expression of national sentiment is a slow, laborious process, it seems that the optimum conditions for the practice of an ideal democracy have not been achieved. My country too has been suffering from this institutional crisis, largely because of the eruption of new factors such as our burning need for housing, education, good health conditions and work.\n51.\tIn Bolivia the armed forces, representing the most faithful expression of our nationhood, have assumed political responsibility, aware that their function cannot be limited to military activity and faced \u25a0with the lack of structures capable of overcoming the deep crisis of transition in the world and especially on the American continent.\n52.\tIn view of the burning need to reassess our social objectives, we are revamping our constitutional life. This is, as it were, a parenthesis, in the course of which we intend to strengthen our institutions and make them more rational. Our position exceeds the bounds of the traditional framework. It is a question of doing away with anachronisms and adapting the new system of national aspiration to the real fulfillment of the expectations of the majority. The development of this process will lead us on the path of pluralistic and effective democracy, the path we have chosen.\n53.\tWe have acted in full awareness of the difficulties and dangers that the armed forces must face in undertaking these great social changes. The task of giving the dispossessed their rights again, without falling into demagogy, abuse or despotism, is an open challenge to powerful interests. It arouses the impatience of certain elements with those who want to overcome chronic poverty,\n54.\tIn a country like Bolivia, with deep structural imbalances and insufficient institutional cohesion  a situation similar in many ways to that existing in the newly established States it is not easy to channel in a rational and peaceful way all the forces of compulsion that are typical of peoples acutely desiring liberation. To correct these imbalances and direct the peoples towards these pre-established objectives of effective democracy, we must inevitably adopt new standards of conduct and there must be a firm political will.\n55.\tAny step towards change and accelerated development almost always has its price. The important thing is to be aware of its real value and to make the means to attain those changes as perfect as possible so that the benefits do not represent too onerous a burden on the weakest layers of the population, precisely those whom we are trying to help.\n56.\tThe burning problem of our time is the deep imbalances dividing contemporary society, a problem that is affecting an ever greater number of people in the world. The universalism that we seek is designed precisely to find a solution to that situation.\n57.\tIn the face of the set and inevitable attitudes of the great centers of economic power, developing countries are in duty bound to establish their own action fronts to interact jointly, as far as possible in a spirit of conciliation and co-operation, with those centers of power. What we must do is achieve that new order in which the situations created in a divided and stratified world whose consequences we still feel will not be repeated.\n58.\tIdeologically, our nationalism is revolutionary, humanistic and Christian. We have established a pluralistic democracy which allows free expression of ideas, initiatives and attitudes, within the framework of the general debates of the nation. Until very recently, democracy in its accepted sense was a myth which perpetuated the power of the dominating minorities.\n59.\tThis is no longer the case in the Bolivian revolution. In order that the people may become an active factor in development, history requires the broadest popular participation and a rapid increase in and a better distribution of wealth. Only thus can not only well-being and equality of opportunity but also the means to develop fully be ensured.\n60.\tInternationally, my Government is in favor of maintaining diplomatic relations with all countries in the world subject to one condition only, namely, that these countries respect our sovereignty and our culture.\n61.\tThe Bolivian revolution is defined as an authentically nationalistic movement against imperialism, racial discrimination, colonialism and neo-colonialism in all their forms and manifestations.\n62.\tWith the support of all Bolivians, the armed forces of my country have assumed a heavy responsibility before history. This has doubtless been their most important decision but one worthy of their sacrifice, their ability, their abnegation and patriotism. In view of the civic maturity and the social awareness of their members, they are competent to be the protagonists in the present stage of structural transformations.\n63.\tThere is unity and identification around my Government, especially with regard to the great national objectives which are, among others, security, development and renewed access to the sea.\n64.\tThe unity which tacitly has been consolidated around the armed forces increases, as never before, the capacity of my people to carry out its fundamental tasks. In the recent past, because of the limited political sphere or due to the confusion created by past conditions, such tasks were not carried out in good time.\n65.\tConvinced of the magnitude of the challenge, our revolution has taken the most direct and expeditious way to narrow the gap between the Bolivian reality and the highest levels attained by the most developed societies.\n66.\tIn the five-year plan that we have drawn up, it is contemplated that Bolivia will double its wealth. Concurrently with the economic growth that broadens social well-being and the cultural level of the people, we are processing raw materials; we are speeding up literacy programs; we are integrating the population in conditions of respect and conciliation among the various traditional cultures.\n67.\tOur goal is to integrate the nation spiritually, physically and demographically. By encouraging the traditional communities of a secular organization, we want the peasant to develop his initiative within his own sphere. By his support, channeled through the civic action programs of the armed forces, we shall urbanize the rural areas. We are implementing a vast plan of road communication. Our extensive water resources will provide a source of energy for a vast rural electrification plan which will transform agriculture and raise the standard of living of the peasants.\n68.\tI believe that the best resource of a people is its human capital; therefore, we have begun a difficult and long campaign to eradicate the manufacture, traffic and use of drugs. In this task, we require the co-operation of all nations and institutions to combat the traffic of drugs because the criminal extension of this traffic affects all countries in the world.\n69.\tBolivia will spare no effort to attain this goal. From this high rostrum, as the President of my country, I fervently appeal for international co-operation to protect the moral and physical health of youth all over the world.\n70.\tOn this occasion I should like to refer to Bolivia's support of the solution of international disputes by peaceful means.\n71.\tConsistent with this principle, the Inter-American Conference of Foreign Ministers, held at Rio de Janeiro in 1965, sponsored a resolution which applauded the decision of the United States of America to review \nthe treaty which Panama signed with regard to the Canal Zone.\n72.\tFaithful to this principle, we consider it a duty of American solidarity to declare that we fervently hope that, in keeping with the mutual interests of both countries the Canal Zone problem will soon be settled satisfactorily in favor of the rights and sovereignty of the brother Panamanian people.\n73.\tI have ventured to outline some of the broad policies of the nationalist Government which I represent.\n74.\tOn the basis of these objectives and the realization of these great ideals, I have entered into an irrevocable commitment with my people: to return to Bolivia its sea, the sea it had when it started life as an independent, free and sovereign State.\n75.\tPowerful reasons prompt us to seek this goal. The integration advocated today, an integration without access to the sea, is for Bolivia a process of dependency which hampers, delays and stifles its full development.\n76.\tThis very situation is recognized as a phenomenon affecting all nations and, in our case, landlocked as we are by force of circumstance, is one of exploitation and subjection.\n77.\tOur sovereignty, as indeed the sovereignty of all land-locked countries, is hampered in its free exercise by having to pay levies for conditional transit which is tantamount to subjection, however free that subjection may seem.\n78.\tIt is well known that my country suspended its diplomatic relations with Chile for over 12 years. This was due to the fact that Chile made unilateral use of the international waters of the Lauca River. Both countries reached an impasse, a vicious circle which prevented them from coming to a healthy understanding which would have served the higher interests of both countries.\n79.\tBolivia maintained that it would not resume its relations with the Government of Santiago if it did not obtain, together with compensation for the diversion of the Lauca river, a means of access to the Pacific coast. Chile, in turn, stated that it would resume its relations with Bolivia only without preconditions, the sole basis which would permit the opening of a dialog for discussion of the Bolivian proposals.\n80.\tI understood that such a state of affairs could not continue and that the time had come for Bolivia once more to prove its readiness for a dialog to reach a common understanding. Thus after my talks at Charana with the President of Chile, on my initiative, we decided to resume our relations with the express purpose of studying at government level the need for us to have our maritime legacy restored to us. I must definitely state that I found brotherly understanding on the part of Mr. Augusto Pinochet, and a firm determination to deal resolutely with this great and historic question.\n81.\tThanks to the exchange of ambassadors, which has enabled us to open an active fruitful dialog, it has been possible for my Government to make a formal proposal to the Government of Chile, in which the Bolivian people places its dearest hopes.\n82.\tIt could not be otherwise. I am certain that the Chilean President will respond positively to my sincere and constructive concern as my country's President.\n83.\tThis world assembly has heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile state:\n\\\"The exchange of ambassadors has made possible the establishment of a direct and active dialog for the purpose of analyzing the wishes of each country, including Bolivia's wish to obtain a sovereign outlet to the sea supplementing the free transit facilities it currently enjoys.\\\" [2376th meeting, para. 263.]\n84.\tWhile quoting the views in echoing the ideas voiced by the Government of Chile through its Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Patricio Carvajal, 1 must also recall the resolution adopted by the Organization of American States at its fourth regular session, held in April 1975 at Atlanta, Georgia, assuring my country of the desire to amend the situation.\n85.\tThe peoples of Latin America subsequently endorsed this desire in the historic Declaration of Ayacucho, signed at Lima on 9 December 1974 [see Al10044, annex], in which it was openly and objectively recognized that one of the problems affecting America, Bolivia's lack of access to the sea, deserved the closest general consideration.\n86.\tI should like to state, in the spirit of the Americas that governs the fair play of our negotiation with Chile, that I fully share Foreign Minister Carvajal's confidence that \\\"... the good will prevailing within the Governments of Chile and Bolivia will enable us to achieve realistic and final agreements\\\" [2376th meeting, para. 264],\n87.\tThose agreements, anxiously awaited by the Bolivian people and, I venture to hope, by all the peoples of our wonderful Latin American world  will have to be crystallized very soon, however lengthy the investigations needed, and however many meetings are required.\n88.\tThe solution of great problems which affect the harmony and the peace of America cannot be postponed indefinitely. We must state frankly that there can be no playing with human hopes, with the hopes of an entire people.\n89.\tFrom this rostrum, in this universal forum, I want to state before the world that Bolivia is awaiting Chile's response to its proposals. Let us repeat emphatically: that those proposals have nothing to do with the right of transit deriving from our land-locked position, but are directed to a basic solution, final and comprehensive, that will give us our own free and sovereign access to the sea, naturally and geographically contiguous with our territory.\n90.\tMoreover, statesmen and other distinguished Latin Americans, and inter-American legal and cultural organizations have, in a praiseworthy manner, fully agreed with Bolivia's right to access to the sea. For all those manifestations of support essentially spontaneous, since my Government has not attempted to convert others to its convictions I must express deep gratitude on behalf of my people, since it is rare in our world to find such outstanding champions of justice.\n91.\tOnly thus will permanent justice and peace in America be attained; only thus shall we be able to dispel the concerns of all those sister countries, which, as I said earlier, have assumed the cause of restoring Bolivia's access to the sea as though it were one of their own fundamental problems.\n92.\tFrom this high rostrum of human solidarity, in this hour of great change when justice must prevail, I bear witness before the world of the noble, democratic and peaceful efforts Bolivia is making to regain, after almost a century, the access to the sea which is rightfully ours, and that we so sorely need to communicate and trade with the rest of mankind.\n\n"

        "file_text": "104.\t Mr. President, on behalf of the delegation of the Soviet Union I should like to congratulate you on the occasion of your election to the high position of President of the General Assembly for its thirtieth session and I wish you full success in the discharge of this most important function.\n105.\tFor three decades now, regular sessions of the General Assembly have been held towards the end of each year. And each session becomes a significant event in international life. Indeed, the United Nations activities are focused on the most important and acute problems.\n106.\tIf we try to visualize with our mind's eye the work of our Organization over all these years, we shall see a vivid picture of the concerns and anxieties, aspirations and hopes of mankind, permeated by a desire, common to all peoples, for peace and for material, social and spiritual progress.\n107.\tWhether or not international developments are in line with that desire, this should be, above all, the starting-point in analyzing the state of affairs in the world. It is from this angle that the Soviet Union views the situation in which representatives of States have gathered for the thirtieth session of the General Assembly.\n108.\tThe main feature of the situation is that the process of relaxation of international tensions is gaining in scope, and detente itself is increasingly gaining substance. This finds its expression, in particular, in the conclusion of a whole number of agreements between States, including the well-known Soviet- American agreements, which are ot great importance for the cause of peace and international security.\n109.\tAnd though the process of improving the political climate is still being influenced by various, sometimes conflicting, factors, it can be definitely stated that in the past year a new significant step has been taken along the path leading, towards a more durable peace.\n110.\tThe peaceful foreign policy of the USSR, a policy of socialism, is aimed at those objectives, at the strengthening of international security. Those objectives were set forth by the great Lenin himself, back in the early years of the existence of the Soviet State, and our country has been invariably guided by them throughout its historical march.\n111.\tFollowing this course, a course embodied in the Peace Program adopted by the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the USSR is an active participant in, and in many instances a sponsor of, efforts radically to improve the international situation.\n112.\tIn present-day conditions, we believe it feasible, though not at all easy, to carry out a restructuring of relations among States such as would leave no room for wars between them and would secure respect for the rights of all peoples, large or small, to free and independent development.\n113.\tThe principled foreign policy line of the USSR will, no doubt, be reaffirmed and expanded in the decisions of the forthcoming Twenty-Fifth Congress of the Party of Soviet communists early next year. All those who fight for the peace, national independence and social progress of peoples can continue to count on our solidarity and active support.\n114.\tIn pursuing its policy of peace, the Soviet Union acts in the world arena in close unity with the fraternal socialist countries. And we are proud that the peaceful policies of the socialist countries are in keeping with ti.s aspirations of all peoples.\n115.\tThis yea.' will remain in the memory of the peoples as the year of the conclusion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Final Act of the Conference, to which the signatures of top leaders of 33 European countries, the United States of America and Canada were affixed in Helsinki, in one of the most outstanding documents of our times.\n116.\tThe peoples of Europe to a very large extent pinned on the Conference the hope that the European continent would be able, at last, to break out of the vicious circle of its history where every post-war period turned into a pre-war period, to be followed by a war unleashed by aggressors. The peoples of Europe expected that the Conference would work out and adopt important decisions in the interests of ensuring their security and agree on the main directions for equal and versatile co-operation. Everywhere in Europe people wished the Conference to succeed.\n117.\tThe participants in the Conference succeeded through intense collective efforts in achieving important results, which have been clearly recorded in the Final Act.\n118.\tThis concerns, above all, the political sphere \u2014the working out of principles governing relations among the participating States. Provided they are strictly observed by all States, the threat of war will be excluded from the life of the peoples of Europe and an atmosphere of trust in the peaceful development of each country will come into being on the continent.\n119.\tThis is also true and applicable with regard to the stability and confidence measures agreed on at the Conference, which are designed to promote a reduction of the risk of armed conflicts in Europe.\n120.\tA positive role is to be played by the understandings reached at the Conference on co-operation in the fields of trade, large-scale industrial projects, science and technology, and the protection of the environment.\n121.\tA substantial contribution to the development of co-operation between the States participating in the Conference are the understandings reached on questions of co-operation in the fields of culture, information, contacts and education, and their significance will be ever increasingly felt as detente deepens and develops.\n122.\tIt is not without a sense of satisfaction that I note that the success of the Conference was largely facilitated by the efforts of the socialist countries, which invariably seek to switch international relations on to the track of peaceful coexistence. This success became possible also because in Western countries the well-founded conviction is gaining strength that it is necessary to adopt a constructive approach to the solution of problems that arise in Europe instead of aggravating and inflaming the situation, which in the past often reached dangerous levels.\n123.\tThe understandings reached as a result of the Conference are based on the recognition by all its participants of the absolute truth that respect for the sovereign equality of States, the non-use of force, the inviolability of frontiers, territorial integrity, nonintervention from outside in the internal affairs of States as well as other basic principles are laws which no one may transgress.\n124.\tWhat are the implications of the result of this joint work of 35 States for the peoples of Europe and indeed of the entire world?\n125.\tThe answer is provided by the experience of the past, when a desire to seize others' territories and brute force raised to the level of State policy acquired the character of criminal claims to world domination and developed into the brown plague of fascism, racism, direct aggression and the tragedy of world wars. Now 35 States which took part in the Conference have assumed, jointly and before the whole world, the obligation to build their relations on the principles of peace, and peace alone, and of deeper co-operation.\n126.\tThe results of the Conference constitute a carefully weighed balance of the interests of all its participants, and they reflect generally acceptable understandings and well-founded compromises. We have every reason to state that the experience of the Conference should be used most extensively for the settlement in general of the pressing problems of today.\n127.\tIn short, as was stressed by L. I. Brezhnev in his speech at Helsinki:\n\\\"The results of the prolonged negotiations are such that there are neither victors nor vanquished, neither winners nor losers. This is a victory for reason. Everyone has won the countries of the East and of the West , the peoples of socialist and capitalist States, parties to alliances and neutrals, large and small. This is a gain for all people who hold dear the cause of peace and security on our planet.\n128.\tAssessing highly the results of the Conference, the Soviet Union believes that the main task now is to translate the understandings reached into deeds, and to advance towards new milestones in the struggle for a lasting peace. This is the course the Soviet Union follows and will continue to follow, and this is what we also expect others to do.\n129.\tWho would contest that the year 1975 will go down in history as the year of the triumph of the just cause of the peoples of Indo-China? Triumph crowned their liberation struggle that had been carried on for almost 30 years against colonialists and aggression.\n130.\tThose people sustained tremendous losses, but their will for freedom was never broken. The victory won by the peoples of Indo-China is above all the result of their own efforts. At the same time, it is also a major and common success of all the peace-loving and progressive: forces which invariably demonstrated their solidarity with the struggle of the patriots of Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia, and provided them with moral and material support.\n131.\tThe Soviet Union as the whole world knows has fulfilled its internationalist duty to the Vietnamese people. It has sought persistently the elimination in\nIndo-China of one of the most dangerous hot-beds of war which troubled international relations.\n132.\tUnderstandably, the removal of that hot-bed was welcomed everywhere with a sense of relief. Now that freedom and peace have dawned over the whole of Indo-China, favorable prospects are opening up for its peoples to begin healing the wounds of war and building a new life, which they are doing with the dedication and heroism so characteristic of them.\n133.\tHaving defended their sovereignty and independence in the long struggle, the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam now express their willingness to participate within the framework of this world Organization also in efforts to develop international co-operation. We are convinced that the admission to the United Nations of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam would be fully in keeping with the lofty purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter; and the Soviet Union supports the request of their Governments to that effect. No one who stands for peace should fear such a decision of the United Nations.\n134.\tThe lessons of Indo-China are simple and obvious. The struggle of peoples for freedom, national independence and social progress is invincible. It cannot be destroyed by bullets or fire. The outcome of many years of conflict in Indo-China is a convincing case in point. It is also clear that any attempt to dictate or to impose one's will on other peoples by force of arms is untenable and in the final account doomed to failure.\n135.\tThis is a good lesson, in the sense that the policy of acting from \\\"positions of strength\\\", which has now been rejected also at the conference table in Helsinki, should be relegated to the archives of history, never to be revived.\n136.\tThe radical change in the state of affairs in Indo-China creates more favorable prerequisites for establishing peaceful co-operation in Asia as a whole. Practical steps in this direction would serve the interests of the settlement of urgent problems and the strengthening of security throughout the continent of Asia which of course requires, as in Europe, collective efforts by all States concerned, both large and small. And it is through such efforts, and subject to strict compliance with the principles of equality and non- use of force in any guise in resolving disputes between States, that a most effective solution of the problem of Asian security can be found. Let no one think that the Soviet Union would benefit from such a turn of events in Asia to a greater extent than some other States. Not at all; objectively all countries of Asia are equally interested in this.\n137.\tThe entire course of world events in recent times confirms the conclusion reached a long time ago by all those who stand on the ground of reality, that only the policy of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems can have a future and is in keeping with the interests of the peoples.\n138.\tOur country, the Soviet Union, which is faithful to the legacy of Lenin, carries on a tireless struggle for the further establishment of these principles as a generally recognized rule of international relations. In our relationships with countries of different social systems 'here are a good many positive elements which serve both our interests and those of our partners in corresponding agreements and understandings. This finds its expression in particular in the development of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America in recent years, primarily as a result of Soviet-American summit meetings, which favorably influences the situation in the world as a whole.\n139.\tA joint search for solutions of urgent problems, including their consideration at the very highest level, the development of political contacts, the expansion of economic, scientific, technological and cultural exchanges have already yielded tangible results which have a positive impact on the general state of international relations and strengthen the spirit of trust in them, without which relations among States cannot be built on a solid basis.\n140.\tThe Soviet Union continues to consolidate friendly relations with developing countries with which we are united by a common desire for peace and progress. We have invariably rendered and will continue to render support to the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America and to the movement of non- aligned States in their struggle to consolidate their national sovereignty and economic independence, to overcome the grim legacy of the colonial past, and against intrigues aimed at undermining their independence and infringing upon their legitimate rights.\n141.\tStep by step the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America are freeing themselves of the consequences of the \\\"cold war\\\" and its distortions in politics. In this respect the decision by Latin American States to put an end to the policy of boycotting socialist Cuba, a policy imposed upon them, was an important event.\n142.\tIt is quite natural that it should be precisely in the present-day situation that the last pillars of colonialism, built up over centuries, are falling down. Quite recently, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, the Comoros and Papua New Guinea have joined the ranks of independent States. Our country welcomes the victory of the just cause of their peoples.\n143.\tWe congratulate the representatives present in this Hall of the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, and the People's Republic of Mozambique, which have become full-fledged Members of our Organization.\n144.\tOf course, the completion of the process of decolonization is not proceeding without difficulties. The events in Angola, for example, testify to this. The forces hostile to the liberation struggle of peoples do not surrender their positions without fighting. They sometimes find accomplices also among those who like to pose as zealous champions of the good of oppressed peoples while in practice they are in collusion with the oppressors.\n145.\tBut in spite of all difficulties, the struggle for the elimination of the vestiges of colonialism, for the uprooting of racism, is now closer to final victory than ever before.\n146.\tThe States of Asia, Africa and Latin America constitute a great and active force in world politics, and this imposes on them a grave responsibility for the state of affairs in the world. We view with understanding the fact that these countries, still suffering from the consequences of exploitation, discrimination and economic coercion, are today participating in the work of putting forward and elaborating proposals to establish such international economic relations as would be based on equality and justice.\n147.\tThe solution of those questions, too, is inseparably connected with the further relaxation of political tensions in the world. The Soviet Union is fully aware of the legitimate interests and demands of the developing countries, and it based itself precisely upon such positions in the course of the recently concluded seventh special session of the General Assembly, the results of which we assess positively, although it is quite clear to everyone that much has still to be done before the relevant problems are actually solved.\n148.\tThus, the past was marked by significant inter-national events of a positive nature. It is not for us, the socialist States, to underestimate the significance of successes in the international arena. Their contribution to the struggle for those successes is common knowledge.\n149.\tAt the same time, one should be clearly conscious of the fact that detente is not a process which develops by its own momentum. For detente to move ahead, ever new impulses must be given it. A continuous day-to-day struggle must be conducted for it in international forums and from parliamentary rostrums. Each State, each Government, should realize that it can and should make its own contribution to detente.\n150.\tWe deem it necessary to state this from the rostrum of the United Nations because, as facts prove, it would be wrong to underestimate the resistance of the enemies of detente.\n151.\tDesigns dangerous to the cause of international co-operation continue to originate in their camp. And in this connexion no small arsenal of means is put into action, ranging from the direct use of force against other countries and peoples to demagoguery which exploits the tenacity of the \\\"cold-war\\\" dogmas and sows doubts as to the benefits of detente for all peoples.\n152.\tThe same forces which once in the past sought to thwart the convening of the all-European Conference, and later on tried to prevent it from succeeding, attempt to question the effectiveness of its results.\n153.\tHowever the problem does not only lie in tendentious propaganda campaigns against detente and international actions aimed at deepening it; what is even more dangerous is the continuous policy of interference which endangers the independence of States, even though such a policy may be camouflaged words in defense of the ideals of freedom and democracy. Two years ago, this policy paved the way for the bloody Fascist coup in Chile. Today, almost the same methods are used to exacerbate the situation concerning some other countries.\n154.\tThe world is deeply concerned over the blatant attempts to bring outside pressure to bear on Portugal, clearly made with the intent to compel the Portuguese people to abandon their chosen road of free development.\n155.\tThe interests of solving the complex political and economic problems faced by Portugal require that a calm situation be ensured with regard to that country. No one can be allowed to flout the inalienable right of the Portuguese people to determine its destiny independently and without outside interference. Such is the position on which the Soviet Union has proceeded and will continue to proceed.\n156.\tOpponents of the process of detente will try to slow it down. But if we ask all those who, overtly or semi-overtly, today come out against the line of lessening international tensions what alternative they offer, they cannot come up with anything intelligible. In reality, their policy has but one answer, an answer which would tend to reserve this process and bring it back to the times of the \\\"cold war\\\".\n157.\tHerein lies the watershed between those who in practice stand for peace, for the improvement of relations between States and for the development of peaceful co-operation in all fields and they are backed by the peoples and those who reject this course in the development of world affairs, who would rather push the world towards the old path of tension, clashes between States, and an unrestrained arms race with all the ensuing dangers.\n158.\tAll participants in this world forum of States would probably agree that one of the main tasks in the international sphere remains the elimination of the hot-beds of armed conflict. One need not dwell on the gravity of the threat when in this or that hot-bed the conflict suddenly flares up and again produces a crisis. The world has repeatedly faced such a turn of events and knows full well how hard it is to put out the flames of war.\n159.\tThis, above all, concerns the Middle East, where a dangerous situation has persisted for many years.\n160.\tThe essence of the conflict, its origins and causes are well knwon. What is required for the solution of the problem is no secret either. Only those do not see it who do not wish to. To establish a just and lasting peace in the Middle East in the interests of all States of the area and peoples inhabiting it, it is necessary that Israeli forces be withdrawn from all the Arab territories occupied by them in 1967; to ensure the lawful rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including their right to establish their own State; to guarantee the rights of all the countries of the Middle East to independent development. I repeat, \\\"all\\\" the countries of the Middle East.\n161.\tA Middle East settlement cannot make headway if those crucial problems are left unsolved. Without their solution a settlement in the Middle East can only be delayed indefinitely, with increasing dangers for the situation. No palliative measures or camouflaging can change the substance of the matter.\n162.\tThe problem of the Middle East must be free from an approach based on momentary considerations and publicity. It can be solved in the interests of the security and independence of all the countries of the region only in conditions of a serious and responsible approach to its solution.\n163.\tFrom all appearances, the circles which determine the political course of Israel have not yet realized that it is impossible to ensure the security of the country while trampling upon the legitimate rights of other countries which are jits neighbors. That policy naturally meets with broad condemnation. The Soviet Union, too, decisively condemns it.\n164.\tThe main problems of the Middle East are still awaiting solution. There is appropriate machinery for their examination the Geneva Peace Conference. The Soviet Union stands for the reconvening of the Conference with the participation of all\u2014and I stress \\\"all\\\"\u2014parties concerned, including representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization. It will be recalled that the General Assembly at its twenty- ninth session reaffirmed by an overwhelming majority the right of the Arab people of Palestine to self-determination and national sovereignty [resolution 3236 (XXIX)\\. The solution of the Palestine problem is an integral part of an over-all settlement in the Middle East. Today this is axiomatic and politicians cannot pretend that they do not see it.\n165.\tThe main thing with which the participants should come to the Conference is a firm desire jointly to seek acceptable solutions. The Soviet Union, for its part, is ready to continue to do everything so that the Middle East may become an area of lasting and durable peace. That is what we mainly want to see in the Middle East, an area adjacent to the southern borders of our country.\n166.\tThe Soviet Union consistently pursues a policy of friendship with the Arab countries, which are defending their just cause. This friendship is deeply ingrained and we do not believe that anyone will succeed in undermining it. The Soviet Union will continue to do everything in its power to consolidate this friendship on a basis of justice and principle.\n167.\tThe situation in and around Cyprus still remains complicated. To satisfy interests alien to Cyprus the sovereignty of that small country and the inalienable rights of its people have been trampled upon for more than a year.\n168.\tThe Soviet Union has consistently come out in defence of the independence and the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus, for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the island, and for the settlement of the internal matters of their State by the two communities, Greek and Turkish, themselves. In other words, we are for the implementation of the well-known United Nations decisions on Cyprus. It is only on such a basis that a just settlement of the Cyprus problem and the elimination of this hotbed of tension will be possible.\n169.\tThe precarious state of armistice obviously does not ensure the stabilization of the state of affairs on the Korean peninsula. The need to create conditions for establishing durable peace on the Korean peninsula and speeding up the peaceful reunification of Korea has long been pressing.\n170.\tThose goals would be served by a cessation of outside interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people and, in the first place, the withdrawal from South Korea of all foreign troops stationed there under the United Nations flag, as well as by the conclusion of a peace treaty. It is the duty of the United Nations to assist in every possible way in taking such steps. This can be done on the basis of the proposals put forward at the current session of the General\nAssembly by a large group of States, including the Soviet Union.\n171.\tThe process of lessening tensions in the world, the very logic of its development, pose most acutely the question of the need to curb the arms race. The measures taken in this direction in recent years are to be commended. We attach great importance also to the negotiations now under way aimed at working out a new long-term agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States of America on the limitation of strategic offensive weapons. Its conclusion will be a new and major step forward, not only in bilateral Soviet-American relations, but in a wider international context as well.\n172.\tHardly anyone would dispute the fact that everything that has been achieved in the field of disarm-ament so far represents but the first steps. Indeed, mankind so far has been unable to check the arms race or even substantially to slow down its pace. It goes on in the direction both of developing ever more destructive means of warfare and of building up the total volume of armaments.\n173.\tThe Soviet Union is convinced that in the conditions of a relaxation of tensions in the world the prerequisites have been created for the implementation of effective measures which would end the arms race. In other words, it is now not only necessary but also possible to supplement political detente with military detente. The States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe unanimously pronounced themselves in favor of this in the Final Act.\n174.\tThe Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held last May at Geneva, came out for the implementation of broad measures for the limitation of the arms race ana fcr disarmament. It is precisely such specific steps towards easing the burden of armaments that become the touchstone for testing the genuine readiness of States and Governments to pursue the course of peace.\n175.\tThe struggle for disarmament has always been and continues to be an integral part of the foreign policy line of the Soviet Union. The USSR is a permanent and active participant in negotiations on various aspects of the disarmament problem.\n176.\tWe attach great importance to the lessening of military confrontation in areas where it is especially dangerous. Now, following the conclusion of the all- European Conference, one of the primary tasks is to find ways towards agreement on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in central Europe, without infringing the security of anyone. The Soviet Union will contribute in every way to the success of the talks on this problem currently under way in Vienna.\n177.\tWithin the framework of the United Nations we have on more than one occasion already stated in detail our position on disarmament questions. And we have not merely stated it. The Soviet Union has put forward a large number of specific proposals many of which have formed the basis of important decisions adopted by the United Nations. We have consistently supported their implementation. This applies in particular to the resolution of the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly on the non-use of force in international relations and the simultaneous permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)].\n178.\tAnother question raised by the Soviet Union the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the United Nations Security Council also retains the utmost importance..\n179.\tWe consider it important speedily to conclude an international convention on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of techniques to influence the environment. The conclusion of such a convention would be not only a means of limiting the sphere of the arms race, but also an important means of preserving the environment, which would meet the vital interests of all States and peoples. We would like to express the hope that agreement will be reached on this matter in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, where a relevant draft is under consideration.\n180.\tIn the field of disarmament, as in other matters, the Soviet Union adopts a realistic approach. It is constantly seeking areas of disarmament and arms- race limitation in which it is feasible to find commonly acceptable agreements.\n181.\tAt the same time, we have never overlooked the main objective general and complete disarmament. We are of the view that this problem should be in the forefront of the attention of the World Disarmament Conference. The United Nations has already approved the idea of convening it. In that forum all countries of the world could, on an equal footing and freely, set out and compare their positions and outline ways and means of limiting and arresting the arms race.\n182.\tIt is high time that efforts were made to complete preparations for the conference and to convene it. As is well known, this is something in which the Soviet Union will not be, and has not been, found wanting.\n183.\tThe Soviet delegation would like to draw your attention to two aspects of the disarmament problem on which, in our view, decisions are required and can be taken in practice at the earliest possible date.\n184.\tWe all realize the importance of scientific and technological progress. The mission of science is noble and humane in essence. It expands the horizons of human knowledge, makes knowledge a powerful force of economic development, of raising the well- being of peoples and their cultural levels, and links countries together by bonds of peaceful co-operation.\n185.\tQuite recently the entire world was given new proof of this. We are referring to the outstanding international experiment in outer space, the docking and joint flight of the Soviet and American space craft, \\\"Soyuz\\\" and \\\"Apollo\\\". The \u2022 handshake in orbit, as this experiment is now known, has rightfully become a symbol of the fruitful union of scientific achievements and the policy of peaceful coexistence.\n186.\tThe USSR is a consistent champion of the use of science exclusively for peaceful purposes and in the interest of mankind, and is prepared for wide, large-scale co-operation in the sphere of science and technology with all States interested in this.\n187.\tHowever, the experience of the past shows that achievements in science and technology can be used for dangerous, even criminal purposes.\n188.\tWith today's rapid development of science and technology in various countries new types and new systems of weapons of mass destruction could emerge in various places. One can assume with a high degree of certainty that they would be even more ominous than those existing at present.\n189.\tNone of this can be ignored. Further, it is well known how difficult it is to withdraw any weapon that has already been developed from the arsenals of States, and consequently how much safer and more reasonable it is to prevent its emergence in advance. If things are viewed from that angle, the need for, the urgency of, effective measures to prohibit the development of new types and new systems of weapons of mass destruction should become absolutely evident.\n190.\tProceeding from this, aware of its responsibility as a permanent member of the Security Council, the Soviet Union proposes the inclusion in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly as an important and urgent matter of item 126 entitled \\\"Prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons\\\".\n191.\tWe propose that States, and first of all the major Powers, conclude an agreement based on an undertaking neither to develop nor to manufacture new types and new systems of such weapons and not to assist in or encourage any activities in that direction.\n192.\tThe need may arise to be more specific as to the categories of weapons which should be covered by the ban. The Soviet Union is prepared to take part in a detailed examination of this question in the course of appropriate negotiations. It is ready to speak out on the substance of this matter and to put forward most concrete proposals.\n193.\tThe draft agreement which we submit to the General Assembly [see A/10243, annex] is worded in such a way that, while banning the development of new types and new systems of weapons of mass destruction, the agreement would not at the same time impede the economic, scientific and technical development of States parties and would not infringe their right to make use of scientific research and discoveries for peaceful purposes, for the benefit of people and without any discrimination.\n194.\tSuch an international agreement would make a major contribution to the cause of limiting the arms race and to the cause of further easing international tensions. We should like to express our hope that our proposal will find support from the participants in this session and that other countries will join us in our initiative.\n195.\tIn submitting^ our second proposal we were moved by the same concern, that of delivering mankind from the danger of war; by the desire to curb the race in the most pernicious weapons at present in the arsenals of States, nuclear weapons. Its purpose is to end completely nuclear weapon tests and thus radically to limit the practical possibilities for perfecting it further.\n196.\tMajor steps have already been taken towards this aim: the 1963 Moscow Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water,\\\" and the 1974 Treaty between the USSR and the United States of America on the limitation of underground nuclear weapons tests.2\n197.\t_ In our view, conditions are ripe at present for the final step along this road: to conclude a broad international agreement imposing a ban on all nuclear weapon tests without exception.\n198.\tIn line with this approach, the Soviet Union has already proposed the inclusion in the agenda of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly of an important and urgent item entitled \\\"Conclusion of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests\\\" [item 122].\n199.\tIn accordance with the draft treaty which is submitted for the consideration of Member States [see AH0241, annex], its adherents would undertake from now on not to manufacture nuclear weapons and to prohibit and prevent any test explosions of nuclear weapons in any environment, including the underground environment. Such an obligation must, of course, be assumed by all States, including all nuclear Powers.\n200.\tWhile outlawing all nuclear weapon tests, the treaty must not at the same time deny access to the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear explosions for both nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon countries.\n201.\tWe hope that the General Assembly will support our initiative for the conclusion of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests.\n202.\tThe implementation of the proposals submitted by the Soviet Union for consideration at the present session is in our view an integral part of the fulfillment of the general task which life itself has today made the corner-stone of all United Nations activities. The essence of the task is to promote the further development of the positive processes taking place in the world and to make them irreversible.\n203.\tWe are convinced that the United Nations is equal to that task. Our world Organization has accumulated enormous experience in the multilateral co-operation of States. That valuable asset can and must be constantly employed for the benefit of peace.\n204.\tThe successful fulfillment of its lofty mission by the United Nations as an important instrument for consolidating international security, particularly in the present-day most responsible period, presupposes constant enhancement of the effectiveness of its work. That need is ever greater, since some useful decisions of the United Nations still remain unimplemented, and that plays into the hands of those who would like to maintain hotbeds of the danger of war, colonial domination and remnants of racism.\n205.\tIt would do no harm to recall once again from this rostrum that, as regards the obligation to comply strictly with the provisions of the United Nations Charter, there can be no exceptions for any of its Members. The Charter is the foundation of the entire structure of the United Nations. It has stood the test of time, and fully retains its significance for the future.\nIt is in the strict observance of the Charter, rather than in its revision, that one should look for resources for the further enhancement of the effectiveness of the United Nations and the strengthening of its authority.\n206.\tThe lofty purposes and principles proclaimed in the Charter are an embodiment of the collective quest of the peoples for peace and progress. They were born out of the flames of the greatest tragedy that has ever befallen mankind. Celebrating this year the thirtieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, the peoples look to the future with hope.\n207.\tThe greatness of the exploits performed in the struggle against fascism and aggression by the peoples of the Soviet Union and the peoples of all countries who, during the years of war, combined their efforts in the name of victory and founded the United Nations, setting themselves the task of saving present and succeeding generations from the scourge of war, will never fade.\n208.\tIn the three decades since the end of the Second World War a great distance has been covered in the struggle for international security. Particularly impressive are the successes achieved in recent years, which graphically prove that the prevention of wars between States is not a Utopian but an attainable goal. However, that must not be a source of complacency. There is still much to be done to achieve a truly stable peace on earth.\n209.\tAs for the Soviet Union, we wish to see no stops on this road, no zigzags and, above all, no reversals. Substantial steps in that direction can be made here, at this General Assembly, and we are willing to take a most active part in this common endeavor.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\n137.\t  May I convey to the President, on behalf of the Party-State of Guinea and its leader, the Supreme Authority of the Revolution, Comrade Ahmed Sekou Toure, our warm congratulations on his brilliant election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that his eminent qualities as a statesman and his lengthy experience of international problems will undoubtedly confer a special seriousness on the work of this session.\n138.\tI should also like to pay a special tribute to his predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, whose remarkable lucidity, assured competence, total availability and, above all, revolutionary courage, have enabled him to discharge effectively the heavy and complex task that was incumbent upon him both at the twenty-ninth session and the seventh special session of the General Assembly.\n139.\tAmong those well-deserved tributes I should also like to include a tribute to the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts in the search for peace, the initiation and strengthening of mutual understanding between States and their rapprochement, with a view to more effective international co-operation. I should like once more to assure him of the complete support of the people and Government of the Republic of Guinea. The admirable way in which he performs his lofty and difficult mission in the vast fields of activity of the United Nations commands the esteem and recognition of our people.\n140.\tA careful analysis of the events we are now living through reveals the contradictions opposing international imperialism and the peoples it is subjugating. This reality is clearly proved by the ever-growing dimensions of the courageous struggle undertaken by the different national liberation movements in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and also by the successes achieved on various fronts by the progressive forces of the world.\n141.\tWith the brilliant victory of Frente de Libertadao de Mozambique [FRELJMO], Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde fPA1GC], Movimento Popular de Libertagao de Angola [MP LA] and Movimento de Liberta?ao de Sao Tome e Principe [MLSTP] over Portuguese fascism, one of the most retrograde bastions of colonialism has just collapsed, at the same time liberating the Portuguese people and marking an important and historic turning point in the new stage of the decolonization process.\n142.\tMay I therefore welcome with militant fervor the admission to our Organization of the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, and the People's Republic of Mozambique. In welcoming these fraternal peoples, who have written with their blood some glorious pages in the history of Africa's liberation struggle, the delegation of the Party-State of Guinea would like to assure them once more of its militant solidarity and to pay a tribute, through them, to the memory of the heroes, Amilcar Cabral, founder of PAIGC, and Eduardo Mondlane of FRELIMO.\n143.\tWe warmly congratulate the State of Papua New Guinea on its accession to national independence and on its forthcoming admission to the United Nations.\n144.\tTaking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to convey the warm congratulations of the Party-State of Guinea and of my delegation to the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, to the Republic of South Viet Nam and to Cambodia for the brilliant victory which their peoples have just won over the greatest military Power in the world. The heroic peoples of Indo-China, through their determination and faith in the justice of their cause, have compelled the best equipped imperialist forces to abandon their country, thus confirming the thesis that, however strong, a Power cannot obstruct the triumphal march towards the conquest of its independence and sovereignty by a united and organized people determined to achieve victory. This dual military and political victory, which has been welcomed by all peace-loving and justice-loving peoples, is an inestimable contribution to the realization of the legitimate aspirations of all oppressed peoples.\n145.\tIt is regrettable that the rancorous attitude of a permanent member of the Security Council the United States has prevented the entry into full membership of the United Nations of the Republic of South Viet Nam and the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam. Those two countries, whose peoples have made heavy sacrifices for the preservation of their national independence and sovereignty and for the realization of the ideals of freedom and peace in the world, could, if they were admitted to our Organization, make a valuable contribution, based on their experience and qualities, to the attainment of the objectives laid down in the Charter. The overwhelming majority which recently expressed itself both in the Security Council and in this Assembly in favor of the admission of those two countries to the United Nations should induce the United States to examine its conscience seriously, reconsider its attitude towards those two States and support their rapid admission to our Organization.\n146.\tWhile the rejection of the applications for admission of the two valiant Vietnamese Republics has embittered my delegation, we are, on the other hand, pleased to see Cambodia's seat occupied by the authentic representatives of the Cambodian people  one of the fortunate consequences of the victory of the Indo-Chinese over imperialism and its lackeys.\n147.\tWhile in recent months we have welcomed the success achieved over international imperialism, we remain concerned over the problem of Korea, where the artificial division of the country resulting from the\npresence of foreign troops in the southern part creates a situation which threatens peace and security. Moreover, the efforts towards peace being made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are being impeded by the enormous obstacles placed in their way by the Seoul Government, with the encouragement of outside Powers.\n148.\tConsequently, the Party-State of Guinea supports the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its just demand for an end of foreign interference in the internal affairs of Korea and for the acceleration of the peaceful reunification of the country. Already, at previous sessions, our delegation has favored the dissolution of the United Nations Command. It is convinced that, during our present deliberations, the General Assembly will be able to adopt measures for the creation of favorable conditions to transform the armistice into a durable peace and to accelerate, in conformity with the desire expressed by both sides, the reunification of the country. My delegation also remains convinced that to admit one of the parties now to membership in the United Nations might jeopardize for ever the chances of this reunification.\n149.\tBesides the situation in the Korean peninsula, other sources of tension no less serious for the international community persist in the Middle East, Cyprus and southern Africa.\n150.\tIn the Middle East, the Zionist State of Israel continues not only illegally to occupy Arab lands but also to multiply armed attacks against the neighboring States. In the view of the delegation of the Party-State of Guinea, the \\\"no war, no peace\\\" situation in the Middle East will finally be settled only when the Palestinian people recover their national rights and Israel withdraws from all the occupied Arab territories. Within this framework, the participation of the PLO in all the efforts designed to achieve a negotiated settlement of the problem remains the sine qua non of the success of this process. The Republic of Guinea expresses its complete solidarity with the just cause of the Arab people and in particular with the PLO, the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people struggling for the recovery of its usurped homeland.\n151.\tThe persistence of the Cyprus crisis constitutes a threat to international peace and security. In the search for ways which should lead to ajust and lasting solution of the problem, it would be desirable to take into account the provisions of General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX), which stresses the equal rights of the Greek and Turkish communities on the island, asks for a negotiated settlement of the constitutional problems and calls upon all States to respect the independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus and to refrain from all acts of intervention directed against it.\n152.\tWith a view to reaching freely a mutually acceptable political settlement, based on the fundamental and legitimate rights of the Cypriot people, we encourage the two communities to continue contacts and negotiations with the good offices of the Secretary-General.\n153.\tIn southern Africa, in spite of the recrudescence of repression and of the methods of intimidation, the liberation movements of Azania, Zimbabwe and Namibia are progressing in their struggle against the\npolicy of apartheid and its inhuman practices. With the breaking up of the Pretoria-Lisbon-Salisbury axis and the pressures of public opinion against its odious regime, the racist Government of South Africa is becoming more and more aware, not only of its vulnerability, but also of the increasingly intolerable character of its position. The rejection by an overwhelming majority, at the twenty-ninth session, of the credentials of the Vorster representatives provides eloquent testimony to this fact. The disarray of the advocates of apartheid will now induce them to seek a so-called detente designed to lull the vigilance of the African leaders and to find new subterfuges for increasing their oppression of the peoples of Namibia and the black majority of South Africa.\n154.\tIn spite of a scandalous propaganda campaign inspired from abroad and built up around the so-called detente, the racist regime of Pretoria has just unleashed a wave of bloody repression, inhuman torture and arbitrary arrest against the South African population. The much vaunted dialog should first be established between Vorster and the legitimate representatives of the people, that is, the liberation movements.\n155.\tUsing fallacious arguments, the South African Government persists in its illegal occupation of Namibia and in the imposition of the bantustans. In conformity with the pertinent resolutions of the Security Council and of the General Assembly, Namibia must accede to independence as a single entity.\n156.\tThe so-called constitutional conference on Namibia, trumped up by Vorster, and the conference he orchestrated with his henchman, Ian Smith, at Victoria Falls in Rhodesia are maneuvers designed to reinforce the supremacy of the white minority in southern Africa. The sole aim of Vorster and Ian Smith is to prevent by every means the African majority from achieving power in these countries so as to perpetuate the unrestrained exploitation of their natural resources.\n157.\tThe delegation of Guinea hopes that in Zimbabwe the liberation movements will remain vigilant so as to thwart all the maneuvers designed to divide them or to induce them to proclaim a semblance of participation of the African majority in a puppet Government.\n158.\tIt hopes also that the United Nations, after a long period of hesitation, will assume its responsibilities and decide to put an end, once and for all, to a situation in southern Africa which contains the seeds of conflagration.\n159.\tIn the same region, and more precisely in Angola, the unstable internal situation created by the clashes provoked and maintained by neo-colonialism constitutes a serious obstacle to the attainment of independence by that country. However, with the considerable efforts continually being made by the MPLA, the authentic embodiment of the interests of the working masses, independence will be won on the date anticipated, 11 November 1975.\n160.\tThe situation in the Comoros, a State member of the OAU, is still a source of concern to my delegation, which hopes that the international community will take appropriate steps to preserve the national independence and territorial integrity of that country.\n161.\tThe delegation of the Republic of Guinea appreciates the efforts being made to achieve decolonization in various parts of the world and supports all peoples struggling courageously for the attainment of their inalienable rights to self-determination, independence and national sovereignty: in so-called Spanish Sahara, the Seychelles, so-called French Somaliland, the Pacific Islands, and so on.\n162.\tThe acuteness of the problem of development and international co-operation has in recent years engaged the countries of the third world in a battle for the liquidation of the old international economic order. Indeed, since the sixth special session of the General Assembly the problem has constantly been a central concern of the international community. The evaluations made during that session made it possible to adopt a Declaration and a Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)], whose modalities, establishment and basic principles were studied by the seventh special session, which has just ended.\n163.\tThe work of those two sessions proved the strength of the awareness and unity of the third world, and particularly the realization of peoples of the interdependence of the modern world. It is particularly interesting to note that, as we face the need for changing, rebuilding and redefining the international economic system, the outdated dogmas and the old ideas of the world are in the process of disintegration. The changes begun are irreversible and are characterized by the revolutionary overthrow of the old order, which upheld the supremacy of the big, powerful and developed countries to the detriment of the small, weak and under-equipped countries.\n164.\tThe seventh special session, which revealed the will of all States to reach positive conclusions, though not entirely satisfactory, led to the adoption of concrete measures in the fields of international trade, the transfer of real resources, techniques and technology, monetary reform, industrialization, food and agriculture, and so on. These measures, we dare to hope, will mark the beginning of a new era in international economic co-operation based on the increased and more equitable interdependence of mankind.\n165.\tIn any event, it is we, the developing countries, which must help the industrialized countries to cooperate more loyally with us in destroying and redefining the present international economic order in conformity with the new concepts and the new situation. For, as President Ahmed Sekou Toure has stated:\n\\\"It is not at all fatal that there has been what is modestly called a deterioration in the terms of trade. This is the normal evolution of an imposed system which is essentially bad. It is absolutely abnormal that the developing countries, the legitimate owners of vast mineral and energy resources and other resources which have been snatched away from then-economies and used as the basis for the rich countries' prosperity, should be kept in poverty, although benefiting officially from technical and material assistance. The system is surely a bad one. Therefore, we must break away from it deliberately and as soon as possible.\\\"\n166.\tIt is in this context that we must understand the action, or rather the reaction, of the developing countries as producers of raw materials. The decision taken by the countries members of the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries [OPEC], far from being an act of hostility directed against the capitalist Powers which are the major oil consumers, constitutes essentially the first step in the radical modification of a situation and the liquidation of a system which, if allowed to persist, could only end in a brutal clash between the countries injured by, and the countries benefiting from, that iniquitous situation, a clash which would also swallow up the beneficiaries.\n167.\tWe are convinced that the measures adopted at the two special sessions will help to equalize the economic and commercial exchanges between nations and to promote a form of international co-operation which will ensure the well-being and progress of all peoples. These noble objectives, the economic and social progress of mankind, would receive a powerful boost if we could put a stop to the frantic arms race and if all the nuclear Powers made a sincere effort towards general and complete disarmament. Let them therefore decide to release the enormous sums they are now spending on research and the development of new weapons so that they can be used to help overcome under-development.\n168.\tThe fortunate changes which have taken place in the political, economic, social and cultural fields in the 30 years of United Nations history have profoundly modified the physiognomy of the international community. Conceived by about 50 countries, the Charter of the United Nations, signed at San Francisco must be adapted to the requirements of the new realities; the Charter must be revised and the Organization must be restructured.\n169.\tThe Government of the Republic of Guinea considers that the time has come to review the structures of certain organs of the United Nations, particularly the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council. The Security Council, which is responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security, remains the instrument of the big Powers, which hold the power of veto, the treacherous use of which has been condemned more than once by my delegation. The very criterion which confers this right on the permanent members of the Council is no longer acceptable. Even the continued assignment of permanent seats can no longer be justified after 30 years of existence of the Organization. Hence my delegation, with a view to reinforcing the foundations of the' United Nations, renews its proposal for the elimination of the right of veto.\n170.\tIn view of the importance of economic and social questions, the operating machinery of the Economic and Social Council should be redefined so as to make it more effective for the primary role incumbent on the Council in the establishment ol a new international economic order.\n171 The Republic of Guinea is firmly attached to the noble ideals of the Charter; hence it expresses its willingness to participate conscientiously and responsibly in the strengthening of the United Nations and in the establishment of links of friendship and co-operation between Guinea and all peoples of the world on the basis of mutual respect for national\nsovereignty. In this spirit it welcomes the normalization of its relations with France and with the Federal Republic of Germany.\n172.\tOne of the priority tasks of the international community of States concerns the need to find common ground for the elaboration and signature of a convention governing the specific status of the sea-bed regime. Indeed, during the last three sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea the need for the elaboration of a universal instrument has been recognized. My delegation regrets that the attitude of certain Powers has made it impossible to overcome the deadlock resulting from their failure to recognize the sovereignty of States over their maritime space and resources.\n173.\tAt sessions of the Conference held at Caracas, New York and Geneva my delegation clearly stated that Guinea has no intention of reducing by one millimeter the extent of its territorial sea, which of course includes the economic zone. With regard to this zone, we respect the principle of freedom of navigation for the individuals and corporate bodies of other nations and also agree to the laying of pipelines and submarine cables in the event of the interested persons requesting authorization in conformity with existing international regulations.\n174.\tThe participation of women in the fight against imperialism, colonialism and racism and in favor of progress and peace is of decisive importance. The proclamation of 1975 as International Women's Year constitutes a recognition of women's role and represents an advance towards the liquidation of all forms of discrimination based on sex, which is a serious infringement of human dignity and a flagrant violation of human rights. The promotion of the status of women is not the fabrication of the good conscience of a repentant society; it is a problem to be viewed, not from the angle of sex, but from the angle of human dignity.\n175.\tWe must therefore rid ourselves of all the causes of social injustice: indignity, exploitation, oppression and inequality. To this end, societies must be based on democratic and dynamic bases; social relations must favor social equality; and principles and methods must enable each and every one of whatever sex to participate, solely on the basis of ability, in the management and direction of the public affairs of a country, thus paving the way for the happy future of the universal society. Thus the level of development, the achievements of science, technology and economics and the new realities of the world militate in favor of the complete integration of women in political, social and cultural life.\n176.\tThe World Conference of the International Women's Year, held in Mexico in June and July, adopted measures to accelerate this process of integration. On the application of the decisions of that Conference at the national, regional and international levels will depend the improvement of the status of women and hence of society. The Guinean delegation welcomes the encouraging results of the World Conference in Mexico and reaffirms the unreserved support of the Government for the World Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Women's Years and the Declaration of\nMexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace, 1975.9\n177.\tThe Guinean delegation expresses the hope that the work of this session, which coincides with the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations, will be crowned with success and will hasten the advent of a world based on justice and peace.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me first to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. Your election is a well-deserved tribute to your great qualities as an international statesman.\n2.\tThe admission of Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe to membership in the United Nations is yet another result of the persistent and successful process of decolonization and yet another important step towards full universality of membership. The Danish Government looks forward to continuing in this Organization the fruitful co-operation which already exists among our peoples.\n3.\tWe share with others the belief that all States should be Members of the world Organization. All countries should be allowed to reap the benefits of full participation in the work of the United Nations, while being subject to the obligations of the Charter. Irrespective of the sympathy or antipathy we may harbor for any system or policy, we oppose any attempt contrary to the Charter to expel or suspend any Member State from the United Nations itself, its organs or affiliated organizations, or any attempt to limit the rights of a Member State. Peace and progress towards a more orderly world require contacts and dialog in an organized forum. Exclusions or restrictions will serve only to eliminate useful contacts and, in turn, to lessen the possibility of exerting influence.\n4.\tThe thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations offers a very welcome opportunity to evaluate the present state of the Organization and to try to look into the future. In recent years it has often been said that the United Nations is in a state of crisis and irrelevancy. Rather than go into a general but ultimately fruitless discussion of this, I would prefer to take as my point of departure the remarks made by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the\nwork of the Organization [Al100011Add.!] when he underlines the fact that two great questions concerning the future remain unanswered. First, can the sovereign nations of our interdependent world, in the new circumstances in which we live, reach a sufficient consensus and generate the necessary collective will to give real and lasting effect to the original idea of the United Nations as an effective instrument for keeping the peace? Secondly, can they develop the capacity of the Organization to deal with the global problems which now face all nations and which certainly cannot be dealt with in isolation by one nation or group of nations alone? Those two are essential questions.\n5.\tWe can give a positive reply only if certain important pre-conditions are fulfilled. The first is strict adherence by all Members to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respect for the letter of that instrument. At the twenty-fifth session a foreign minister concluded his statement at this rostrum with what he called the most modest and the least original of proposals: \\\"Let us use our Organization and let us apply the Charter.\\\" On this occasion I take the liberty of repeating that proposal,\n6.\tIn this connexion it is important that the division of competence between the Security Council and the General Assembly laid down in the Charter be strictly observed.\n7.\tIt is of paramount importance that we preserve the basic principles of the Charter. At the same time we must realize that the proper functioning of our Organization in an ever-changing world depends on continuous and constructive adaptation to new challenges. We must strive together to proceed by dialog, negotiation and co-operation and we must avoid bitter confrontation. The proceedings and outcome of the seventh special session testify to that.\n8.\tThere must be a convergence of opinions into compromises that all countries can live with. That is true not least in questions where viable solutions can be found only through the participation of the world community as a whole.\n9.\tWe are eager to co-operate, but we are also determined to insist on orderly procedures and adherence to the Charter. The United Nations was never intended to be an organization of like-minded States; it is rather an arena in which to harmonize and accommodate different policies and different interests. That does not mean that this Organization should not reflect deep-rooted divisions and existing, but unacceptable, inequalities. Without an open airing of justified grievances the Organization would lose its life. But we should endeavor to understand our respective back-grounds and motives and ultimately to seek solutions through joint efforts, not arbitrary action.\n10.\tIn particular, in the specialized agencies excessive politicization should be avoided. In spite of the \nmany burning and unsolved questions, we are convinced that these organizations derive their strength and their significance from the very fact that they are able to deal with their separate tasks in an objective atmosphere.\n11.\tIf the pre-conditions which I have just mentioned are fulfilled we should be on the road to making this Organization a truly universal tool of co-operation among nations.\n12.\tThe primary task of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security. The record shows both success and failure. There have been local wars; yet there have been no global wars. More than once, conflicts which might have escalated have been contained through the efforts, or at least within the framework, of the United Nations. The confrontation which marked East-West relations in the postwar period has been increasingly replaced by various forms of co-operation. Here and elsewhere our aim must be, through the development of international co-operation in breadth and in depth, to create a net-work of common interests by which to make the process of detente irreversible.\n13.\tThe second interim agreement between Egypt and Israel must be viewed as a significant step towards a just and lasting peace. The momentum must be preserved, however, so that through negotiation new and substantial progress can be made on the road to a global peace settlement in accordance with the well- known principles laid down in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In this respect may I also recall our adherence to the declaration of the nine members of the European Economic Community [EEC] adopted on 6 November 1973.\n14.\tIn Cyprus the United Nations has endeavored for many years to help bring about conditions for a peaceful solution based on the consent of the two national communities. The Danish Government highly appreciates the current efforts of the Secretary- General to promote negotiation between the representatives of the Cypriot communities. We shall continue to support those efforts. We appeal to the parties to act with prudence, with realism and with flexibility.\n15.\tWhen we consider the search for just and lasting settlements in the Middle East and Cyprus we should not overlook the essential role also played by United Nations peace-keeping forces in these areas. Peacekeeping operations cannot in themselves solve political problems. That goes without saying. But they can help to reduce tension between conflicting parties and thereby create an atmosphere conducive to realistic negotiations between them. Peace-keeping is an indispensable prerequisite to peace-making. The peace-keeping operations of the United Nations have in fact proved to be one of the most constructive and imaginative accomplishments of this Organization.\n16.\tAfter a decade of slow development the process of decolonization has regained its impetus. The United Nations has played an essential role in the developments which have taken place in southern Africa and which in the last few years have brought out particularly gratifying results in the efforts to achieve independence for the former Portuguese Territories.\n17.\tBut many Africans are still under the yoke of oppression. This is true not least of Namibia. The Republic of South Africa continues to uphold its illegal regime and to prevent the population from exercising its right of self-determination and independence. In this respect, the United Nations has quite a special responsibility which we must all do our utmost to live up to. The pressure on South Africa must not be weakened; on the contrary, it must be enhanced and so must the pressure on the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia by strict implementation of the sanctions of the United Nations. In spite of the persistent denunciation by the international community, the illegal regime continues to exercise its repressive policies against the African majority of Zimbabwe and to deprive those people of their rights as equal citizens.\n18.\tThe United Nations is rapidly acquiring a new and important role in the management of the world economy. This is in keeping with the universal character of the Organization.\n19.\tThe existing gaps between rich and poor countries, between countries favored by nature and countries less endowed, constitute the stark reality on the basis of which our common endeavors in the United Nations must proceed. It is the duty of all nations to take an active part in efforts to eliminate unfair inequalities and outdated privileges among the peoples of the world. Only by helping the less fortunate peoples to regain their dignity and to occupy a proper place in the human community can we hope to create a just world,\n20.\tIn the promotion of this goal, the Danish Government is firmly committed to the official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product set out in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. According to our national plan, the target envisaged in the resolution adopted last week at the seventh special session [resolution 3362 (S-VII)] will be reached by the end of this decade.\n21.\tIt is a distinctive feature of Danish development assistance that about half of it is channeled through international organizations. Through our contributions, first and foremost, to the United Nations Development Program, we have supported efforts to enable the United Nations to play an important role in international development co-operation.\n22.\tAlthough we can truthfully claim that considerable and encouraging results have been accomplished through past and ongoing development Programs, we have to admit that those Programs have been insufficient to achieve the goal of narrowing the gap in standards of living of developing and developed countries.\n23.\tWe have accepted this challenge. The response by the member countries of EEC to the proposals presented by the Group of 77, including the signing of the 1975 Lome Convention, bear out our earnest desire for a constructive dialog.\n24.\tIt would be idle to expect rapid and spectacular results. The process of adjusting to new conditions and of accepting the necessary sacrifices has its own rhythm and is conditioned by our democratic decision- making processes. Patient negotiations are needed, not only among nations but, equally importantly, within nations where conflicting interests have to be reconciled. The general economic climate is another significant factor in determining the ability of developed countries to meet the requirements for changes in the economic order and, in turn, the capacity of developing countries to enjoy the benefits thereof.\n25.\tThe seventh special session was an event of major importance. Member States succeeded in reaching agreement on guidelines for a broad and realistic Program of measures designed to increase the capacity of the developing countries to pursue their development. The outcome was significant because it was achieved through true negotiations involving give-and-take on both sides. It is an encouraging sign that a new and realistic approach has been found. It holds a real promise for the success of the detailed negotiations which must now be conducted to give substance to the resolution.\n26.\tAnother area of international co-operation under the auspices of the United Nations is the drafting now under way of a convention for a new law of the sea. Such a convention will only acquire the intended value if it receives nearly universal adherence. It is therefore essential that reasonable account should be taken of all legitimate interests in the elaboration of solutions to the concrete problems.\n27.\tA continuing concern of our Organization is to promote and encourage respect for human rights. Throughout the existence of the United Nations we have had to witness persecution on ideological, political or religious grounds, torture and other flagrant violations of fundamental human rights in many parts of the world. Unfortunately, present-day practices in our various continents bring fresh and tragic evidence of such violations. It remains one of the central duties of the world community to react with determination to such practices wherever they occur.\n28.\tIn conclusion, I would like to touch briefly upon a very important aspect of our work. The United Nations was established by the peoples of the world. An organization created by man to work for man can only succeed if it is backed by public understanding, by respect and by support from the people. We must admit that a flow of rhetoric, inaction, disrespect for the Charter, and national narrow-mindedness have often weakened public faith in this Organization.\n29.\tPublic understanding and support must be regained. We must develop an atmosphere of moderation and conciliation conducive to a genuine dialog: that is, a dialog based on respect for differing national interests. We must all show greater willingness to co-operate constructively in the search for common answers to the global problems confronting us.\n30.\tThe Danish Government does not underestimate the magnitude of this task. But if we all have the wisdom, the courage and the political will to cooperate we may be able together to develop a strong United Nations. It is an immediate challenge to all 141 Members to make this Organization a more effective instrument for the strengthening of international peace and security and for international economic and social co-operation. If we fail, it will be our common responsibility.\n"

        "file_text": "\n78.\t Mr. President, allow me on behalf of the Government and the people of Malaysia, to congratulate you on your election to the high office of President of this session. Your admirable qualities, tact and understanding will serve you well as you lead us through our deliberations in the months ahead. In welcoming your appointment, I should like also to pay a tribute to your illustrious predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Foreign Minister of Algeria, President of the twenty- ninth session and seventh special session, for his leadership during those sessions.\n79.\tAllow me, on behalf of my Government, to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to our new friends, the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe on their achievement of independence and on their new status as sovereign nations, taking their rightful place in the United Nations. We should also like to congratulate Papua New Guinea in anticipation of its admission into the United Nations soon. As we see it, the presence of these countries among us represents not only the inevitable triumphs of peoples struggling against colonialism but also another big step towards complete universality in the United Nations.\n80.\tThis year is a momentous one for the United Nations, as it celebrates its thirtieth anniversary. As our Organization stands on the threshold of another decade, we feel that it is relevant for us to ponder upon the path it has taken in the last 30 years and the direction which we hope it will take in the years to come. This is surely the time for frank assessment, for the searching of minds and, most of all, for a fearless look at reality.\n81.\tWe are all aware that the United Nations, with its limitations and weaknesses, is far from being a perfect Organization. This is understandable especially when one considers that the world in which the Organization was fashioned was different from the one we have today. It was created then by a small minority to ensure that mankind would be spared the scourge and devastation of another world-wide conflagration. The high ideals and principles upon which the Organization was founded have not found expression in our desire to have an effective instrument for maintaining peace and security and for economic and social justice.\n82.\tThe challenge before us as we stand on the threshold of the next decade is whether or not we shall be able to rise above narrow selfish interests and perceive the world in a larger context and in its human and often vulnerable entirety. Are we going to remain indifferent to the cries of the majority of mankind, which still lives ill-fed, ill-clothed and ill-housed, and are we going to be helpless in the face of the great gulf that separates the well-to-do minority from the poor, the deprived and the disadvantaged majority? To allow the situation to drift as we have been doing is hardly conducive to a stable, secure and peaceful world. The onus is therefore on us as to whether we leave a legacy of peace, equality and prosperity or chaos, devastation and grief.\n83.\tThere are those who are sceptical or cynical about the worth or the achievements of this Organization. Yet, if the past 30 years have taught us anything, it is that the United Nations is a durable and living Organization and that the principles and purposes for which it was founded are as relevant today as they were when the Charter was drawn up in 1945. That we should look to the United Nations to solve the problems of disarmament, decolonization and development, of food and population, of trade and industrialization, of the environment and the seabed, of human rights and the plight of women is indication enough of the importance we attach to the Organization. These problems are global in nature and they require global solutions. The United Nations provides us with the best means to discuss these problems and search for acceptable solutions. If the solutions have fallen short of our aspirations and this has often been the case it is not the fault of the United Nations itself, but our own. The ability of the United Nations to grapple with these problems depends very much on us. It is only our political will that can make the United Nations succeed as an instrument of peace and a catalyst for change. It is, therefore, the common responsibility of all of us, especially the big Powers, to fulfill our obligations in accordance with the provisions of the Charter. In this respect we think that it is opportune to look into the restructuring of our Organization and to review the Charter so that the United Nations can be an effective force in the resolution of the problems that we face.\n84.\tWe are, of course, not blind to political realities. We are aware that we can only do so much in calling for a more constructive and sane world order. What is essential is still the co-operation and concurrence of the big Powers. However, at the moment this is not yet forthcoming. While we initially welcomed the super-Power detente as offering brighter prospects of peace, we viewed it with some caution. Our caution seems to be justified, for what we have seen so far is a mutual accommodation of big-Power interests. For detente to have real meaning, there must be a perceptible movement towards meeting the aspirations of all countries, especially the developing countries, for a more just and equitable economic and social order, and towards solving some of the intractable problems that continue to bedevil us. Therefore, detente should not merely be a convenient formula for mutual consultations in the continuing game of big-Power politics. We in Malaysia, however, are still hopeful that in our generation we shall live to see a radical change in the policies of the big Powers so that these Powers will direct their energies towards more constructive and beneficial ends.\n85. We can make a fresh start here at this session by seriously devoting our attention and our efforts to those problems that have continually appeared on the agenda since the first session of the Assembly.\nProblems relating to disarmament, apartheid, the search for a peaceful and just solution in the Middle East, the Korean question, and the problems of economic advancement, trade and aid, are in urgent need of attention and solution. If we can at this session display the willingness and ability to consider them seriously without having the sterile debates and recriminations of the past, then we shall have achieved something we can be proud of. What is needed is a fresh start and a fresh look at these problems. There are signs that the international community is ready to enter into an earnest dialog in the search for a consensus on these issues.\n86.\tOne of the first problems that need our attention is that of disarmament. The Secretary-General, indeed almost all the speakers before me, have rightly emphasized at various times the seriousness and the danger inherent in the escalation of the arms race and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Some nations now have the capability to inflict far greater and more irreversible damage than militarists ever dreamed of in the last war. The arms race, both in conventional and nuclear weapons, has continued unabated. What is even more disturbing is the fact that the arms- supplying countries are using their hardware as a political weapon of \\\"divide and rule\\\" among nations. The global expenditure on armaments in a year has amounted to $300,000 million. The increase in the level of armaments, both quantitative and qualitative, not only poses a constant threat to our survival, but is also as senseless as it is wasteful. Only a fraction of the amount spent on the arms build-up would be needed, for example, to stabilize the prices of primary commodities of export interest to developing countries. This would have a great regenerating effect on our economies and benefit both developed and developing countries. Our sense of security is not going to be enhanced by a rise in the arms build-up, nor can any edifice for peace last if this trade in the merchandise of death is not halted. The United Nations should do all it can to mobilize world public opinion and bring its moral weight to bear on this issue.\n87.\tWe reiterate our position that lasting peace can be achieved only through general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control, and not through a mutually agreed balance of armaments. We affirm our support once again for the convening of a world disarmament conference under the auspices of the United Nations. This session should also seriously consider the recommendation of the Lima Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries for the convening of a special session devoted to disarmament matters [iff A/10217 and Corr.l, annex, para. 114]. We are most concerned that midway through the Disarmament Decade we have barely begun to touch upon the vital issues. The Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons that was held in May this year in Geneva ended with no commitments from the nuclear Powers that vertical or horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons would be stopped, that all forms of nuclear weapon-testing in all environments would be banned, or that the world disarmament conference would be convened. At the same time, the non-nuclear- weapon States parties to the Treaty have had no firm assurance that their security would be guaranteed in case of the use, or threat of the use, of nuclear weapons, or that the benefits from the peaceful application of nuclear energy would be made available to them. We hope that these issues will be discussed at this session in a true spirit of co-operation and constructive debate.\n88.\tOn the Middle East question, Malaysia's position is clear. We note that some tension has been removed as a result of the latest negotiations. However, the problem will remain unresolved as long as Israel occupies Arab lands and refuses to comply with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We deplore the acquisition of territories by the use of force and the changing of the geographical and demographic aspects of the occupied territories. Another aspect of the Middle East conflict is the question of Jerusalem and Israeli acts of desecration in transforming the religious and historical character of the city and the Holy Places. Malaysia has joined the Islamic countries in calling for the withdrawal of Israel from Jerusalem and has condemned its acts of desecration. The solving of the Palestinian problem is also indispensable to peace in the Middle East. The people of Palestine must be granted their inalienable right to self-determination and their right to return to their homeland. Malaysia recognizes the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and we fully support the PLO in its struggle to realize the aspirations of the Palestinian people.\n89.\tAnother of the problems I mentioned earlier is that of apartheid, which has been on our agenda in one form or another since 1946. Together with this is the general situation with regard to southern Africa. The General Assembly cannot allow both the Pretoria regime and the illegal racist-minority regime in Salisbury to continue ignoring and flouting United Nations resolutions with impunity. The Pretoria regime must end its illegal occupation of Namibia. The people of Namibia must be given the opportunity to determine their own future. The people of Zimbabwe must also be granted their inalienable rights to self- determination and independence. These oppressed peoples should no longer be subjected to any uncertainty regarding their prospects for freedom and independence. The United Nations should give full support to the people and the leaders of the liberation movements in their just and legitimate struggle.\n90.\tOne of the major achievements of this Organization has been in the field of decolonization. As the records will show, Malaysia has always given its unqualified support to peoples struggling to free themselves from colonial subjugation and domination. More than ever before, the time appears appropriate for peoples to be really free to exercise sovereignty over their own country and to shape their own destiny. A residue of colonial presence under any guise detracts from the real significance of independence. That is why we are concerned at the pockets of colonialism that still exist in many parts of the world, including our own. Consistent with our firm policy, Malaysia fully shares and supports the desires and aspirations of all subject peoples to attain self-determination and independence.\n91.\tIn Cyprus we face a complex and a dangerous situation that we cannot ignore. The problem is just as serious as the ones I have mentioned and requires a speedy solution. Since the main parties to the conflict are the Greek and the Turkish Cypriot communities, they should be encouraged to seek a peaceful and amicable settlement through negotiations. It is our view that, to succeed, these negotiations must give expression to the rights, the interests and the concerns of both communities. There must be a spirit of accommodation. We would like to congratulate the Secretary- General for his role in the talks that have been held between the two communities both in Vienna and in New York. His task is by no means an easy one and he has our best wishes as he continues with his efforts.\n92.\tThe question of Korea is another one of those issues that has been before us for a long time and is of special concern to us. We feel that every effort should be made to encourage the two Governments to continue the dialog between them and undertake confidence- building measures so that, under an improved climate, more substantive discussions can be held. The main problem, as we all know, is one of peaceful reunification of the two parts of Korea. In this respect, we feel that we should take a realistic view and promote a solution that will be acceptable to both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea.\n93.\tI now turn to our part of the world where significant changes have taken place since we last met. I refer to the events in Indo-China. We are happy indeed to see the end of the cruel and protracted war and the return of peace in the area. We look forward to working closely with the countries of Indo-China in a spirit of friendship and mutual co-operation. We deeply regret that the applications of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam for full membership in the United Nations were rejected in the Security Council. We express the hope that this time the Council will take into account the overwhelming support the two applications received from this Assembly and reconsider the applications favorably.\n94.\tThe Governments and people of the National Union of Laos, Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, and the Republic of South Viet Nam face a formidable task in their efforts to rehabilitate and reconstruct their countries. In this they deserve all the support and assistance we can give. The United Nations, through the Economic and Social Council, has made an urgent appeal for aid and relief assistance to these countries. At the same time, the Lima Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non- Aligned Countries established a solidarity fund in aid of these countries. It is imperative that these measures be implemented quickly. I renew the pledge I made in Lima that Malaysia stands ready to extend all assist-ance to the people of Indo-China. We offer this in a gesture of friendship and neighborly concern. Malaysia has always underscored the importance ot regional co-operation, harmony, and solidarity. Together with the countries in the region, we hope to build a strong, stable and neutral South-East Asia, free from outside interference.\n95 Malaysia, together with her neighbors and partners in the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] namely, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand-are now actively pursuing the objective of establishing in South-East Asia a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality. This proposal, as reflected in the Kuala Lumpur Declaration of 1971,1 seeks to protect the region of South-East Asia from being an arena for big-Power conflict. This Declaration also seeks to ensure that the countries in the region will be able to proceed with their national development in a climate of regional harmony and co-operation, free from disruptive elements engendered by foreign designs. It is our hope that the other countries of South East-Asia will come in time to see the merits of the neutralization proposal and join with the ASEAN countries in a common endeavor to make the region a safe and better place for the peoples in the region to live in. We are optimistic that the big Powers will come to realize that this order that we seek is really to their advantage as well. Indeed, a neutral South-East Asia would eliminate the prospect of expending energies on power play which often leaves no room for mutually beneficial activities.\n96.\tIt is heartening to see that more and more countries appear to find the idea of neutralization a commendable one. We are encouraged by the creation of nuclear-free zones and zones of peace on both land and sea. Malaysia firmly supports moves in this direction. We strongly feel that for such proposals to succeed they need to have the prior and unqualified support of the countries in the regions concerned. At the same time, we hope the nuclear Powers will respond to the call made by the Secretary-General and cooperate to ensure the success of these zones.\n97.\tIf the economic events and the debate of the last few years have revealed anything about the international economic order, it is surely the need for changes to be made to it. Our debates and negotiations, as the Secretary-General of the United Nations stated so succinctly in his closing address to the seventh special session, \\\"... is about change; it is not about a smoother management of the status quo'\\\".2 The reasons for changes to be made have been rehearsed so often, most notably at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, and I need not repeat them here. The kind of changes that need to be made have been fully articulated for many years by the developing countries and are fairly contained in the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VJ)] and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 328/ (XXIX)]. These documents and the cry for a new economic order are not slogans. They embody the directions and the measures that the developing countries believe the community of nations must take if the development of the developing countries is to be accelerated, and a more just and rational world economic and social order is to be realized.\n98.\tThe deliberations and conclusions of the seventh special session have pinpointed the issues and directions that the international community must take up in the days ahead. The importance of implementing the decisions that have been agreed upon regarding these issues cannot, I believe, be overemphasized; nor, for that matter, the importance of maintaining the momentum towards finding solutions and arriving at decisions on those issues that have not been agreed upon. Let me take this opportunity to state yet again some of those issues upon which we believe it is vital that agreements should soon be reached.\n99.\tFirst and foremost, we must reach agreement on the issues relating to international trade, particularly the trade in commodities. The importance of this matter to both developed and developing countries alike is too plain to bear recalling here. Selective and isolated solutions to the problems are no longer enough. Only a comprehensive and concerted approach to the problems, as indicated in the integrated Program for commodities as proposed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, would suffice,\n100.\tSecondly, measures to liberalize trade and to facilitate access to the markets of developed countries for the commodities, manufactures and semi-manufactures of developing countries must be urgently implemented. Improvements of general system of preferences schemes through wider coverage and deeper tariff cuts can and should be undertaken promptly. The multilateral trade negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should conclude the considerations of tropical products as soon as possible.\n101.\tThirdly, solutions should be found to the issues that have yet to receive full consensus under the heading of the transfer of real resources and the reform. of the international monetary system.\n102.\tAs we are well aware, the disparity in terms of the standard of living, wealth, technology and socioeconomic structure between the developed and developing countries is deep. Only by an integrated and comprehensive approach to the problems of the developing countries can this disparity be diminished. The task of restructuring and creating a just, rational and equitable economic order that would provide a fair opportunity for all countries to progress and prosper, is a complex one. The restructuring of the international economic order, demanding as it does, changes in the economies both of the developed and developing countries, requires the political will to sacrifice and compromise all countries, particularly the developed countries.\n103.\tFor far too long, the dialog between the developing and the developed countries has been characterized by a submission of proposals by the former and its consideration and subsequent rejection or, on the rare occasion, acceptance by the latter. The seventh special session has set in motion a new dialog based, we believe, and certainly we hope, on co-operation and a commitment to change. It is in the interest of both the developed and the developing countries that this dialog be fostered and furthered in the negotiations that lie ahead.\n104.\tWith this in view, and on the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations, we would like to leave in the minds of this Assembly the simple concept of our inseparable destiny. We firmly believe that if recognition is given to this concept in the conduct of our national and international policies, an immeasurable step will have been taken towards the resolution of our conflicts and struggles. It is an irrefutable fact that we have evolved into a very complex earth society . Today, we have accepted the reality of economic interdependence. It is equally valid to recognize the undeniable crystallization of a political symbiosis. Our political decisions affect each other, whether directly or indirectly. We are inseparably linked. Therefore, it behooves us all to ensure that our policies and actions do not set off a chain reaction of dissatisfactions and conflicts that may eventually engulf mankind.\n105.\tWe will have achieved much, if we can come away from this thirtieth session of the General Assembly with the clear realization that we are all fellow travelers on this planet earth and that it is essential that we enjoy our journey together in a spirit of goodwill, co-operation and understanding. Not least, we should also make sure that we preserve the beauty and structure of the landscape so that future travelers can enjoy an equally rewarding journey.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\n243.\t In the name of Mr. Jean-Bedel Bokassa, President-for-Life, Marshal of the Central African Republic and President for Life of the Mouvement de 1'evolution sociale de l'Afrique noire [MESAN], of our great single national party, on behalf of the Central African people and on behalf of the delegation that I have the honor of leading, allow me to extend our most sincere congratulations to the President on his election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. In fact, the States represented at this anniversary session of the Assembly, by entrusting to the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg the task of leading our work, paid a particularly well-deserved tribute to a great statesman and at the same time gave proof of their recognition of his beautiful country, which has always made remarkable efforts in favor of our Organization, thus assuring it of support in its search for a lasting peace, security and\nwell-being for all human beings living on our planet. My country, the Central African Republic, is indeed very happy at this choice in view of the relations of friendship and co-operation which link it to Luxembourg within the framework of the European Economic Community.\n244.\tWe should like to include in this tribute the Vice-Presidents and the other members of the General Committee.\n245.\tMy delegation would also like to avail itself of this opportunity to offer its most fraternal congratulations to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Algeria, who successively presided over the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session of the General Assembly. Thanks to his competence, courage, dynamism and integrity, that worthy son of Africa was, during our debates, able to create a dialog in which the spirit of candor, consultation and co-operation prevailed.\n246.\tWe should also like to pay a tribute and express our gratitude to the Secretary-General, who, with his staff, is sparing no effort to infuse into our Organization all the vitality needed to achieve its noble objectives.\n247.\tThirty years ago, on 25 June 1945, after a war that had imperiled the balance of the world, men of goodwill meeting in San Francisco founded our Organization, which thus succeeded the League of Nations.\n248.\tThose who wrote the Charter gave the United Nations precise objectives: to maintain international peace and security; to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principles of equal rights and self-determination of peoples; to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; and to be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends.\n249.\tIt would be advisable to emphasize that such noble ideals could not but claim the allegiance of the States which then enjoyed total freedom. Therefore it seems very important to consider the role our Organization has played during these 30 years of its existence and to trace the path Member States should follow to correct the mistakes of the past and to make this Organization more efficient in future.\n250.\tIf it seems difficult to draw up a balance sheet that is complete and satisfactory in all fields, nevertheless concrete results have been obtained. Some conflicts have been solved peacefully through the efforts of our Organization. All the major problems of our time decolonization, women's rights, population, food, raw materials, the environment, and energy, to mention but a few have been tackled, and world conferences have been devoted to them, particularly this year. It goes without saying that these changes have been favorably received and represent positive progress which honors our Organization.\n251 The activities pursued by the specialized agencies have been appreciable and, as was declared in\nthis Assembly on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations on 20 October 1970 by Jean-Bedel Bokassa, President-for-Life, Marshal of the Central African Republic, \\\"our Organization is journeying step by step towards universality and will embrace, in what we hope will be the near future, all those nations that have espoused peace and justice.\\\"\\\"\n252.\tMy country, the Central African Republic, feels legitimate pride in greeting, through its spokesman, myself, the States of Mozambique, Cape Verde, and Sao Tome and Principe, which have just acceded to independence and have taken their places in all dignity among the members of the international community, At the same time my delegation would like to welcome the fact that Papua New Guinea is to be admitted to the United Nations in October 1975.\n253.\tAt the same time we must unfortunately note that difficulties are being encountered in the implementation of some principles of the Charter and a considerable number of resolutions, so that peace is constantly troubled by the existence of many armed conflicts in many parts of the world.\n254.\tThe armaments race continues at a frenetic pace, although disarmament and detente are ceaselessly preached.\n255.\tEntire nations are bound by the chains of colonialism and of racist contempt, while neocolonialism continues to subjugate peoples that have recently attained their freedom and are trying to maintain and consolidate their interests,\n256.\tThe world economic situation continues to deteriorate, in particular in the developing countries, under the baneful influence of a galloping inflation caused by monetary disorder. The huge gap separating the highly industrialized world, where waste is not infrequent, from the other world, which is a prey to hunger, disease, ignorance and poverty, is widening to the detriment of hundreds of millions of human beings.\n257.\tMr. Jean-Bedel Bokassa made a forceful denunciation of this in the General Assembly. He said:\n\\\"We believe also that the United Nations specialized agencies should be freed from the abusive influence of certain States which do not hesitate to delay, even to thwart and to boycott, consideration of background material presented by certain other States whose political leanings are not to their liking.\\\"12\nIn the same spirit, the President also stated:\n\\\"Attempts either partially or completely to destroy the territorial integrity of States are still common among the imperialists, colonialists and neo-colonialists, for whom the independence of States must be only a screen to enable them to perpetuate their exploitation.\n\\\"Despite the principle of non-interference in the affairs of other States and the principle of respect for national sovereignty, certain States continue to organize campaigns of slander and disparagement in their national press against other States.\\\"13\n258.\tThis background allows us to affirm that peace and social justice, two fundamental concepts of the\n3% Charter of the United Nations, need sustained efforts on the part of our community for their concrete implementation.\n259.\tThe Central African Republic, which draws its political strength from MESAN, our great national single party, is the work of Barthelemy Boganda, its founder President. This great African figure, venerated leader of our nation, based his action an the philosophy ofzohve z<> which means \\\"equality among men\\\". His worthy successor, Mr. Jean-Bedel Bokassa has, by the principle of zo kwe zo consecrated \\\"dignity and respect\\\" for man in its most noble sense.\n260.\tIt is obvious, therefore, that in the Central African Republic we believe that whatever the nature of the dispute or conflict that divides two countries, two communities or two individuals, it should be solved by negotiation and consultation, not by violence.\n261.\tIn our review of the situation, we noted the positive progress made through the efforts of our Organization. Nevertheless, several hotbeds of tension exist throughout the world.\n262.\tIn the case of southern Africa, the Central African Republic is following developments there with great interest and my delegation endorses the statement by the current President of the General Assembly:\n\\\"May we hope that the still faint signs of progress we have detected these past few months will gain in strength and scope and that the movement thus begun will lead to the desired result within a reasonable period of lime? It would in any event be wise for the authorities who still hold the key to the situation to make the necessary concessions in their own interest.\\\" [2351st meeting, para. \n263.\tAs regards Angola, the Central African Republic, my country, is concerned hy the strife among brothers which divides the three national liberation movements and would like to reiterate the appeal it made at Kampala and Lima to the political leadens of Angola to find a basis for the peaceful settlement of their dispute, and to do so before 11 November 1975.\n264.\tIn the same connexion, my eouniry is convinced that the good offices now offered by the OAU to our brothers, the Angolan leaders, will be accepted in the interests of their peoples.\n265.\tThe so-called \\\"Spanish Sahara\\\" is another burning contemporary problem which is of great concern to all of us. We base our hope on a rapid and reasonable solution to this question. Thus, the advisory opinion that the International Court of Justice is to give on the situation prevailing in this Territory will no doubt guide our Organization in taking a decision.\n266.\tThe Middle East, to our great regret, is still a cause of great concern on account of the tension and anguish that prevail there. In Fact, the bloody clashes which dangerously shook this region in 196? and in 1973 are covering more and more areas not strictly concerned by the conflict. Therefore it becomes urgent that solutions to the resolutions adopted by the Security Council should be found for the restoration of a just and lasting peace in the region, as well an recovery by the people of Palestine of their legitimate rights.\n267. However, the Central African Republic is following with great interest the easing of the situation which began with the step-by-step policy of the Secretary of State of the United States. Mr. Henry Kissinger My country encourages the efforts undertaken along this path and hopes that in the relatively near future they will lead to favorable conditions for negotiation.\n26B. As regards the question of Cyprus, the Central African Republic, once again, deplores the failure to implement resolution 3212 (XXIX), unanimously adopted by the General Assembly and Security Council resolutions >65 [19741 and 367 (1975). It is clear that this, situation aggravates the crisis, which can make the situation, already complex in this region, even more explosive.\n269.\tWe believe that the solution to the Cyprus problem is to be found in the fact that all foreign interference should be eliminated in order to ensure the harmonious coexistence between the two communities within the same State.\n270.\tIn South-East Asia my delegation welcomes the newly restored peace in that part of the world. It expresses the wish that the international community should study the present situation in the two Viet Nam and that measures of assistance and aid should be taken in their favor.\n271.\tWhile on the subject of Cambodia, the Central African Republic welcomes the return to the international community of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia and would like to express once again our sympathy towards it.\n272.\tAs regards the question of Korea, the Government of my country continues to believe that the most realistic means for a peaceful solution is. and continues to be, the continuation of the dialog and the broadening of exchanges and co-operation between the two Korea with a view to activating an independent and peaceful unification of the country in conformity with the text of the consensus adopted by the mem-ben of the General Assembly it its twenty-eighth session.\\\"\n273.\tBy sponsoring draft resolution A,;C. 1/L.708, on the urgent need to implement fully tire consensus of the twenty-eighth sexton of the General Assembly on the Korean question and to maintain peace and security on the Korean peninsula, my country only wishes to contribute to the maintenance of peace and security in the region.\n274.\tThe Central African Republic is in favor of the admission of both Koreas to the United Nations, although reuniftcaiKKv which has to be peaceful and independent ihouId continue to be the ultimate objective for these countries, taking into account the joint north-south communique published simultaneously on 4 July 1972.'* We believe that application for admission to the United Nations is the sovereign right of a State and that this should be examined in conformity with Article 4. paragraph ! of the Charter.\n275.\tIs it necessary to recall that the first request was made on 19 January 1949 and that in resolutions 2% (IV). 81? fIXK 1017 <XIi and 1144 (XII). the General Assembly successively affirmed that the Republic of South Korea was fully qualified and should be admitted as a Member of the Untied Nations' South\nKorea with a population of over 34 million inhabitants, represents two thirds of the total population of the Korean peninsula and is a member of almost all the specialized agencies and bodies of the United Nations. It has diplomatic relations with a great majority of the States Members of our Organization.\n276.\tIn view of all these considerations, the Central African Government unreservedly supports South Korea's application for admission to the United Nations.\n277.\tThe interest that the Central African Republic has in all the questions that I have just mentioned does not make it lose sight of the importance of specifically economic problems and the problems with which it is directly confronted.\n278.\tIn fact, a developing country, one of those which are least advanced economically, the Central African Republic, on account of its land-locked situation in the heart of Africa, occupies an exceptionally difficult position which deserves to be studied with great attention.\n279.\tThe irony of destiny has also made the Central African Republic, a country of contrasts in which floods and drought alternate, subject to the influence of two important seasons: a rainy season with violent storms which devastate plantations and cause floods, and a long dry season which has harmful effects on crops and causes a maximum lowering of the waters. Thus, for many months the traffic on the river Ubangui is hindered. This is the only important waterway which now allows us access to the sea.\n280.\tBecause of this, the Central African Republic has been fighting for 15 years for the construction of a railway which, in addition to correcting its landlocked situation, would allow us to develop additional forest production corresponding to annual volume of felled trees of 500,000 to 600,000 cubic meters, and therefore promoting new agricultural production, the export of which would benefit from advantageous tariffs. With this railway network it would become possible to define a genuine policy of development, the more operational conditions of which would make the economy of the Central African Republic much more dynamic.\n281.\tThen it would be possible to create in the various regions a group of units of forestry production which would include saw-mills, and factories for woodworking, wood peeling, making paper pulp, and so on; to develop new agricultural crops in these same regions; and to increase the existing production throughout the country, thanks to the stimulus provided by the decrease in the cost of transport.\n282.\tFurthermore, the large volume of traffic by rail would favor the supply of imported products at reasonable prices, and the benefits to the purchasing power of the consumers and would lead to a general rise in the standard of living of the population.\n283.\tThere is no doubt that the construction of a railway which would make transport easier in the Central African Republic would have a very healthy impact which would enable us to achieve the development objectives fixed by our Organization for the establishment of a new world economic order.\n284.\tBut, to be truthful, it must be stressed that the efforts undertaken by Mr. Jean-Bedel Bokassa since 1966, when he acceded to this highest office of the country with a view to starting this process for our land-locked country encountered the strong and hidden resistance of powerful interests with the sole aim of boycotting the project and crystallizing the existing situation.\n285.\tHowever, the building of the railway continues to be our highest priority because it must be the backbone of our economy.\n286.\tFaced with difficulties of all kinds the head of the Central African State has decided personally to undertake action at both the national and the international level, in order to make more clear to his people and to the international community the important place its Government assigns in its development Program to the problem of changing the landlocked situation of the country.\n287.\tThat is why Mr. Jean-Bedel Bokassa addressed a message on 1 January 1974 to all Central Africans, whether by origin or adoption, and to the world in general, declaring 1974 to be the year of overcoming the land-locked situation of the Central African Republic.\n288.\tThus the 1976-1980 five-year development plan for the Central African Republic makes this objective its number one priority.\n289.\tFor some time, following the appeal of our Head of State, some international financial organizations and certain friendly countries, having understood the good reason for this decision of the Central African Government in this area, have been showing interest in this project.\n290.\tI should like to stress also the very great importance that we give to the rapid building of the trans-African road from Mombasa to Lagos. This road will also serve the Central African Republic and will certainly contribute to African unity.\n291.\tMy delegation appeals to the specialized agencies for financing and development to pay special attention to the problems of the least developed countries, the land-locked countries and the island developing countries.\n292.\tThe Central African Republic is among these and it should therefore be given concrete help in the form of special international assistance, particularly in the spheres of agriculture, stock-breeding, mines, tourism, water and forests.\n293.\tThat is why my delegation firmly endorses the decisions taken at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Algiers in September 1973, and confirmed at Dakar in February 1975 by the Conference of the Developing Countries on Raw Materials, at Lima at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries last August and, more recently, by the seventh special session of the General Assembly.\n294.\tBefore closing this chapter in which I have reviewed very briefly the situation in my country, I should like to add that, having immense natural resources, the Central African Republic opens its doors wide to all public and private investments, from whatever source, provided our national institutions and our national sovereignty are respected.\n295.\tIn that regard, the Central African code of investments offers very favorable conditions, including the exemption from certain fiscal and customs taxes, for various periods of time, depending on the size and the category of investments, and the provision of land on which plants can be constructed.\n296.\tThe third world, which is the reservoir from which the industrialized countries draw almost all the raw materials used in their factories, includes 70 per cent of mankind, but lives on only 30 per cent of the world's income. Of a population of 2,600 million people, 800 million are illiterate, nearly 1,000 million suffer from malnutrition or starvation and 900 million have a daily income of less than $0.30. These figures brought to our attention in reliable documents are sufficient evidence of the blatant injustice of which the peoples of the third world are victims.\n297.\tThat is why the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-AIigned Countries, held at Algiers in 1973, \\\"expressed its concern at the constant deterioration of the economic conditions of the developing countries which see the gap separating them from the industrialized countries grow all the time.\\\"\n298.\tTwo years later, at Dakar, the Conference of the Developing Countries on Raw Materials declared that the present structure of international trade must be replaced by a new international economic order based on principles of equity and justice in the interest of all the peoples so as to correct present injustices and not create new ones.\n299.\tThe discussions which took place during the seventh special session of the General Assembly have clearly demonstrated the determination of the third world to benefit from a better world, a world both more equitable and more human.\n300.\tFor their part, the industrialized countries have admitted the principle of a more concrete and active co-operation aimed at removing the enormous gap separating them from the developing countries.\n301.\tMy delegation gives its firm support to the decision taken by our Organization, which requests the permanent members of the Security Council to reduce by 10 per cent their military budgets and to use a part of the funds thus freed for assistance to developing countries.\n302.\tAs far as the Central African Republic is concerned, the developing countries should not expect everything from the industrialized countries. They must endeavor to seek solutions to their development problems at both the national and regional levels.\n303.\tOn this specific point, the Central African Republic is working in this direction by mobilizing all its resources within the framework of Operation Bokassa, which is a philosophy of economic, cultural and social development, as conceived by Mr. Jean-Bedel Bokassa, on his accession to the highest office of the land on 1 January 1966.\n304.\tIn the face of the present crisis which has shaken the world and of which the first victims are the third-world populations, the developing countries must\npromote solidarity that should lead to a strengthening of active co-operation among them.\n305.\tMay I be allowed on this occasion to launch a fervent appeal to all the countries which say they belong to the third world, but which have been favored by nature and Providence, to invest with full confidence in the less privileged countries.\n306.\tIs it necessary to speak of the trade situation resulting from the aggravation of the monetary crisis, which has stifled the development of the third world? The share of the third-world countries in world traded which is already modest, is diminishing all the time', while the terms of trade are continually deteriorating. The transfer of resources from developed to developing countries has been decreasing, whereas the volume of the external debt of the latter has quadrupled during the last decade.\n307.\tUnder these conditions, a fundamental reform of the world trade system is one of the priority objectives to respond to the exigencies of development, as was so well stressed by Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, in his statement of 1 September 1975.\n308.\tAll aspects of this reform are of the highest interest to all developing countries because it is not necessary to prove any further that the monetary and financial system as conceived at Bretton Woods has been serving only the interests of the developed countries without talcing into account the specific needs of the developing countries.\n309.\tThe new international monetary system, for the creation and functioning of which the developing countries must participate on the basis of equality with the richer countries, must be absolutely universal. It must guarantee the stability of the flow and terms of financing of international trade. This new international monetary system must recognize the conditions and the specific needs of the developing countries on the basis of a preferential treatment, in conformity with the declaration of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-AIigned Countries at Algiers.\n310.\tI cannot pass in silence the very important problem of technology. Indeed, the technological needs are considerable in developing countries in general and in Africa in particular.\n311.\tOf course, much technology has already been transferred to developing countries since the end of the Second World War, but those countries were not able to benefit from such transfers for two fundamental reasons: first, the technology transferred is not adapted to the economic realities of the countries involved; and, secondly, the technology market is dominated by transnational corporations and the developed countries continue to maintain their dominant position under the old economic order owing to the fact that all advanced technology is still dependent on them. To that one must add the very high cost of technology, patents, rights of ownership and trade marks.\n312.\tThe international code of conduct for the transfer of technology which was envisaged in the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] should make\npossible access on easier terms to a modern technology adapted to the needs of the developing countries.\n313.\tAs far as the transnational companies are concerned, one must fully recognize that several aspects of their activities very often clash with the strategy and objectives of the development of third-world countries.\n314.\tThe measures stressed in the recommendations of the Group of 77 and in the Lima Program for Mutual Assistance and Solidarity concerning foreign investments by the private sector clearly indicate the scope of the pernicious practices of those companies and also show the concern with which the developing countries are viewing this problem.\n315.\tMy delegation feels that the working out, the adoption and the speedy implementation of a code of conduct for the transnational companies will make it possible to exercise global surveillance of the operations of those companies. The principles that should govern that code are the following: respect for the laws and regulations of the host country; recognition of the right and privilege of the host country to nationalize the companies if such nationalization is considered the best solution for that country to exercise its sovereignty over its natural and other resources; non-interference, of any kind, in the domestic affairs, political or other, of the host country; abolition of unfair commercial practices; and reinvestment in the host country itself of an important part of the profits made.\n316.\tThe geographical situation of my country, to which I referred a few moments ago, makes it necessary to interest ourselves at a high level in the problem of the law of the sea.\n317.\tIn accordance with the Lima Program for Mutual Assistance and Solidarity of August 1975, the international community must assist the land-locked developing countries by facilitating their exercise of the right to free access to the seas.\n318.\tIf the principle of freedom of the high seas, as defined by international law, is accepted by all, it is appropriate for the resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof to be regarded by everybody as the common heritage of mankind.\n319.\tThe rational exploitation of those resources is of vital significance for the economic development and promotion of the well-being of all peoples.\n320.\tMy delegation feels it important and urgent to request our Organization to establish an international authority capable of assuming effective control over the exploration and exploitation of the resources of the high seas for the benefit of all.\n321.\tAs regards the establishment of a new international economic order, which is a matter of prime concern to us today, the Central African Republic considers that the food problem must be given the greatest attention. In our view it is urgent to increase the volume of food aid to the developing countries, and particularly to those which are subject to floods and droughts. The specific needs of each country must be taken into account.\n322.\tIn order to achieve these objectives the developed countries should considerably increase the\n399\nvolume of their assistance to the developing countries in the field of agriculture and food production.\n323.\tThey must facilitate, without reservation, access to their markets of agricultural products, especially food, coming from the developing countries in the form of either processed or unprocessed goods.\n324.\tThey must also undertake all other necessary measures of adjustment.\n325.\tThose are the economic views of my delegation which we wanted to submit for the Assembly's consideration.\n326.\tOn the social level, is it still necessary to reiterate before this Assembly the manifold and severe problems facing the third world in this sector? It is my duty to do so as long as more effective methods and strategies have not been developed for the radical elimination of hunger, early mortality, unemployment, illiteracy and the other scourges which afflict the developing countries.\n327.\tIn this respect, my country pins its hopes on the objectives of the seventh special session, which has just concluded its work. If I revert again to the new international economic order it is because of the very close correlation between economic and social problems, the latter being nothing more than the fortunate or unfortunate consequences of solutions applied to the former.\n328.\tAnachronistic commercial and industrial systems, together with inherited methods of cultivation, are responsible for the poverty of millions of human beings.\n329.\tThe United Nations cannot remain indifferent to such realities. That is why it must do all it can to encourage the highly industrialized countries, those which possess advanced modern technology, to share their secrets and place their scientific expertise at the disposal, at little cost, of the underprivileged countries for the sake of a better future for all mankind.\n330.\tAs I have said, my country is also suffering from the effects of natural phenomena which hinder our constant efforts to improve our people's standard of living. 1 refer to climatic influences. In this regard, it is my painful duty to report to the Assembly the consequences of the floods which beset Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, in the second half of August 1975. In addition to two deaths, hundreds were injured, and some 13,000 people were rendered homeless.\n331.\tThese natural disasters which our people must face every year are not conducive to the improvement of their social well-being. Thus we appeal to all friendly countries to help us find lasting solutions to this problem.\n332\tMay I now be allowed to draw up the balance sheet of measures taken for the emancipation of women by our Government under the enlightened guidance of Mr. Jean-Bedel Bokassa.\n333\tWe are very happy and proud to have a woman as Prime Minister and Vice-President of our only political party, MESAN, as well as three other women holding ministerial posts in our present Government.\n334\tWith regard to employment, the only requirements for access to the highest posts are professional\nqualifications and efficiency, and of course both sexes are assured of equality of pay and opportunity. Thus it is that countless women occupy responsible positions in the public sector: education, the legal profession, customs, health, the labor inspectorate, social security, finance, law enforcement, and so forth.\n335.\tThus, discrimination on grounds of sex is nonexistent in the Central African Republic.\n336.\tEverything has been done to allow our women to take their full responsibility as workers. We have many centers for the care of mothers and children where nutritional education for the mother supplements the medical care provided for the child. A very elaborate system of pre-school education is available to children from three to six years of age, thus freeing the mother to pursue remunerative economic activities, whether in handicrafts or agriculture. Special training schools and community development agents place their experience at the service of the population to help raise their standard of living.\n337.\tInasmuch as our Program of activities in this field must be expanded to cover the entire country, we urgently solicit the technical and financial assistance of such United Nations specialized agencies as the International Labor Organisation, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Development Program, and the United Nations International Children's Fund.\n338.\tMy delegation deeply appreciates the results of the first World Conference of the International Women's Year, and fully supports the Economic and Social Council resolution 1959 (LIX) concerning the World Conference of the International Women's Year, which will shortly be submitted to this Assembly for approval. In this spirit we shall support all efforts to proclaim the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality, Development and Peace in order to strengthen and implement the recommendations and resolutions adopted at Mexico City.\n339.\tSimilarly, we consider it most desirable that a substantial special fund be provided for the speedy implementation of the objectives of the Program of the World Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Women's Year,  adopted in June of this year in Mexico.\n340.\tFinally, in order to make possible a periodic evaluation of the situation of women in the world, the General Assembly at this thirtieth session should decide to hold in 1980 the second World Conference of the International Women's Year.\n341.\tIn the second half of the twentieth century our planet has so excelled in inventing and constructing an awesome panoply of deadly weapons that the search for conditions conducive to detente and durable peace is now the constant concern of the United Nations.\n342.\tThe discussions regarding the grave question of disarmament and security are of interest to the entire international community because in the present situation an armed conflagration would have deadly and unimaginable consequences.\n343.\tIt is also fitting to stress that those involved in the negotiations to settle the question of disarmament and of the reduction of tactical and strategic weapons are marking time, because the Powers directly concerned are making insufficient efforts in obedience to their desire to maintain so-called zones of influence which they arrogated to themselves at Yalta.\n344.\tThe past decade has been particularly encouraging with regard to decolonization. In the course of it the United Nations has welcomed into its midst a considerable number of countries which were formerly maintained in a state of degrading and abject dependence degrading both to the peoples concerned and to their colonizers themselves.\n345.\tMy delegation is firmly convinced that the desperate situation of our brothers of southern Africa will inevitably result in solutions in which the respect and the dignity of man can prevail. The efforts already undertaken in this direction deserve all support and encouragement.\n346.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly, which dealt with the question of raw materials, and the seventh special session, held a month ago to discuss the important question of international cooperation, have defined the objectives of the creation of a new more just and more humane world economic order.\n347.\tDuring the next decade our Organization, one of whose basic objectives is development, will have an important part to play in giving practical and operational effect to the objectives defined at the two historic and important sessions held in 1974 and 1975.\n348.\tThe geographical and structural obstacles to be met with in certain developing States and their socio-political circumstances in many cases constitute hurdles which Governments will have to overcome in their efforts to meet the obligations inherent in the implementation of their development Programs.\n349.\tThe press exercises a very pronounced influence on public opinion in the developed countries, and it is often said that it represents a fourth world Power.\n350.\tMy delegation therefore wishes to make an urgent appeal to the conscience of mankind to make of the press an objective channel through which may flow a current of opinion favorable to the promotion of development and co-operation.\n351.\tFinally, the burning question of disarmament and security, the difficulties caused by racial discrimination and by the implementation of the Articles of the Charter relating to the countries still under foreign domination, the energy crisis, the monetary disorders, galloping inflation and the deterioration in the terms of exchange all constitute a set of equally important problems which our Organization must tackle in a spirit of consultation, realism and perspicacity.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to renew my congratulations to our President on his election to his high office. At the same time I wish to express my satisfaction at the thoughtful work of the Secretary-General. I sincerely wish both gentlemen success in their responsible functions.\n213.\tThe thirtieth session of the General Assembly is marked by notable changes in international relations. The idea of peaceful coexistence among States having different social systems has gained ground in the past year. International agreements and pledges make this idea both powerful and binding, and this fills the peoples of the world with relief and lets them look hopefully to the future.\n214.\tIn the thirtieth year since the victory over fascism, we are also celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Both jubilees are strong incentives to us further to strengthen international security. By fighting and shedding their blood, the peoples of the world have gained the right to live in security and peace. To establish a world without war has been the guiding principle of the United Nations.\n215.\tIt is on record that this is also the supreme purpose of socialist foreign policy. On the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of its liberation from Nazism, the Government of the German Democratic Republic reaffirmed its dedication to the legacy of the victims of fascism, pledging to do everything not only to preserve, but also to promote, what was so hard to achieve.\n216.\tOf course, we still have a long way to go until war is eliminated from the life of mankind forever. We have no illusion about that. But experience teaches. When all people interested in peace unite in firm and persistent action, the opponents of detente will find it more and more difficult to encroach upon the vital interests of the peoples. And the United Nations can effectively contribute to achieving our aim. This, we believe, is the very purpose of the Charter of the United Nations.\n217.\tTwo events have convincingly demonstrated that political detente is growing in international relations. In Indo-China, the war came to an end, and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe came to a successful conclusion. Both events are having a beneficial effect on world politics.\n218.\tWaging a long struggle and making heavy sacrifices, the people of Viet Nam defended their right to social and national self-determination and gained victory over foreign intervention. The States of the socialist community always have firmly stood on the side of the people of Viet Nam, and so have the anti-imperialist forces and all those who cherish justice and peace. The brave people of Viet Nam have a moral and legal right to be immediately represented in the United Nations on an equal footing. We object to any blocking of the admission of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam to membership, whatever the excuses may be. The German Democratic Republic expects the Security Council to consider again and approve the applications of both States for membership, in accordance with the resolution adopted on 19 September [resolution 3366 (XXX)]. Who could seriously dispute the right of these two States to membership in the United Nations? And by admitting these States, would the United Nations not be reinforcing its peacekeeping mission and encouraging co-operation among peoples?\n219.\tIn Europe, after a long period of dangerous confrontation and cold war, a historic change has occurred. The peoples of the continent and of the world expected much from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. They have not been disappointed. A solid basis has been created for the relations among States of the European continent. The frontiers and sovereignty of the States are respected and the principles of peaceful coexistence have been recognized as the standard of behavior in the mutual relationships of States having contrary social systems.\n220.\tThe Government of the German Democratic Republic made every endeavor, together with the Governments of the USSR and the other socialist States, to ensure the success of the Conference, and it did so in accordance with its socialist Constitution.\n221.\tWith the adoption of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference, a significant step was taken towards the establishment of a regional security system, in the interest of securing universal peace in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations. \u2022\n222.\tOf far-reaching importance, especially, are the 10 principles guiding relations among States and constituting a \\\"code for the application of the principles of peaceful coexistence among States with different\n166\nsocial systems\\\", in the words of Mr. Erich Honecker at the Conference on 30 July 1975.\n223.\tIn view of the lessons of history in Europe, where two devastating world wars started, let me emphasize the principle of the inviolability of frontiers. \u2022 It is not only significant for the peoples of the European continent, but also relevant to stable relations among States in general.\n224.\tIf it is asked why the Conference proceeded and ended successfully, the answer is that there were, above all, both a willingness and a commitment to proceed from the principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all European States. Reason and realism prevailed over dangerous illusion.\n225.\tThe representatives of the 35 States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, in affixing their signatures to its Final Act, collectively committed themselves to abide by the international legal principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. That commitment is to be strengthened. Events in Portugal make it imperative to insist strongly on that principle. All attempts to hinder the Portuguese people in solving their problems on their own favor both Fascist and other reactionary forces.\n226.\tWe have noted with interest the appraisal of the results of the Helsinki Conference which the Secretary-General made in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization. We concur in the conclusion that the United Nations, relying thereon, should extend the process of detente to other continents. The fruits of European detente must benefit all peoples.\n227.\tTo make detente irreversible, it must be extended and be given material content. In the view of the German Democratic Republic, arms limitation md disarmament are of priority importance. The\nrms race is more and more clearly in conflict with\ntie development of prosperous relations among States. Today a majority of States recognize arms limitation and disarmament as the central and most topical task. The view of the socialist States that political detente urgently needs to be complemented in the military area is meeting with broad approval. Here we envisage measures to reduce military confrontation as well as a step-by-step reduction and elimination of means of warfare.\n228.\tMany things have been achieved on which to build. Large areas of the globe and outer space are free of nuclear weapons. The development, production and use of bacteriological weapons have been outlawed. Nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere have been much reduced. There would be none of them any more if the People's Republic of China would also stop tests of this kind immediately. Among the agreements concluded, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons deserves special emphasis. To secure its universal application, the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty in its Final Declaration [see AIC.111068, annex. I] appealed to States still hesitant to adhere to it. This would undoubtedly add considerably to its effectiveness. Therefore, we welcome the call by the Conference to co-operate in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in compliance with obligations under the Treaty. This refers especially to States exporting material and equipment to countries which are not parties to the Treaty.\n229.\tWe count the agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States on the limitation of strategic armaments and the prevention of nuclear war as measures conducive to a further checking of the arms race. These agreements set hopeful signs. Nu-clear arms limitation and disarmament require, however, the participation of all Powers possessing nuclear weapons. The German Democratic Republic strongly advocates the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests by all States everywhere. For this reason we welcome the latest proposal of the Soviet Union relating to the conclusion of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests. That is the logical and most timely move in order to bring to a good end the undertaking initiated with the Moscow Treaty of 1963 and followed up by the Soviet- United States Treaty of 3 July 1974. No measure would at present be more appropriate to check the nuclear arms race.\n230.\tWe are confident that the Soviet initiative will be supported by the General Assembly all the more so as it is a response to what a majority of Member States have been demanding for years. The Declaration of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held in May this year, reads, inter alia, \\\"The Conference expresses the view that the conclusion of a treaty banning all nuclear weapon tests is one of the most important measures to halt the nuclear arms race.\\\" [Ibid.]\n231.\tEqually important is the proposal of the Soviet Government to place the question of prohibiting the development and production of new types of means of mass destruction and of new weapons systems of that kind on the agenda of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly, We value the draft agreement submitted to this forum as a basis acceptable to all and appropriate for a just and durable solution of this problem. The adoption of the proposals made by the Soviet Union would moreover give great momentum to the process of arms limitation and disarmament as a whole. It is precisely this that can give material content to political detente.\n232.\tIn addition to global arms limitation and disarmament measures, relevant regional agreements can promote military detente as well. For this reason we have taken a vital interest in the current negotiations on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. In conjunction with the Soviet Union and the other socialist States, the German Democratic Republic is striving to achieve effective reductions. The principle of undiminished security of all States concerned is naturally important for mutually acceptable results.\n233.\tThe German Democratic Republic urges the convening of a world disarmament conference and recorded this position in a statement on 29 April 1975. It would be timely to take practical steps for convening the conference. Should the Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference not immediately be given instructions to this effect?\n234.\tWe appreciate the fact that the Soviet Union and the United States have presented to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament identical drafts of a convention on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques [AII0027, annex II, documents CCD/471 and CCD/472] which are incompatible with the maintenance of international security, human well-being and health. The next session of the Geneva Committee on Disarmament could consider these drafts.\n235.\tThe delegation of the German Democratic Republic hopes that this session of the General Assembly will give vigorous impetus to arms limitation and disarmament.\n236.\tThe German Democratic Republic wishes to see implemented the resolution on the non-use of force in international relations and on the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)], adopted at the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly. It would be for the Security Council to take a binding decision on this question. Thus, world-wide peaceful co-operation and security would surely be strengthened. In this context, I wish to emphasize the 1970 Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. Particularly in the thirtieth year since the end of the Second World War, this thirtieth session, a jubilee session, ought to draw the requisite conclusions.\n237.\tIn the past 10 years the role of the United Nations has grown visible to all. The Charter of the United Nations has proved to be a solid basis for the struggle against aggression and national suppression and for the equal co-operation of States in all spheres. The principle of unanimity of the permanent members of the Security Council has also proved to be good. In this way it is possible to co-operate more trustfully in strengthening peace and averting nuclear war. Does this not meet the interests of all peoples?\n238.\tThe opportunities for implementing the purposes and principles of the Charter in spirit and letter are growing. Evidence of this is, for instance, provided by the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)], and other docu-. ments. Therefore, there is absolutely no need for questioning the Charter of the United Nations.\n239.\tThe German Democratic Republic supports the demand of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea that the question of Korea be solved peacefully, without external interference. This would be instrumental in strengthening peace and security in Asia. The German Democratic Republic is a sponsor of the draft resolution with regard to the creation of favorable conditions for converting the armistice into a durable peace in Korea and accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. The dissolution of the United Nations Command, the withdrawal of all the foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations and the other tasks contained in the draft resolution are indispensable requirements of topical importance.\n240.\tThe situation in the Middle East still endangers international security. The German Democratic Republic is in favor of a political settlement of this problem. This requires: Israel's full withdrawal, in accordance with United Nations resolutions, from the territories occupied since 1967; ensuring the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including the right to establish a State of its own; and guarantees for the security of all States and peoples of the region.\n241.\tPartial steps and this is shown by the present situation cannot replace the necessary general solution to this problem. Given realism and good will on the part of all parties, we believe the continuation of the Geneva Middle East Peace Conference to be the most promising way. Participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization is a matter of course, the more so as it has already been recognized in the United Nations as the sole legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine.\n242.\tSo far as the just settlement of the Cyprus question is concerned, we think that the Security Council and the General Assembly, in adopting relevant resolutions, have provided a realistic and hence constructive basis.\n243.\tAlso from this rostrum we categorically demand the restoration of human rights in Chile and the release of the Communist Luis Corvalan, and of the other Chilean patriots subjected to maltreatment in prisons and concentration camps of the junta. The Fascist military junta, which is persisting in its terrorism against the Chilean people and which refused to grant entry to the ad hoc working group of the Commission on Human Rights, must no longer disregard the resolutions adopted at the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly relating to Chile.\n244.\tFifteen years ago, following an initiative of the Soviet Union and relying on its Charter, the United Nations adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. That ushered in the final stage of the struggle for the political independence of the peoples under colonialist suppression.\n245.\tThe German Democratic Republic has at all times stood on the side of the national liberation movements of peoples. It will continue to support them in their efforts aimed at eliminating the last vestiges of colonial and racist domination.\n246.\tFlagrantly defying the clear will of the United Nations, the racist regime of Pretoria, a bastion of defense for colonialism in southern Africa, is still repressing and terrorizing the majority of the people. It is maintaining its illegal rule in Namibia. It is high time for Security Council resolution 366 (1974) of 17 December 1974 to be implemented. Moreover, the German Democratic Republic supports the decisions of the Kampala Conference of the Organization of African Unity, demanding a total arms embargo and economic sanctions on, and the breaking off of all relations with, the Vorster regime. We concur with all those who consider the continuation and expansion of the economic and military co-operation of some States with South Africa to be support for that regime. To stop such co-operation is prerequisite for a settlement of the question of South Africa in keeping with the rights of peoples to self-determination.\n247.\tOur sympathy and solidarity are with the people of Zimbabwe in its just struggle against the Smith regime. The sanctions adopted by the Security Council against the racist rulers of Rhodesia are to be strictly observed.\n248.\tUnder the blows of the national liberation movement, and in the wake of the democratic changes in Portugal, the last colonial empire collapsed. With great joy we greet and congratulate the delegations of the People's Republic of Mozambique and of the Republic of Cape Verde as representatives of their countries, which gained independence with heavy sacrifices, and of their peoples, with whom the German Democratic Republic has long had links of solidarity. An equally warm welcome do we extend to the representatives of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. We are looking forward with the utmost sympathy to Angola celebrating its independence in November and taking its place in the United Nations as a sovereign State.\n249.\tThe current situation, however, causes us concern. Reactionary forces, backed from abroad, are out to destroy the gains of the liberation struggle, to plunge the country into a fratricidal war and to violate its territorial integrity. They want the country to remain open to the neo-colonialist influence of transnational corporations. But the people of Angola must not be deprived of the fruits of its liberation struggle, for which it made great sacrifices.\n250.\tPolitical liberation from the colonial yoke is a great achievement. It contributes to equal co-operation among all peoples on the basis of the right to self-determination and of respect for the sovereignty of States. At the same time, these young sovereign States are facing the need to abolish the colonial structures of their national economies and of their international economic relations. We support the just demands they raised at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly to come to a new international economic order.\n251.\tAspirations for international peace and security are mobilizing ever broader sections of people. It is particularly striking how the role of women is growing in this struggle. The World Conference of the International Women's Year held in Mexico is an outstanding example. The results of that Conference impressively demonstrate the interdependence of peace and social progress on an international scale.\n252.\tBecause of its intensive work, the Conference in Mexico has created a solid basis for deliberations at this session of the General Assembly. This permits the discussion of the multifaceted problems of the struggle for the full implementation of equal rights for women and the achievement of adequate results.\n253.\tIn October, the German Democratic Republic will host the World Congress of Women. The International Preparatory Committee is expecting over 2,000 delegates. The people and Government of the German Democratic Republic are anxious to provide every facility and to make all the arrangements for this event, along the lines of the resolutions adopted in Mexico.\n254.\tPreparations are under way in our State for the Ninth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the leading party in our country. All of our people are making great efforts for high accomplishments in industry and agriculture, science and tech-nology, education and culture. For this socialist construction work we need peace. Addressing the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Erich Honecker, said: \\\"All major problems that strained relations between States in the post-war period have now been solved.\\\"\n255.\tThis also applies to the so-called German question. That question has been solved by the development of two German States independent of each other and with contrary social systems. The people of the German Democratic Republic has exercised its sovereign right of deciding upon its own social order and has irrevocably chosen socialism. Anybody who denies this historical truth will endanger the peace and security of the peoples.\n256.\tThe people of the German Democratic Republic knows that the other peoples also are profoundly interested in mutually beneficial relations between States and, consequently, in maintaining and strengthening peace.\n257.\tYou may always be assured of our co-operation whenever it comes to the contribution of the United Nations to the strengthening of peace, to disarmament and co-operation of peoples for mutual benefit.\n"

You bring to that high office an outstanding record of dedicated work in the service of your country and for the cause of amity and understanding among nations. We pledge our whole-hearted co-operation to you in the fulfillment of your great task.\n2.\tI wish also to express our appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, for his outstanding leadership in the work of the General Assembly's twenty-ninth session and the seventh special session, which followed it.\n3.\tThis is the thirtieth anniversary session of the General Assembly. During those 30 years the world has witnessed revolutionary political, social and economic changes. Old issues have receded into the background and new problems have staked their claims for priority. The so-called cold war, which characterized a bipolar world of two super-Powers, is giving way to a multi-polar world whose main feature is the self-assertion of the greater part of humanity, whose voice had been stifled by colonialism and imperialism. The political emancipation of the latter world is now leading its peoples to striye for the social and economic emancipation that alone can ensure true freedom.\n4.\tThe United Nations reflects this change. The third- world countries now constitute an absolute majority of its membership. This fact calls for a new sense of direction, and a new perception of realities which those used to the old ways find somewhat difficult to accept.\n5.\tAt this session we welcome three new Member States Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe into the United Nations. We also look forward to welcoming another new Member, the one hundred and forty-second, Papua New Guinea.\n6.\tFor small developing countries such as Bangladesh the United Nations provides not only the best, but the only, forum for making their voices heard. Therefore Bangladesh has from its very inception as a sovereign, independent nation pledged its total allegiance to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We support all measures which strengthen the United Nations. Our nation owes a special debt of gratitude to the United Nations system, as well as to friendly countries, for providing invaluable help in our national effort to meet the challenge posed to our country in the aftermath of the destruction and dislocation that accompanied our emergence as a sovereign nation, and the successive natural disasters that followed it,\n7.\tWe are convinced that only within an environment of peace can our people reap the fruits of independence and exert their utmost effort to meet the challenge of poverty and ignorance. We have, therefore, pursued a policy of non-alignment based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, and have sought to promote friendship with all countries. We have developed, and earnestly seek, friendly and mutually beneficial relations with all our neighbors, the countries in our region and, indeed, all countries of the world irrespective of their economic, social and political systems. We have identified ourselves with the hopes and aspirations of the countries of the third world and have actively participated in the deliberations of conferences held by the Islamic, non-aligned and Commonwealth States.\n8.\tOur policies and attitude towards current international issues derive directly from our search for peace and stability. Despite the comforting assertion that the greater the production of weapons of war the smaller the chance of these weapons ever being used, the logical denouement of an untrammeled arms race is war. And war in the nuclear age is annihilation. Even without a war, an arms race is an unconscionable waste of resources that are finite and at this time wholly inadequate even to deal with the problems of hunger, disease and ignorance afflicting far too large a proportion of the human family.\n9.\tBangladesh stands for disarmament: effective and total disarmament; nuclear as well as conventional disarmament.\n10.\tWe want disarmament because we want to see the world freed from the scourge of war. No covenant can guarantee peace more effectively than disarmament. And we want disarmament for a selfish reason too: namely, to get a part of the resources that could then be transferred from sterile expenditure on armaments to the life-sustaining production of food. This would also serve the goal of the international community to build a new international economic order that would guarantee a more equitable and therefore more peaceful world.\n363\tA/PV.2371\u2003\n11.\tIn this context, we welcome the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [S/ILI]. However, may I be permitted to voice the disquiet of a non-nuclear country by pointing out that the mere limitation of nuclear weapons, although a step in the right direction, is a far cry from nuclear disarmament. Of what use is limitation or, t<) be hopeful, even reduction of the number of weapons when those which remain are made more sophisticated in their variety, accuracy and striking power, with the result that aggregate destructive capability becomes even greater than it would have been without the limitation or reduction? What the world is really waiting for is a world without nuclear weapons, whether strategic, tactical or other.\n12.\tBangladesh regards the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] as a positive measure to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in the context of an accelerating world-wide spread of nuclear technology and materials.\n13.\tThere are, however, two vital issues that arise in this connexion. Non-proliferation was never meant to divide the world permanently into nuclear and non- nuclear nations. While those nations with nuclear capability, either actual or potential, abjured their right to acquire the know-how to \\\"go nuclear\\\", those nations which already have nuclear weapons solemnly undertook to negotiate in good faith not only to limit and reduce those weapons, but to get rid of their entire nuclear stockpile, not in some distant mythical future but in the immediate foreseeable future. Common sense tells us that the longer the delay in bringing about total nuclear disarmament, the smaller is the chance to prevent proliferation.\n14.\tThere is also a need to clarify the issue of nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. Granted that the peaceful uses of nuclear energy are technically feasible, some ways must be found to permit peaceful nuclear explosions under suitable safeguards.\n15.\tThe Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, signed at Moscow in 1963 left underground tests outside its scope. Understandably, underground tests have been carried out vigorously to make the nuclear weapons more destructive. We are naturally in favor of extending the ban to underground tests of nuclear weapons.\n16.\tIt is hardly necessary for me to stress that my country opposes all forms of chemical, bacteriological, environmental or geophysical warfare.\n17.\tThe initiative for the creation of zones of peace in different parts of the world has gained momentum in recent years. We welcome this trend and believe that it provides a framework within which the threat posed by thermonuclear weapons can be reduced and eventually eliminated. So that such measures may succeed, proposals for the creation of peace zones should be preceded by thorough consultations among the regional countries and must be based on their cooperation and consent. I reaffirm my country's support for making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace.\n18.\tThe most straightforward way to deal with the problem of ensuring the security of non-nuclear- weapon countries is to have the nuclear-weapon countries pledge themselves not to use those weapons against them. In the absence of such formal assurance the idea has been advanced of creating nuclear- weapon-free zones, or nuclear-free zones in the manner of the 1967 Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco),1 under which 20, but not all, Latin American countries have accepted the ban on the production, testing, receipt or stationing of nuclear weapons. We support these moves in principle, although we think that there is an important pre-condition to make them operative: there should be detailed consultation with, and a clear consensus among, the countries in the region participating in the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones.\n19.\tWe have consistently supported all attempts to achieve a just and lasting settlement in the Middle East. We continue firmly to believe that such a settlement must be based on a complete Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab lands, including Jerusalem, and the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right of self-determination, including their right to the establishment of an independent, sovereign State of their own.\n20.\tIn Cyprus, we have supported all initiatives aimed at an amicable settlement of the outstanding problems. We firmly believe that no solution of the problem of Cyprus can be lasting which does not take into account the legitimate aspirations of the Turkish and Greek communities of Cyprus. We want to see Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities live in safety, dignity and honor.\n21.\tWe believe that the people of Korea should be allowed to pursue the objective of peaceful reunification of their divided country free from outside interference.\n22.\tWe are of the opinion that the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam should join us in the United Nations at the earliest opportunity. The inspiring 30-year old struggle for freedom and peace that the people of Viet Nam have waged make them pre-eminently worthy of membership in an organization designed to promote freedom and peace in the world.\n23.\tWe rejoice that the process of decolonization has proceeded rapidly since the end of the Second World War. Portugal's African empire no longer exists. The last of its territory Angola is about to attain its independence. We are saddened by the conflict among the freedom fighters there and we fervently hope that they will resolve their differences at the earliest possible opportunity, without, of course, outside interference.\n24.\tHowever, the process of decolonization is by no means complete. This becomes evident when one looks at the southern part of the African continent. What may be regarded as a classical form of colonialism is compounded by an obnoxious racism that should have been buried under the debris of the Second World War.\n25.\tWe fully support the people of Namibia in their struggle to shake off illegal South African domination as well as the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe to establish majority rule. The struggle of those peoples is intimately linked with that of the non-white inhabitants of South Africa, the majority of the population, to put an end to the regime of infinite brutality and oppression imposed on them by a minority.\n26.\tWith Mozambique as a sovereign country, Angola on the way to becoming one and Namibia, under the law, a ward of the United Nations, South Africa has no realistic option but to accept coexistence with the black nations surrounding it. But is the white minority regime willing to terminate its abominable system of apartheid and really move towards sharing wealth and power with the non-white majority instead of resorting to political maneuvers? To my mind, it is no longer possible to flout fundamental human rights and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n27.\tThe Government in Pretoria seems to have seen the writing on the wall. Much praise has been showered on the so-called \\\"change of heart\\\" in Pretoria. But is one sure that Pretoria's conciliatory moves are not tactical maneuvers to postpone the day of reckoning? We need to be watchful.\n28.\tGone are the days when economic issues were regarded as matters to be handled by economic experts only. Economics has now become politics. It is Foreign Ministers, and sometimes even Heads of States, who with increasing frequency meet to discuss bilateral or international economic issues. Just as individual States are learning that they have increasingly to take political decisions to intervene and, if necessary, intervene massively to make their economies grow, the international community is learning that political decisions must be made to spare the peoples of the world or, at least, the greater part of them from the ill effects of a system which not only splits the world community into a minority of rich and a majority of poor but makes the gap between them grow ever wider.\n29.\tAs we see it, the new international economic order that we envisage will have little meaning unless it bridges this gap between the minority of the rich and the majority of the poor. We welcome negotiations foreseen in the decisions of the seventh special session for devising ways and means for a larger transfer of capital and technology from the developed to the less developed countries. Such transfers will fail in their fundamental purpose if they do not help the developing countries, not just to advance, but to catch up with the developed world.\n30.\tWhile negotiating for such a large transfer of resources must necessarily mean that developed countries voluntarily accept a slower rate of growth for themselves, the developing countries cannot absolve themselves of the responsibility of setting their own houses in order so that the growth benefits their dispossessed majority instead of making their rich richer. Indeed, the developing countries cannot demand the restructuring of the international economic order without restructuring their own socio-economic order. A determination to stand on one's own feet and carry out internal reforms is the necessary condition for making the desired new international order feasible.\n31.\tA sense of collective self-reliance and mutual aid among the developing countries of a region sharing a common destiny needs to be promoted. Conscious of these imperatives, the Government of the People s Republic of Bangladesh is in the process of drawing up a development plan designed to achieve agricultural self-sufficiency and a better utilization of existing\n965\nindustrial capacity. It has also launched a comprehensive program of action to control population growth, to improve administrative efficiency, and generally to create a framework conducive to economic development. While striving for self-reliance, we welcome foreign capital and technology to help us build a solid economic infrastructure that will guarantee sustained growth.\n32.\tAfter peace, no issue is more essential for the purposes and principles of the United Nations than human rights. Indeed, no issue has so preoccupied the United Nations in so many ways than human rights. To provide equal opportunities to all is a fundamental concept of human rights, and to emphasize it 1975 has been designated as International Women's Year. This was highlighted by the recent World Conference of the International Women's Year, held at Mexico City. The World Plan of Action and the series of resolutions appended to it should be studied and implemented.\n33.\tIt has been said, and rightly so, that legislation alone cannot eliminate the practices, traditions, and even laws which perpetuate discrimination of one sort or another. What is required is education, a change of attitude above all on the part of public opinion. But the United Nations has no option other than to ask all Member States to make full use of the legislative weapon in combating discrimination of no matter what kind racial, religious, class, sex and at no matter at what level of the body politic it may be found social, economic, or political.\n34.\tIt is indeed a paradox that one spin-off of scientific, technological progress should have adverse effects on human rights. Among several new problems in this category, I may mention the encroachment on the right to privacy by means of electronic eavesdropping. The all-pervasive destructiveness of modern weapons must also be regarded as a violation of the right to life itself.\n35.\tThe issues confronting the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea are of great complexity and wide ramifications. The purpose of the Conference is to create an international legal framework to permit the exploitation of the vast living and non-living resources of the sea for the benefit of all nations, and certainly not simply for the benefit of the handful of countries having the wherewithal to exploit those resources. It is gratifying that the differences among the conferees have narrowed, especially in the two strenuous negotiating sessions held at Caracas in 1974 and in Geneva last spring. Developed and developing countries alike appear to be moving towards the acceptance of coastal States' sovereign rights over natural resources envisaged in the concept of the exclusive economic zone. There is a general consensus supporting such broad zones of resource jurisdiction extending up to 200 miles. While agreement in principle has been reached to establish an international sea-bed authority, differences still exist with regard to its scope and details of its powers. The heart of the problem is whether we can create a truly universal ocean regime to exploit judiciously the underwater wealth of our planet in the collective interest of mankind, and particularly for the developing world. Such a distribution of ocean resources would be commensurate with the creation of the new international economic order which is the goal of us all.\n36.\tWe believe that there can be a widely acceptable treaty on the law of the sea and that most countries desire this objective. The framework, issues and alternatives have been collected and collated; potential accommodations are also discernible. What is now necessary is the will to negotiate on the substantive issues. The forthcoming session in New York next year is a crucial one for progressing from bargaining positions to concrete solutions. Failure can lead only to unilateral action, to the detriment of all mankind. I hope you will appreciate the seriousness of the position that is posed if no international legal framework on the law of the sea can be achieved within the shortest possible time.\n37.\tOuter space, the use of which has been opened up in the recent past by breathtaking scientific and technological advances, came under the scrutiny of the international community rather negatively, as a ban was placed on its use for non-peaceful purposes. But its potential for peaceful uses needs to be exploited for the benefit of mankind.\n38.\tTwo revolutionary space technologies, both developed by the United States, currently preoccupy the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. One is remote sensing by satellite of enormous beneficial potential in prospecting for mineral re-sources and gathering intelligence pertaining to agriculture, resources near the surface of the sea, and so on. Two experimental satellites have already given spectacular proof of their usefulness. The other major new technology is direct-broadcasting satellites. Experimental international broadcasting is already taking place, as, for instance, by the United States satellite ATS-6, beaming educational programs to community receivers below.\n39.\tBoth these technologies have complex legal implications. Could remote sensing by satellite take place against the wishes of a given country, or could a satellite broadcasting directly to home receivers be used for purposes deemed unfriendly or hostile by the receiving country? On behalf of Bangladesh, which could gain immensely from these technologies in locating and developing new economic resources and in dealing with such problems as illiteracy, I express the hope that international conventions can be worked out to meet legitimate objections and thus open wide the doors of economic and cultural progress.\n40.\tI come, finally, to the question of reforming the Charter of the United Nations. Undoubtedly, in the 30 years of its existence the United Nations has revealed certain lacunae. We support the idea of consultation among Member States as to how to remove these deficiencies. But in view of the staggering expansion of the role of the United Nations in all fields of human endeavor, our principal preoccupation should be to try to implement more effectively, through an international co-operative effort, the decisions and programs of the United Nations, rather than to revise the Charter. This is especially so because, although the passage of time has revealed some defects, the United Nations has rendered and is rendering immense services to meet the problems facing the world. Moreover, the failures, when they have occurred, have been due more to the national egoism of Member States than to any structural defects in the Charter itself.\n41.\tIn conclusion, I should like to express, on behalf of the people of Bangladesh, the hope that out of the deliberations at this thirtieth session will emerge better prospects for peace and progress for the peoples of the world.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "139.\t  The general debate, which is drawing to a close, will be highly illuminating for our Organization. The analyses made by many heads of delegation on the international situation, and the proposals which eminent personalities have put forward on how to settle certain problems of concern to our Organization contain, in our view, interesting elements. The delegation of the People's Republic of the Congo wishes to speak now not with any claim that it is contributing anything new to our common deliberations; we come here, rather, to make clear or to reaffirm some of our positions on topical issues at a particularly dangerous time in our history, when a certain element of confusion has been willfully sown among us with the idea of encouraging the peoples of the world to doubt themselves.\n140.\tIn the People's Republic of the Congo, we have every confidence in the United Nations, and it is precisely because we have placed in it not only our confidence but also our hope that we feel in duty bound, whenever it seems necessary to us, to say, even forcefully, what we believe or know to be just.\n141.\tI would only remind you of the positions which we have taken here on, for example, the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China and the admission of the German Democratic Republic as a full-fledged State Member of our Organization. At the time, we were called as were a very small number of fraternal countries of the third world  dreamers, trouble-makers and even political illiterates. Today, history, which has always been the only reliable judge of truth, has vindicated us. That is why we say that whenever a country comes freely to address this Assembly, it makes its modest contribution to the search for solution to the ills which gnaw at the vitals of mankind.\n142.\tAnd so it is entirely without pretension that we should like to remind you that the peoples of the third world that is, the peoples of Asia, Latin America and Africa are mature and comprehensively reject exploitation and neo-colonialism in any form. Therefore, we, the countries of the third world, must look inwards and ponder the fundamental interests of the vast masses we represent. We must, on the basis of our own analyses, gain a clear insight into the problems of the world if we want to find solutions for them.\n143.\tWe should no longer allow ourselves to be taken in by specious, harmful assertions designed simply to mislead us and to keep us in ignorance so that we may the better be exploited. For us, there is no such thing as an evil people. There are imperialist, Fascist, colonialist, racist and exploiting regimes; and it is these regimes, of which there are still so many today, that we must fight.\n144.\tOnly yesterday we were told that we must not go to Moscow or to Peking because there was a monster in those places called communism. Today, most countries co-operate with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China, and no one has been asked, as far as we know, to become Red although becoming Red is the indispensable choice of tomorrow; it is the only choice which electively and genuinely places power in the hands ot the people. The Congo, for its part, has in all freedom and conscience chosen to become Red, under the leadership of the Congolese Labor Party and its President, Commander Marien Ngouabi. This choice explains,\nas was solemnly reaffirmed by our President, two months ago in Kampala, that all our positions have been dictated exclusively by the fundamental principles of our policy, the background to which is proletarian internationalism and the anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist and anti-neo-colonialist struggle. This choice places us among the supporters of all just causes, the triumph of which is nothing but a matter of time now, as recently demonstrated by the smashing victories of the heroic Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples over imperialism victories which are a great spur to those who are still fighting.\n145.\tAfter five years of absence, during which the puppets of the Lon No clique had never represented Kampuchea except in their imaginations, the people of Kampuchea has just resumed its usurped seat. The important speech made on behalf of-that people by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Chairman of the United National Front of Kampuchea [2376th meeting], constitutes an important contribution to the work of this session.\n146.\tUnfortunately, there are still States which, in spite of the political and crushing military defeats sustained in various places, continue to swim against the current of history and today wish to prevent the Vietnamese people from working here among us for the strengthening and consolidation of international peace and security, which are, and remain, the primary objectives of our Organization. There is no doubt that, here again, the adepts of the policy of anachronism will suffer new defeats.\n147.\tWe remain similarly convinced that the just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their country, free from all foreign interference particularly after the withdrawal of the American troops stationed there under the banner of the United Nations will triumph. I hope that the Korean people will understand this as an expression of the determined support of the Congolese people.\n148.\tThe People's Republic of the Congo similarly supports the Palestinian people in their relentless liberation struggle against imperialism and Zionism. The Palestinian cause is just, and in the Congo we are totally committed to it. This is a commitment which should be shared by all those who, here or elsewhere, speak of peace, justice and liberty. A people has been cruelly torn from its land and today finds itself pain-fully compelled to impress itself upon the conscience of the world, sometimes by acts forced upon it by the deafness of the capitalist West. The people of Palestine are entitled to a country as indeed the Arab countries, which we so firmly support, have the right to recover their territories illegally occupied by Israel since 1967.\n149.\tIn our view, the occupation of Arab territories is no more than a consequence of the spoliation of the Palestinian people, and we have every reason, therefore, to believe that any settlement to the conflict which fails to take account of the rights of the Palestinians will be precarious. We also wish to state here that it would not be good politics to ignore the existence of the Jewish people established in Israel. In the Congo, as I have said, we condemn regimes and their policies, but not peoples. So in this case we vigorously condemn the Zionist, hegemonistic, expansionist and arrogant policy of Israel, but not the Jewish people, which is no different from the other peoples of the world.\n150.\tThe first half of our century was one in which twice in the space of 20 years, the selfishness, ambition and folly of men nearly destroyed the world, while the second half will undeniably be marked by the development and success of the liberation struggles, particularly in Africa. We can only express our satisfaction at seeing the political map of the world showing day by day profound positive changes leading towards the fulfillment of the legitimate aspirations of the oppressed peoples.\n151.\tThe liberation war of the peoples of Africa, as the Assembly is aware, freed the Portuguese people itself from the worst fascism of our day. The wild dreams of Salazarand Caetano met with the fate history always reserves for retrogressive and criminal enterprises.\n152.\tAfter Guinea-Bissau, three other fraternal countries Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe have just achieved sovereignty. We warmly welcome them as States Members of the United Nations. This is also an opportunity for us to hail the memory of the illustrious freedom-fighters who fell on the field of honor in the struggle for independence.\n153.\tBut the international community must now become imbued with a sense of its new duty, that of helping these young States to staunch the wounds of an unjust war imposed upon them and which did so much damage to their economies.\n154.\tNow I turn to Angola. Although we all agree in recognizing that one month before the accession of this country to independence the situation there remains one of concern, we for our part still wish to denounce those among us in this Organization, the alarmists, who cry \\\"fire\\\". The war raging today in Angola is one more hotbed kindled by imperialism in order to make sure that the State which will emerge will be run by men in its pay and in the service of its interests, which, as the Assembly is well aware, it is doing everything in its power to perpetuate everywhere.\n155.\tThe people of Angola paid a heavy price for their liberation and wishes only for independence in dignity and national harmony, an independence which it intends to enjoy to the full because it will not have been something granted. The people of the Congo firmly support the fraternal people of Angola, particularly the brave freedom fighters of the MPLA who are the only true architects of national independence. We call upon the backward colonialists, the racists snugly entrenched in their egoism and the rapacious imperialists to understand that the time of the\\\"Angola of papa\\\" has gone for ever.\n156.\tThe fact remains, however, that all men of good will, of whatever race, have a place in Africa, as was stated here from this very rostrum just a few days ago [2370th meeting] by Field Marshal ldi Amin Dada, President of the Republic of Uganda, current Chairman of OAU. And as was quite recently confirmed by the political leaders of MPLA, all whites, particularly the Portuguese in Angola, who are ready to accept the new situation have no reason to leave and should indeed remain in the country to make their contribution to its reconstruction which is so indispensable.\n157.\tWe therefore wish to issue an urgent appeal from the General Assembly to the world to leave it to the Angolans themselves to settle their own problems and to bring their country to independence in respect for its territorial integrity. We condemn out of hand any attempt at secession and state that an independent Angola will itself alone examine special cases, such as that of Cabinda.\n158.\tThe situation in Rhodesia and South Africa has shown no sign of progress. The racist and minority regimes of southern Africa have learned nothing from the masterly history lesson just given to the Portuguese Fascist regime of Salazar and Caetano. Ian Smith persists in rebellion and Vorster is bogged down in apartheid both policies without a future and inexorably doomed.\n159.\tThe capitalist West alone bears responsibility for a situation which, in an escalation of violence, may lead to a confrontation between racial communities in spite of the good will demonstrated a thousand times by the Africans through their reluctance to respond to blind, abominable and mindless racism by another Fascism just as reprehensible.\n160.\tAn independent Africa, which began to believe at one time in all good faith that every avenue likely to lead to a settlement of the situations in Rhodesia and South Africa should be explored without exception, finally woke up to the fact that only through armed struggle could it put an end to the reign of injustice and anachronism. The People's Republic of the Congo can only express its gratification at the increased support being given by OAU to the liberation movements of Zimbabwe and South Africa.\n161.\tOnce again we vigorously demand the unconditional transfer of power to the majority of the people of Zimbabwe.\n162.\tOn the question of Namibia, we believe that the United Nations should do its duty because, while it is true that the African States are more closely concerned than others by this problem, there is no denying that morally and legally speaking the question of Namibia is primarily a problem between our whole Organization and South Africa. The United Nations possesses, in its own texts, provisions which make it possible for it objectively to resolve its problem with South Africa, and all it needs to do is to apply these provisions.\n163.\tWe are pleased with the efforts of European nations to narrow differences even further and to establish better understanding among their peoples. We believe that, after the Second World War and the cold war which followed, the detente which is gradually being brought about in Europe is an important step on the road to peace. We therefore believe that the results of the Helsinki Conference, however modest they may be, are none the less an encouraging landmark.\n164.\tBut Europe, the place where the two world conflagrations which almost destroyed the world broke out, would be wrong to believe that it can be secure while the third world is insecure. That is why it is in our common interest that Europe, which has known the horrors of war, should refrain from sparking conflagrations or fueling them as it is doing throughout the world, particularly in southern Africa.\n165.\tInternational detente and non-intervention in the affairs of States should, in the view of our delegation, be prerequisites for serious discussions on disarmament.\n166.\tWe repeat that the oppressed and exploited countries, which are today still exposed to all kinds of intervention and aggression, have the right and duty to defend themselves. However, the People's Republic of the Congo is ready to take part in a world disarmament conference, if it is ever convened, under the auspices of the United Nations in the hope that a dialog marked by candor can be established on a problem which becomes of graver concern with each succeeding day.\n167.\tWe cannot talk of disarmament without thinking immediately of the Charter of the United Nations because they both throw into relief the intolerable inequalities within the international community, where some can decide for all and others are reduced to expressing an opinion which is hardly ever taken into account in the settlement of problems of concern to us all.\n168.\tDecisions relating to crucial questions which determine the life of the Organization and the future of mankind continue to be the privilege of a minority of Member States. We therefore reassert vigorously that the Charter, which of course at one time did correspond to a political map of the world, today needs to be revised in order to be brought into line with the new realities.\n169.\tThe right of veto, for example, which has become an instrument of oppression of third world' countries wielded by the Western Powers, might go. A striking illustration of the anachronistic and unfair use of the right of veto has been given by the shameful conduct of the Government of the United States, which blocked the well-deserved admission to membership in the United Nations of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam.\n170.\tThe American double veto gave grist to the mill of the detractors of our Organization who consider that the Security Council is a sound-proof chamber, an organ walled up in the Escorial, haunted ceaselessly by phantoms of unreality. This incident, it will be recalled, marked the increasingly pathological solitude of a great Power, a Power worthy of respect, the United States of America, to whom none the less the heroic people of Viet Nam, in its noble desire to turn one of the gloomiest pages of contemporary history, is holding out the hand of friendship.\n171.\tOur country, which always supported the heroic war of resistance and national liberation which the Vietnamese people waged so successfully against the foreign invaders, is more than ever convinced that the friendly people of Viet Nam will triumph over all the maneuvers which we are now witnessing.\n172.\tWe therefore wish to state once again that it is only when these two questions of disarmament and the revision of the Charter have been tackled with courage that a decisive step will have been taken towards the indispensable democratization of international relations. Then, it will be possible for the economic problems, the discussion of which in various places daily throws more light on the selfishness of the haves in the face of the poverty of the \\\"have-nots , to be examined in a new light. In the meantime, we call on the industrialized countries to understand that the unequal economic relationships governing the world are objectively a genuine threat to international peace and security. The alms-giving policy practiced by the industrialized countries must give way to mutually advantageous co-operation where everyone has something to give and something to get.\n173.\tThe sixth special session of the General Assembly, after having broken the ice of caution and immobility, enabled our Organization to take decisions which promise an end to the relationships of dependence and domination which hitherto have governed international trade and the establishment of new cooperation on the basis of dialog, not confrontation, while respecting cultural diversity and the specific decisions taken by our various nations.\n174.\tThe achievements of that historic session have just been consolidated by the very considerable results of the seventh special session, thus contributing to an acceleration of the process of building a new system of international relations which lays down the principles which should guide the conduct of all our States. In such an approach, applying the technology mastered by some to the primary commodities produced essentially by others would establish among the nations of the two camps a complementarity which is the essential basis for the very delicate balance which our world is attempting to achieve.\n175.\tThose are a few considerations which, on behalf of the President of the Central Committee of the Congolese Labor Party, comrade Marien Ngouabi, it is the duty of our delegation to submit to this Assembly at its thirtieth session.\n176.\tWe are convinced that, thanks to the wisdom of the President of the Assembly, his eminent statesmanlike qualities which made him a natural and unanimous choice for the presidency of the thirtieth session, on which we warmly congratulate him, and the always valuable support and assistance of the Secretary-General, he will be able as the successor to my friend and brother Abdelaziz Bouteflika, of whom Africa has every reason to be daily more proud  to channel our energies so that our work will have successful results as regards progress, peace and understanding among peoples.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "2.\t Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to extend to you, on behalf of the Republic of Cyprus, warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your wide experience in international affairs and your outstanding qualities, which have distinguished you as Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, a country with long and rich democratic traditions, ensure that the deliberations of this Assembly will be guided by a constructive and creative spirit.\n3.\tI should like also to express deep appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, for the skillful and effective manner in which he presided over the deliberations of the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session of the General Assembly.\n4.\tThe Republic of Cyprus extends a warm welcome to the three new Members of the Organization, Sao Tome and Principe, Cape Verde and Mozambique, which, having emerged from colonial status, have assumed their rightful place as members of the international community. We salute their presence as a further step towards the universality of membership of this global Organization. We hope this process will soon be concluded by the admission to membership in the very near future of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam and also of the remaining Territories still under colonial or other alien rule.\n5.\tBefore proceeding further, I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his dedicated efforts at upholding the principles of the United Nations and attaining its objectives. My country is particularly grateful for his contribution in the search for a just and peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem. We are deeply appreciative of the fact that, with great patience and a sense of fairness, he presided over the negotiations in Vienna and New York in an effort to reach a solution within the framework of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, and that, with untiring dedication, he continues to make his good offices available.\n6.\tThis year, the United Nations finds itself celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of its establishment. The fact that its membership has grown from the original 50 States to the present total of 141 demonstrates the significance of the Organization and gives it the dimensions of a truly global community. The universality of its membership shows the momentous evolution which has taken place since the Second World War and underlines the fact that the principles of self-determination and independence have been steadily accepted and widely applied.\n7.\tA new era has been ushered in for mankind. Old patterns and practices of international thinking and behavior are now outmoded and have given place to the new concept that the world is interdependent and constitutes a single community. The advances of technology have made the world shrink and events occurring in one place have global repercussions. In our small world of today, principles and values such as peace, freedom, and social and economic justice are indivisible and co-operation among peoples and nations is an imperative necessity. It can be truly said that in our interdependent world the alternatives are common progress or common disaster.\n8.\tThis necessity for co-operation was highlighted at the recent Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The principles included in the Final Act of the Conference are in line with the Charter of the United Nations and at the same time take due account of the accumulated experience of the past 30 years and the existing situations in the world. The fact that the signatories included Powers which possess the means to destroy our planet within a matter of hours gives particular importance to the Helsinki Conference.\n9.\tIt has become increasingly recognized that, in our age, no one State or group of States can achieve its aims through unilateral actions in disregard of the legitimate interests of others but only through accommodation and co-operation. The seventh special session has gone a long way towards revising and restructuring the world economic order with a view to establishing a more equitable and fair system bridging the gap between the developed and the developing countries. To this effect, much has yet to be done,\nbut an auspicious beginning has been made. The general awareness of the importance of the problem and of the need to deal with it realistically gives rise to the hope that more concrete results may be forthcoming soon.\n10.\tThe effort to create a new economic order and a better future for mankind is closely connected with the problem of disarmament, and more particularly with the cessation of the spiraling arms race. Colossal sums, now reaching the figure of $300,000 million, are annually squandered on purposeless armaments. If only a small part of this wasteful expenditure were applied to the positive purpose of development, the grave economic difficulties involved could be overcome and the existing gap substantially bridged. Such a halt or reduction in the arms race would serve both the cause of peace and that of development, the two main objectives of the United Nations. Furthermore, the creation of nuclear-free zones on which a hopeful start has been made would be a positive step in the right direction. In this context, we support all efforts for a complete and effective prohibition of all nuclear- weapon tests.\n11.\tAny expectation, however, of effectively halting the course of armaments would be unrealistic and fruitless in the absence of international security and legal order. For how could nations diminish their war potential in a world of international anarchy? It is my firm conviction that our primary and collective endeavor should be directed to the establishment of effective international security and legal order. To this end, one of the first United Nations steps should be to ensure that the resolutions of the Security Council are effectively implemented.\n12.\tIt is not my intention to deal in any detail with the many and important items on our agenda. I would only say that Cyprus as always in the past will consistently support all initiatives aimed at eradicating racial discrimination and apartheid, at bringing peace with justice in southern Africa, at promoting liberation causes, at protecting human rights everywhere, at advancing the observance of international law and at strengthening the United Nations so that it may become a more effective instrument for security and peace in the world.\n13.\tI would, however, be remiss if I did not refer more particularly to the Middle East problem which by analogy and by its geography is connected with that of Cyprus. The position of my country on this issue is that any sound settlement should be based on the withdrawal of the Israeli troops from all the territories occupied since 1967 and the respect of the national rights of the Palestinian people. Under no circumstances can the acquisition of territories by force be condoned or military occupation be taken as creating any rights. Consequently, we support the full implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions and all efforts aimed in that direction. Certain initiatives may have brought about a measure of peace in the area. But real peace is not simply the absence of war. The situation remains grave and, if no comprehensive and just solution is found in the near future, there is a serious clanger of conflagration with incalculable repercussions.\n14. I turn now to the question of Cyprus, an item on the agenda extensively discussed by the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session, when I had the opportunity of telling the Assembly [2251st meeting] of the tragic fate that has befallen my country, a small, non-aligned and defenseless State Member of this Organization. I believe it would be appropriate and understandable if I dealt at some length with this problem, which is not only close to my heart and mind but also serves to bring into focus some of the more disquieting realities facing the world today.\n15.\tThe Republic of Cyprus, since July 1974, has been dismembered as a result of the armed aggression by Turkey. In consequence of this aggression, unprecedented in our times in its ferocity and inhumanity, nearly 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus, in which 70 per cent of its economic resources are located, has come under the military occupation of the invader.\n16.\tTwo hundred thousand Cypriots. one third of the total population of the island, have been uprooted from their ancestral homes and have become destitute refugees in their own country. The killing in cold blood of thousands of people, including women and children, assumed the dimensions of a genocide which is paralleled in history by the massacres of the Armenians in 1915. Desecration of places of worship, destruction of priceless archaeological treasures, looting and usurpation of properties, rapes and other crimes, too many to be recounted, compose the tragedy brought about by operation Attila, as Turkey called its military operation in Cyprus.\n17.\tAnother aspect, and a very' tragic one, is that of the missing persons. More than 2.000 persons are missing. Evidence exists that many of these persons were alive in the hands of the Turkish army after the cease-fire became effective. Authentic photographs of several such persons taken at the time of their seizure by the Turkish forces have appeared in the foreign press, including Turkish newspapers, and in television documentaries. What has been the fate of those persons? We have persistently and repeatedly raised this grave matter with the Turkish side. The reply has been that no prisoners or hostages are being held, either in Turkey or in the occupied part of Cyprus.\n18.\tIf this is so. are we to reach the conclusion that they have all been killed in cold Mood some time after their arrest? To this there has been no reply, and the families of all the missing persons are in constant agony as to whether their loved ones are still alive or whether they have been killed. We asked the Turkish side to arrange for a search operation to be carried out by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which would be given freedom of movement to trace those persons or at least to discover the places where they were buried. The reply has so far been negative. This matter must be fully investigated and cleared up. My delegation will raise it in the appropriate Committee of the General Assembly, for the purpose of obtaining information on the fate of those missing persons, which would at least alleviate the agony of their families.\n19.\tTurkey, by its actions in Cyprus, flagrantly violates international law and every concept of human rights. The General Assembly, when it dealt with the Cyprus problem last year, at the initiative of the non- aligned States to whom we are deeply grateful  unanimously adopted resolution 3212 (XXIX). That resolution provided the framework for a solution to the problem. In its key provisions, it calls for respect of the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus, for the speedy withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from the Republic, the cessation of all foreign interference and for the taking of urgent measures for the return of the refugees in safety to their homes.\n20.\tThat resolution of the General Assembly was endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 365 (1974) of 13 December 1974, thus making its implementation mandatory.\n21.\tWhat has Turkey's attitude been towards those resolutions, and what does the record show one year later? It has been an attitude of contemptuous disregard of and non-compliance with any of the provisions of those resolutions. There has been no withdrawal of foreign troops, speedy or otherwise; there have been no measures for the return of the refugees to their homes, urgent or otherwise; there has been no cessation of foreign interference and no respect for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus. All this despite the fact that Turkey also voted for resolution 3212 (XXIX). In casting its affirmative vote, Turkey was merely pretending to go along with the unanimity of the General Assembly.\n22.\tThe United Nations resolutions on Cyprus also provide for negotiations between representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots with a view to reaching freely a political settlement. Negotiations were indeed undertaken and carried out in Cyprus and, since last April, in Vienna and New York, under the personal auspices and direction of the Secretary-General. I very much regret that to date these negotiations have not produced any positive results. This has been entirely due to the negative attitude taken by Turkey towards the talks.\n23.\tIt became obvious from the very start that there was no intention on the part of the Turkish side that meaningful negotiations should take place. The time of the talks was used by Turkey in order to consolidate its hold on the occupied territory and to create further situations of fails accomplis. Turkey, acting through its instrument, the Turkish-Cypriot leadership, took a series of arbitrary measures by unilaterally declaring a purported \\\"Turkish Federated State of Cyprus\\\", followed by setting up a \\\"Constituent Assembly\\\", drafting a \\\"Constitution\\\" and holding a \\\"referendum\\\" thereon.\n24.\tAll these arbitrary acts were carried out during negotiations and, particularly, at a time when the Turkish Government had received a verbal note officially addressed to it by the Secretary-General, asking what steps it had taken or contemplated taking for the implementation of General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX), endorsed by Security Council resolution 365 (1974). To that request, Turkey evaded replying and finally made no response.\n25.\tThis conduct of the Turkish Government demon-strates once more its lack of good faith in the negotiations. It should furthermore be pointed out that, under the continuing pressure of Turkey's military occupation, aggravated by the perpetration offails accomplis, negotiations could not be conducted \\\"freely\\\" as stipulated in the relevant resolutions.\n26.\tIt should not be overlooked that when the parties engaged in any negotiation are at cross-purposes there can hardly be any prospect of positive results. Turkey's purpose is not to comply with the United Nations resolutions on an independent and territorially integral State of Cyprus, but to partition Cyprus. I would like in this connexion to clarify that I am not opposed to the negotiation process as such and that, on the contrary, I believe it to be the best means for achieving a peaceful solution of the problem. If the negotiations are to be fruitful, however, it is imperative that they be conducted meaningfully and in accordance with the express provisions of the relevant resolutions on Cyprus. I refer to Turkey's attitude towards the talks and not to that of the representative of the Turkish Cypriots, since the Turkish-Cypriot leadership is totally dependent upon, and directed by, Ankara.\n27.\tTurkey's lack of good faith in the negotiations and its real intentions can be seen from the fact that it is systematically channeling thousands of members of the Turkish population from Turkey, transplanting them into the occupied area, where they are being established in the usurped homes and properties of the expelled Cypriots. It may be recalled in this connexion that the Turkish Cypriots are, numerically speaking, but a relatively small minority of 18 per cent, as compared with the Greek-Cypriot majority of 82 per cent. The Turkish colonization process to which\nI\thave just referred is calculated to change the agelong demographic character of Cyprus.\n28.\tThese are the facts which bear out the attitude and reveal the intentions of Turkey. Turkey has been trying to present the Cyprus situation as a dispute between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, This is not the substance of the problem as it stands today. In its real essence, the problem is the aggression by Turkey and the continuing military occupation of a large part of the territory of Cyprus. I must say that the oppression of the Turkish military is felt not only by the Greek Cypriots but also by the bulk of the Turkish Cypriots. If the people of Cyprus are left free from outside interference, they can well settle any differences which may exist between them.\n29.\tAnother fallacy which Turkish propaganda is trying to spread, especially among Islamic countries, is that religion lies at the root of the Cyprus problem. This is totally untrue. Religion has never been a cause of friction between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.\n30.\tIn its effort to diminish the unfavorable impact on world opinion of its aggression and conduct in Cyprus, Turkey is falsely representing that, for\nII\tyears, after 1963 the Turkish Cypriots suffered at the hands of the Government which allegedly deprived them of their freedom of movement and otherwise suppressed them. The reality is that the Turkish Cypriots suffered from the restrictions imposed on them by their leadership, acting in pursuance of Turkey's policy of division. A large number of them were forced by their leadership to move from their villages into enclaves and were prevented from having any dealings with their Greek compatriots, in a manner which adversely affected their economic and everyday life. These facts were clearly spelled out in the reports of the Secretary-General throughout all those years and are a matter of record. The Turkish Cypriots were \nalso prevented from participating in the functions of the State, as a means of separatism paving the way to ultimate partition. Turkey's plans for partition appear in the proposals of the Turkish-Cypriot leadership submitted to the United Nations Mediator, Mr. Gaio Plaza, as set out in his official report of 1965.'\n31.\tThe future of Cyprus as an independent country is at stake. The Turkish aggression against Cyprus wit! continue so long as Turkish forces continue to occupy part of its territory. This situation should not be tolerated by the United Nations. All necessary measures must be taken to restore fully the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus, It might be said that a compromise should be sought. It is true that in many cases problems and disputes are solved by compromise, but in no case can there be a compromise of basic principles, particularly when independence and territorial integrity are involved. Cyprus is the victim of mutilating aggression. What kind of com-promise can there be between the victim and the aggressor, unless compromise is intended to mean capitulation to faits accomplis created by the use of force? In our case, I consider compromise based on the results of aggression and of the grave crime involved as immoral. As such, it cannot be legalized.\n32.\tTurkey alleges that its invasion of Cyprus was carried out by right under the Treaty of Guarantee to restore the constitutional order upset by the coup of July 1974. Turkey, together with the United Kingdom and Greece, guaranteed the constitution, the independence and the territorial integrity of Cyprus. I do no! wish at this juncture to e rater into the issue as to whether the Treaty of Guarantee gives such right of military intervention in Cyprus. In any case. Turkey, by its actions, destroyed the very object it had guaranteed to preserve. Ankara now speaks of new realities. What are these new- realities? Turkey's military occupation of 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus, the uprooting of 200.000 indigenous Cypriots from their homes, and other situations brought about by the use of force are the so-called new realities which the Greek Cypriots are required to recognize and accept.\n33.\tSuch violently accomplished facts might even be presented by the Turkish side as superseding the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus and as an excuse for non-compliance with their mandatory provisions. In no case, however, can situations established by (he use of force in violation of binding resolutions of the United Nations supersede such resolutions.\n34.\tIt has also been alleged that the Turkish military intervention was intended to protect the Turkish Cypriot community and io secure their rights. But the colonization of the occupied territory by a population imported from Turkey and the looting and transfer to Turkey of large quantities of goods and valuable movables have nothing to do with the protection of the Turkish Cypriot community. On the contrary, ail these actions are dearly against the interest of the Turkish community. I do not think that Turkey is genuinely interested in the welfare of the Turkish Cypriot community. Turkey's seeming concern is a pretext for the promotion of its expansionist plans, and the Turkish Cypriots are but the unfortunate pawns manipulated by Turkey in pursuance of those plans.\n35.\tIndicative this expansionist policy is the repeated reference to the statement made in this Assembly by the Turkish Foreign Minister \\2364ih meeting] to the \\\"geopolitical\\\" considerations behind Turkey's policy. \\\"Geopolitics\\\" ii the well known term used by the Nazis in justification of their policy of aggressive territorial expansion. Turkey's aims at such expansion over Cyprus on geopolitical grounds were spelled out as early as 1954. when the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Turkey declared that Cyprus was an extension of continental Turkey and that it should revert to Turkey on the basis of geographic proximity.\n36.\tThe Turkish Foreign Minister, in his address, referred to resolution 3212 (XXIX). but only to its provision regarding negotiations, m though there were no other cardinal and urgent provisions in the resolution. He did mil find it appropriate or expedient io make any mention of Turkey's obligation to implement the essential and urgent parts of the resolution regarding the return of the refugees and the cessation of Turkey's military intervention, or of what it contemplates doing in these respects. On the contrary, the Turkish Minister made proposals which are incompatible with the resolution and its purport. It is true that he spoke for the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus, But that was mere lip-service, calculated to mislead; for Turkey \\\"s actions in Cyprus speak knitter than its words.\n37.\tI confidently trust that Cyprus wiU not be left at the mercy of the invader. The United Nations resolution on Cyprus must not remain a dead letter.\n38.\tI have come to this body to week such urgent and effective measures by the United Nations as this tragic situation warrants.\n39.\tThe implementation of General Assembly resolution 32l2tX'XIXI as mandatory endorsed by Security Council resolution 3651 1974) is a paramount necessity for positive progress towards a just and peaceful solution of the problem. I express the confident belief that the General Assembly will we the wisdom of taking effective steps no promote progress towards such a solution.\n40. In the erst of the United Nations, when concerted efforts are exerted to ensure the prevalence of international law and order, it would be inconceivable to allow the strangulation of the independence of a small State Member of this Organization. if this is tolerated in the ease of Cyprus, ii will create a dangerous precedent for other small countries, especially those among the non-aligned. It should not be overlooked that the issue involved is not only the future of a mall country but also a broader issue: one of international security under the Charter, which is the primary concern of the United Nations and upon which the meaningfulness of the Organization stands or falls. If the tragic situation in Cyprus remains un-remedied, the message to the world will be that only force wins.\n41. As 1 stated earlier. I believe that negotiations are an appropriate and available means or achieving a peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem. 1 am convinced that if such negotiations are curried out meaningfully in a spirit of goodwill and good faith, free from outside pressures and influences, they can lead to positive results within the framework of resolution \n3212 (XXIX). It is my fervent desire that Greek and Turkish Cypriots should live together in peace and co-operation as they have done for many years in the past and enjoy in common the benefits of the progress and prosperity of their country. The forcible movement of people and the exchange of properties are inhuman and will be to the detriment of both sides. Those Cypriots who wish to move and resettle elsewhere within the island may do so freely, but what is essential is that there be no usurpation of property and that all those who wish to return to their homes can do so in safety, as expressly provided in resolution 3212 (XXIX).\n42.\tIf, as I hope, a settlement is reached on a viable State within the universally accepted norms, it should be respected by all both within and outside Cyprus. In this regard lessons should be drawn from the experience of the past, and such a settlement should be under broad and effective international guarantees. We want lasting peace, and lasting peace cannot be based on force but only on the exercise of reason, through mutual respect and understanding. Cyprus, located between three continents, could then become a bridge of unity in the whole region, as was its aspiration when it joined the United Nations.\n43.\tIn our interdependent world, when the need for understanding, unity and co-operation among nations becomes increasingly realized and constructive moves are taken in this direction through the United Nations, it is a sad reality that within a small country like Cyprus so much outmoded separatism and division are being forced upon its people on ethnic grounds.\n44.\tMy efforts have always been towards conciliation, co-operation and unity between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, and I will persist with faith in this course. I know that the bulk of the Turkish Cypriots, no less than the Greek Cypriots, in their hearts share a common yearning for conciliation and co-operation. Even under present circumstances, this feeling is there and many are the occasions on which it bursts out.\n45.\tI am convinced that in an independent non- aligned Cyprus, freed from the threats of force and all outside interference, its people, Greek and Turkish Cypriots, can live together in harmony with mutual respect for their legitimate rights. In these circumstances there will be neither need for nor purpose in the existence of any armies. In this respect I wish to state that the Government of Cyprus supports a fully demilitarized State of Cyprus and to that end is prepared completely to disband its armed forces.\n46.\tBeyond all the achievements of the human intellect, it is the human spirit that will determine the fate of man on this planet. Technology in its gigantic progress is rendering obvious the need for ethic principles in the conduct of life for the very survival of mankind. The Charter of the United Nations provides the pattern for such conduct on the international level. I may say, in all humility, that Cyprus, within its modest means, has invariably supported adherence to the Charter on all occasions and will steadfastly follow that path.\n47 May God guide us all to what is right so that we may outgrow the past and have as a measure of our decisions truth, justice and love; that we may hear the deep tones of the spirit, seek the wisdom that liberates from self and master circumstances by the power of principle, so that lasting peace in justice may become a reality on our planet earth.\n48.\tBefore concluding I wish to express once more to the Secretary-General our deep gratitude for all he has been doing for my country. I also wish to record our warm appreciation of his Special Representative in Cyprus, Ambassador Luis Weckmann-Mufioz, for his valuable services in the discharge of his mission in the island, as well as to the Secretary-General's collaborators in New York, Mr. Guyer and Mr. Urquhart.\n49.\tOur sincere thanks are also extended to the Commander of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus [UNFICYP], General Prem Chand, and to all the officers and men serving under his command for the excellent manner in which they carry out their difficult duties in the UNFICYP operation as well as in humanitarian matters.\n50.\tWe are also very grateful to those countries which are contributing military and police contingents to the Force, as well as to those which make its functioning possible by financial contributions.\n51.\tGratitude is due also to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, for his exemplary humanitarian work in alleviating suffering in Cyprus, as well as to those countries and organizations which have been contributing for that purpose.\n52.\tI also pay a special tribute to those delegations which have given support to the cause of Cyprus and have expressed their concern for the plight of its people, both in the course of this general debate and in other international forums. In this respect I wish to make particular mention of the Conference of Commonwealth Heads of Government at Kingston last May and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries at Lima in August of this year and their full support for a just solution to the problem of Cyprus.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "2.\t May I express to you, Mr. President, my most sincere congratulations on your well-deserved election to preside over our work. Nevertheless I feel that in these moments in world history we are not entitled to be complacent regarding good wishes but, rather, we must make an over-all and complete appeal for collective responsibility.\n3.\tFrom this same rostrum four years ago I expressed the confidence of Mexico in our Organization.1 At that time we ratified, and today we reiterate, our adherence to its animating purposes and principles,\n4.\tWe believe in the validity of dialog in seeking areas of understanding among countries with different ideologies and also in establishing forms of co-operation among all people.\n5.\tDespite the difficulties with which the United Nations has been faced, the combined efforts of the peoples who compose it make it possible for us to advance towards a more just and equitable international structure.\n6.\tThe aims which originally motivated its creation were all directed toward the maintenance of international peace and security, and they are still fully valid. But the same cannot be said of the methods conceived at that time for achieving those aims. The inequalities to be found among countries constantly threaten the continued existence of a very delicate balance and call for a constant reassessment of the situation and the adoption of new strategies.\n7.\tIn 1945, when 51 nations signed the Charter of the United Nations, the world population was a little over 2,000 million. With the exclusion of revolutionary\n\nChina, based on an arbitrary misunderstanding of the profound political changes of our day, our Organization at that time represented only about one half of the world's inhabitants.\n8.\tBut today, there are 141 Member States and they represent the immense majority of the world population. This, surely, is a new factor which is indicative of a fundamental geopolitical change. It also bespeaks the enormous challenge that confronts us and foreshadows the constant changes that the future will- undoubtedly bring.\n9.\tAlmost all those peoples that form part of the great dispossessed of the world participate in the work of our Assembly today those that 30 years ago were constrained to play a passive role in history, thanks to the banners that were raised over them, supported by the sword or economic dependency, by the onetime metropolitan countries.\n10.\tThis basic difference in the composition of the United Nations today has raised the possibility of our Organization directing its actions to benefit the great majority and truly and fully acting as a forum that will lead to the establishment of a true international democracy both politically and economically.\n11.\tThirty years ago a simplistic interpretation of the evolution of peoples and a mechanical assessment of events made it possible for the order that had been restored, considered to be a legacy and a new accumulation of power, to reproduce the military alliances and blocs that from that moment started vying for world hegemony.\n12.\tThe law of \\\"might makes right\\\" and the philosophy of domination once again played a decisive role in the conduct of world affairs. The cold war led to ideological persecutions which in every case constituted an assault on the freedom and full independence of nations and resulted in a long and tragic period of local wars which has still not come to an end.\n13.\tThis situation, which prevented most nations from exercising their historic rights and even forced them to fight for causes that were not their own, in turn made it impossible for the reorganization of international life to be undertaken with the necessary vigour and thoroughness and in accordance with the ideal of universal solidarity enshrining the rights of all peoples of all on earth to enjoy decent standards of living.\n\n14.\tIn order to achieve this goal we must have access to the immense treasure of the cultures which are today recovering their voice and the awareness of their lineage, and we must be strengthened by the presence of the millions of human beings who have emerged from their marginal position to become peoples who have found their identity and their sovereignty. \n\n15.\tNow, for the first time, we can achieve true peace, not the peace that prolonged privileges and powers. I am referring to a peace based on a new mentality and on a new philosophic concept of history.\n16.\tToday, peace is development. That is a concept which must be understood not only in its economic context but also as the constant social, cultural and civic betterment of all peoples in general and of every human being in particular. To ignore this fundamental truth means seeking refuge in empty rhetoric which, in avoiding commitment to action, ends by legitimizing, through conformity, injustice in international relations.\n17.\tNo single country or bloc of countries, no matter how strong, is capable of establishing the norms that are to govern international affairs; nor must any alliance of transnational corporations continue to benefit from the patrimony and the work of independent peoples.\n18.\tWe are still experiencing the old effects of a precarious peace because there are still those who strive to perpetuate an anachronistic concept of power whose ashes are now, quite justifiably, being dispersed by the winds of history.\n19.\tThree quarters of mankind is now determined to participate in the organization of world power, not in a desire for revenge, as some would try to make us believe, but rather through strict adherence to the ideals of democracy.\n20.\tIf we are to achieve this purpose fully, the majority must not lose itself in the trivial dead-end trap of high-sounding trite phrases only to be left without any effective solution to existing contradictions. The new majority in the United Nations must, with full responsibility, be ready to take on the transfer of a large part of the rights and obligations that were formerly the domain of a minority that perpetuated the politics of force for its own benefit.\n21.\tBut this implies far more than the transient act of making speeches at meetings. It requires seriousness and consistency in analyzing and presenting valid alternatives.\n22.\tIn this context, the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] is an unquestionable advance. It was never irresponsibly conceived as an act designed to divide the wealthy countries and the developing countries into two factions. Such a view has nothing to do with the intentions of the nations and men who placed their will for change and their ideas at the service of that project.\n23.\tFrom the first working hypothesis onwards, this Charter was designed to find a point of world agreement, a wide range of collective stands that would make it possible to establish a new world economic system.\n24.\tUnanimous approval was desirable, but not at the cost of yielding points of vital importance. It was necessary to be firm on issues that were neither incidental nor debatable. That was the case with regard to the natural resources and national wealth of the peoples of the world and, by extension, with regard to ratification of the inalienable sovereignty of nations in relation to transnational corporations. The process of concentration and multiplication of these companies has turned them into enclaves of foreign domination within other States which act against those States whenever an objective attempt is made to set up national and popular priorities. In these areas, I repeat, there was no possibility of concession.\n25.\tThe resolution that was adopted by the General Assembly is not directed against any particular nation. It is directed against the illegitimate interests of the supranational groups that are protected by certain States whose image is tarnished by those very corporations because of their identification with acts that go beyond the bounds of law and sovereignty. I must make it clear, therefore, that the Charter is open  and will be open in the future to dialog among nations, but it is firmly closed against any attempt at domination.\n26.\tThat is the truth underlying an instrument of universal scope which provides a regulatory framework and firm bases for the great world economic process of change that we have set in motion. Its text contains principles which, although at the outset not understood by some, will in time be proclaimed as evident truths in those very countries that voted against it a year ago.\n27.\tIndeed, there is no force on earth capable of maintaining inequality, in the decades as an ideology of minority prosperity.\n28.\tContemporary history confirms the degree to which domination has been established through trade imbalances, the flow of capital, and the effect of influences determined by cultural dependency.\n29.\tFor these three key factors, no just or adequate solution has yet been found. Essentially, the measures adopted have met the interests and needs of the powerful countries. The same has been true of international assistance. Conceived as a system of support for the exports of the countries that are responsible for financing it, it does not fulfil its basic objective of lessening inequality among nations. On the contrary, it has brought about an increase in the foreign debts of the developing countries and thus made their subjection all the more severe.\n30.\tFor this reason we must establish financial machinery and instruments to deal with trade compatible with the level of certain societies that cannot survive in the intricacies of an international economic organization based on commercial and financial concentration.\n31.\tAt this time we acknowledge the support that the socialist countries have offered the peoples of the third world at various international meetings, and the significant role they are playing in the balancing correlation of world forces. But at the same time we must tell them with all sincerity that this attitude should always be reflected, with the same vigor, in the sphere of action.\n32.\tIn building up growing trade among themselves, some industrialized countries have not only increased the difficulty of the situation in the peripheral nations, but have also failed to resolve their own economic crises, and it is those crises that in the last few years have led to world-wide inflation which has reached unusually serious levels in the developing countries. This situation exists because the importation of capital goods and manufactured products required by the developing nations generates additional burdens that bring their economic and social programs to a halt.\n33.\tThe adjustment that has been imposed on the prices of oil and certain raw materials has been defined by some as an arbitrary and monopolistic act on the part of the producer countries, but the industrialized countries seem to overlook the fact that, for the first time in centuries, they now have had to accept international prices for certain raw materials rather than imposing them themselves on the basis of their own economic, commercial and production interests. It is a well known fact that price-fixing in the past obeyed the rules of a system which considered raw materials and primary products as compulsory supplies from dependent colonial countries to the industrial countries, independently of the former nations' desires.\n34.\tHowever, from the standpoint of the producer countries, today it is no longer possible, within the context of global interests, to repeat that earlier situation because it would create a crisis that would also affect the less-well-off nations.\n35.\tWe are bound to create the necessary historical conditions for a new world economic order in which production and prices will be adjusted to a blueprint geared to the overall interests of mankind.\n36.\tThe energy resources being exploited today are insufficient to maintain in all countries the levels of consumption prevalent in the most industrialized ones, but thus far that consumption has been based on the predominance of waste and irrationality in the very form of production.\n37.\tFor this reason that system can no longer be advocated as a viable model for mankind. Furthermore, and as a consequence of what I have just said, the basic resources that man will require in the future are being gradually exhausted. This being the case, it is obvious that the affluent nations must pay a fair price for raw materials, including oil a fair price which they must consider not only in monetary terms but also in terms of inflation and the prices paid for manufactured goods.\n38.\tThe producing countries must not overlook two basic facts: first, the serious imbalance created for the non-oil-producing countries and, secondly, the fact that high prices, along with value added and new profits, will bring about a situation in which the industrialized countries will organize a scientific revolution in the field of energy. What is needed, historically speaking, is the creation of a true association within the framework of the new world order, based on fair prices, a renewal of technology for all and benefits that will be acceptable only if they are collective in nature and placed at the service of the masses of mankind.\n39.\tAlthough we admit that the contribution made by the members of the Organization of Petroleum- Exporting Countries to the development of developing countries has reached levels that are beginning to surpass those of official development assistance given by the industrialized countries, we nevertheless feel that it could be increased still further, particularly by putting a stop to be superfluous investments being made in the old metropolitan areas.\n40.\tOil is a basic input, not only for the industrialized nations, but also for the developing nations. Therefore we consider it imperative that a study and analysis be made of the measures necessary to prevent the countries of the third world which do not produce oil from suffering the consequences of an imbalance in price and to permit them to continue to pursue their economic and social development priorities.\n41.\tRecent experience in marketing confirms our determination to improve and multiply the instruments for co-operation and defense of the small and medium- sized countries, which, through world-wide negotiations, will compensate for the abysmal imbalance of power prevalent in bilateral trade.\n42.\tThis fact further shows that it is not only necessary to negotiate jointly on raw materials and oil, but that we should so organize the new economic order as to include in the agreement manufactured products themselves.\n43.\tFor that reason we have proposed the establishment of an economic system for the development of the third world which, through effective co-ordination among producers, would facilitate the permanent protection of prices and the marketing of export products, define mutual support mechanisms in all sectors, further the establishment of multilateral enterprises and guarantee optimum levels for imports of goods, capital and technology.\n44.\tThat goal is provided for in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and to reach it would undoubtedly constitute one of the surest means of implementing that document. The system, designed to ensure the participation of the countries of the third world in the control of world trade and in decision-making acts that affect all, would be provided with two basic instruments: a financial fund specifically oriented towards the goals I have mentioned, and a data unit that would furnish the elements required for timely and precise action on trade and financial flows.\n45.\tThis project will considerably modify the balance of power and will foster the establishment of a world economy based on solidarity, a form of solidarity which should not be viewed as pure moralizing.\n46.\tTo arrange movements of goods and products only among affluent industrial enclaves would lead in the short and medium term not only to an explosion in the third world but also to urban violence and suicide in those very nations that believe it possible to isolate themselves in autarchy. On a regional level the creation of machinery such as the Latin American Economic System [SELA] proves that similar projects are viable the world over. Again I must point out that SELA, like the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, is an instrument intended to take us from today's unreasonable confrontations towards the historical negotiations that the world requires.\n47.\tWithin this type of organization an exhaustive study will have to be made of all the areas in which it will be possible to employ concerted action. Essential among those areas is the question of food, which affects most countries. It is for this reason that Mexico has advocated the establishment of a world food bank, and we are gratified that this idea, shared with many other countries, has begun to crystallize with the establishment of a fund for agricultural development that exemplifies solidarity and will contribute in practical and immediate ways to solving one of the most acute problems of our time.\n48.\tIt will also be necessary to set up autonomous systems of communications and information that will not depend on the centers of world domination, since the latter ultimately make people look at themselves from the colonial standpoint, a standpoint which converts subjected cultures into mere anthropological repertories, into mere collections of anecdotes, in exotic compilations of folklore which are even incorporated into the requirements and tastes flowing from the very scale of values of the dominating culture.\n49.\tToday, peoples are regaining their own identities and their current differences, far from constituting an obstacle to solidarity, make it possible, through a dialog between one civilization and another, to achieve a true universal form of authentic co-existence. Never before in the course of history has there been an age like this which permits so complete and vast an enrichment of man's vital, political and ideological experience. Man's awareness today is fed on the values inherited from the ancient cultures of the Orient and of Latin America, from the vigorous Negritude movement, and from all the mestizo contributions which, in its moral impotence, colonial authoritarianism had in the past rejected.\n50.\tThe imperative need to preserve and strengthen one's independence, however, must not be confused with isolationism. The latter does not derive from those peoples who are struggling to preserve their own identity, but from those who reject or despise any conduct which they themselves cannot control, or any thought which they themselves do not share.\n51.\tEquality is based on the recognition of the right to enjoy diversity and the freedom to select one's own economic and social model. This means giving economic substance to political independence and giving the world's peoples the means that will allow them to take their own autonomous decisions.\n52.\tMany nations which were formerly in a marginal position have inherited millenia of history and cultures with a high degree of spiritual development and, in addition, have themselves developed technologies appropriate to their own levels of development. Therefore, the medium-sized and small countries must diversify their exchanges in order to escape, in as many areas as possible, from the onerous transfer of technology and culture which constrains peoples to alien ways of life.\n53.\tTo facilitate this exchange, Mexico has undertaken the organization of an open university and a third-world economic and social research institute, which will begin operations early in 1976, and whose purpose will be to decolonize theories on development and to exchange among the poorer nations technologies appropriate to their own needs, without implying any type of link or ties.\n54.\tWe were honored to see the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, preside over the ceremony for the laying of the cornerstones of these two institutions. May I take this opportunity of inviting the peoples represented at this Assembly to co-operate in the functioning of those two bodies and to participate in the fruits of their work.\n55.\tA calm and objective analysis of the achievements by the United Nations, its successes and failures, nevertheless bespeaks the imperative need for this Organization to exist. But this does not conceal its flaws and limitations in certain fields, primarily with regard to the maintenance of peace, which again proves the urgent need to strengthen the Organization. But the idea of maintaining peace is closely linked to a world disarmament plan. To say so is nothing new, but, without falling into exaggeration, I believe that such a statement is in keeping with the highest aspirations of mankind.\n56.\tThe arms race, with the incredible sums devoted to the manufacture and sale of weapons, is at one and the same time an unjustifiable squandering of resources and proof of the moral crisis afflicting those countries which live off the industry of war and build the progress of key sectors of their economy on such an industry.\n57.\tMore than anything else, disarmament is a true attempt at liberation: liberation of energy, liberation of resources, liberation of goods, of scientists and of workers, and all of them could then be diverted to a fruitful program of action, of study and work that,, would hasten social transformation.\n58.\tThe world is living amid violence, but the causes must be pinpointed. Many of them are the product of a form of development which, with its variants of abundance and excess, has produced an underdevelopment that is characterized by exploitation, marginalization and despoliation. And the result of this is the appearance of revolutionary violence which, even with all its excesses, bespeaks the disequilibrium in today's world. If the enormous sums today being wasted on armaments were channeled to the overall development of the world, much would be done then to eliminate the conflicts which today loom over the present and future of mankind.\n59.\tMay I, furthermore, add that disarmament not only provides those real possibilities, but also constitutes an indispensable factor overcoming the political, intellectual and scientific forms of authoritarianism, ideological disarticulation and falsification. This is so because the arms race must always, in order to be accepted morally by the peoples, lead to the most brutal and absolute stereotyping of the enemy in question, an enemy which serves as a pretext for organizing power as an end in itself.\n60.\tThese true facts should, I think, incite this Assembly to speed up its search for a rational alternative in this matter. There can be no possibility of true peace without disarmament. Yet, first we must establish the objective conditions which will pre-establish complete agreement in the field; and such an agreement can only be the result of our courage to make this project part of an overall scheme; that is, a concrete analytical blueprint in which the disarmament program will develop in accordance with a change in the world economic reality.\n61.\tHundreds of thousands of scientists and technicians and millions of men in the great industrial countries are today engaged in the manufacture and sale of weapons. That is a fact. Because of the population explosion and under-development, the third world is suffering from a tragic and alarming level of unemployment. In the industrial countries there are signs of very serious structural unemployment, which, although not comparable, calls for objective reflection. To put it as boldly as possible: it will be impossible to abolish rearmament, which today has become the backbone of the established order, unless it is through an integral economic project that will permit us to move from a war economy the fruit of a restored and therefore fictitious peace to an economy based on true peace.\n62.\tLocalized conflicts not only afford wide opportunities for the continuation of that arms race, but also, because of today's increasing interdependence, threaten the conditions on which world peace must rest.\n63.\tA recent fact-finding trip through the Middle East has served to strengthen my conviction that there can be no firm foundation for peace in that area of the world without an overall agreement that will cover the departure of troops from all occupied territories, guarantee the borders of the States in the area, and accord historic recognition to the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Such an agreement necessarily should and has to be achieved within the framework of the United Nations, which is the objective hope of the world, and go beyond partial negotiations which, despite the progress they may represent at a given moment, may nevertheless later create even graver problems and difficulties.\n64.\tWorld peace will be endangered unless absolute respect is shown for the principle of the territorial integrity of States in the solution of other territorial conflicts. Mexico therefore supports the sister Republic of Panama in its just demand for the restoration of its sovereignty over the whole of its territory.\n65.\tWe rejoice at the triumph of the liberation movements in Africa and Asia. The new countries that have emerged into independent life after prolonged struggles in which they successfully confronted forces far superior to their own have demonstrated once again that man will resist, overcome and, in the end, destroy all despotism.\n66.\tWe moreover confirm our repudiation of apartheid, of the illegal occupation by South Africa of the Territory of Namibia and of the fact that the great majority of the population of Rhodesia is prevented from exercising its political rights.\n67.\tWith respect to the recent events in Spain, I wish, firmly and calmly, to support the message submitted to the Security Council by Mexico on 28 September 1975.2 We are convinced that, both technically and politically, reason is on our side: technically, because this petition is in accordance with the terms of the Charter of the United Nations, which gives every Member State the right to denounce situations of this type before the Security Council; and politically, because the events we are dealing with not only constitute repeated violations of human rights, but, over and above all, are evidence of the systematic creation of a climate of violent confrontation that may easily lead to international friction and endanger the maintenance of peace in an area of the world where, because of its strategic importance, it could constitute a threat to world security. This has been demonstrated by the magnitude of the protest which this case has aroused throughout the world. And, inevitably, history will prove it true.\n68.\tRecent years have brought increasing awareness of the urgent need for substantial modernization of the law of the sea. In the negotiations now under way to approve a treaty of general application, the rule calling for an exclusive economic zone has won almost unanimous support.\n69.\tBecause of the existence of certain difficulties, which may well postpone adoption of this agreement for a considerable period of time, Mexico has decided to establish an exclusive economic zone extending to 200 nautical miles from its coasts, but not affecting navigation, overflight, or the laying of cables. This implies the affirmation of our full sovereignty over the resources of the entire Gulf of California.\n70.\tMy country has participated with constant interest in world conferences dealing with the principal problems affecting  mankind. It was our signal honor to act as hosts, in our capital city, to the World Conference of the International Women's Year. That important event marked the beginning of a new era in our continuing struggle to enforce women's rights and to make women more active participants in the building of our future society.\n71.\tThus it was obvious that the struggle we were waging on behalf of the equality of women was part of the enormous task of achieving the liberation of mankind as a whole, which once again implies the transformation of the world economic order. Mexico will spare no effort to bring about unrestricted implementation of the World Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Women's Year, adopted at that Conference on the basis of the principles approved in the corresponding Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and their\nContribution to Development and Peace, 1975. i\n72.\tThe United Nations is today in the process of leaving behind the rule of the minority which characterized it for decades and of trying to achieve a structure more in accord with the changes that have occurred in our times; it is becoming a model of responsible and democratic power which, on the basis of consensus, will overcome contradictions, but which will not counterfeit that consensus by means of economic pressure or the force of arms.\n73.\tOur Organization must rid itself of colonialist attitudes in order to become the contemporary forum of a new majority which excludes no one, and which unquestionably represents the voice of history. That majority is waging a responsible struggle to bring the sovereign will of the peoples of the world to the point of deciding, on the basis of law, to undertake that change of course which humanity yearns for and which must not be decided in an anti-democratic manner by the arbitrary imposition of the will of any minority,\n74.\tThe emerging nations want to assume their proper responsibilities within the community of nations. All nations, regardless of their size or strength, share the rights and obligations inherent in the building of a new order. Although it is true that the most powerful nations should contribute more than others to the aid of those who have the least, this certainly should not lead to a rebirth of paternalism or of economic hegemonies.\n75.\tIn reforming the United Nations we must act with maturity and adopt a thoroughly practical approach. First of all, we must reinforce the decision-making capacity of the General Assembly, whose functions are currently limited, in comparison with those of the Security Council, in matters in which this is no longer justifiable. The recent refusal to admit the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam as Member States, despite the majority support expressed by the General Assembly, is a negation of the most elementary principles of international democracy and should be cause for grave concern to us all.\n76.\tConsequently, it would be appropriate to reduce the number of questions which are subject to veto, and also to extend the right of veto to one or more members of the third world in order to achieve a balance within the Security Council that is more in keeping with the true composition of the present-day world.\n77.\tTo want to improve the United Nations is to believe in it, for to resign ourselves to its recognized limitations in various fields would be tantamount to becoming accomplices of the established order, or to transforming this Organization into a forum for fictions useful only for venting one's feelings and to allowing the fundamental decisions of our time to be taken, with increasing frequency, behind its back,\n78.\tWe stand at an impressive moment in world history. This Assembly provides clear proof that the parliaments established on the basis of the minority power of one or more countries have now yielded pride of place and must henceforth be governed by the historic will of the majority. That was the original process that led to the organization of democratic regimes.\n79.\tWe here cannot be taken to task for the fact that the third world, together with the peoples of all the world, aspires to the creation of a democratic basis for world power. This implies a full responsibility on the part of the new United Nations majority and also the urgent need for a structural reform of this Organization that is in keeping with the changes which the world is now undergoing.\n80.\tAll this spells a political will for change and the restructuring of organizations along new lines in order to make that change possible.\n81.\tMexico will continue to contribute in every way possible to the starting of a new world economic order. I hereby officially reaffirm the autonomy of our institutions and the revolutionary and nationalist character of a regime which was created and has developed in freedom and which has invariably demanded as a rule of coexistence respect for the rights of others and for freedom and sovereignty.\n82.\tFrom this world tribune I wish to express to you, as an augury and as an expression of hope, that if true peace and not imposed peace is to be achieved it will be done here or not at all. That is the moral legacy of the new majorities of the world represented in this Organization.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "81.\tTogether with all the other Members of the United Nations, the Austrian delegation is delighted that the General Assembly has elected as the President of its thirtieth session Mr. Gaston Thorn, the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, a statesman as well versed in international affairs as he is known for his liberal and democratic views. I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election. It is more than a mere act of courtesy for me to wish such a sincere friend of Austria success in his duties and in all he undertakes.\n82.\tI would not wish to let this opportunity pass of expressing our gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, who guided the work not only of the twenty- ninth session but also of the seventh special session of the General Assembly with remarkable tact and great personal dedication.\n83.\tI also wish to convey my country's warm welcome to the three States which have just been admitted to membership in the United Nations: the Republic of Cape Verde, Mozambique, and Sao Tome and Principe. It is indeed a source of great satisfaction to my country to note that further progress has been achieved in the process of decolonization in Africa.\n84.\tBut the admission of these States also constitutes a further step towards giving effect to the principle of the universality of the United Nations, a cause which my Government has always championed and the reason why it supports every effort to admit to this Organization all independent States wishing to join it and accept its Charter.\n85.\tIn this connexion, I also wish to express the hope that Angola, a territory still beset by such serious internal upheavals, will find the way to unification of its political forces so that it may attain independence without further setbacks or delays. Otherwise, there is reason to fear that harmful consequences will ensue for the process of decolonization, which could be used as a pretext for delaying the granting of independence to other States.\n86.\tThe celebration in the coming weeks of the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations will afford an opportunity for a new assessment of its work. Much criticism will undoubtedly be levelled on that occasion because, regrettably, in the past 30 years it has not always been possible to reconcile political events with the principles of the Charter, by reason of the fact that the world economic situation has been such as not to permit certain changes to be made which could have allayed much poverty and suffering, and because human rights are still far too little respected.\n87.\tYet, when we think of the changes that have taken place in the world in the past 30 years, changes of an extent never before witnessed in the world in so short a span of time and over so wide a range, and when we consider, too, the tensions which such afar- reaching process of transformation inevitably entails, it is almost miraculous that the international community has not been exposed to more serious crises and greater disasters.\n88.\tWe must not forget that during the last 30 years  in contrast with the previous three decades the community of nations has been spared another world war, even though, unfortunately, numerous armed yet territorially limited or localized conflicts could not have been prevented. Nor should we forget that during the last 30 years, as a result of the decolonization process, many new States whose peoples were able to attain freedom and independence, thereby transforming the maps of Asia and Africa, have come into being. We should remember that the cold war period, which aroused grave fears as to its possible dire consequences, has led to and has been superseded by a policy of detente, which culminated this year in the signature at Helsinki of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. It is to be hoped that the guiding principles thus approved will now find practical application in inter-State relations and that an actual, and not merely verbal, detente will thus be attained.\n89.\t'\tWithout the sustained efforts of the United Nations and its organs these results could hardly have been achieved, and I should like to associate myself here with the appreciation which many speakers have expressed to the Secretary-General and his collaborators. If nothing more has been achieved, the fault should not be laid at the door of this Organization, whose activities are governed by the sovereign will of its Member States, and whose decisions and resolutions often do not find the compliance essential to international co-operation.\n90.\tThis co-operation is further threatened by a number of conflicts, which have so far remained unresolved simply because it has not proved possible, despite a great many efforts, to translate the relevant United Nations resolutions and decisions into reality.\n91.\tIn the Middle East conflict, of course, a further significant step towards a just and durable peace settlement in the region has been made possible by a new troop disengagement agreement between Israel and Egypt. This step must, however, be followed by others in the near future in order to prevent the emergence of new tensions and in order to bring to the peoples of the Middle East, in particular the Palestinian people, the just peace that the United Nations has for so long been demanding in its resolutions.\n92.\tOn the other hand, no substantive progress has been achieved on Cyprus, although, thanks to the good offices of the Secretary-General, it has at least been possible to maintain the basis for negotiations between the representatives of the two communities. Now, as in the past, my Government attaches the greatest importance to the maintenance of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. It hopes that the sense of responsibility of the States and communities directly involved in the conflict will ensure the maintenance of balance and peace in the eastern Mediterranean. My Government also hopes that through further negotiations it will be possible in the near future for a satisfactory arrangement for the future coexistence of the two communities to be found, and believes that any unilateral action would have a serious prejudicial effect on such possibilities.\n93.\tThe United Nations peace-keeping operations in the Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean are essential to the preservation of peace in those crisis areas and to the development of political efforts aimed at finding peaceful solutions to such problems. For this very reason these operations warrant the support of all the States Members of the United Nations. At the same time, there must be a readiness to make available to the Organization the relatively modest financial resources which it needs for the maintenance of these operations.\n94.\tThe failure so far to reach a just settlement of the conflicts in the eastern Mediterranean is not only having a harmful effect on security in Europe. Regrettably, it has also led to the outbreak of severe disturbances in Lebanon, with the result that a country so exemplary in its liberal and democratic outlook and in the peaceful coexistence of its various religious communities, is now encountering serious difficulties, which we sincerely hope it will be able to overcome.\n95.\tIn southern Africa, too, it has not yet proved possible to find solutions that are in keeping with United Nations resolutions. Admittedly, in recent months prominent African statesmen have tried to institute measures which might serve to ease tension. However, success has so far eluded them. More than ever before, it is to be feared that any further delay in the adoption of such measures which take into account legal obligations and human rights requirements might lead in the end to an armed conflict in the region with all its unforeseeable consequences.\n96.\tHappily, the bloody conflicts in Indo-China have ended. Many millions of people in that part of the world can now for the first time in decades live a life free of war. My Government, which consistently called for an end to the bloodshed in Indo-China, wel-comes this development and hopes that it will be possible quickly to heal the wounds inflicted by war on the peoples of the States concerned. Austria seeks good and friendly relations with the States of IndoChina and is also prepared, to the extent of its modest means, to contribute to their reconstruction.\n97.\tWhile a hotbed of tension has thus been eliminated in South-East Asia, a critical situation persists in Korea which might become a threat to the stability of the region. My Government maintains diplomatic relations with both States on the Korean peninsula and it will support all measures likely to contribute to a relaxation of tension, rapprochement and a trusting dialog between the parties concerned.\n98.\tInternational co-operation is also threatened by a constantly increasing production of arms, on which this year alone some $300,000 million have been spent. For years disarmament talks have been going on in Geneva with only negligible results, while the negotiations concerning a reduction of troops and armaments in Central Europe, which have been taking place in Vienna for some two years now, have so far proved fruitless.\n99.\tWith growing impatience world public opinion is awaiting progress in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] between the United States and the Soviet Union and it is becoming increasingly alarmed as the prospects grow more remote of fashioning the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons into an effective instrument against the danger of nuclear war. The Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty has proved most disappointing.\n100.\tWithout the necessary will on the part of the major States to achieve a disarmament that does not affect the balance of power or jeopardize security, it is to be feared that the disarmament negotiations will not produce any results in the future either. Nevertheless, my Government will continue to uphold the idea of a world disarmament conference, and it hopes that, with the conclusion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, conditions have now improved for achieving a reduction of the gigantic arsenal of conventional and nuclear weapons. Above all else, it is by developments in this field that world public opinion will measure the success of the policy of detente.\n101.\tThe success or failure of international co-operation will, however, be substantially influenced by the outcome of the economic and social negotiations which are ever-increasingly dominating the political world scene. It is in this very field that the United Nations has been able to take particularly useful action. It has made successful efforts through some of its bodies, such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, and through the convening of a number of large conferences, which have made it possible for the international community to become aware of the necessity and urgency of establishing a new and more just economic order and also to gain acceptance for the perception that the necessary measures can be implemented only by means of trustful co-operation and not through hostile confrontation. In this respect the seventh special session was an event full of promise, of which my Government takes a very positive view.\n102.\tThe consensus by means of which its final document [resolution 3362 (S-Vffj] was adopted has been universally assessed by all as an act of genuine political wisdom. But this same political wisdom compels us to translate into reality as rapidly as possible the decisions taken in the interests of the economically disadvantaged countries.\n103.\tOne of the most important objectives of the Charter of the United Nations was the realization and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. However, it cannot, unfortunately, be denied that the conduct of certain Member States in this field leaves much to be desired, despite all the efforts of the United Nations and all its resolutions and decisions. The number of political refugees alone, already totaling some 14 million persons, shows how little fundamental human rights and freedoms are respected in many States. In 1974 alone, 2,250,000 persons fled their homes for political reasons.\n104.\tIt is especially deplorable that not all States have yet renounced the use of torture and other inhuman and brutal forms of interrogation to which political prisoners are often subjected. This is nothing less than an abominable violation of human rights and a total disregard for human dignity.\n105.\tThe Austrian Government will continue to support every effort made in this Organization for the abolition of the death penalty, which it finds utterly reprehensible and condemns particularly as a punishment for political offenses.\n106.\tAs long as the policy of apartheid is practiced in South Africa, as long as hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees find no national homeland, as long as the Members of this Organization, under strong suspicion of violating human rights, can refuse entry to a study group of the Commission on Human Rights or engage in endless delaying tactics, the voices which denounce such injustices must not fall silent in this Assembly. For this reason I welcomed warmly the initiative taken by my Belgian colleague, Mr. van Elslande, with regard to the debate which is to take place at this session concerning ways of improving the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, that we should also consider ways and means of guaranteeing the dispatch of commissions of inquiry, together with criteria for determining their composition and method of work.\n107.\tWe must, however, recognize and praise the commendable efforts which the United Nations has made and continues to make with a view to enhancing respect for human rights and humanizing man's relations with his fellow men. For example, the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees is striving unremittingly to ease the bitter lot of these people who have had to abandon their native lands, usually losing their goods and possessions in the process. Austria regards it as a special duty to support these efforts. Since its admission to the United Nations 20 years ago, Austria has granted asylum to some 400,000 political refugees, many of whom have found a new home in Austria. For the past two years Austria has received approximately 4,000 refugees from various continents, without distinction as to race or creed.\n108.\tEqually commendable are the efforts of the United Nations with respect to the development of international law, especially humanitarian law. In this connexion I should like to mention that Austria has given its firm support to the initiatives of the United Nations and the International Red Cross for the re-codification of the international law of war. It welcomes the progress achieved at the two earlier diplomatic conferences in Geneva devoted to this question and it is seeking, together with other States, an international prohibition or restriction on the use of certain conventional weapons which cause needless suffering.\n109.\tAs a land-locked country, Austria also has a great interest in the successful conclusion of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n110.\tMany major United Nations conferences on the codification of international law have been held in Vienna recently, the latest being the conference this year which adopted the Vienna Convention on the Representation of States in Their Relations with International Organizations of a Universal Character. Since its admission to membership in the United Nations in 1955, Austria has increasingly become a country of international meetings and also the host country for larger international organizations, in particular organizations in the United Nations family. If my country aspires thus to serve the international community and especially the United Nations, it is because it is firmly convinced that it is particularly well qualified to play this role by reason of its permanent neutrality. The headquarters buildings for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency are being constructed at the expense of the Federal Government and the City of Vienna and will be completed by 1978.\n111.\tThrough the construction of these buildings, Austria is making a contribution designed to ease the financial burden of the United Nations, whose budgetary difficulties will once more be before the General Assembly this year. My Government is con-vinced that the optimum use of these premises serves the interests of the United Nations and it hopes that the\nSecretary-General's proposals in this regard will be received favorably by all Member States.\n112.\tIt was five years ago that my Government first informed this Assembly of a proposed agreed solution whereby Austria and Italy provided for the extension of the autonomy of South Tyrol and for a relevant timetable agreed to by both States. Since this question was the subject of General Assembly resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI), I again wish to report on the situation to the General Assembly in accordance with past procedure.\n113.\tI am happy to be able to state that efforts to enact remaining measures concerning the autonomy of South Tyrol continued during the past year and that a certain amount of progress has been achieved. If these efforts have, however, not led to a final conclusion, it is because these measures involve difficult problems. However, I should like to express the hope that it will be possible at a very early date to resolve this question in a satisfactory manner.\n114.\tThe great changes, both technological and political, which have taken place in the world in the past 30 years, and which will undoubtedly continue to take place, require more than ever before trustful co-operation in this Organization if mankind is to escape total annihilation. The United Nations has become more indispensable than ever before. My Government can therefore only whole-heartedly subscribe to the observation made by the Secretary- General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization. He said:\n\\\"It is widely acknowledged that in our present world there is no rational alternative in international relations to the principles and procedures of the United Nations. Discussion and compromise are the only known alternatives to oppression, conflict and bloodshed. Unilateral and bilateral diplomacy are no longer enough and must be supplemented by collective action and multilateral diplomacy.\\\" [Al 100011 Add.I, sect. XXI.}\n115.\tUpon signing the Final Act of the Conference at Helsinki, 33 European States, together with the United States and Canada, agreed upon guiding principles which are to guarantee the further friendly coexistence between States having different political systems. At the seventh special session a resolution was adopted by consensus [resolution 3362 (S-Vll)] which should allow for the promotion and establishment of a new economic order. In both cases only decisions on guiding principles were taken.\n116.\tThe next decade will show whether this promising beginning will be followed by the implementation of these principles. This will determine whether the world of tomorrow will know less tension, less suffering and more justice. For ourselves and for the United Nations, as we celebrate its thirtieth anniversary, we hope that this goal will be fully achieved.\n\n"

        "file_text": " With your kind permission, I shall address the representatives here in the name and in representation of the Head of State of the Republic of the Philippines, President Ferdinand E. Marcos. He has designated me to deliver on his behalf a special message to this thirtieth anniversary session of the General Assembly, which coincides with International Women's Year.\n31.\tLet me begin by conveying to you, Mr. President, the cordial felicitations of the Government and people of the Republic of the Philippines upon your election to the leadership of the General Assembly at such an important juncture in the life of the United Nations.\n32.\tThe Philippines joins in the warm welcome extended to the three new Members of our Organizations: Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and Mozambique. Their entry into the family of independent nations marks another milestone in the inexorable march of decolonization in Africa. We also look forward to welcoming our neighbor, Papua New Guinea, into the United Nations.\n33.\tMy country was one of the original signatories of the Charter of the United Nations and is therefore a founding Member of this world Organization. Many of you will recall that our own esteemed General Carlos P. Romulo, who later became President of the fourth session of the General Assembly, signed the Charter on behalf of the Republic of the Philippines. Having been present at its creation, the Philippines has a vital stake in the survival of the United Nations.\n34.\tAs we all know, the survival of the United Nations has been threatened for many years by a dangerous struggle for political and military advantage between two so-called \\\"worlds\\\". But underneath it a new confrontation was taking shape. As the force of historic colonialism diminished and withered away, new nations emerged a third world that sought, not supremacy, but equality and justice. This new world sought to challenge the economic and social order inherited from an age that had in fact come to an end, an order that was no longer rational or equitable or justified if indeed it had ever been.\n35.\tMy country inevitably shared in this new confrontation; we identified ourselves with other developing nations in the common search for a just distribution of the human heritage. This is why I bring with me the resurgent hope of a developing country in Asia. We dare to believe that the great and fortunate Powers of the world have at last acknowledged the aspirations of the third world.\n36.\tWe aspire not to dispossess or to deprive the rich, but to claim our legitimate heritage. For decades, we have indeed been insisting that the predatory politics of the past were formidable obstacles to our development. But there is this resurgent hope, a hope sparked by the consensus reached at the seventh special session, which marks a turning-point in world affairs. That consensus should necessarily be the primary concern of this Assembly.\n37.\tThat concern would be reflected in the reordering of priorities in the agenda of this Assembly. The various aspects of a new international economic order must rank equally in importance with the political questions of special interest to the great Powers.\n38.\tPeace is essential to development. That is why we are gratified by the spirit of conciliation and mutual accommodation that inspired the recent agreement in the Middle East. But peace is not measurable in military and political terms alone. There can be no peace in our world until conditions of life worthy of the dignity of man are achieved in the developing countries.\n39.\tCertainly we understand the importance of the search for national security. Still, we must note how the people of the world deplore the madness of an armaments race that yearly dissipates more than $300,000 million in weapons of death in the midst of mass hunger and privation in the developing countries.\n40.\tFor this reason, we cannot accept the thesis that the search for peace and the promotion of development are not concurrent but consecutive tasks. We therefore commend this Assembly for adhering to the view of the vast majority of mankind that peace and development, being inseparably interlinked, should be concurrent undertakings.\n41.\tWe could go further and suggest that the creation of a new world economic order is a proper field for the application of detente. We hope that this stage will be reached in due course. The sooner the better. It is only when detente among the great nations and the great Powers becomes a positive and substantial factor in the international economic order that it will be truly meaningful for the developing countries. The specific measures contained in the concluding resolution of the seventh special session, approved as it was by an unexpected and unprecedented unanimous vote, lay the basis and framework for pragmatic cooperation. But it remains to be seen if and how they are actually implemented.\n42.\t__ Much hard bargaining is ahead of us on the terms of international trade, on market structures in the field of raw materials and commodities, on indexation and buffer stocks, on tariff preferences, on the transfer of resources and technology, on monetary reform, on the tragic problem of food, indeed on all the aspects of a new world economic order.\n43.\tLet us not forget that with all the proliferation of conferences and resolutions, plans, funds and councils, we still find ourselves, at this mid-point of the Second United Nations Development Decade, very far indeed from a just and equitable world society. It has been many years since the United Nations officially fixed 0.7 per cent of the gross national product as a fair annual rate for assistance from industrial countries [see resolution 2626 (XXV)]. Yet even now the richest countries in the world extend development assistance in an amount far below the official United Nations target. But dare we hope that, in the new spirit of conciliation and co-operation, Member nations might be prepared to consider a more reliable means of financing development?\n44.\tThe unpredictable fluctuations in the amount of international assistance extended in any given year have made it almost impossible for national and international authorities to plan balanced development on a long-term basis. Would Member nations, rich and poor, of whatever economic or social system, be prepared to consider restructuring international development assistance by basing it on fixed assessments in accordance with objective criteria?\n45.\tUnder such a system, development could be pursued on a more stable and systematic basis, little influenced by political and military considerations. If this system is adopted, it will make the poverty of nations and the hunger of peoples a truly global and human concern. All nations should be assessed according to their capabilities as an earnest of our sincerity about pursuing the universal goal of the general consensus. International co-operation for development has become too important, too crucial a factor in the new world economic order to remain at the mercy of voluntary contributions.\n46.\tIndeed, if we are in earnest, we should be prepared, rich and poor alike, to give world development more generous and more dependable support. This we must consider now: just as the United Nations is supported by contributions from all nations, so should world development be supported. This suggestion may seem visionary to some, but to us it is attainable, a goal worth striving for.\n47.\tThat is why it is imperative to widen the dialog on the new world economic order. In this age of increasing interdependence, the United Nations is the only Organization in which the necessary dialog can be conducted and consensus achieved on the building of a new world order. The Member nations should therefore seize the opportunity to move the United Nations from the periphery to the center of world affairs. The consultations and negotiations within the United Nations system and related forums should be maintained and intensified. Every effort should also be made to enlarge the consensus among Members on each side the developed countries on the one hand, the developing countries on the other  as an essential step towards wider and more generally acceptable agreements.\n48.\tOn the side of the developing countries, an important stage in the continuing search for wider consensus will be reached in the Philippines in February 1976, when the ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 is held at Manila, in preparation for the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which will be convened at Nairobi next May.\n49.\tThe dialog, so important for the future of mankind, should no longer be left exclusively to diplomats, politicians and bureaucrats. It should not be limited to Governments bargaining with other Governments here in the General Assembly and in other international forums. The time has come to engage not only Governments but also the peoples which they represent. The time has come to bring to life the provision of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] calling for intensive, concerted mobilization of world opinion.\n50.\tWe are convinced that the creation of the new world economic order is too big a task for Governments alone to accomplish.\n51.\tIn order to implement their solemn commitments in the consensus decisions of the seventh special session, the Governments of the industrial countries will need the understanding, consent and support of their constituencies of their own peoples. So will the Governments of developing countries in discharging their own responsibilities.\n52.\tAs the Secretary-General has pointed out, the international consensus on the new world economic order must be matched by a corresponding domestic consensus. Otherwise, there is a danger that the professions of interdependence and co-operation will amount to little more than well-intentioned lip-service. The critical testing-ground will therefore be in our respective national constituencies, because the fundamental structural reforms implicit in the new world economic order will inevitably affect domestic policies and practices; they will require basic changes in political and social attitudes.\n53.\tOur appeal therefore must be directed to peoples, to their sense of what is right and fair. Certainly, our peoples can perceive that the problems of the world, including those of an economic nature, cannot be reduced to mere material terms. The solutions to the world's economic problems must have a moral basis.\n54.\tThe problems facing us today have moral roots  in injustice, intolerance, greed and dominance by the strong. Their solutions, then, if they are to be effective and enduring, cannot be sought in man's acquisitive nature but in his sense of justice and sense of community with his fellow-men.\n55.\tIt is clear that international relations including economic relations, must no longer be based merely on the balance of conflicting interests nor on the unremitting competition among nations over material objectives but on the moral principles accepted by all \nmankind justice, fair sharing, mutual understanding and co-operation, tolerance, the protection of the weak, and freedom from domination by the strong.\n56.\tThese universal moral principles could be embodied in an international code of ethics governing relations among nations. The international community has already adopted the International Development Strategy, the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] and the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)]. The idea of a code of conduct for transnational corporations has gained almost universal acceptance. We can now extend our attention to a more comprehensive international code of ethics which should guide the entire range of the behaviour of nations towards one another.\n57.\tCentral to the proposed international code of ethics are the principles of sovereign equality and self-determination, taking into account national aspirations for self-reliance and the equitable distribution of the goods of life among the nations of the world.\n58.\tA sincere commitment to an international code of ethics will free mankind from the tyrannies that have stifled the full development of so large a sector of humanity: the tyranny of circumstance, which has kept men and nations prisoners of historical events; the tyranny of power blocs, which has curtailed the rights of many nations to make autonomous decisions for the welfare of their own peoples; and the tyranny of ideological dogmas, which has constrained Governments from devising practical solutions to concrete problems.\n59.\tThe code of ethics that should animate the relations among nations is rooted in the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. It is in the very foundations of our Organization, therefore, that we should search for the solutions to the problems that confront us.\n60.\tMay we not say, too, that this code of ethics is inspired by the morality of the oppressed, the oppressed who seek not dominance but the simplest right to live as decent human beings? We have not forgotten, I trust, that our civilizations, our religions, all those great movements which exalt the human spirit have been leavened by the morality of the oppressed.\n61.\tIt is in accordance with this view that we in the Philippines have placed the moral imperative at the very heart of our development program. We believe that the goal of economic and social justice the human goal which we require of the international community should also be a cardinal aim within nations and societies. This is the very essence of the new society which President Marcos and the Philippine people are striving to build in our country.\n62.\tIt is a rare experience, on this occasion, to gain at first hand such a vivid sense of history in the making. This thirtieth session of the General Assembly provides a unique opportunity for shaping a better future for mankind.\n63.\tThe new international economic order confronts not only our instinct for survival or our natural desire tor material well-being but also the deepest values of our civilization. The challenge, therefore, is ultimately addressed to the conscience of humanity. We are called upon to create a new moral image of man.\n64.\tAt the threshold of action, we should pause and reflect on the kind of world we want for ourselves and for the generations yet to come. We could aim simply for a world of coexistence, of minimum \\\"give and take\\\", of nothing more than \\\"live and let live\\\" until the next conflict.\n65.\tBut we could raise our sights and aspire to the kind of world envisioned in our Charter: a world of compassion; a world without borders where basic human needs are concerned; a world of tolerance, of dignity, of respect and reverence for life a just world, an authentic human community.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t The Government of Luxembourg has established a record and added luster to the long line of Presidents of the General Assembly by providing the first Prime Minister to preside over a regular session of the General Assembly. On behalf of the delegation of Sri Lanka I extend to Mr. Gaston Thorn our warm congratulations and best wishes on his election as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. In the discharge of his responsibilities he may be assured of my delegation's unwavering support.\n2.\tWe take this opportunity of expressing to his predecessor in office, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, our appreciation of his able conduct of the proceedings of two sessions of the General Assembly the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session on development and international economic co-operation. The latter will rank as one of the most historic sessions in the 30 years of the United Nations existence. Mr. Bouteflika brought to the office of President the ardor and vitality of youth and, as he quite admitted, a revolutionary spirit. As the Foreign Minister of the country which at present holds the chairmanship of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, he articulated lucidly and convincingly the essence of the Movement's philosophy and policy.\n3.\tMr. Bouteflika's presidency occurred at a time when the non-aligned Movement was seen to be acquiring greater strength not merely in its membership but also as an increasingly effective moral force in the councils of the world. There is today no group of States in this Organization more advantageously placed to preserve a proper balance between conflicting ideologies and interests and to ensure that the voice of smaller nations is no longer a muffled murmur but a clarion call.\n4.\tSpeaking as the representative of the country which will have the distinction of acting as host to the fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, which will meet at Colombo in August 1976, I can assure this Assembly that we will remain loyal to the principles and policies of non- alignment as proclaimed and reaffirmed at the four summit Conferences so far held, at all of which my Prime Minister and Minister of defense and Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Sirinlavo Bandaranaike, led her country's delegation. These policies and principles are expressed in the Belgrade Declaration of 1961, the Cairo Declaration of 1964, the Lusaka Declaration of 1970 and the Algiers Declaration of 1973.\n5.\tLest we forget, I would draw attention to the provisions of the Belgrade Declaration of 1961, which 14 years later remain unimpeachably valid. In fact, the histoiy of the last 14 years has proved that the Belgrade Declaration of the non-aligned countries has been one of the principal driving forces in international affairs in the unflagging search for security, economic stability and justice for the peoples of the world.\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh), Vice-President, took the Chair.\n6.\tThe Belgrade Declaration called for the unconditional, total and final abolition of colonialism and declared support for the full restoration of all the rights of the Arab people of Palestine.\n7.\tIt expressed the conviction that all peoples should be free to dispose of their natural wealth and resources for their own ends, without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic co-operation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit and international law, and that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence.\n8.\tIt expressed the determination that no intimidation, interference or intervention should be brought to bear in the exercise of the right of self-determination of peoples.\n9.\tIt considered the establishment and maintenance of foreign military bases in the territories of other countries, particularly against their express will, a gross violation of the sovereignty of such States and called for the abolition of foreign bases as a contribution to world peace.\n10.\tIt pointed out that general and complete disarmament should include the elimination of armed forces, armaments, foreign bases and manufacture of arms as well as the elimination of institutions and installations for military training, except for purposes of internal security, the total prohibition of the production, possession and utilization of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons and bacteriological and chemical weapons, and the elimination of equipment and installations for the delivery and placement and operational use of weapons of mass destruction on national territories.\n11.\tIt considered the urgent conclusion of an agreement on the prohibition of all nuclear and .thermonuclear tests to be essential.\n12.\tIt recommended that the General Assembly, at its following session, which was to be held in 1961, adopt a decision either on the convening of a special session devoted to disarmament or on the convening of a world disarmament conference under the auspices of the United Nations.\n13.\tIt asked that efforts be made to remove the economic imbalance inherited from colonialism and imperialism; it demanded just terms of trade for the economically less developed countries and, in particular, constructive efforts to eliminate the excessive fluctuations in primary commodity trade and the restrictive measures and practices which adversely affect the trade and revenues of the newly developing countries; and in general it demanded that the fruits of the scientific and technological revolution be applied in all fields of economic development to hasten the achievement of international social justice.\n14.\tA survey of the last 14 years will reveal clearly the influence the non-aligned Movement has exerted in all spheres of international activity. The Algiers Declaration is specially noteworthy for the prominence it gives to the economic problems of developing countries and to the need for resolute action by the international community to create a new and more equitable economic order.\n15.\tAfter nearly 500 years of existence, the Portuguese colonial empire has been liquidated. We congratulate the Portuguese Government on their final relinquishment of their colonial Territories and welcome to membership in the United Nations as sovereign and independent States the former Portuguese Territories of Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe and Mozambique. We wish the peoples of those sovereign States peace, prosperity and happiness.\n16.\tWe trust that the agony of Angola will soon be ended and that the warring factions in that country will compose their differences in the cause of national unity. We are confident that the Organization of African Unity [OAU] will exercise its authority and influence to bring peace to Angola and help to weld its people into one State, united in freedom and sovereignty.\n17.\tWe extend our warmest felicitations to Papua New Guinea on its attainment of independence and look forward to its early admission to membership of the United Nations. Australia has brought great honor and credit on itself by demonstrating that the trust reposed in it by the United Nations was fully justified.\n18.\tThe record of progress towards the attainment of universality of membership has unfortunately been marred by the rejection of the applications of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam for membership. The mistakes of the past could be honorably redeemed and some slight amends made for the carnage and havoc that during more than 20 years of war have been heaped on Viet Nam by extending to those valiant people the hand of reconciliation and by welcoming them into the United Nations. If the will of the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations is to be flouted and if the Organization is to be subjected to the dominion of one, we face a grave constitutional crisis. The maintenance of international peace and security is an even greater responsibility than the admission of new Member States. If, therefore, it is considered right and proper that when the Security Council is deadlocked over the problem of the main-tenance of international peace and security the responsibility passes to the General Assembly, it could be contended with no less cogency that in regard to the admission of new Member States the General Assembly has the right to ignore the Security Council's recommendation. To make the admission of one country conditional on the admission of another is an attempt to introduce extraneous considerations not recognized in Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Charter of the United Nations. In an advisory opinion sought by the General Assembly as far back as 1948 the International Court of Justice stated on 28 May 1948 that the requisite conditions for admission to membership are only five in number. The condition invoked in justification of the exercise of the veto in this instance is not one of them. To introduce such extraneous considerations offends against the letter and spirit of the Charter.\n19.\tBy the same token, let me make it clear that my delegation must express its deep disappointment that the democratic principle of free discussion and debate was violated when the request for inscription of the application of South Korea for membership as an item on the agenda of the Security Council was rejected.\n20.\tThe period that has elapsed since the twenty- ninth session has been one of feverish activity, marked by achievements which augur well for the future if action on the decisions that have been taken is pursued in a manner consistent with the spirit behind those decisions.\n21.\tWe have in mind particularly the Sinai agreement recently concluded between Egypt and Israel. We welcome this agreement. Its architects would deserve the lasting gratitude of the world if the agreement was conceived and is executed with the genuine intention that it should provide the pattern for a complete, honorable and just settlement of the entire Middle East problem. The Sinai agreement must, therefore, with the least possible delay be supplemented by a settlement in regard to the other aspects of the Middle East problem. Some of the most vital elements of that final settlement which are still missing are the evacuation of the rest of the occupied territories and the granting to the Palestinian Arabs of the right of self-determination, including the right to their own national home and State, As the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom [2358th meeting] very succinctly expressed it, the final settlement must ensure security for Israel and justice for the Arab peoples. These are not mutually exclusive or contradictory objectives. We have stated quite emphatically and unequivocally that the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security must be recognized by one and all, but the same right must be given to all other States in the area and to the Arab peoples of Palestine.\n22.\tIt might be ritualistic, but it is certainly not realistic, to question Israel's right to exist or to ignore its existence or to threaten it with extinction. The cause of peace and the interests and future welfare of the peoples of the Middle East, in particular of the Palestinian Arabs, would be constructively advanced if we bent our efforts to securing the immediate evacuation of the occupied territories by Israel and the exercise of the undeniable right of self-determination by the Arab peoples of Palestine as well as the termination of the state of belligerency in the entire area. Any utterances and declarations regarding the retention of conquered territory, any denial of the right of all nations, including the State of Israel, to exist in peace within secure boundaries must be categorically rejected by the United Nations as inconsistent with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967. It would be the height of irresponsibility to encourage such ideas or to connive at actions in pursuance of those ideas.\n23.\tIt is in this light that we view the Sinai agreement. If it is allowed to be used as a means of securing a respite during which the occupation could become more firmly entrenched by the acquisition of overwhelming military superiority on one side and so of deferring indefinitely and even rendering impossible an honorable settlement, it would be an unmitigated disaster. This is the time for unremitting vigilance and dogged persistence in the search for a durable peace. It is not the occasion for bitter mutual recrimination. We are confident that the Government of Egypt is fully conscious of and will honorably discharge its responsibility and duty towards its fellow Arabs.\n24.\tAs we enter upon the last quarter of this century, the United Nations finds itself called upon to devote more attention to questions and measures which would help to improve the social and economic well- being and welfare of peoples throughout the world.\n25.\tWe have adopted all the declarations and resolutions that are necessary to guide us in our international economic relations, the most recent being the resolution entitled \\\"Development and international economic co-operation\\\" [resolution 3362 (S-VII)] adopted at the seventh special session of the General Assembly on 16 September 1975. What we need now are concrete measures and especially a mechanism which will help bring the new international economic order into existence without delay. Time is not on the side of the developing countries. Their economic position is deteriorating almost daily, and the relief they need so desperately is too slow in coming. Success and progress are not measured by expressions of intention, couched in Messianic declarations, especially if those declarations are diluted by strong reservations. Such declarations, however peremptory their tone, have no legally binding force and we must not let them lull us into a false sense of hope and complacency.\n26.\tThe resolution adopted at the seventh special session had only one concrete decision in the strict sense of the term, the appointment of the Ad Hoc Committee, and that, too, to consider the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system. There is little advantage in building an elaborate new structure if there is nothing of sub-stance to put into it.\n27.\tTo take my own country's case, for over two decades our economy has been ravaged by the persistent and severe decline in our terms of trade. This has been the principal impediment to economic growth and social progress in my country. The international community has recognized our special problem and included us in the list of the most seriously affected countries. For this group of countries immediate relief is the only salvation. It is imperative therefore that earnest consideration be given to the latest proposal made at the Ministerial Meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] held recently at Vienna by the Shah of Iran for a special fund operated by the oil-producing countries for the grant of low-interest loans to the least developed countries. We trust that the benefits of the proposal are intended to be extended to all countries falling within the most seriously affected category.\n28.\tHaving failed to take advantage during the sixth special session of a similar proposal by the Shah of Iran for a low-interest loan fund to be established by the OPEC and the industrialized countries, we should not once again miss the opportunity of quick relief to the most seriously affected countries which the Shah's new proposal could provide.\n29.\tWe applaud the announcement made by the Foreign Minister of Venezuela in his statement at the preceding meeting that the President of Venezuela has proposed to other member nations of OPEC the creation of a fund of between $1,500 million and $2,000 million for the non-reimbursable financing of the increase in the cost of petroleum resulting from the adjustment of prices, for the benefit of third-world countries which do not produce oil. The Shah of Iran and the President of Venezuela, Mr. Carlos Andres Perez, have set a shining example of statesmanship and shown a high sense of international responsibility. We trust that their proposals will receive early endorsement from the rest of the members of OPEC.\n30.\tLet me turn now to certain other matters in which my country has a special interest.\n31.\tThe Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean has continued its work in accordance with General Assembly resolution 3259 A (XXIX) of 9 December 1974. The littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean have been holding consultations with a view to convening a conference on the Indian Ocean. We regret very much that the co-operation that was expected of the great Powers and the major maritime nations is, with two notable exceptions China and Japan still being withheld from us. We deplore the refusal of the other great Powers and major maritime nations even to enter into an exchange of views with us. The reasons they have given are far from convincing.\n32.\tMy delegation would like to make it clear that the concept of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace and the efforts we are making to translate it into reality are not directed against any particular bloc. Its purpose is to rid the Indian Ocean area of all foreign military presence, without any exception. It is not our intention that the arms race and competition between the great Powers should be replaced by a similar form of rivalry between countries of the region. We do not believe in replacing Satan by Beelzebub.\n33.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held its third session at Geneva from 17 March to 9 May 1975. The most constructive achievement of that session was the agreement reached, without dissent, that the Chairmen of the three Main Committees should prepare an informal single negotiating text covering all issues entrusted to their respective Committees. These texts were not to be regarded as negotiated texts or compromise texts. They were to serve purely as a procedural device to set in motion the process of negotiation. In addition, the President of the Conference has taken upon himself the responsibility of preparing an informal single negotiating text on the question of dispute settlement. Provision for dispute settlement must form an indispensable element in the future law of the sea.\n34.\tThe stage is now set for negotiations to commence in all seriousness, and I hope that when the next session meets in New York on 15 March 1976 all participants will come fully prepared to discharge their responsibility. We must strive to reach agreement during 1976. The longer we delay, the greater the danger of unilateral action, which could prove fatal to the conclusion of the universally acceptable convention which we all devoutly desire.\n35.\tThere are still areas of this planet where opportunities remain for constructive and peaceful cooperation on the part of the international community for the common good of all rather than for the benefit of a few. Such an area is the Antarctic continent. While we would refrain at this stage from commenting on the attitudes of States regarding the legal status of this last dark continent, or portions of it, there can be no doubt that there are vast possibilities for a new initiative that would redound to the benefit of all mankind. Antarctica is an area where the now widely accepted ideas and concepts relating to international economic co-operation, with their special stress on the principle of equitable sharing of the world's resources, can find ample scope for application, given the cooperation and good will of those who have so far been active in that area.\n36.\tIt may be noted that the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 was designed solely to preserve the area exclusively for peaceful purposes, to promote international co-operation in the conduct of scientific research and to prevent the continent from becoming the scene or object of international discord. Our reference to the resources of that continent should not be construed as an attempt to hinder the programs of scientific research that have already been instituted or that may' be instituted in the future in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty. At the same time, I should make it clear that the question of the status of Antarctica is in no way linked with the issues before the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and, therefore, this question should not delay agreement on a new Convention on the Law of the Sea. The mention of this subject will not, I hope, create a flutter in any dovecotes.\tJ\n37 In deference to the President's appeal that lenghty statements be avoided at this stage, I shall not touch on other important questions such as apartheid, racial\ndiscrimination and disarmament, all of which could be covered in the appropriate Committees.\n38. I cannot, however, avoid a brief reference to the new item on the agenda regarding the prohibition of underground testing. This was promised to the world in 1963, and it was expected that it would be realized by 1968. Twelve years have elapsed since the signing of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water and the same excuse is given: that without reliable means of verification a ban on underground testing would not be enforceable. The prohibition of underground testing, however, is not, by itself, likely to reduce in the least the threat of nuclear war, which we all want to avert, unless other related and essential measures accompany it. We have stated before, and we should like to repeat today, that nuclear disarmament cannot be achieved without agreement on and the simultaneous implementation of four measures. Those who have attained what would appear to be final perfection  if there is such a thing in the development of the most advanced and sophisticated nuclear weapons systems cannot reasonably expect others who are lagging far behind them to accept their overwhelming superiority in nuclear technology and weaponry as constituting the best safeguard against nuclear war. The comprehensive program which we propose and which we have proposed before must comprise: first, a categorical undertaking by the nuclear Powers not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States; secondly, the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty; thirdly, the total cessation of the manufacture of nuclear weapons and the freezing of the existing stockpile of nuclear weapons; and, fourthly, the phased dismantling of the apparatus of nuclear terror.\n39.\tWe have referred to the need for an undertaking on the part of the nuclear Powers not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States. If the threat of nuclear war is to be eliminated altogether, there must be a categorical renunciation of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against anyone. The renunciation of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would remove all justification for the manufacture or possession of such weapons. There is nothing in the conduct of the major nuclear Powers to indicate that they are willing to move in that direction. Given the scale and quality of their nuclear armoury and their continued competition in the production of even deadlier weapons, all talk of strategic arms limitation [SALT] must be taken with a pinch of salt. It must have taken an unconscious humourist to provide such an appropriate acronym for the talks on this subject. However, with a robust faith in the inevitability of gradualness, we do not despair of progress in this sphere.\n40.\tBefore concluding, I should like to express once again my delegation's appreciation of the work of the members of the international civil service, headed by our distinguished and conscientious Secretary-Gen- eraj. As a civil servant myself, I am aware that every civil service has its dead wood. But there are large numbers in the Secretariat of the United Nations and 'n the rest of the international civil service within the family of the United Nations who continue to discharge their duties with single-minded devotion, conspicuous\nefficiency and admirable impartiality to make the United Nations and specialized agencies and other related organs effective instruments of the wishes and will of their members. The morale of the international civil service could best be preserved and efficiency encouraged by a sound appointments and promotions policy which would give due recognition and reward to merit over all other considerations, without prejudice to the principle of equitable geographic distribution. We need and the world deserves the highest standards of efficiency within the international civil service if we are to meet and overcome the challenges that will face the United Nations and allied organizations in the years ahead.\n41.\tAs for the States Members of the United Nations, they could acquit themselves best if there were, on the one hand, a clear appreciation of what a well-known American diplomat has termed the \\\"discipline of power\\\" and, on the other hand, an equally clear recognition of the power of discipline.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me, in the first place, to congratulate you on your election to the high office of President of the thirtieth anniversary session of the General Assembly. We are greeting you as a prominent politician, representative of a country which has been linked with ours by relations of long standing and business-like co-operation. Your election testifies to recognition of you, personally, and that of Luxembourg's constructive efforts on the international forum.\n41.\tAt the same time, we address our assurances of appreciation today to the President of the twenty- ninth regular session and the seventh special session of the General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika. We thank him for his outstanding contribution of work during the two sessions.\n42.\tPoland is happy to welcome the new Members of the United Nations: the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. The admission of these States to membership in the United Nations is but another confirmation of the fact that the remnants of the colonial epoch are disappearing from the map of the world and our Organization is becoming ever more universal.\n43.\tAmong the newly admitted Member States we miss the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam, in spite of these two States' applications for admission. By its heroic struggle the people of Viet Nam has proved its steadfast love of freedom and independence. The two Vietnamese States have given ample evidence of their respect for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and they are fully qualified to become Members of the Organization. Poland firmly supports the admission of the two Vietnamese States to membership in the United Nations.\n44.\tThe international situation of today is characterized by the gradual growth of the process of detente; more and more Governments are intensifying their efforts to achieve a durable peace and international security. Not only big States, but medium-sized and small alike, are assuming an ever greater role in international life. For lasting peace, security and socioeconomic progress can only be achieved in conditions of detente, peaceful coexistence and equitable and mutually beneficial international co-operation.\n45.\tThe present session revives the memory of two outstanding events of 30 years ago: the victory of the anti-Nazi coalition over fascism, and the establishment of our Organization. Those two events are historically interrelated.\n46.\tThe United Nations was created \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\". It was established by a collective effort of the peoples that had united to restore and maintain international peace and security. To achieve those goals it was necessary first to conquer fascism and Hitler nazism, which had unleashed the Second World War and indeed trampled under foot all human rights. The teachings of that epoch-making tragedy underlie the foundations of the Charter of the United Nations. Therefore, that Charter's purposes and principles are as lasting and as constantly timely as the memory of the victims of the Second World War is sacred.\n47.\tIf one looks back on the developments of the past 30 years of the United Nations, one can say that it has proven possible to bring closer the implementation of the purposes outlined by the founding fathers of this Organization. From a period of tensions and cold war we turn to detente, which embraces ever new spheres of international relations; we turn to ever broader practical applications of the principles of peaceful coexistence. For the first time in the past 30 years, nowhere in the world is there an open armed conflict among States.\n48.\tWhile the arms race has not yet been arrested and the danger of a nuclear war has not been averted, while numerous acute and difficult problems continue to exist and the vestiges of colonialism and neocolonialism must still be eliminated, while detente has not yet reached all the regions, we may say with satisfaction that in the past 30 years we have gone a long way, from war to peace, from cold war to peaceful co-operation.\n49.\tInternational developments pose a question before all States as well as before this Organization: what should be the further nature of the processes of detente, what content should they be given and what should be done to accelerate them and make them irreversible?\n50.\tIn order to achieve those goals it is necessary fully to implement the principles of peaceful coexistence, to supplement political detente by military detente and to limit the arms race; it is necessary to build mutual confidence and expand all-round international co-operation. The United Nations must assume an important role in tackling that great task.\n51.\tMay I be allowed in this connexion to dwell upon some conclusions which flow from the recent but already historic Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe? Indeed, the decisions reached at that Conference are bringing to an end once and for all the post-war period on the European continent and represent a strong foundation for peaceful, friendly and mutually advantageous co-operation among the participating States. The Conference has had an important bearing not only on Europe but also on the entire international situation. Recognizing as we do the close interdependence between peace and security in Europe and peace and security in the world at large, we remain convinced that the greatest contribution Europe can make to the peaceful development of the world is to turn that continent into a region of peace and peaceful co-operation.\n52.\tIn easing tensions in Europe along the line between the two most powerful military and political groupings we thereby contribute to the consolidation of peace and security all over the world; we thus release the energies and resources of European nations for the benefit of their more effective participation in the solution of global problems.\n53.\tThe Final Act of the Helsinki Conference expresses the full support of European States for the United Nations. The Decalogue of principles governing relations between the participating States represents both a reaffirmation and a development of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations as well as of those solemnly proclaimed in the General Assembly's Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV), annex] and the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. The principles of territorial integrity and inviolability of frontiers, signifying renunciation once and for all of all territorial claims which in the past gave rise to tensions, conflicts and wars, are of fundamental importance for the peaceful future of Europe.\n54.\tThe broad Program in the field of economic relations based on equal rights, as outlined by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, is part and parcel of European security. Indeed, it should consolidate the material infrastructure of peace. The decisions of the Conference regarding cultural exchanges and other contacts create conditions for strengthening confidence and understanding among nations. The implementation of those decisions should serve to promote noble humanistic values, with due respect for the traditions, customs and laws of every nation.\n55.\tIn the spirit of that Conference, and while it was taking place, an agreement was reached between the Governments of the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concerning the basis for normalization of their mutual relations, signed at Warsaw on 7 December 1970. The agreement has created foundations for further expanding relations between the two States and is a contribution to strengthening detente in Europe.\n56.\tThe decisions contained in the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference represent a great common victory of all the participants in the Conference, of all the forces favoring peaceful coexistence. We believe also that they bring closer the prospect of establishing an all-European system of collective security.\n57.\tPoland declared in Helsinki, and now from this world rostrum resolutely reaffirms, its will to participate actively in carrying out the decisions of the Conference and to implement them for the good of our own and other peoples.\n58.\tWe are convinced that the United Nations can become a forum for the universalization of these positive European experiences and their extension to other parts of the world.\n59.\tBecause of the growing spiral of armaments, an urgent task in the present phase of international relations is the intensification of efforts to limit the arms race and embark upon disarmament measures. The present situation, on the one hand, imposes the necessity of seeking substantial progress in the field of disarmament and, on the other, offers possibilities for such progress. The United Nations, as a most important forum for multilateral negotiations, has a special role to play in working out effective measures to contain the arms race and bring progress in the field of disarmament.\n60.\tNegotiations and agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States, including the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, are making an important contribution to the cause of international security and disarmament.\n61.\tThe special responsibility of the big Powers for peace and international security in no way diminishes the obligation of the entire international community to promote progress in the sphere of disarmament. Every State, notwithstanding its military and economic potential, can and should make its own contribution to the process of negotiations and constructive disarmament measures. The most suitable forum for discus-sion of these matters, with the participation of all States, ought to be the World Disarmament Conference.\n62.\tLikewise we attach great importance to the Vienna talks on mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. They should now enter a more effective phase.\n63.\tThe States of the socialist community have consistently presented in the United Nations a Program of specific undertakings towards disarmament. They include reduction of military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and the utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries; the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons; the complete elimination of chemical weapons.\n64.\tWe welcome the submission by the USSR and the United States of America, at the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, of draft conventions on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques.\n65.\tThe Soviet initiative, which we support, concerning the conclusion of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapons tests meets the stipulations contained inter alia in numerous\nUnited Nations resolutions and in the recent decisions of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries at Lima.\n66.\tWe also led our full support to the new important initiative on the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass annihilation, and of new systems of such weapons, submitted in this forum by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR, Andrei Gromyko [2357th meeting}.\n67.\tOne of the indispensable conditions for reducing and eliminating the risk of a nuclear war is the full effectiveness and universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]. We trust that the course and results of the Review Conference of the Parties to that Treaty will contribute to the implementation of those objectives. Similarly, the establishment of nuclear-free zones in different regions of the world would also serve to strengthen the non-proliferation system.\n68.\tWhile stressing the positive factors of the world situation, we do not lose sight of the fact that serious tensions still exist in different parts of the world.\n69.\tIn Chile, the Fascist terror continues its criminal work of destruction of the democratic forces of its people.\n70.\tIn the Middle East, although the sound of guns has died down, we do not believe that, short of comprehensive solutions as provided for in the well- known Security Council resolutions, or outside the Geneva Peace Conference, it will be possible to settle the problems of that region. The Arab people of Palestine is still deprived of its own statehood.\n71.\tWith regard to Cyprus, General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) remains unimplemented.\n72.\tIn South Africa, the racist regime pursues its policy of apartheid, recognized by the United Nations as a crime against humanity. It continues its illegal occupation of Namibia.\n73.\tIn Southern Rhodesia, as in the past, the indigenous population remains subjugated to the yoke of racism.\n74.\tAll these are flagrant examples of infringements on the indivisibility of peace and peaceful coexistence, self-determination of peoples and social progress.\n75.\tThe need to fortify our efforts towards the consolidation of a peaceful future for the world makes it imperative also to draw more attention to questions of security in Asia, the greatest continent of the world. A suitable solution for problems arising there could be found, we submit, in the implementation of the Soviet proposal concerning the establishment of a system of collective security on that continent.\n76.\tPoland believes also that adoption at the present session of a General Assembly resolution on the creation of favorable conditions for converting the armistice in Korea into a durable peace and accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea would represent a contribution to the solution of the question of Korea and to the further easing of tensions in Asia.\n77.\tPeace, international security, detente and disarmament are the indispensable prerequisites for the development of all States, for all-round co-operation among them and for the creation of a new, just, international economic order.\n78.\tThrough its active bilateral and multilateral relations Poland is developing international economic co-operation and trade both with States of the socialist community, with which we are closely linked in the framework of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, as well as with States with different economic, social and political systems, be they developing or developed. The Government of the Polish People's Republic will also further expand its participation in the work of the economic organizations of the United Nations system.\n79.\tWe believe that the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] and the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)] are of paramount importance in building up international economic relations based on new and equitable principles. The recently concluded seventh special session of the General Assembly has likewise been an important forum for debate and constructive decisions.\n80.\tThe reconstruction of international economic relations has become a necessity since the existing mechanisms of international economic co-operation meet neither the interests of the developing countries nor those of the socialist States, and thus no longer conform to the needs of the majority of States Members of this Organization. The new principles and instruments embodied in the decisions of the sixth special session of the General Assembly and in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties, as well as in the decisions of the seventh special session, should serve the interests of the entire international community; they should provide for the dynamic, economic development of all countries, in particular the developing countries; they should regulate equitable economic co-operation among all States on a non-discriminatory basis and for the mutual benefit of all the parties concerned.\n81.\tWe rest assured that economic development and the elimination of imbalances throughout the world will intensify broad economic co-operation, thereby becoming an important element of consolidation of detente and peace.\n82.\tPoland owes its independent existence and position in the world to the socialist system. Socialism has generated a dynamic rise in Poland's socio-economic growth. Friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union and with other States of the socialist community have become the corner-stone of our security and have made it possible successfully to solve problems of development in accordance with the principles of fraternal assistance and mutual advantage. New prospects for our development and for the growth of the well-being of the broad masses will be mapped out by the forthcoming seventh Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party.\n83.\tWe also consider the consolidation of peace and security, the irreversible establishment of detente and its extension to new spheres of international life to be a condition for the successful implementation of our own plans to promote the socio-economic development and further improvement of the standards of living of our own people.\n84.\tToday, the community of socialist States remains the driving force behind the positive transformations in the world. Its constructive policies have an important impact upon the normalization of world relations and the consolidation of international peace and security.\n85.\tIn the social field also there are many issues calling for action. I shall confine myself to two of them.\n86.\tThe first issue is the situation of women in the world. The recent World Conference of the International Women's Year, held at Mexico City in June and July, has listed a number of obstacles hampering the implementation of the rights and legitimate aspirations of women and has defined problems whose solution is still pending. We support the decisions of the Conference and declare ourselves in favour of their constructive implementation, seeing in it an important element of social progress.\n87.\tThe second issue is the question of education for peace. It is in the interest of mankind and its future that the lofty ideals of the Charter of the United Nations be impressed upon the young generations. May I recall in this context the appeal addressed last year, from this very rostrum, by the spokesman of the people of Poland, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Edward Gierek:\n\\\"Let us do everything possible to make the remaining quarter of this century, a century which has seen untold suffering brought upon mankind, an era of peaceful construction and of peace-oriented education.\\\"4\n88.\tThe 30-year record of accomplishment of the United Nations comprises the over-all effort of Member States to consolidate international peace and security and to expand all-round, mutually beneficial co-operation among nations. The same purpose is also well served by the dynamic activity of our Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim.\n89.\tIt is our sincere hope that in conditions of detente, the United Nations will prove able in the years to come to move further and more effectively towards the full implementation of the purposes and principles of its Charter. Poland, which has always been active in defending the letter and spirit of the Charter, also wishes on this occasion to reiterate emphatically that the road to making the work of this Organization more effective does not lie in the revision of the Charter; it lies in a strict respect for its principles and provisions in the practice of international relations, and through a fuller utilization of the constructive possibilities offered by the Charter. The Charter of the United Nations has successfully stood the test of life and has served in the solution of problems posed by the diversified and complex world of our times.\n90.\tI wish to assure this Assembly that, as always, the Polish People's Republic will continue to persevere in seeking greater effectiveness for the United Nations, the expansion of all-round international cooperation, acceleration of socio-economic development, detente, international security and peace throughout the world.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\n140.  There can be no more pleasant duty for me than to extend to Mr. Thorn my congratulations and those of the Algerian delegation on his assumption of the presidency of this session of the General\nAssembly. His qualifications for assuming such a responsibility and his own personal merits are sufficiently well known and sufficiently numerous for me not to have to expatiate on them in a way in which many speakers before me have done so eloquently. As he is a friend, I should only like to add that his election to lead the work of our Assembly does him honor as well as being a tribute to his country, Luxembourg, whose eminently positive role in the European Economic Community is known to us, and whose preoccupations and concerns are very often analogous to ours in a world where all too often reason is divorced from power.\n141.\tSince I have often on previous occasions underlined all the qualities possessed by our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, I do not wish to offend his modesty by repeating here our deep appreciation of his tireless devotion to the service of our Organization and his invaluable contribution to its effulgence.\n142.\tThe President and members of the Assembly will understand that I cannot conform with that part of established custom which dictates that one pay a tribute to the President of the last session. But to all those who in their statements found something to praise in the way in which I discharged my responsibilities, I should like to say how touched I am by their friendship and to remind them that my task would have indeed been impossible if I had not been able to rely on their support and their understanding.\n143.\tTo compensate for its many drawbacks, my present position as the last speaker in the general debate provides me with the privilege of benefiting from all the analyses which have already been made here. We have, of course, had an opportunity once again to note the differences of opinion which have become customary. But there seems to be a fairly widespread feeling that a new spirit is emerging in the relations among nations, and that the confrontation which was predicted by some and which we all feared has finally given way to the beginning of a most promising co-operation. Since we have always advocated dialog in a free and loyal spirit, we can only rejoice at this feeling, to the extent that the expressions on which it is based embody a genuine desire on the part of all to accept and encourage those changes that are turning international society upside down. In the harmony that we wish to see reigning here, moderation in some quarters should in no case encourage or justify immobility on the part of others, and a spirit of realism on the part of all should in the final analysis provide a sufficiently positive trend to calm any impatience, and one reasonably calculated to neutralize any possible apprehensions.\n144.\tThe discussions at the sixth special session and the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly undoubtedly made it possible to bring out sharply the failures of the international system that had governed us for more than a quarter of a century. That revelation and the shock engendered by a serious economic crisis brought about an awareness among the developed countries that the situation was rapidly and dangerously running away from them and that they finally had to face up to radical changes that had been delayed for so long.\n145.\tIt was in that context that some suddenly evinced their disquiet about the affirmation an\naffirmation that was, however, foreseeable and far from spontaneous of a new majority which disturbed the old balance that had been so convenient for their interests. However, this is one of those facts whose prior acceptance is essential if a climate of understanding is to be established in our Organization.\n146.\tThat acceptance should, furthermore, easily derive from an attachment to the democratic principles professed by those who differ from the majority. But it is precisely in the name of that democracy that an attempt is made to detract from the importance of the part played by the countries making up the majority of our community. That dialectic would have some validity if those who use it and who boast of their allegedly democratic traditions had the same respect for other peoples and demonstrated in their international behavior those virtues that should underlie democracy.\n147.\tSimilarly, I should like to take up a reference that is frequently, and sometimes surprisingly, made to the concept of the universality of our Organization. Those who speak about it most frequently now did not seem to be very convinced of it in the recent past, and this sudden conversion has inevitably led to some doubts about the sincerity of their intentions. Our concept of the universality of the Organization is very clear, and we have already had an opportunity to formulate it. We consider that this universality is an ideal towards which the Organization should be guided, because its realization would mean that all the Members of the international community had the same faith in the principles of the charter and committed themselves to respect those principles. But that fundamental condition cannot be sacrificed to the search for universality at all costs, which would give access to this Organization to certain elements bent on bringing about its speedy destruction.\n148.\tNothing should prohibit the admission of new Members that pledge to accept the obligations of the Charter; that kind of admission should not be subject to any other requirement that could be a matter for bargaining or any kind of political operations. However, that is precisely what has occurred twice recently in the Security Council in respect of the admission of the Republic of South Viet Nam and the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam. The fact that the United States of America explained the negative vote it cast on those two occasions by its adherence to the principle of universality deserves, perhaps, to be emphasized, but it hardly needs any comment. For it was by referring to that very principle that the United States opposed the suspension of South Africa to cite only one particularly significant example. If I did not fear I might err on the side of exaggeration, I would say that this is really a quite curious form of universality that, while excluding those which voluntarily assume the obligations of the Charter, automatically extends to all those which glory in systematically contravening the Charter's provisions.\n149.\tBut that behavior on the part of a permanent member of the Security Council prompts us to pay particular attention to the serious consequences that could result from the arbitrary use of the right of veto, The assurances given by the great Powers on the way in which they intended to use this privilege seem to have been lost in oblivion, and in the archives of our\nOrganization. However, it seems quite clear that the right of veto, which is part and parcel of a precise philosophy and of well known intentions, cannot be left to the total discretion of the countries that benefit from it and that, furthermore, hardly need it to secure the paramount role which belongs to them in the regulation of world affairs.\n150.\tAll this indicates, at any rate, that there is a need to reopen the discussion on the various elements contained in our Charter. The fact that that Charter has dominated international life for more than 30 years now does not necessarily prove that it is always responsive to the needs of our times. It is undoubtedly the application of the Charter that is far from being perfect. We willingly concede that point, but that makes it even more necessary, as we see it, to engage in a thorough study of the reasons why the Charter has not been respected, and of the measures to be provided for in it to ensure that it is implemented more seriously and more effectively.\n151.\tEveryone agrees in recognizing the importance of the changes that have occurred on the international scene during the past year. The super-Powers continue to seek in their mutual relations a balance based on a recognized division of their responsibilities. And the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has extended to the rest of the developed world the principles underlying a detente that, generally speaking, has been greeted with much hope.\n152.\tIt is important in that connexion that the will expressed at Helsinki to define international relations on the basis of security and co-operation not be limited to the prosperous areas of the world, and that detente, which has proved to be so necessary in this day and age, should be extended to other parts of the world: to Africa, beset by racism and exploitation; to the Middle East, where the Arab peoples are still denied their most legitimate rights; to the Mediterranean, where the crisis in Cyprus is worsening; to the Indian Ocean, where jockeying for position is seriously threatening the coastal States; and, finally, to all the parts of the third world exposed to aggression and economic blackmail. It is only that way that genuine detente can be brought about and thus promote a constructive dialog that will be to the benefit of the entire international community.\n153 It would indeed be vain to hide behind a \\\"Euro-centrism\\\" that excluded the rest of the world. How can we dissociate European security from the threats which so dangerously affect the Mediterranean area? More than a year has passed since Cyprus had visited upon it, as the result of foreign instigation, events which are of major concern to the international community because of the very geographical position of the island and the nature of the political and human problems o which those events give rise. Despite the complexity of the situation, we remain convinced that thebonds that have been forged by history between the two communities on the island wil withstand ^ vicissitudes of the present day and will make it possible for those two communities to find in their diversity as in their national goals, the ways and means likely to result, through dialog and nego iat n n peacetu solutions that will preserve the legitimate \\\"Jererts of all and, at the same time, guarantee the non-ahgn\nment, independence, integrity and territorial unity of the island, free from any foreign military presence.\n154.\tIt is precisely because two major wars started in Europe that we cannot dissociate European security from that of the rest of the world.\n155.\tFor example, tension has been stepped up in the Indian Ocean because of new imperialist undertakings. Whereas that region should serve to promote unity, peace and co-operation, it is in the course of becoming an area of confrontation in which the security and independence of the coastal States are overtly threatened. The situation is slowly but surely moving towards a state of crisis which is at present latent but may at any time take on uncontrollable dimensions. The community of nations therefore has the duty of forcefully reaffirming its desire to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace, free of the presence of any foreign naval forces.\n156.\tHowever, in the rest of the world\u2014that is, in other countries of the third world\u2014a slow and difficult trend is continuing towards the accomplishment of the goals of political liberation and economic development, thanks to the persevering and often courageous action of their peoples.\n157.\tThe lifting of the blockade against Cuba, which was decided on at the Costa Rica meeting of the Organization of American States, while confirming the results of the courageous struggle of the Cuban people and the farsightedness of its leaders, undoubtedly represented an important success for the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in Latin America.\n158.\tThe victory so dearly won by the peoples of Viet Nam and Cambodia has created a new situation in South-East Asia and must necessarily have an impact on the rest of Asia. A hotbed of war, which for many years had threatened international peace and security, has thus been extinguished; but building peace, a genuine and lasting peace, in that area will indeed be an arduous task, not only because of the tremendous ruins that have been created by war and the extent of the damages suffered by the countries and their populations, but also because of the breadth of the social and political changes entailed in such a fundamental conversion of the machinery of war into machinery of peace. We have no doubt that those peoples which could display so much courage and tenacity during the long years of their difficult struggle, and knew how to show imperialism the limits of its power will be able to shoulder their new responsibilities with the same valour and the same resolve, once again winning the unstinting admiration of the rest ot he world The sacrifices they have made were not only the price of their freedom and independence; they are the most precious contribution possible to the rehabilitation of small nations and an invaluable contribution to the establishment of a fairer international order. The international community must for its part show its recognition of what has been done and assure those peoples of its sympathy and solidarity with them ,n the task of reconstruction that they have undertaken.\n159 We already had occasion to express our indignation at the fact that the request for admission to the United Nations of the two Vietnamese Republics has been rejected. This rejection which in itself is intolerable becomes even more reprehensible when it is a\nquestion of countries which, more than many others, deserve their place amongst us. Our Organization is thus once again passing up an opportunity to play its genuine role of bringing about better understanding among peoples.\n160.\tA serious error compounded by serious injustice towards the Cambodian people has, fortunately, been repaired by the return to our Organization of the authentic representatives of Cambodia. This restitution of justice is exclusively the result of the efforts of the Cambodian people, which by its victorious actions made it inevitable. It might also have been the work of our Organization and might thus have spared the people of Cambodia additional suffering as a result of the futile prolongation of a senseless war. For that, it would have been necessary for the voice of reason to be heeded, and primarily by those who today still persist in their erroneous ways.\n161.\tWe are all the more pleased to welcome the presence of the delegation of Cambodia in this Assembly, since we regard it as the symbol of the victory of its people and\u2014no less important for us of the triumph of reason within our Organization.\n162.\tWill reason equally be able to triumph in the case of the problems that still have to be solved? Shall we finally see our Organization rid itself of the obstacles which it erected itself against the peaceful reunification of Korea? We believe that it is now high time finally to close this chapter of the cold war, which seems interminable and whose pages are not particularly to the credit of the United Nations. It is high time that this Organization play a positive part in the solution of the Korean problem, by first demanding the withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea and then leaving it to the Koreans themselves to settle their internal disputes, free from any external interference.\n163.\tWith regard to the Middle East, our concerns are identical with those expressed here by all delegations; they are ail the keener since the evaluations of the situation are so contradictory, as are the predictions that have been made about its future evolution.\n164.\tThe problem, as we all know, is highly complex and brings into play as many objective factors as subjective elements. Its prolongation has increased its complexity through the unleashing of a number of wars and the accumulation of their effects. But its core is still the question of the future of the Palestinian people.\n165.\tThe recognition and satisfaction of the rights of the Palestinian people are the fundamental elements in any true solution to the Middle East crisis. It took a long time for international opinion to accept this truth, and the General Assembly finally enshrined it in its resolution 3236 (XXIX). There is virtue in any demarche in favor of a settlement of the Middle East problem only in so far as it takes into account the national rights of the Palestinian people and facilitates their realization.\n166.\tThe Palestine Liberation Organization responded to the confidence placed in it by the international community by accepting that recognition as an additional responsibility which it fully assumed in its actions.\n167.\tIn its struggle for freedom, the people of Palestine, at the international level, already has rights and will shortly have duties which call for greater recognition by the international community and which should be formulated more daringly and clearly. If, following the example of what has been done in the case of other peoples, the legitimacy of its struggle is no longer contested, there is still in the present situation some merit in providing the Palestinian people with more marked assistance.\n168.\tThe Arab countries in the region, in particular those a part of whose territory is still occupied by Israel, undoubtedly have every right to do everything in their power to defend their territorial integrity. They are better placed than anyone to appreciate their true interests and to choose the most appropriate means of defending them. As we see it, there is no other limitation to this freedom of action except the interests of the other Arab countries, the strengthening of their global struggle and the protection of the Palestinian cause. With that proviso, we shall not cease to give our full support to any action by the Arab countries in the region aimed at the recovery of their territories and at ensuring their security. We believe that it is within this precise framework that we must consider the latest measures that have been adopted. We understand equally both the satisfaction of Egypt, which is making progress in the recovery of its territories, and the legitimate apprehensions of the other Arab countries and of the Palestinians.\n169.\tUnder no circumstance would we wish to aggravate dissensions between sister countries in the region whose immediate and long-term interests call for the fullest solidarity. But we must agree with those who, for various reasons, have expressed their skepticism or concern over the new situation which has thus been created; as we see it, this concern is founded above all on the commitments undertaken by the United States to strengthen considerably the military potential of Israel and on the introduction into that already very sensitive region of United States technicians sent as observers. We are not convinced that this represents true progress towards a satisfactory settlement of the Middle East question, since it is based on an unequal bargain in which one side is \\\"selling\\\" what does not belong to it, whereas the other is recovering only part of what belongs to it and above all because that progress is not directed towards the satisfaction of the national rights of the Palestinian people.\n170.\tWe are told that this is no more than a first step which is soon to be followed by others. If this is so, perhaps then our pessimism is premature and unfounded. But no one should have any illusions as to the dangers inherent in the present situation and the even greater dangers which would result from its exploitation to strengthen the position of Israel and weaken the unity of the Arab countries. The international community, in any event, should follow these developments with the greatest care and vigilance if it wants to avoid finding itself in the midst of a venture leading inevitably to disastrous consequences.\n171.\tThe progress of decolonization of the African continent has been hailed universally as a victory of the struggle for liberation of peoples, and also as a success of the United Nations. The task of decolonization\ncarried thus to its successful conclusion will be one of the greatest claims to glory of our Organization and one of the most remarkable achievements of its 30 years of existence. It has made it possible to put an end to the period of colonial domination and exploitation and, by encouraging the emergence of young and free nations, it has given a completely new face to the international scene. These changes are the direct consequence of action that was sought and encouraged by the world community as a whole, and must be accepted as such, just as the changes they entail in the structures of the old international order must also be accepted with good grace.\n172.\tThis year we have the pleasure of welcoming in our midst three new States: the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, and the Republic of Cape Verde. I wish to reiterate our wishes for their success and prosperity, while assuring them of our friendship and our continued and brotherly support.\n173.\tHowever, the situation prevailing in Angola appears to us to be of great concern, all the more so since that country is located within the limits of southern Africa, with its endless problems and repercussions. While that country is preparing to accede to independence, the internecine struggles among its liberation movements are already compromising the future of the State for which they have fought. We hope that the attempts now being made within the framework of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] to calm rivalries and unite the liberating forces will be crowned with speedy success. We appeal to all the leaders of the Angolan movements to put aside their resentments and rancor and rise above their temporary differences, pursuing the single goal of achieving the independence for which they have already made so many sacrifices, and rejecting any foreign intervention which would constitute a serious threat in the future to the sovereignty of the Angolan State which they intend to build.\n174.\tSince I am speaking of African questions and decolonization, I should like to say a few words about a liberation problem of direct concern to my country, that of the Sahara under Spanish domination. This problem has aroused a certain amount of concern since last year. At its last session, in fact, the General Assembly, accepting a request submitted by Morocco and supported by Mauritania and Algeria, asked the International Court of Justice to provide an advisory opinion concerning certain juridical aspects of the problem [resolution 3292 (XXIX)]. For its part, the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples decided to send a Visiting Mission to the Sahara, as well as to the different countries concerned, that is, Spain, Morocco, Algeria and Mauritania.\n175.\tThe process of organizing the self-determination referendum has been provisionally suspended until such time as the International Court of Justice hands down its advisory opinion. The latter will no doubt make it possible better to appreciate both the Moroccan and the Mauritanian claims over the Saharan Territory. The Algerian Government, for its part, has already proclaimed, and repeats here solemnly, that it makes no claim over any part whatsoever of that Territory,\nbut that it considers that it is directly concerned in the manner in which decolonization will be carried out, since it naturally affects the peace and the future of the region to which Algeria belongs.\n176.\tThe General Assembly has always envisaged this decolonization through the exercise by the people of the Sahara of its right to self-determination. Even when it agreed to suspend procedures pending the advisory opinion of the International Court, it made a point of reaffirming the right to self-determination of the populations of the Spanish Sahara and clearly stated that the request to the International Court was made without prejudice to the application of the principles contained in resolution 1514 (XV) on decolonization.\n177.\tThe Algerian Government therefore considers that the route leading to the final decolonization of the Sahara is quite clear. The support that my Government, together with Morocco and Mauritania, has always given to General Assembly resolutions on this question does not permit it to envisage any other way of putting an end to Spanish domination over the Sahara than through the holding of a referendum on self-determination, to be both supervised and guaranteed by the United Nations. Such a solution, incidentally, would not be in conflict with the Moroccan and Mauritanian claims, but if those claims are to be met it would appear that there is no better course to follow than that of the express choice of the population itself. Thus the opinion of the population directly concerned will always remain the primary and decisive element in any settlement.\n178.\tThe position of Algeria can therefore give rise to no ambiguity. By refusing a policy of interest and accepting a policy of principle, Algeria remains constant and faithful to decisions which have been taken for a long time, first jointly with the brother nations of Morocco and Mauritania and then repeatedly confirmed in the resolutions of OAU, the non-aligned countries and the General Assembly. Whatever shades of difference there may be in the various approaches to the question, they are all aimed at the decolonization of the Territory, at the triumph of the rights of peoples in conformity with the principles of the Charter, and at the promotion of regional cooperation.\n179.\tInternational economic relations now appear to be going beyond nostalgia for what used to be challenging both conservative attitudes and a public opinion which up to now has been conditioned by a partisan and rigid system of references. True, they are still objectively inegalitarian, but the holders of the strongholds of yesterday, then comfortably ensconced, now have to justify their situation and the privileges wrongfully acquired, and to recognize the rights of others.\n180.\tThe group of industrialized nations is realizing more and more that it cannot continue without risk to deal with the present on the basis of the privileges of the past, and still less to deal with the future only on the basis of the concerns of today. Although the world is one, it is unfttrtunateLy divided on a material basis governed by mechanisms so unjust that they' provide some with far more than they need, while the majority cannot even hope for the bare necessities.\n181.\tThe most recent special sessions appeared, however, to favor a change in that state of affairs. The approach is more pragmatic and the view of things is becoming clearer and more global. The affirmation of the primacy of economics is accompanied by a healthy awareness of the direct impact of the economy on international security. The new economic order is no longer viewed as a piecemeal readjustment to be made to specific distortions of the world economic system.\n182.\tWhile it is fallacious to assert that the energy crisis is at the root of the economic crisis we are all suffering from, it is none the less just to recognize that the countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC], through their unity and their dynamism, occupy an advanced position in the conquest of the new international economic order.\n183.\tOn the occasion of their first summit meeting in Algeria, the producer countries decided to embark resolutely on a constructive dialog with the industrialized countries on the basis of equality of partnership and balance of interests. The provisional freeze in the price of oil until 30 September 1975 and the recent intentionally modest price rises agreed in Vienna were gestures of good will and represented substantial sacrifices by the members of OPEC, but they have not led to the expected efforts on the part of the industrialized countries to reduce inflationary pressures, which have recently increased, further reducing the loss in purchasing power of the producer countries.\n184.\tIn an international context fundamentally disturbed by structural disorders in the economies of the developed countries, the Algeria summit meeting adopted specific measures with a view to strengthening the action directed to the exercise of national sovereignty over natural resources, and to contributing to the development efforts of the countries of the third world, in particular through readjustments in their balance of payments. That decision took the form of firm commitments covering a period of at least two years and amounting to $17,000 million, of which $4,000 million was effectively contributed by the OPEC countries. Those commitments represent 10.2 per cent of their gross national product, whereas the sums already allocated, according to World Bank statistics, represent 3 per cent of their gross national product. That is undoubtedly a remarkable effort when we are all aware that, to help their development, all that the developing countries could obtain from the industrialized countries was 0.4 per cent for the decade 1962-1972 and 0.3 per cent for the year 1973. Moreover, by rejecting attempts to make the Paris Conference a restricted meeting limited strictly to the energy problem, the seven countries which then represented the third world were able to thwart the divisive maneuvers which sought to dissociate the energy problem from those of other raw materials and development and to place themselves within the framework of the results of the special sessions of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to the new international economic order.\n185.\tThe policy of trying to disrupt the unity of the developing countries by putting forward the fallacious notion that the difficulties of our countries are caused solely by the rise in oil prices has completely failed; and because oil represents the trump card not to say\nthe only card available to the developing countries in gaining their rights and defending their interests in the major negotiations to come, it is more important than ever to ensure the cohesion of the countries of OPEC in particular and the unity of all the developing countries in general.\n186.\tThe unanimity just shown at United Nations level demonstrates the capacity of our countries to go beyond the stage of isolated claims and restrictive attitudes and to make the actions of the world community part of a dialectic of a global and united struggle. Indeed only the future will show whether the developments recently recorded represent a simple change in tactics or, on the contrary, respond to profound and real changes in outmoded concepts which were initially defended by the prosperous countries.\n187.\tHow many times have we heard evoked at this very rostrum the dream of an international society from which not only the fear of war and the arms race but also the selfishness which nurtures injustice and the privileges which paralyse man's progress would be banished? Once again we proclaim our faith in the capacity of peoples to adapt to the new demands of this stage in history and to respond to the mission of leading the community of nations towards new heights of material prosperity and spiritual growth.\n188.\tMy statement is deliberately limited to the few questions I have just mentioned, on which I thought it important to give the views of my Government. The agenda for the current session offers a wide spectrum of important problems of undeniable interest for the whole of the international community, on which my delegation will make known the position of Algeria at the appropriate time.\n189.\tThe considerable scope of the general debate which is now coming to an end shows the attachment of all Member States to this Organization and the need they feel to express their concerns and apprehensions as well as to make suggestions for overcoming our difficulties. We believe that this is an extremely rich and varied exchange of views, which first permits a better understanding among all peoples and then directs the action of our Organization towards ever increasing effectiveness.\n190.\tAfter 30 years of existence this Organization is showing signs of real vitality and, defying all criticism and pessimistic forecasts, remains the indispensable instrument of international co-operation. The fact that it is necessary to remedy some of its imperfections, correct some of its shortcomings or modernize some of its institutions in no way detracts from the merit it has proved since its creation. The hope that our peoples place in it remains the highest tribute that it could wish for and the surest guarantee of its conservation and expansion.\n"

        "file_text": "60. Profound changes have taken place in the international situation since the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. A serious capitalist economic crisis plagues most parts of the world. All the basic contradictions in the world are becoming sharper. The trend of revolution by the people of the world is actively developing. The Asian, African and Latin American peoples have advanced valiantly and won a series of significant victories in their struggle against colonialism, imperialism and hegemonism. On the other hand, the contention between the two super-Powers for world hegemony has become more md more intense. The whole world is in greater turbulence and unrest. Rhetoric about detente cannot cover up the stark reality. The danger of war is visibly growing.\n61.\tFirst of all, it should be pointed out that the great victory of the three Indo-Chinese peoples has shaken the world. The Cambodian and Vietnamese peoples have thoroughly defeated United States imperialism and its lackeys, thus making an important contribution to the anti-imperialist cause of the people of the world and greatly inspiring all oppressed nations and oppressed people. Their victory is a brilliant example showing that a weak nation can defeat a strong one, and a small nation can defeat a big one.\n62.\tThe peoples of Asia are strongly against superPower interference and control and against the attempt of any country to seek hegemony in any part of Asia. The South-East Asian countries want their region to become a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, free from any form or manner of interference by outside Powers. This position of theirs has won the recognition and respect of an increasing number of countries. The struggle of the South Asian peoples against expansionism and hegemonism has made new progress. In West Asia, long-standing disputes have been resolved by the countries concerned which excluded foreign influence and conducted consultations on an equal footing, thus creating favorable conditions for friendly co-operation among the countries in the region. The Gulf countries are uniting in the common struggle against super-Power infiltration and control.\n63.\tIn Africa, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe and the Comoros have achieved independence, one after another. This is the result of their persistence in protracted struggles, particularly armed struggles. The struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania against racism and white rule is developing in depth. The situation on the African continent is most encouraging.\n64.\tThe struggle of the Latin American peoples to combat imperialism and hegemonism, safeguard State sovereignty and defend their national natural resources and economic rights and interests has continued to surge forward. Those peoples have reinforced their unity in the struggle in various ways.\n65.\tFurthermore, we are pleased to see that in Oceania Papua New Guinea has recently achieved its national independence.\n66.\tIn order to change the old international economic order and oppose the shifting of economic crises, the third-world countries have, in pursuance of the Declaration and program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)], adopted by the General Assembly at its sixth special session, advanced many reasonable proposals and waged unremitting struggles at various conferences and achieved marked successes.\n67.\tThe unity and struggle of the third-world countries, extending from the political to the economic sphere, have ushered in a new stage in the revolutionary cause of the people of the world against colonialism, imperialism and hegemonism.\n68.\tThe countries of the second world have also heightened their struggle against super-Power, and particularly social-imperialist, control, intervention, subversion and threat of force. The trend among the West European countries to unite against hegemonism has continued to grow. The second world has increased its dialog and contacts with the third world. Such co-operation will doubtless have good prospects for development as long as it is based on mutual respect for sovereignty and equality.\n69.\tThe contention between the two super-Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, extends to all parts of the world. Those Powers are intensifying iheir strife in Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific, the Atlantic, Asia, Africa and Latin America. Strategically, Europe is the focus of their contention. Social- imperialism is making a feint to the East while attacking in the West. This was revealed, rather than covered up, by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The two super-Powers do reach some agreements from time to time, but these only erect a facade, behind which they are engaged in bigger and fiercer contention.\n70.\tTake, for example, the agreement in principle reached at the United States-Soviet summit meeting last November on the limitation of strategic offensive arms. This agreement only sets a numerical limit on the arms in question, which exceeds the amount each side possesses at the moment, while qualitatively' it sets no limit at all. It is evident, therefore, that such an agreement should more appropriately be called an agreement on strategic arms expansion rather than an agreement on strategic arms limitation. Facts are at hand to prove this. Since the signing of this agreement, the United States and the Soviet Union have both stepped up their development and deployment of new types of strategic arms, each trying hard to overpower the other.\n71.\tOf late, the Soviet Union has made use of the conclusion of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to turn out much propaganda alleging that detente has progressed to a new stage. This is sheer deception. We are aware of the eager desire for security on the part of the many small and medium-sized countries which participated in that Conference. We are also aware that such countries have no illusions about its agreements, which have no binding force. What security let alone detente\u2014 is there to speak of when Europe remains in the prolonged state of tense armed confrontation? While chanting \\\"peace and security\\\" in the conference hall, the Soviet Union made moves to aggravate tension outside. It not only concentrated massive military forces and carried out unbridled provocations in the seas of northern Europe and the Mediterranean, but it has also brazenly stretched its tentacles to the\nIberian peninsula. Such deeds of expansion coupled with words of detente are a huge mockery of the Conference. From its inception we considered the Conference a European insecurity conference. Now that this Conference has ended, is there greater security in Europe? In our view, no. The Conference has not altered the basis situation in Europe in the least. If one should be so naive as to believe in Soviet propaganda, that would be dangerous indeed.\n72.\tThe Soviet leadership hankers after a so-called \\\"Asian collective security system\\\". Now that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has been a success, as they say, we Asian countries should learn from its example. What a bright idea! The situation in Asia, however, is different from that in Europe. It was only a short while ago that a super-Power was driven out of Indo-China. So the purpose of the Soviet Union is not the preservation of Asian security; rather, it is to \\\"fill the vacuum\\\" and at the same time divert world attention to Asia to cover up the fact that Europe is the focus of its strategy. As for the principle of the inviolability of existing frontiers that was stressed at the European security Conference, what implications would it have in Asia? Is it that the Soviet Union wants, us to recognize as legal its occupation of the territories of some Asian countries while at the same fame allowing it to reserve the right to support one Asian country in violating the existing frontiers of another, as it did in 1971? To put it bluntly, the idea of a so-called \\\"Asian collective security system\\\" peddled by the Soviet leadership is designed to facilitate its contention with the other super-Power for hegemony in the Asia- Pacific region and serves as a means by which it seeks to divide and control the Asian countries. But the Asian countries, which won their independence after protracted struggles, know well that in order to be masters in their own house they must never \\\"let the tiger in through the back door while expelling the wolf through the front gate\\\". China's attitude towards this stuff of \\\"Asian collective security system\\\" is clear- cut: first, we are against it; second, we despise it.\n73.\tAs Lenin pointed out time and again, imperialism means war. So long as imperialism and social-imperialism exist, war is inevitable. The content of imperialist politics is world domination, and the continuation of this politics is imperialist war. Since both super-Powers are after world domination, the contradiction between them is irreconcilable; one either overpowers the other, or is overpowered. The so- called \\\"balance of power\\\", even if it exists, is only a transient and superficial one. It will not do to depend on a \\\"balance of power\\\" or a so-called \\\"balance of terror\\\" for maintaining peace. Khrushchev's brainchild that peaceful coexistence is the only alternative in this nuclear age is a hypocritical lie. If the Soviet Union took this stuff seriously, why should it frantically develop conventional armed forces in addition to energetically developing nuclear arms and maintain an offensive posture far exceeding its defense needs? With the super-Powers contending so fiercely and expanding their armaments so madly, they are bound to go to war against each other some day. This is independent of man's will. The super-Powers are the source of a new world war, and the danger of war comes mainly from the wildly ambitious social-imperialism. The frequent meetings between the superpowers and their profuse talk about detente precisely prove that there is no detente, let alone lasting peace, in this world. What characterizes the current world situation is decidedly not an irreversible process of detente but the approaching danger of a new world war.\n74.\tWe hope that the people of all countries will heighten their vigilance and get prepared in view of the growing danger of a new world war. It is better to be prepared than unprepared. Without preparations one will suffer. The super-Powers look strong but are inwardly weak and very isolated. The more evils they do, the more thoroughly they will reveal their true features, and the stronger the resistance of the people of the world will become. At present, the factors for both revolution and war are increasing on a world scale. Whether war gives rise to revolution or revolution prevents war, in either case the international situation will develop in a direction favorable to the people. And the future of the world will be bright.\n75.\tNumerous questions will be considered at the current session of the General Assembly. The Chinese delegation would like to state our views on some of them.\n76.\tFirst, there is the question of opposing colonialism. The past year was a year in which the African people continued to win important victories in their straggle for national independence and liberation. With the collapse of the Portuguese colonial system and the glorious birth of a number of newly independent States, the African national liberation movement has advanced to a new stage, and the last strongholds of colonialism in southern Africa are assailed from all sides by the multitude of African people and countries persisting in struggle.\n77.\tBut even before old-line colonialism dies out, the two super-Powers have already stepped in. The United States has long supported colonial race in Africa, and southern Africa in particular. The Soviet Union, flaunting the banner of \\\"socialism\\\", has infiltrated the African national liberation movement to sow discord and stir up trouble in an attempt to bring the movement within its social-imperialist orbit.\n78.\tAll revolutionary peoples of the world are saddened by the civil war in Angola. Differences within a national liberation movement are something normal. The correct attitude is to encourage unity in their common struggle to combat the enemy and drive out the colonialists. That is why the Organization of African Unity has recognized and supported all the three liberation organizations in Angola engaged in armed struggle and has made tireless efforts to promote unity in the Angolan national liberation movement. But the Soviet leadership, which considers itself as the patron of the national liberation movement, disregards the agreement reached among the three Angolan organizations on unity against the enemy and has, through its propaganda media, identified one organization as revolutionary and censured another as reactionary in a deliberate attempt to create division. Furthermore, it has sent large quantities of arms, including heavy arms, to one of the Angolan organizations. That was how t? civil war was provoked in Angola. The other super-Power, on its part, has not lagged behind. The situation in Angola is becoming ever more complicated.\n79.\tFrom the very beginning, China has given its support to the national liberation movement in Angola. We gave military aid to all three Angolan liberation organizations to help them fight Portuguese colonialism. Being aware of their differences, we have all along urged them to unite against the enemy. After the agreement on independence was reached between the Angolan national liberation movement and Portugal, we stopped giving new military aid to the three Angolan organizations. Such are the facts, and facts are more eloquent than words. The Soviet slanders against China can in no way cover up the truth; instead, they serve to lay bare the true features of the Soviet Union.\n80.\tThe civil war in Angola instigated by the Soviet Union is a bad thing, but a good thing too. It is good precisely because it serves as teaching material by negative example. All revolutionary movements are bound to go through twists and turns. We believe that the broad masses of the Angolan people, after experiencing setbacks and detours, will certainly uphold unity, persist in struggle, frustrate the super-Power and particularly social-imperialist schemes and achieve their independence and liberation. Their temporary difficulties and sacrifices will not only greatly enhance their own political awareness, but also provide a profound lesson for the liberation movements of the oppressed nations throughout the world.\n81.\tAn excellent situation prevails in Africa. It was because the racists in southern Africa were driven into a corner that Vorster of South Africa prorosed \\\"dialog\\\" between the minority white regime of Southern Rhodesia and the Zimbabwe national liberation organizations. This signifies only the weakness of the racists, not their strength. Through such tactics they intend to disintegrate the national liberation movement and to preserve the reactionary white rule. The recent twelfth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity penetratingly stated that \\\" Vorster's detente manoeuvres on Rhodesia are a transparent trick to frustrate majority rule and to disarm the freedom-fighters\\\". The Assembly stressed the necessity of armed struggle, called on the Zimbabwe' people to intensify immediately their armed struggle and expressed a determination to fight by every means possible the white racist regimes until their complete elimination. We warmly support this correct stand. We have always advocated the use of revolutionary dual tactics against the reactionaries' counter-revolutionary dual tactics. Armed struggle is fundamental; the people's armed forces must be strengthened and not weakened, negotiations or no negotiations. Deviations and detours may sometimes occur in the complicated struggle against counter-revolutionary dual tactics. But the people will sum up their experience, overcome difficulties and continue to advance. Through long and tortuous struggles the people of southern Africa will eventually win the complete liberation of the African continent.\n82. Secondly, I take up the Korean question. The independent and peaceful reunification of Korea is the common aspiration of the entire Korean people. Over the years the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea has put forward many reasonable proposals and propositions for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. Thanks to its initiative, an agreement was reached with the South Korean authorities in 1972 on the three principles for independent and peaceful reunification, which were affirmed by the General Assembly in 1973.2 However, Korea remains divided today, because the Chung Hee Park clique, supported by the United States, has abandoned these principles and sabotaged the North-South talks.\n83.\tUnder the impact of the great victory of the Indo-Chinese peoples this year, United States imperialism became panicky and endlessly repeated the myth of a so-called \\\"threat of a southward invasion from the north\\\" concocted by the Chung Hee Park clique, deliberately played up the tension on the Korean peninsula and even declared that it would not hesitate to use nuclear weapons there. Backed and abetted by the United States, the Chung Hee Park clique pursued its policy of national division with greater frenzy, issued a succession of \\\"emergency laws\\\", declared a state of war and intensified its suppression of the people in South Korea. It looked as if a Korean war was an imminent possibility. As a matter of fact, that was much ado about nothing. It is now cigar that the United States and the Chung Hee Park clique have acted in this way merely to create a pretext and deceive the people of the world so that United States troops may hang on in South Korea and the division of Korea may be perpetuated. If there is a danger of war on the Korean peninsula, it can only originate from the South Korean authorities that constantly clamor for \\\"reunification by prevailing over communism\\\", and absolutely not from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea which insists on independent and peaceful reunification.\n84.\tThe draft resolution on Korea submitted by the United States, Japan and other countries this year [A/10142 and Add.1-7] claims a \\\"preparedness\\\" to terminate the United Nations Command. But there is no mention at all of the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea. Obviously, its purpose is, under the cover of terminating the United Nations Command, to legalize the presence of United States troops in South Korea and create \\\"two Koreas.\\\" The United States attempt to thrust the Chung Hee Park clique into the United Nations is part of this scheme. Clearly, such a draft resolution can by no means lead to a peaceful settlement of the Korean question, no matter how nicely it is worded. It is absolutely unacceptable to us.\n85.\tWe have consistently held that the Korean question should be settled by the Korean people themselves free from any outside interference. The draft resolution on Korea submitted by Algeria, China and other other countries [A! 10191 and Add. 1-3] proposes that the United Nations Command be dissolved and all the foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations be withdrawn, and that the Korean Armistice Agreement be replaced with a peace agreement signed by the real parties to the Armistice Agreement. It also puts forward a series of positive measures to remove tension between North and South Korea, prevent armed conflicts and promote the normalization of the situation. This proposal is entirely just and reasonable.\nIt not only meets the eager desire of the entire Korean people but is conducive to the fundamental improvement of the situation on the Korean peninsula and in northeast Asia.\n86.\tThe United Nations Command must be dissolved. From the day of its formation it has been illegal and a tool of United States aggression. In fact, it has become a United States command long since.\n87.\tHowever, the dissolution of the United Nations Command must be coupled with the withdrawal of all the foreign troops from South Korea. For what would be the point of merely changing the name while keeping everything else intact? Continued presence of United States troops in South Korea under whatever name contravenes the principles of the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea and will only aggravate the tension on the Korean peninsula. The question of withdrawal of all the foreign troops from Korea should have been discussed and settled within three months after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. This has been delayed for no less than 22 years because of obstructions placed by successive United States administrations. And 17 years have passed since the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew on their own initiative from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to facilitate a peaceful settlement of the Korean question. Now there are no foreign troops in North Korea, but United States troops still hang on in South Korea. For how much longer does the United States intend to prolong such a state of affairs?\n88.\tKorea cannot remain forever in a state of armistice. The United States representative's idea for the United States and the South Korean authorities to propose to the parties to the armistice the convening of a conference to discuss ways to preserve the Armistice Agreement is of no avail. The Korean Armistice Agreement has been in existence for 22 years, and how much longer will it be preserved? Moreover, as is known to all, the parties to the Korean Armistice Agreement have in fact changed a great deal. The Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from Korea long ago. Most components of the United Nations Command have dispersed and evaporated into thin air. So how can such a conference be convened?\n89.\tAs for the exploration at such a conference of the possibility of a larger conference to negotiate a more fundamental arrangement, is it not even more impractical? After the armistice in 1953, under the provisions of the Armistice Agreement a political conference at a higher level should have been held to settle the Korean question. However, owing to sabotage by the United States, even the preliminary talks failed to produce any result. Subsequently in 1954, the Korean and Chinese sides made tremendous efforts at Geneva to urge the convening of a political conference at a higher level in the hope that a peaceful settlement of the Korean question could be realized. At the time, the United States representative, stubbornly and arbitrarily clinging to his own course, went so far as to refuse to reopen any discussions on the Korean question in the future. Thus, the United States single-handedly slammed the door to a political conference on the Korean question. In the actual circumstances at present, the practical way is for the real parties to the Korean Armistice Agreement to negotiate and sign a peace agreement to replace it.\nThe facts over the past two decades and more prove that United States interference in Korea is the root- cause of constant tensions in Korea. Therefore, the key to a peaceful settlement of the Korean question lies in the conclusion of a peace agreement to replace the Armistice Agreement and in the withdrawal of all United States troops.\n90.\tThe United States asserts that, as there is no normal international boundary between North and South Korea, the Armistice Agreement and the demilitarized zone stipulated therein absolutely must not be changed. We cannot accept this view. Korea is only in a state of temporary division. Between North and South Korea there can be no normal international boundary but only a provisional demarcation line. Since both North and South Korea have agreed on the mutual non-use of force and on reunification by peaceful means, why should it be impossible for some necessary measures to be agreed on to settle this problem pending the peaceful reunification? It is groundless to assert that a war will break out in Korea in the absence of the Armistice Agreement.\n91.\tThe Chinese delegation maintains that the draft resolution on Korea sponsored by Algeria and other countries is one that can solve the problem. We hope that the current session of the General Assembly will seriously consider and adopt this draft resolution.\n92.\tI now come to my third topic, the Middle East question. Since the October war, the Middle East has reverted to a state of \\\"no war, no peace.\\\" This is the result of the fierce and many sided contention between the two super-Powers carried on against the will of the Arab and Palestinian peoples.\n93.\tDuring this period, disengagement agreements were signed between Egypt and Israel and between Syria and Israel. Recently, a second disengagement agreement has been signed by Egypt and Israel. Nevertheless, the Middle East question is far from being settled.\n94.\tIt is mainly the two super-Powers that are to be held responsible for this state of affairs. In the two years since the October war, one super-Power proposed a \\\"comprehensive solution\\\" and the other a \\\"step-by-step solution\\\" of the Middle East question, each trying hard to boost itself and denigrate the other and masquerade as a friend of the Arab and Palestinian peoples. In fact, while the United States has no intention of bringing about a thorough settlement of the Middle East question, the Soviet Union is still less inclined to do so. It may be recalled that, when the October war in the Middle East was at its most critical juncture and thereafter, the Soviet Union withheld the shipment of arms already promised to Egypt and even pressed for the repayment of debts. How can one expect such a perfidious country to support in earnest the Arab people in their just.struggle for the recovery of the lost territories and the restoration of the Palestinian national rights?\n95.\tBoth super-Powers have the need to maintain a state of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" in the Middle East \u2014brief fighting followed by a period of truce, with both war and peace kept under control. Taking advantage of this state of affairs, they contend for spheres of influence, places of strategic importance and oil resources in the Middle East. Taking advantage of the same, they sell munitions in order to reap fabulous profits and alleviate their own economic difficulties. Again taking advantage of this, they test new weapons in preparation for a new war on a larger scale. All this is done at the expense of the fundamental interests of the people in the Middle East.\n96.\tCountless agreements on the Middle East have been reached inside and outside the United Nations in the past twenty-odd years. Now, in retrospect, is there any agreement that has been strictly observed by the Israeli aggressors, or that has brought about a basic change in the Middle East situation? None, practically none. In the final analysis, it is not agreements on paper but the struggle of the people that will determine the future of the Middle East. What calls for close attention and vigilance now is that a super-Power is taking advantage of the present situation to sow discord and attempt to undermine Arab unity. The Arab and Palestinian peoples must never be taken in.\n97.\tThe Chinese people have consistently supported the Arab and Palestinian peoples in their just struggle against the Israeli aggressors and have all along opposed super-Power contention in the Middle East. We believe that the Palestinian and Arab peoples will continue to strengthen their unity, persevere in struggle and carry their fight against aggression and hegemonism through to the end.\n98.\tMy fourth theme is the question of disarmament. Disarmament is an old question. At a time when there is a growing danger of a new world war, it is fully understandable that the people of all countries, and those of the third- and second-world countries in particular, should feel more concerned about this question. After the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Soviet leadership has become particularly clamorous for \\\"complementing political detente by military detente\\\", preaching that the most important task now is general and complete disarmament. This is making political profit out of the well- intentioned desire of the people of the world. It is a calculated fraud.\n99.\tAnyone having respect for realities can see that what exists in Europe is not political detente at all but a fierce and many-sided contention between the two super-Powers. Immediately after the conclusion of the European security Conference the Soviet Union violated Norway's airspace. Is this not another proof that the so-called detente is just empty talk? To advocate in these circumstances the expanding, developing in depth and spreading of detente can only make people laugh.\n100.\tExploiting the developing countries' keen desire to improve their national economies, the Soviet Union recently has again trumpeted its proposal for a 10 per cent reduction of the military budgets of the five permanent members of the Security Council and the use of part of-the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries. The Soviet Union deems this proposal its masterstroke, and its representative has tried to sell it to us here for no one knows how many times. But so far he has failed to inform us just how big the real Soviet military budget is. It would probably take several years to get this clear. And who knows how many more before military budgets can truly be reduced as proposed by the Soviet\nUnion? This magnificent Soviet plan, to use a Chinese saying, is \\\"to draw a pie to satisfy hunger\\\". If the developing countries were made to wait for such assistance, would they not be left helpless like \\\"the stranded fish which is promised water to be fetched from a distant sea\\\"?\n101.\tChina's views on disarmament are known to all: we are for disarmament, but it must be genuine and not phony disarmament. We are against phony disarmament, and still more against the Soviet attempt to use a disarmament conference as a veil to cover up the truth of its arms expansion and war preparations. The two super-Powers are quickening their pace towards a new world war. At this juncture, a disarmament conference in whatever form will only create the illusion of peace, serve to deceive and lull the people of the world and bind the hands of the numerous small and medium-sized countries. This is what we are firmly against.\n102.\tAs regards a world disarmament conference, China keeps to the position it set forth long ago, namely, that such a conference must have a clear aim and fulfill the necessary pre-conditions. The clear aim is the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and absolutely not the so-called limitation of strategic arms. The pre-conditions are: all nuclear countries, and particularly the two nuclear super-Powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, must first of all undertake the unequivocal obligation that they will not be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and in any circumstances, and in particular will not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries or nuclear-free zones, and that they must withdraw from abroad all their armed forces, including nuclear-missile forces, and dismantle all their military bases, including nuclear bases, on the territories of other countries. But now the super-Powers even refuse to undertake the minimum obligation not to use nuclear weapons against the non-nuclear countries. How can it be said that conditions are ripe for holding a world disarmament conference?\n103.\tHistorical experience merits attention. The more the imperialists diffuse a smoke-screen of disarmament, the bigger is the danger of war. Before the Second World War, a large-scale international disarmament conference lasting nearly three years was held under the sponsorship of the League of Nations after nearly seven years of preparation, and hundreds of proposals and suggestions were discussed. But what were the results? They were arms expansion instead of disarmament, and war instead of peace. The only effect of that conference was to put many countries off guard and as a result they were caught unprepared by the outbreak of the Second World War and suffered a great deal. We hold that the United Nations should not repeat the mistake of the League of Nations.\n104.\tNevertheless, as was expected, the Soviet Union tabled at this session of the General Assembly a proposal for the \\\"complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapons tests\\\" [At10241]. This is old ware in new wrappings and another of its tricks for maintaining nuclear monopoly. China's stand on this question is clear to all and we will not repeat it. As regards the Soviet proposal for the prohibition of the manufacture of what it calls new types of weapons even more formidable than nuclear weapons, its aim is none other than to divert people's attention from the immediate issues by talking about remote things. Let it be discussed by those who are prepared to manufacture such weapons. There is no need to bring it up here to scare people.\n105.\tMy fifth point is the question of development. Since the sixth special session of the General Assembly, the third-world countries have waged an effective struggle and have put forward a series of reasonable proposals and ideas for transforming the old international economic order which was based on exploitation. The oil-exporting countries have bravely stood up to super-Power intimidation and threats, and have kept a firm hold on their oil resources and their right to fix oil prices. Many countries have taken measures to curb transnational corporations in order to regain their sovereign rights in varying degrees. Various associations of raw material-producing countries have been set up one after another. The third-world countries have put forward a number of proposals, such as the integrated program for commodities and the indexation of prices, for the transformation of the present irrational international economic order. The situation of the struggle in the economic field against colonialism, imperialism and hegemonism is excellent.\n106.\tThere are two conflicting positions on the question of development. The position taken by the third world is for maintaining independence and self-reliance, for transforming the old economic order of exploitation of the third world by a few big Powers and for establishing a new economic order on the principles of sovereignty, equality and mutual benefit. The other position, taken by the super-Powers, stresses \\\"interdependence\\\" or the \\\"international division of labor\\\" between the exploiting and the exploited countries in an attempt to preserve the old economic order. Are the industrially developed countries and the raw material-producing countries interdependent? Yes, they are. This interdependence has been in existence ever since the emergence of a single world market. The point is what kind of interdependence. It may be said that there is an interdependence between the horse and its rider. But, we all know it is the horse that takes the burden and not the rider. As for the \\\"international division of labor\\\", it is in essence one and the same as \\\"interdependence\\\". With the emergence of colonialism and imperialism, a new international division of labor sprang up in the world that converted one part of the globe into an area of chiefly agricultural production serving the other part which was chiefly industrial. But to call such cosmopolitan exploitation internationalism is an idea that could only be engendered in the brains of the social- imperialists. Whether or not there is exploitation in the existing international economic relations and whether or not an end should be put to such exploitation this is a real problem of great importance today.\n107.\tTowards the demand of the third world for transforming the old international economic order, two differing attitudes are adopted by different industrially developed countries. One is dialog, and the other confrontation. Since the use of oil as a weapon by the oil-exporting countries, one super-Power has kept hurling abuses and waving the big stick at them and even threatened them with armed intervention in an attempt to coerce them into submission. The other super-Power has chimed in, saying that oil prices should not be raised unilaterally and asserting threateningly that the aggravation of the oil problem may cause a new flare-up of international tensions. Both take an out-and-out imperialist attitude. We are firmly against this attitude. Facts show that this attitude, far from subduing the oil-exporting countries, only stimulated them to closer unity and hardened their fighting will. We are in favor of dialog. In the past year and more, many second-world countries have frequently tried dialog with a number of third- world countries, and some of these attempts have yielded positive results. Ties between the second world and the third world have been strengthened. This is a good phenomenon in the international economic life of today.\n108.\tIn the face of the worsening capitalist economic crisis and the shifting of crisis by industrialized countries, the third-world countries have advanced such proposals as the integrated program for commodities, the indexation of prices and the democratization of the international financial institutions in order to improve their trade terms and develop their national economies. These are entirely justifiable and are minimum demands. But they have met with opposition from a few major industrialized countries. For they constitute a violation of the so-called free market system, which is allegedly sacred and inviolable. Instead, those industrialized countries have put forward a series of concrete proposals allegedly designed to \\\"promote economic development\\\". As a matter of fact, the so-called free market of today has never been free ever since the emergence of monopoly capital. This market is free only for monopoly capital and the industrial Powers and not for the developing countries. In the 1960s, for example, the prices of oil and many other raw materials were kept very low. Was that determined by supply and demand? No, it was determined arbitrarily, or \\\"freely\\\" if you like, by big monopoly capital. To transform the old international economic order, it is imperative to touch this free market system of gaining profits at the expense of others. Otherwise, no matter how many concrete proposals the super-Powers may submit or how much money they may promise, these in essence are nothing but a kind of alms and relief which can at best temporarily and slightly mitigate the difficulties of the developing countries but will not help them shake off exploitation and control. The root-cause of their poverty will still be there. The gap between the poor and rich countries will keep widening.\n109.\tThe oil weapon has opened up new vistas for the anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist and anti-hegemonic struggle in the economic field. The key to the victories of the oil struggle lies in upholding unity and daring to touch what the industrial Powers regard as sacred and inviolable. All raw material-producing countries should get organized and fight in defense of their proper interests. Some people accuse the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries of being a monopoly organization, a cartel. Why do they not stop and think that cartels, trust and transnational corporations were inventions of the industrial Powers and that to date they still weigh heavily on the developing countries? Are we to tolerate the injustice of the magistrates being allowed to burn down houses while the common people are forbidden to use fire even to light lamps? All the developing countries should unite more closely. It is true that among the developing countries some are in the greatest need. Other countries should give them more help, and they have already begun to do so. The neediest and other developing countries share common experiences and face common tasks. To call the neediest countries the \\\"fourth world\\\" is groundless or ill-intentioned. There are no saviors in the world. To develop the national economy, a country must persist in independence and self-reliance. Political independence is not won easily, so it is essential to give play to State sovereignty to eliminate gradually but firmly the forces of imperialism and all forces of colonialism and neocolonialism. The old international economic order was evolved over centuries of colonialist and imperialist plunder and exploitation. It is impossible to thoroughly change it at one stroke. The seventh special session of the General Assembly is a continuation of the struggle of the sixth special session. The struggle against exploitation will be a long one. United as one and persisting in our efforts, we developing countries will surely attain our goal.\n110. Before concluding my speech, I would like to state briefly our opinions on the review of the Charter of the United Nations. We are in favor of reviewing the Charter and making the necessary amendments. Nothing in the world is immutable. The situation within and outside the United Nations has changed, and it is only natural that the Charter should be amended accordingly so as to suit the changed situation. This is common sense. Basing themselves on the purposes and principles of the Charter, many countries have put forward views in principle on the revision of certain provisions of the Charter, such as expanding the power of the General Assembly, restricting the power of the Security Council, changing the composition of the Council, limiting or abolishing the veto right of the States permanent members of the Council. We think that these views deserve serious consideration. Since the Charter was drawn up by man, why cannot it be revised by man? But the super-Powers are greatly upset by the changed situation within the United Nations. One super-Power describes the democratic voting in the General Assembly as a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\". The other goes further; at the mere mention of the phrase \\\"review of the United Nations Charter,\\\" it flies into a rage and breaks into abuse, calling people in favor of reviewing the Charter \\\"reactionary forces\\\". It mortally fears that it might be deprived of its privilege to abuse the veto power. We would advise this \\\"natural ally of the developing countries\\\" to calm down a bit and not get so exasperated. If you are sure that you have the truth, why are you so afraid of dissenting views? A review of the Charter is the general trend and popular demand. We believe that a rational solu-tion acceptable to all can be found so long as the nations, big and small, carry on patient consultations and repeated discussions on the basis of the principle of equality for all. If anyone still resorts to deliberate obstructions, that can only help people see more clearly who are champions of the special privileges of the minority. Therefore, we submit that the work of the review of the Charter should be continued.\n\n"

        "file_text": "199.\t I would ask you to convey, Sir, to the President of the Assembly, Mr. Gaston Thorn, the greetings of the Government of Ecuador, and at the same time my Government's sincere congratulations on his well-deserved election to the presidency of this new session of the General Assembly.\n200.\tMay I also pay a tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Mr. Bouteflika, who, with exemplary impartiality and efficiency, presided over the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session of the General Assembly.\n201.\tMy delegation's greetings go also to the countries just admitted as States Members of the United Nations: the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the People's Republic of Mozambique, to all of which I extend a most fraternal welcome. Similarly, I congratulate the people of Papua New Guinea upon its achievement of independence and its imminent entry into our Organization.\n202.\tOn this occasion Ecuador wishes to confirm once again its support for the principle of the universality of the United Nations, strict application of which will make it possible for the Organization to achieve its lofty aims.\n203.\tThe United Nations is about to celebrate the thirtieth year of its life. The Government of Ecuador believes that this is a fitting occasion for some serious soul-searching as to what our Organization should be. But this exercise will be incomplete if, at the same time, the States that compose it are not resolved to redress the errors of the past.\n204.\tIn its first 30 years the United Nations has changed from an association of 51 nations, closely bound together by the circumstances surrounding the Second World War, into what has this year become a 141-Member Organization. During this period, the scope and magnitude of the Organization's activities have evolved tremendously so as to reflect the changing circumstances of our times and the interests and concerns of its component Members. The enormous population growth and the emergence of a group of independent developing nations have created a new geopolitical structure. Thus the foundations of world\npolitical and economic power have changed in a manner that could not have been foreseen in San Francisco.\n205.\tAfter these 30 years of 'effort and changes, two great unknown factors with respect to the future remain unanswered. The Secretary-General has wisely formulated these two great concerns. Can the sovereign nations of our independent world, in the new circumstances in which we live, attain sufficient consensus and display the necessary collective will to put into practice in a genuine and lasting manner the original idea of the United Nations as an effective instrument for the maintenance of peace? Can they develop the necessary capacity to deal with the world problems that confront all nations and which obviously cannot be solved in isolation by either one nation or a group of nations? Undoubtedly, as pointed out by the Secretary-General, the future of the United Nations and of mankind itself depends on the answers to these two questions.\n206.\tThe United Nations as a world forum where all peoples can make themselves heard is of inestimable value. This in turn enhances the relevance of the Organization vis-a-vis the complex and acute problems of our time, among which, together with the aspects pertaining to international peace and security, world economic problems take pride of place. However, together with the elucidation of ideas, the Organ-ization must play a more active role in the quest for peace. We are of course gratified that countries in conflict should negotiate, open dialog and find a way towards the cessation of armed struggle and hostility, either through direct settlement among the parties or through mediation by other Powers. But the United Nations would become a stronger and more vigorous Organization if all the problems confronting peoples or to be confronted by peoples were channeled and solved through it. The United Nations must play a predominant role in the solution of all conflicts where not only the values of peace but also those delicate values born of interdependence are at stake. Strengthening the juridical regime of the United Nations in order that it may fulfill its functions for the maintenance of international peace and security has always been the desire and decision of the Ecuadorian Government. Thus, the hegemonic positions of certain Powers, based on their actual power or the number of adherents to their policy, can never be justified in this Organization,\n207.\tThere is a clamor that rises from the depths of the feelings of all nations: the clamor for peace. Sometimes we do not know quite what we want, but we do know what we do not want: we do not want war any kind of war, preventive, local or nuclear. Mankind today, the spectator and protagonist of a technical civilization endowed with equal potential either for destruction or for man's salvation, must seek out the way of peace a peace substantially based on right, law and justice the necessary foundation for the liberation of communities from poverty, disease and ignorance.\n208.\tThis year the world has witnessed a series of important events in the area of international peace and security.\n209.\tThe end of the cruel Indo-Chinese war brought a sigh of relief and appears to have given way to a period of relative calm, although tensions and conflicts still persist in other regions, Ecuador trusts that this period wiil serve to consider the possibility of revitalizing, in a manner in keeping with the realities of our time, the whole concept of collective security and responsibility for the maintenance of peace. There is no doubt that this can be achieved with the admission to the United Nations of the two Vietnamese States, thus achieving almost full universality in this General Assembly and fulfilling the almost unanimous wish of the Organization.\n210.\tIn connexion with the situation in the Middle East, my delegation wishes to express its satisfaction at the recent agreement between Egypt and Israel, which represents an important milestone in the efforts made to solve those problems. Many years of confrontation, which on two occasions in the past have led to a state of war between countries in the region, brought the world to a situation of fear and alarm that in no way benefited the policy of detente and settlement through peaceful means.\n211.\tIn this case the Government of Ecuador believes it necessary for all the peoples in the region, with which my country maintains sincere relations of friendship, to arrive at a definitive agreement so that they may all live in peace.\n212.\tEcuador wishes duly to restate its position: we reject and condemn territorial conquests through force; we do not admit that the occupation of territory may be used to strike fear in the enemy, to demand negotiations or to refuse to return such territory until an agreement has been signed. We recognize the legitimate right of the people of Palestine to self- determination, national sovereignty and independence. But we consider likewise that the State of Israel, which was in fact created by the United Nations, has the right to existence. My country sincerely hopes that the parties involved in this lengthy conflict may find the way to a just and lasting peace within secure borders, duly recognized and guaranteed. Thus, all the peoples in the area can make a contribution of their great values to the whole world.\n213.\tMy Government is greatly concerned at the situation in Korea, a region that for many years has been beset by insecurity and instability. We believe that every effort must be bent to promote a rapprochement and frank and cordial negotiations between the parties concerned, without external interference, in order that they may find an agreement beneficial to the whole of the Korean people, both north and south. This can be achieved through an international climate of mutual understanding and confidence, a task in which the United Nations may play an important part, preventing the great Powers from seeking to impose unilateral solutions. This climate will be achieved through the mutual cession of inflexible positions, through conciliation and understanding, but never through confrontation. Let us not now repeat the errors of the cold war.\n214.\tIn Cyprus, there is an imperative need to move towards an agreed settlement. The United Nations peace-keeping force plays an essential part in watching over the tranquility and humanitarian tasks in that area until a settlement is reached. We hope that the negotiations now under way between the two communities under the aegis of the Secretary-General will achieve progress leading to the objective of the establishment of a basis for an eventual agreement enabling all the inhabitants in Cyprus to live together in peace. There can be no doubt as to the difficulty and complexity of the problem or as to the sincerity with which the leaders of both communities wish to solve those problems to ensure a future of peace and progress for the whole of the Cypriot people. In this connexion, Ecuador sincerely hopes that General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) will be strictly complied with.\n215.\tIn the course of these past few months there have been encouraging events in the process of the decolonization of Africa. With the exception of Angola, all of the former Portuguese colonial Territories in the continent have achieved independence through an orderly and peaceful transition of power, in conformity with the agreements arrived at between the liberation movements concerned and the Government of Portugal.\n216.\tHowever, we note with anguish that the same has not happened in the case of Angola, whose transition to independence has not been peaceful, and is affected by international strife and bloodshed. The Alvor Agreements between the Government of Portugal and the three liberation movements have been frustrated by undue interference from outside, which must cease in order to allow the Angolans to find for themselves the road towards their own destiny.\n217.\tThe refusal of the illegal minority regime in Rhodesia to accept majority rule has so far made it impossible to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe. This has frustrated the desires of my people, as well as the people of other United Nations Members, who wish that a peaceful and just solution to this situation will be arrived at as soon as possible for the benefit of the authentic inhabitants of the Territory. Efforts must be pursued to convene a constitutional conference which could lead to a negotiated and ordered transition towards majority rule.\n218.\tEcuador has always supported the aspirations of the people of the Comoros to self-determination and independence, and has affirmed the unity and integrity of the Territory. We endorse the Political Declaration of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries held recently at Lima concerning the Comoros [see A/10217 and Corr.l, annex, para. 41], and trust that the results of the referendum held not long ago in some of the islands of the archipelago a general vote in favor of independence will be implemented.\n219.\tMy Government has noted with particular satisfaction the work of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the signing of the Final Act. We regard it as a decisive step towards the development of understanding and true co-operation among the signatory States, since one of the fundamental bases of the agreement is the restatement of the principle enshrined in the Charter concerning the condemnation of any recourse to force. With the signing of that Act a new era has opened in Europe: that of understanding and co-operation; there is greater detente, and the stages of mistrust and even of violence are being overcome.\n220.\tAmong the problems of direct concern at present to the American continent is that of the Panama Canal. My delegation sincerely hopes that the negotiations between the United States of America and Panama will soon lead to a just solution. Ecuador once again reiterates its clear and definite position on this question: we give our categorical support to the sister Republic of Panama in its legitimate aspirations to recover full sovereignty and full exercise of its jurisdiction over the so-called Panama Canal Zone and to obtain exclusive control over the Canal.\n221.\tDisarmament and arms regulation is one of the fundamental objectives of the United Nations, since this is an imperative need for the organized survival of life on our planet. The immediate reasons for disarmament are even more pressing as the United Nations celebrates its 30 years of existence and in view of the pressure of the nuclear age. Despite the fact that a number of important agreements on the limitation and control of weapons have been concluded, it has thus far not been possible to achieve the means of arresting or limiting the arms race, both in nuclear weapons and in conventional weapons. The danger of nuclear proliferation not only continues, but has increased; nuclear testing continues; weapons are daily becoming more complex and lethal and the race in weapon technology constantly opens new and more terrible prospects.\n222.\tThe Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held at Geneva in May of the current year, showed the difficulties in reconciling the policies of nuclear and non-nuclear weapon States. Ecuador is gratified at the fact that new States should have become parties to the Treaty, bringing the number of signatories to more than 90. My delegation takes this occasion to address an appeal to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament that, on a priority basis, it continue its negotiations, with a view to arriving, as early as possible, at an agreement on effective measures for the prohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of all chemical weapons, and the destruction of existing weapons. We also appeal for the cessation of nuclear-weapon tests for the benefit of the supreme interest of mankind, both as an important step towards control over the development and proliferation of nuclear weapons and to alleviate the profound concern of the world over the harmful consequences of radioactive fallout for the health of present and future generations. We address a special appeal to the Soviet Union that it accede to Additional Protocol II to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America. We view with sympathy the fact that that Treaty, which went into force for the United Kingdom and the United States in 1969 and 1971, respectively, should have also gone into force last year for France and the People's Republic of China. Ecuador makes this request, convinced as it is that the co-operation of the nuclear-weapon States is indispensable for the greater efficacy of any treaty establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and that that co-operation must be translated into commitments included in a solemn international instrument that is fully legally binding.\n223.\tMy delegation believes that the United Nations should speak out frankly and openly wherever human rights are violated, wherever acts of genocide are committed, wherever there is torture or the useless sacrifice of human life, wherever whole peoples are displaced, wherever a new curtain of silence and oppression is sought to be lowered. Human rights, like any act of justice, are indivisible. Any violation of human rights must be condemned. Through our Organization, Governments and peoples must unite their efforts to overcome this untenable situation. The Government of Ecuador, in fact, attaches equal importance and mandatory value to the duty of respecting and protecting human rights and to the other principles and institutions governing international relations.\n224.\tAny form of racial discrimination is decidedly contrary to the most fundamental human and legi rights. It is anachronistic that, late in the twentieth century, while the world is seeking to raise peoples' standards of living, we should insist on drawing various distinctions between human beings. This is repugnant to the conscience of mankind. My Government shall always give the necessary support to any measures the General Assembly or the Security Council may adopt to put an end to this dangerous state of affairs, wherever such acts are committed or threaten to emerge. Guided by this principle, Ecuador was one of the first countries to ratify the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [resolution 3068 (XXVIII), annex].\n225.\tOne of the most serious problems arising in southern Africa lies in the persistent application of apartheid, a policy in direct contradiction with the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the purposes of the United Nations. The world community, and the United Nations in particular, have the obligation to pursue unrelentingly their efforts to induce the Government of South Africa to abandon that shameful policy.\n226.\tMy Government considers that, as the thirtieth anniversary of the Charter is celebrated, it is desirable to introduce certain reforms which, properly analysed, may be regarded as necessary and useful. Any institution can be improved. The political situations which prevailed in 1945 no longer exist; thus the Charter, like any human undertaking, must also be modified in order to bring it into line with the world in which we live to make it more dynamic and to make it better reflect the aspirations of all peoples, particularly those which in 1945 had neither a voice nor a vote in the elaboration of that instrument. Of course, the changes that may be made must be aimed at the institutional and political strengthening of the Organization. They will be justified if they morally and truly strengthen the United Nations and offer greater guarantees of peace and tranquility for the peoples of the world. My delegation will therefore support any concrete and realistic initiative within the context of respect for the principles and purposes that are at the root of our Organization.\n227.\tEcuador has been making an effective contribution to international efforts designed to bring about a just and realistic legal order in the oceans and seas of our planet. In that long and constant struggle, my country was one of the pioneers in the development of the new law of the sea, and we have always borne in mind the need to strengthen international peace, to protect our own security and to preserve and make the best possible use of the natural resources of the seas for the permanent benefit of our population. For this reason, we note with great satisfaction that, thanks to that struggle and the efforts of the American States of the South Pacific and other neighboring countries, we can no longer speak of the law of the sea without referring to the maximum breadth of 200 miles, which has acquired such great universal significance.\n228.\tThe new law of the sea must be constituted by an adequate balance between the irrenunciable rights of the coastal States and the true interests of the international community. Sovereignty exercised by the coastal States over the sea up to a distance of 200 miles cannot be conceived of as arbitrary or unlimited; neither can general interests serve to conceal the hegemonic claims of a few Powers accustomed to make use of the sea as they choose. The balance that will make possible a true world understanding must be sought between sovereignty with responsibility and the peaceful interests of all nations.\n229.\tInternational co-operation is more necessary than ever in a world in which interdependence becomes daily more evident. Measures for the conservation of renewable resources, the prevention and elimination of pollution and scientific research arc sections of the law of the sea in which true solutions will have to allow a greater margin for international co-operation.\n230.\tHowever, certain countries still adopt attitudes which are governed by the sole purpose of prolonging the existence of a system of exploitation which, sheltering under the principle of the so-called freedom of the seas, has favored and still favors a few great maritime and fishing Powers only. Moreover, once those countries were faced with the majority reaction of the developing peoples, they were compelled to recognize the need to introduce specific changes in the law of the sea, although at the same time they still resort to maneuvers whose fundamental purpose is to take all practical meaning from the acceptance of contemporary juridical trends. Thus the developing countries have stated, and rightly, that the recognition of jurisdiction by coastal States over 200 miles of the sea must not be devoid of concrete content but must, on the contrary, constitute an effective guarantee of the establishment of a system of conservation and use of the resources of the seas mainly for the benefit of their own peoples.\n23], My country's experience in this field has led it to the conviction that the only effective guarantee of respect of its right as regards the sea is the proclamation of its own sovereignty and jurisdiction over a distance of up to 200 miles. In this territorial sea that Ecuador possesses, there has been for almost 25 years now peaceful coexistence and harmonious co-ordination between its national rights and respect for the interests of the community of nations.\n232. Another fundamental aspect to be elucidated at the next stage in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is that connected with the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. There can be no valid regime for the sea-bed and the ocean floor, which have been declared the common heritage of mankind, unless administrative international machinery benefiting all nations is established. The moratorium declared by this General Assembly and ratified by the Conference, the purpose of which is to prevent the few technologically and economically capable countries from arbitrarily beginning the exploitation of the sea-bed and the ocean floor for their own egoistic and exclusive use and purposes, is still in force. Technology is not a basis for dominion, but an instrument for the common progress of all, and States possessing technology should share it generously if they are truly oriented towards the building of peace. Ecuador reiterates its views on the imperative need to maintain and apply that moratorium.\n233.\tIf the Conference on the law of the sea orients its work on the basis of good faith, realism and true deliberation, we are convinced that it will achieve full success. My country will continue to offer its most sincere and determined co-operation.\n234.\tAs regards economic development, it has been stated repeatedly that it not only must relate to the structure of public and social service which provides the human being with material well-being but, at the same time, must ensure an atmosphere wherein he can act as an individual member of society protected by fundamental freedoms. In the world of today, which is subject to the closest interrelation in all spheres of human endeavor and most essentially in the economic field, that so deeply desired goal can be achieved only through effective international co-operation.\n235.\tThe International Development Strategy takes account of these purposes, which were enshrined in the resolution on the Second Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. However, the examination and assessment of the results so far achieved by the application of the Strategy have caused the Government of Ecuador some concern. Those results confirm once again the slight progress, if not the stagnation, in the process of integral development of the countries of the third world, because even the initial goals provided for in the Strategy have not been achieved. If the developing countries have achieved partial development in terms of isolated economic indices, this has been due exclusively to their domestic effort and has not been the result of the action of the international community in favor of the poorer countries.\n236.\tEcuador, in keeping with the policy it has been maintaining, affirms the principle of total and absolute sovereignty of the State over its own natural resources. This is an irrenunciable and inalienable right recognized by the international community, from which stems the right of the developing countries possessing such resources to carry out their exploration, exploitation, industrialization and marketing in accordance with their own interests.\n237.\tOn the other hand, Ecuador, like the other developing countries, in wishing to safeguard its heritage, believes that interdependence in this sphere must necessarily stem from the satisfaction of its own needs as well as marketing and industrialization terms compatible with the integral development needs of its people.\n238.\tThe participation of the developing- countries in world trade has become smaller and smaller, deteriorating progressively, especially by reason of the barriers imposed by the developed countries. The developing countries are aware of their limitations as regards the lack of diversification of their export \nproducts, which are basically primary commodities. This situation leads to our observing with great concern that not only are our products experiencing continued deterioration of prices in the light of the constantly rising cost of the intermediate products and capital of the industrialized countries but, furthermore, the exports of the developing countries are subject to discriminatory and coercive policies which cancel out or limit the third world's participation in international trade. Among these policies we find today the foreign trade laws of the United States, under which my country is the victim of discriminatory measures merely because it defends its own natural resources. That is why Ecuador has stated repeatedly that it cannot maintain a dialog under the pressure of threats or measures of such a kind.\n239.\tEcuador considers that one effective way to eliminate the present disequilibrium in the balance of payments of some of the developing countries would be for the developed countries to be willing to adopt a just and balanced pricing policy for the goods that they export to the developing countries in terms of the prices of the primary commodities exported by the third world countries. There is an urgent need to ensure stable markets for products from the developing countries, to reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers and truly to eliminate restrictive trade practices.\n240.\tThe effective participation of the developing countries in the administration of world monetary affairs to date has been nominal. On the other hand, our countries beset by financial difficulties because of our scarce resources urgently require greater and more direct participation in the financial surpluses, as well as in the special drawing rights, administered by the International Monetary Fund; and this participation should be proportional not to our respective contributions, but to the requirements of the economic development and social progress of our peoples.\n241.\tIn a report of the World Bank issued recently, it is stated, inter alia, that behind the cold statistics there lies hidden the cruel reality of the rise of hunger and poverty throughout the world. This reveals the undeniable gravity of the underlying socio-economic problems, characterized by the very unequal distribution of income, excessive unemployment levels, high rates of infant mortality and illiteracy, and generally poor health. This picture is unfortunately almost a common denominator for the peoples of the third world, particularly for many in the American continent. Therefore, co-operation and mutual help at the international level so as to reduce the gravity of these symptoms are the tasks calling for action by the international community and, in particular, for a change of attitude on the part of the developed countries.\n242.\tIt is undeniable that we cannot, in this day and age, apply the same procedures as those that applied to past structures. The evolution of the world offers new prospects. It would be erroneous to hope that an increase in national savings and private capital by itself could give impetus to the process of industrialization that is essential for the achievement of an improvement in the balance of payments and progress in general. That would mean postponing the solution of social problems and maintaining alive a permanent threat of internal disruption. It is therefore desirable to adopt a new social philosophy to enable our communities to cast off the burden of their backwardness. Ecuador believes it is essential, therefore, for the international community and the individual countries concerned to speed up the process of establishing the new economic order which will lead to development in keeping with the needs of the moment and those foreseeable in the future. The Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] and the results of the seventh special session must be the basic machinery that is to give impulse to this process.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "63.\tIt is with great satisfaction that I, representing Portugal, address this thirtieth session of the General Assembly. I am speaking at a time when my country is undergoing a radical change in its history as a consequence of specific and increased responsibilities at the international level. I am speaking at a time when Portugal finds itself in search of a new identity as a nation, based on respect for and defense of liberty and human dignity, and engaged in the fight against all forms of discrimination, injustice and exploitation, on the domestic as well as the international level.\n64.\tWe have recently witnessed the birth of new nations, sharers of our language and creators of original cultures, in which we encounter echoes and amalgams of our own culture and our own mentality and indelible marks of coexistence, although they have been alienated by an oppressive colonial situation. The voices of those nations are beginning to make themselves heard in the international community, with all the authority resulting from the fact that they represent people who have for a long time fought for liberty, justice and national independence. My first greeting is addressed to the Portuguese-speaking nations which have this year become part of the United Nations. We direct our warmest and most fraternal salutations to Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe and Mozambique. My Government had the opportunity to welcome the admission of Guinea-Bissau last year at the twenty-ninth session. Three more new nations, previously under Portuguese domination, and victims, together with us, of an unjust and cruel war, now participate in the United Nations. This fact, which is testimony to the sincerity of our intentions and of the seriousness of our decolonization policy, is for us a cause for profound pride and true happiness.\n65.\tI cannot fail to recall here the role that Algeria played in the process which, on 25 April 1974> converted our country from the last vestige of ultra-colonialism, void of any historical meaning, into a country truly engaged in honoring its responsibilities in the irreversible process of emancipation of colonized peoples. The role always played by Algeria in supporting dialog between the clandestine Portuguese movements opposed to fascism and the national liberation movements of the Portuguese colonies became, after 25 April 1974, a role of mediation between the new Portuguese authorities and the liberation movements, assumed most especially by President Boumediene. All this merits sincere homage. Thus I address a special greeting to the former President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria. Certainly the personal and political qualities of Mr. Bouteflika have contributed much to the position of his country on the international scene as one of the most respected\n\nspokesmen for the third-world nations and proponent of a coherent policy of non-alignment.\n66.\tBut in this connexion I cannot fail to emphasize the assistance and support extended to us by the United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Zambia in the decolonization process, so crucial for our history and for our own identity as a nation. We have always found those countries, and particularly their Presidents, Mr. Nyerere and Mr. Kaunda, who are clearly inspired by an advanced humanistic philosophy, to be attentive and understanding interlocutors regarding the complex problems arising from the decolonization process.\n67.\tThe recognition by the international community and the United Nations in particular of our sincere efforts in this decolonization process was reaffirmed at the meeting of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, held at Lisbon this year. The historical significance of this meeting was incisively emphasized by my Government at the time.\n68.\tI cannot fail to greet with the greatest respect and admiration the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim. The Portuguese Government has had the opportunity on various occasions to recognize Mr. Waldheim's profound political sense and deep knowledge of international relations in all their complexity. I recall here his visit to Lisbon last year, which was of the greatest importance to us and had a significant influence on our effort to solve the problems generated by the colonial situation.\n69.\tMr. Gaston Thorn, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, has assumed the presidency of the General Assembly this year. Western Europe thus sees itself represented by a nation which, situated at the crossroads of the Latin and Germanic cultures, can well be considered the heart of Europe. I salute Mr. Thorn with great sincerity and wish him the fullest success in the performance of his task.\n70.\tPortugal is part of Western Europe and is aware that its historical role can never be dissociated from the European area to which it belongs. The complete independence of Portugal, for which we fight without compromise, can never be achieved against Europe, but only through a correct relation with Europe, to which we are bound by a common culture as well as by close relations of economics and emigration.\n71.\tThe role that Portugal can play in the struggle to establish relations of greater justice and equality between the major world economic centers and the third-world nations victims of inequitable and imbalanced international situations constitutes an important factor in this correct relationship with Europe as well as an effective contribution to the progressive evolution of international life. During the recent special session of the General Assembly, which was an important step towards dialog between these two poles, my country already had the opportunity to pronounce itself on this point, reaffirming a position of unequivocal solidarity with the poor nations in their struggle and favoring greater goodwill and understanding on the part of the great industrial Powers. Thus we assign the greatest importance to the problems of developing nations, with which we share many points of similarity,\nand to the creation of a new international economic order in which those nations will not see themselves relegated to a position of dependence and growing inequality. \n72. Portugal has already shown its adherence to the principles contained in the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the Character of Economic Rights and Duties of States. We give our unreserved support to the recent steps taken towards the establishment of a new system of just and humanistic international economic relations. \n73. Within the decisive dialog for human survival which links the large economic power centers with the poor nations, the dialog between Europe and Africa places us in a position of particular usefulness because of the role we can assume as a link between these two arenas. Our historical responsibilities in the African continent have imparted to us an understanding of the dimensions of misery and suffering that these people, so long subject to colonial domination, seek today to escape.  \n\n\n74.\tThe important experience of decolonization has enabled us to become aware of the role of mediation that we can play in the dialog between Europe, the traditional beneficiary of colonial situations, and Africa. Although a colonial country, Portugal was not a dominant economic Power in the chain of imperialist exploitation. Situated on the periphery of Europe and in a subordinate position in relation to the large European industrial centers, its role as a conveyor belt for substantial private transnational interests became, with the intensification of the war, daily more flagrant. This having been the case, now that the political power in Portugal\nis at the service of the classes with fewer advantages and is directed at a policy of progress and national independence, our historic role changes radically and Portugal becomes capable, thanks to a decolonization process carried out without any neo-colonialist intentions, of becoming the carrier of a new pattern of relations between the major centers of wealth and power and the poor and exploited nations of the third world.\n75.\tWe think that the extinction of the growing inequality between rich and poor countries by the elimination of international economic mechanisms distorted by powerful interests which are at the root of this inequality, besides being necessary in the interest of justice, must also be an important factor in the settlement of conflicts and in the construction of peace.\n76.\tAnother factor that weighs decisively in the struggle for peace is disarmament. Long one of the priorities of the United Nations, it becomes more urgent each year given the growing accumulation of nuclear arms. Portugal favors the convening as soon as possible of a world disarmament conference at which all nations can discuss as equals this problem which is so crucial to the survival of mankind.\n77 Throughout its existence, the role of the United Maikins in the defense of peace and the search for negotiated solutions to the conflicts that lacerate our world has been emphasized.\n78.\tDuring the last years of fascism in Portugal, the rulers of my country were systematic detractors of this Organization, as a result of the firm positions taken here against its colonial policy. These positions, however, taught us Portuguese to respect the United Nations; the reception given at the twenty-ninth session to the new Portugal which was represented by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Mario Soares, and by the President of the Republic, General Francisco da Costa Gomes, gave us profound satisfaction.\n79.\tThe structures of this Organization were adapted to an international context which has seen many changes since the days of the San Francisco Conference. It would be just to accuse the Organization of ineffectiveness in the maintenance of peace and security; in fact, the United Nations has frequently acted within the past years as a mediator and a proponent of dialog between opposing parties. Nevertheless it is necessary, now that the voices of the small and non-aligned nations are heard with growing strength in the international community, that the structures and organisms of the United Nations progressively reflect this state of affairs. But in general, we can make a frankly favorable judgment of the activities of this Organization.\n80.\tThe past year has seen some important favorable developments in the international situation. In the first place, I shall emphasize advances in the elimination of colonial domination, a process in which our political efforts to achieve a just decolonization, as well as to ensure the political capability and national representativity of the liberation movements, were significant.\n81.\tThe end of the war in Viet Nam and Cambodia was also an important victory for world peace. The peoples of Viet Nam and Cambodia, tormented by a long and destructive war, were able to achieve peace through the free and autonomous choice of their political future.\n82.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe this year also represented a historic step in the struggle for world peace. Portugal participated actively and with interest in the work of this Conference, from which resulted important decisions regarding the stabilization of relations between the European States and increased co-operation between the nations of Europe, regardless of their adherence to different political and military blocs. For this reason, the Conference marked the principle of overcoming rigid opposition between blocs and represented a material contribution towards international detente.\n83.\tI shall now refer to some of the questions which most threaten international peace. Regarding the Middle East, we view with concern the disrespect for decisions already taken by the United Nations. We are for peace in this region, which does not signify disregard for any of the already established facts of nationhood, but which implies equally firm repudiation of any violent or imperialist solution, or the imposition by force of the will of one community on another.\n84.\tWe are thankful for the recent peace initiatives in this area and hope that they lead to a solution recognizing the right of the Palestinian peoples to self-\ndetermination and nationhood (although we believe that the existence of Israel as a nation cannot be ignored). With respect to this question we are in favor, of a solution allowing for the free life of the various communities, with the exercise of hegemony by none, a principle which has always guided our decolonization policy.\n85.\tIn relation to the question of Cyprus, we see here also two national communities which, although coexisting in the same territory, have been unable to achieve a peaceful and harmonious life together.\n86.\tCyprus is situated in a geo-political area, the Mediterranean, which we believe could be extended in the sense of allowing a closeness to grow up between the countries of southern Europe and those of North Africa and the Middle East that would in time come to effect a very favorable influence on the balance of power in the world. The struggle of the Cypriot people for the autonomous choice of their destiny will certainly contribute to the consolidation of the Mediterranean area, to which we attach great importance.\n87.\tOur condemnation of apartheid is final and derives from the internationalism of our policies. All discrimination between men is repugnant to our conscience, be it discrimination based on race, sex, religion or any other criterion. Such discrimination is the negation of human progress.\n88.\tRegarding Southern Rhodesia, Portugal has already recognized the African National Congress as the sole and legitimate representative of the people of Zimbabwe and has condemned the repressive and discriminatory policies of the Salisbury regime. We hope and desire that this problem may be resolved by peaceful and political means, through negotiation, although we believe that the strongest international pressure must be exerted on the minority Rhodesian regime.\n89.\tRegarding Namibia, our position is that the Territory is under the illegal occupation of the Republic of South Africa. We hope that that country will shortly come to accept the relevant resolutions already adopted by the United Nations.\n90.\tI shall now direct myself to two questions that are of greatest concern to us at this moment, for with respect to them we act within the full context of a decolonization policy based on respect for the political choices of peoples and on repudiation of all forms of neo-colonialism. I am referring to the questions of Angola and Timor.\n91.\tA fundamental principle of our decolonization policy has always been the respect for the personality of the colonial peoples and for their capacity to determine themselves their political destiny and construct the type of society best adapted to their national conditions. We consider the only legitimate political expression of the colonial peoples to be the national liberation movements which, rooted in the population and without any ethnic distinction, in fact carry out, in the field of political and armed struggle, the emancipation process of those peoples.\n92.\tAs regards Angola, the existence of three liberation movements, widely differentiated ideologically, has introduced a great complication into the implementation of the principle described. This complication has taken the form, on the part of the liberation movements, of systematic violation of established agreements and continuous resort to force over the whole Territory, in a desperate effort to attain hegemony on the date of independence and at the cost of sacrifice and suffering imposed on many thousands of persons, both European and African.\n93.\tRegardless of the political choices of the Portuguese people or the ideological beliefs of its leaders, Portugal believes it must neither export to nor impose upon its former colonies predetermined political or social models. The emancipation of peoples is the task of the peoples themselves and consequently no one can substitute himself for the Angolans in the choice of their future. We therefore recognize as legitimate interlocutors the three liberation movements also recognized internationally: the Frente Nacional para la Libertagao de Angola [FNLA], the Movimento Popular de Libertagao de Angola [MPLA ] and the Uniao Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola [UN1TA]. We have made every effort through political means so that an agreement can be reached between these three forces, in the best interests of the Angolan people.\n94.\tThe Alvor Agreement [see A/10040], in which every movement tacitly acknowledged the legitimacy of the other movements, set up a well defined transitional political framework for independence, overtaken by events in many respects. Nevertheless, Portugal remains faithful to the spirit and to the fundamental principles of those agreements. Thus it continues to recognize the three liberation movements as the legitimate representatives of the Angolan people; it considers 11 November as the date for the independence of Angola and it maintains that the unity of the Territory cannot be questioned. In view of the actual situation currently existing in Angola, truly one of civil war, the problem of the transfer of powers on the date of independence arises. For the solution of this problem, we place high hopes in the co-operation of the African States, particularly those with more direct interests in the area. A decisive contribution in this direction would be the immediate convening of a conference between the three liberation movements and Portugal, with the eventual participation, as mediators, of other African States chosen by the movements, a conference in which specific forms or means of transferring these powers would be studied.\n95.\tActive political and diplomatic support on the part of the United Nations and the international community, as well as non-interference on the part of the great Powers or of the great economic interests, will be of the highest importance for the solution of the Angolan conflict, which gravely endangers the political balance of the area and constitutes a serious threat to world peace.\n96.\tAll efforts must be made to prevent civil war spreading throughout the Territory, particularly after independence. We have spared none and will continue to do everything in our power, but we should like the international community to be increasingly aware of its responsibilities in the search for a peaceful solution with regard to the political future of the Territory.\n97.\tAs regards Timor, the situation is an extremely serious one. Portugal has proposed to the political parties of Timor la Associaao Popular Democratica\nTimorense [APODETJ], el Frente Revolucionaria Timor Leste Independente [FRETILIN] and la Uniao Democratica de Timor [UDT] that talks be held with a view to finding a peaceful solution with regard to the political future of the Territory. We are ready to accept a wide range of political formulas which would really cater to the interests of the people of Timor, without failing to take into account the legitimate interests in that geopolitical area, namely those of Indonesia, and which could be worked out by agreement with the representative parties of Timor. On the other hand, Portugal, as of now, declares itself ready to hold talks with Indonesia, at the appropriate level, with a view to opening the way to a rapid and negotiated solution of the conflicts existing at present and to the determination of the political future of the Territory, always with the agreement of the three parties.\n98.\tNow I shall make a final reference to our position as regards the two great blocs that divide the world today.\n99.\tPortugal is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] and, in accordance with the program of the Armed Forces Movement, which is a provisional constitutional law of my country, complies with all international commitments previously undertaken. We do not intend to call into question our own membership of that Organization because we believe the most favorable way to detente that would bring about the gradual dissolution of the antagonistic blocs inherited from the cold war must necessarily avoid the abrupt dislocation of the prevailing geo-strategic equilibrium. We will therefore remain loyally bound by NATO. This does not prevent us from expressing frank solidarity and favoring a. rapprochement with the group of non-aligned countries and with all those who, like ourselves, are paving the way for a policy of true national independence. Portugal recently participated, as a guest, in the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries held at Lima and has sought to intensify multilateral and bilateral contacts with this group of nations. We will continue to follow this policy and we feel sure we will thus not only reinforce our national independence but also more actively contribute towards a new type of peaceful relationship of solidarity that the independent peoples of all the world wish to see established.\n100.\tWe know that the progressive role we wish to play in the present-day world cannot be dissociated from our position in Western Europe. I have already stressed the role of interlocutor which we will be in a position to play between Europe and the countries of the third world, particularly Africa and the Arab countries. Recent encouraging events, like the Lome Convention, lead us to believe in the establishment of more just and equitable relations between Europe and the third world that will counterbalance the weight of the great Powers. The Mediterranean area can play an important role in a renewed relationship between these two poles.\n101. I have sketched before this Assembly the fundamental lines of our foreign policy. This policy stems from a basic option, made by the Armed Forces Movement in the name of the Portuguese people and later ratified, in free elections, by the sovereign will of the people: the option of socialism in political democracy.\n102.\tThis means the Portuguese want a society progressively emancipated from all forms of alienated relations among men, which derive from the concentration of wealth and the power of social decision in the hands of a minority; it means we want a society directed towards the suppression of class divisions, a society firmly committed to the road to socialism. This means, on the other hand, that, on this road to socialism, the Portuguese do not want to sacrifice the victories of political democracy based on the system of representation and on universal suffrage and party pluralism, because we believe true socialism does not deny those historical conquests but reinforces them and makes them universal, while remaining open to other forms of democratic life which the creative initiative of peoples may bring forth.\n103.\tFrom this basic option is derived, in our foreign policy, the respect for the fundamental principles of international life, namely: the peaceful solution of conflicts; equal sovereignty of States and the rejection of foreign interference in the choices and destinies of peoples; and the establishment of relations with all peoples of the world, independently of their social systems and political regimes. From it is also derived the support of the progressive tendencies which at present are gaining strength internationally, namely the struggle of the peoples and nations of the third world for total independence and for new and more equitable international economic relations and the evolution of detente in the relations between the great political military blocs.\n104.\tThe age-old aspiration of man for the abolition of the barriers raised by the privileges and selfishness of nations, races and classes demands progress in international relations towards justice and peace. Humanity is irreversibly approaching a dimension of universality. Peoples and cultures can no longer shun great world currents and tendencies, and the imposition of the imperialistic or hegemonic ambitions of some nations upon others is considered by universal conscience more and more to be inadmissible.\n105.\tIt was the historic role of my country to be the first to establish contacts among different peoples and civilizations formerly isolated from each other. It is our hope today to contribute towards this further Step in the ascent of man in a universal direction, in the words of a Portuguese poet, \\\"towards becoming step by step more human\\\".\n106.\tWe can become \\\"more human\\\" through the total negation of abusive and uncontrollable situations of political, social or economic power that are almost always based merely on the logic of the selfish interests of small and powerful groups, and through a realization that international relations must represent the meeting-point of the highest interests of humanity as a whole.\n107.\tTherefore we view with concern private interests that exist solely for profit spreading on a world-wide scale and even transcending national States. This is a fact to bear in mind from now on in international life and in the struggle of peoples towards full emancipation.\n108.\tOnly by overcoming all the oppression and exploitation to which humanity is still subjected will it be possible for man fully to assume his mission as\ncreator of universal values and as the conscience of the universe itself. For it is not only the survival of the human species that is our concern, but also the achievement of full humanity through liberation from all subjection and alienation, so as to bring the prehistory of human society to an end.\n\n\n\n"

My delegation cannot fail to greet warmly the accession to international sovereignty of those States, our brothers in blood and united to us by a common destiny.\n172.\tWith reference to the Republic of South Viet Nam and the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, my delegation regrets that the representatives of those two countries do not yet occupy their rightful places in our Organization. The universality of our Organization has too often been preached from this rostrum for international public opinion to stand silent while the candidacies of these two Vietnamese Republics are blocked because of the opposition of one permanent member of the Security Council. We must therefore hope that the Council will heed the appeal of the General Assembly, and will re-examine promptly and favorably the candidacies of these two countries, because clearly the universality of the United Nations cannot but have a favorable effect on the Organization, since it makes it possible to solve certain international problems in the light of the growing inter-dependence of the international community.\n173.\tAs the result of a new balance of power, which can be seen not only in the ever growing number of Member States, but also, above all, in the nature of their claims and in the new awareness of the need to undertake joint action to alter the system of international relations, the United Nations is striving to strengthen its role as a factor in the settlement of international problems on the basis of satisfying the legitimate interests of peoples and their aspirations to independence, freedom and progress.\n174.\tWith their new vision of the world and international problems, one cannot doubt that the countries of the third world have become one of the most active factors.for enhancing the role of the United Nations.\n175.\tAs I indicated at the beginning of my statement, there can be no doubt that the main problems of our world today revolve around two essential poles: the maintenance of peace and the promotion of economic development.\n176.\tPeace? We perceive the manifestations of it in some regions, whereas in others we cannot see even a passing shadow of it.\n177.\tIn Africa, a new wind is blowing since the Portuguese colonialist forces were removed from power. Thus, after Guinea-Bissau, the last Portuguese Territories in Africa have recovered or will recover their independence in 1975. The measures taken by the present leaders in Lisbon have not disappointed our hopes, even though at present serious problems arise, particularly in Angola. The internal war raging there and the rivalries of the popular movements have already handicapped the harmonious development of a country whose every prospect had been so promising. My delegation urges the leaders of the three liberation movements of that country to overcome their difficulties and to work more effectively for national reconstruction. After their well-deserved victory over colonialism, it is truly deplorable that the liberation movements of that country should offer us the sad spectacle we see today, which ultimately benefits only the enemies of Africa. Quite obviously, what unites them is more important than what divides them.\n178.\tIn Asia, the problem of Korea remains a matter of concern. I would simply say in this connexion that the explosive situation which is continuing has lasted too long. Are we to leave that country perpetually divided even though the two parties have expressed a real and specific will to reunite in their joint communique of 4 July 1972?'\n179.\tUpper Volta wishes to reiterate its position as I stated it here during the twenty-ninth session: we demand, first, the dissolution of the United Nations Command; and second, the withdrawal of the foreign troops stationed in Korea under the flag of the United Nations.\n180.\tIn our view, these measures are the prior requirements for any peace agreement likely to lead to an independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.\n181.\tIt is on the basis of this analysis that Upper Volta joined the sponsors of the draft resolution in document A/10191 regarding the creation of favorable conditions for converting the armistice into a durable peace in Korea and accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea,\n182.\tIn the meantime, the conflicts in South-East Asia would have rapidly found a happy outcome if the solutions advocated by the non-aligned had been accepted at the right time, in other words to allow peoples to live in peace which have always longed only for their independence and their freedom.\n183.\tIn this regard, I should like to make special mention of Cambodia. My delegation rejoices to see that we have among us once again the legitimate representatives of that country who had unjustly been deprived of their seat by a puppet clique in the pay of imperialism. Upper Volta, which, side by side with the progressive forces of the world, has striven for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, rejoices at the victory of the patriotic forces of that country. But can we ever forget the thousands who died because of our lack of action and postponements in the last two years when the General Assembly was dealing with the problem of Cambodia? While it is useless to go back to the past, it is nevertheless necessary to draw lessons for the future: foreign intervention, interference in the internal affairs of other States, the illegal occupation of territories by force, are now enterprises doomed to failure.\n184.\tBut if, there, some hopes are warranted, peace elsewhere is threatened nevertheless by other hot-beds of tension. Thus, in Africa, despite favorable developments in the Territories which were under Portuguese domination, the situation in southern Africa still remains alarming.\n185.\tApartheid persists despite the warnings of the international community. Likewise, South Africa continues to occupy Namibia with impunity and pursues its policy of bantustans.\n186.\tHowever, the racists of South Africa are reduced more and more to isolation, not only by the international community but also on their home ground, because Portuguese decolonization has left it deprived of bulwarks.\n187.\tNevertheless, we must pursue, and wage more vigorously, the international struggle against the South African system, because we must, unfortunately, admit that at this level many States have systematically ignored decisions which they themselves helped to draw up.\n188.\tLast year the General Assembly took a firm decision concerning the representatives of Pretoria after the triple veto which paralyzed the Security Council [resolution 3207 (XXIX)]. That legitimate decision was in accord with the idea we have of the\nUnited Nations in its task of peace and of safeguarding human dignity.\n189.\tUpper Volta, for its part, endorses the position clearly reaffirmed by Africa during the last extraordinary session of the Council of Ministers of the OAU held at Dar es Salaam: no dialog is possible with the South African authorities so long as we do not clearly perceive signs of a radical change in policy envisaging the granting to the majority of their legitimate rights.\n190.\tThe Middle East crisis has also become, in many respects, and far more than it was, the key world problem which is shaking the entire edifice of international relations; it is a threat to peace and security and puts the entire international community to the test. This crisis, which constantly moves back and forth between wars and uncertain truces, is more acute and more explosive than ever.\n191.\tApart from the withdrawal from occupied Arab territories, a lasting peace in that region must include the recognition and granting of the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine.\n192.\tThus, while justly appreciating the results of the new disengagement agreement between Egypt and Israel, we hope that the dynamics of peace will not therefore be interrupted. In the meantime, what we all want is to move in the direction of collective security, a security which must, above all, proceed from general and complete disarmament.\n193.\tConcerning that problem, Upper Volta can but recall its past position: namely, that it is urgent to seek ways and means to protect mankind from the nuclear disaster which threatens it because of the manufacture and stockpiling of nuclear weapons.\n194.\tIt is comforting to note that the problem of disarmament holds an important place on the agenda of this session. Is this not the signal that disarmament is what we all hold dear? However, we are bound to confess that so far we have not achieved the results which we were entitled to expect.\n195.\tUpper Volta is nevertheless happy at the initiatives which here and there begin to see the light of day. The establishment of nuclear-free zones is undoubtedly one of the most certain ways, if not to prohibit nuclear weapons in a region, at least to control them effectively. That is why last year we supported the resolution on the necessary denuclearization of the African continent [resolution 3261 E (XXIX)]. Similarly, we have taken good note of the preparation of a world disarmament conference. While it arouses certain apprehensions, it nevertheless remains a stage which could be decisive in the disarmament process if it is prepared by countries having the required political will.\n196.\tTo judge by the circumstantial and structural difficulties which are a source of serious concern in the field of international economic relations, this is no time for optimism.\n197.\tThe situation of the countries most seriously affected by the present economic crisis remains grave. Indeed, according to estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, cereal imports of 32 of those countries rose by $3,000 million in 1974-1975 and amounted to a total of $5,000 million; their need to import fertilizers rose to $1,500 million.\n198.\tWhereas it had been estimated that the unmet financial needs of these countries would rise to $2,300 million by 1975, everything leads us to believe that the needs will exceed $4,500 million.\n199.\tThe international assistance promised will amount to approximately $1,500 million. The deficit to be covered is therefore approximately $3,000 million.\n200.\tMost of the more seriously affected countries are still in a critical situation which is even more serious than it was in 1974, when the deficit had been estimated at $1,700 million.\n201.\tThe situation of these countries is worsening because of the steady deterioration in their terms of trade. The shocking rise in the price of fertilizers, fuel and food-stuffs, aggravated by inflationary pressures becoming more and more acute in the developed countries, is accompanied by a marked decline in their export earnings because of the recession in the developed countries.\n202.\tIt is therefore essential and urgent to have these countries benefit from new favorable measures so that their debt burden will not reach an unbearable level and that they will be able to obtain sufficient quantities of food and fertilizers at reasonable prices.\n203.\tThe unfavorable climatic conditions which have affected certain regions in recent years have resulted in bringing to light the weaknesses in the structures of agriculture, particularly in Africa: the lack there of adjustment in the ownership structures and cultivation methods to production requirements; lack of access to means of production; the insufficiency of the infrastructure, such as access roads and storage installations. The way in which the Africans themselves have at the State level taken all the necessary measures leads us to believe that there is need for outside help.\n204.\tOn a short-term basis, measures are needed to ease the economic difficulties created by the shortages caused by natural catastrophes.\n205.\tOn a long-term basis, consistent efforts should be made by the international community to support the development of the agricultural potential of the developing countries. In this connexion Upper Volta hopes that the Agricultural Development Fund will soon become operational and that it will have resources to finance agricultural projects mainly devoted to the production of food, in particular investments to build new fertilizer factories in the least advanced countries, which would do away with all the uncertainties of fertilizer supply and ensure production at a better price and the financing of investments in the processing industries of agricultural products.\n206.\tUpper Volta is essentially an agricultural country and we have decided to promote our social and economic development by taking the rural environment as the ultimate goal and vehicle for our actions. Our national experience in regard to community development will enable us in time to reach the poorest workers through outside contributions of production factors which will make it possible to increase production and productivity while safeguarding the cultural and rural traits which are factors for harmonious social and economic progress.\n207.\tThe most distressing problem for Upper Volta and other Sahelian countries is the lack of water resulting in the encroachment of the desert. It is in the hope of a solution to this scourge that we proposed to the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly the convening of an international conference \u25a0on preventing the encroachment of the desert [resolution 3337 (XXIX)]. We hope that the work of the conference will be deliberately directed towards the solution of theoretical and practical problems which will constitute the elements for a genuine program of international action.\n208.\tThe urgent implementation of special measures ! for the least advanced countries and the land-locked \u25a0 countries is all the more necessary since these countries are the most vulnerable in the developing world. The tragedies which these countries have lived through have quite eloquently proved the need to take corrective measures so as to enable them to deal successfully with the upheavals of the world economy.\n209.\tThe measures advocated for their benefit have remained a dead letter in the commercial sector. While we are justified in being gratified at certain measures in regard to technical and financial assistance at the bilateral and multilateral levels, the fact remains that those measures are very far from meeting expectations. For those countries, the multilateral financial institutions are still, alas, far from their mission of being development banks. The rigidity of their procedures for action, and in particular their strict adherence to standardized profitability.calculations, place them beyond the reach of projects covering the rural world of the least advanced countries.\n210.\tWe hope that the desired changes will be made as soon as possible in the methods of action by these institutions so as to enable the least advanced countries duly to benefit from the general measures adopted for all the developing countries within the framework of the United Nations Second Development Decade.\n211.\tSince the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, several international gatherings have been held, including the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the World Conference of the International Women's Year, the Dakar meeting on raw materials and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries at Lima. All these Conferences have had the merit of better defining a coherent and complete framework of action within which we should place our various efforts to establish a new international economic order.\n212.\tThe seventh special session has just ended. It made concrete progress in the direction of solving priority problems. There was unanimous agreement on an integrated program and the indexing and automatic transfer of resources to finance development, which deserve to be emphasized as having set the framework and objectives for negotiations which will be held between now and the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\n213.\tThe results of the seventh special session have clearly shown the primary role which the United Nations could and should play as the setting for agreement and negotiations with a view to applying the guiding principles defined in the Declaration and the program of Action for the New International Economic Order and in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. But, of necessity, Member States, individually or collectively, must resolutely undertake to comply with the obligations to which they have subscribed in all sovereignty, despite the temporary difficulties they may encounter, Only such an attitude can restore credibility to the United Nations in the eyes of the developing countries after the failures so far encountered in the effort undertaken within the framework of the two Development Decades, because, contrary to the impression spread by a certain press, failures are not to be attributed to the procedure of decision-taking but to the lack of goodwill manifested by the developed countries in carrying out the commitments to which they have subscribed.\n214.\tThe new structure for the economic and social sectors of the United Nations should rather strengthen its role as a negotiating center while making the Organization more capable of following and regularly checking the attainment of objectives jointly decided upon.\n215.\tWe are convinced that we have now made a start towards better co-operation among nations. Perhaps it would not be superfluous to meditate upon the words of the late U Thant, former Secretary-General of the United Nations, who said:\n\\\"Are we much longer to allow blind economic forces to prevail in relations among men in the name of that untenable thesis that social sciences are incapable of progressing at the same pace as physical science? We have arrived at the crossroads of history. Rich and poor countries alike have a choice: either they move forward towards a community of international prosperity that is planned and coordinated, or they separately follow different paths towards an unplanned future, a future of chaos.\\\""

        "file_text": "178.\t  Costa Rica is pleased to join in the many congratulations that have been expressed to Prime Minister Thorn on his well-deserved election as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. His diplomatic skill and vast parliamentary experience are familiar to all. His background as the political leader of Luxembourg, a democratic nation where internal political pluralism is effective and where there is respect for the free interplay of divergent opinions, is the best guarantee that he will discharge his lofty functions in the most appropriate manner.\n179.\tI also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General on his enlightening report on the work of this Organization [Al10001 and Add.l]. The profound considerations in the introduction give us much food for thought. I consider that they should be a most important guide for the deliberations of this Assembly.\n180.\tCosta Rica was one of the 51 founding Members of the United Nations. During the 30 years of its existence, we have remained faithful to its principles and purposes. Today, as in the past, we continue to believe that our Organization offers the best opportunities for the international community to maintain peace, to lessen the present enormous danger represented by armaments, and to make it possible in a peaceful and constructive manner to bring about the essential changes in economic and social relations within and among States.\n181.\tThat is why my country is not discouraged when the Organization fails in the immediate achievement of some of its objectives, and that is why we rejoice at its repeated successes. My delegation is determined to strengthen the United Nations. We maintain that the best way to do that is to make this Assembly, as well as the Security Council, the key forums where the national policies of its 142 Members are harmonized.\n182.\tEmphasis must be placed on harmonization, because the policy of international coexistence, which consists in the daily application of the principles of the Charter, is not forged by a dogmatic imposition of ideas upheld by a transitory majority upon a minority which is also transitory. An Assembly like this, in which so many Members participate, can be strengthened by its devotion to dialog and negotiation.\n183.\tConstant confrontation is the nuyor obstacle to the effectiveness of the General Assembly. It highlights the inability of its Members to understand different positions and to engage in the negotiation that is essential if we wish to find the common denominator that will pave the way for effective collective action.\n184.\tTo achieve the present strengthening of the Assembly it is not constructive to argue that the leaders of the automatic majorities of yesterday are today the minority. For when the former majority automatically imposed its decisions on the former\nminority, the Assembly did not function any more effectively. Therefore, there is no justification for continuing to use a system which has proved to be inefficient merely as revenge against those who were the majority in the past. In that case we would all the losers particularly the representatives of the small and medium-sized countries, for whom the strengthening of the Assembly provides the best opportunity to build an international system in which key decisions can be taken with our participation, and not in isolation, in the centers of political and military power.\n185.\tThis attitude of revenge is even more useless and unjustifiable now that the experience of the seventh special session has proved that it is possible for the General Assembly to function productively by means of a consensus, which is the product of a vigorous dialog and intelligent negotiation. While all mankind stands to benefit from the agreements that are designed to establish a new international economic order, there can be no doubt that when we manage to achieve it, those who will gain the most from the consensus would be the developing countries, which have so far been the victims of the prevailing system.\n186.\tVotes in which the numerical power of a transitory majority prevail tend to focus the Assembly's attention on the disagreements which exist among various groups. On the other hand, consensus concentrates its attention on what can be done to solve a common problem, although there need not necessarily be agreement on why it is done.\n187.\tThe mere fact of adopting by a majority, which is always transitory, resolutions which it is well known will not be complied with weakens the Assembly and lessens the credibility of the Organization. It is better to abandon the relative satisfaction of imposing by majority a controversial point of view that will not be implemented and to continue to negotiate until a consensus formula is arrived at which guarantees implementation.\n188.\tAlthough we cannot always do without voting  particularly on procedural matters it is indispensable that the consensus technique should prevail if we wish to strengthen the Assembly. The goal must be anticipated general acceptance, active or passive, of what the Assembly intends to achieve.\n189.\tWe must not forget that the 142 Members represent civilizations, cultures, political philosophies and vital realities which are very diverse. The survival and the success of the United Nations depend upon the capacity of this Assembly to include them within its historical context and to absorb whatever is valuable from each. Without trying to do away with that plurality at any time, but rather by respecting it at all times, it is possible to find what is common to all and to convert it into a means of collective action in order to obtain peace, justice and the well-being of all mankind.\n190.\tThe consensus technique does not, of course, imply the elimination of debate. On the contrary, it is essential that the different points of view be stated so that the process of negotiation may then begin. Those who are in a privileged position usually scorn as hostile rhetoric what is simply an expression of rebellion against unjust situations. Experience shows that the vehement denunciation of what is unjust is essential. Those who benefit from the status quo rarely\naccept changes unless they are preceded by energetic demands from its victims. Only when they are convinced that it is dangerous to maintain a situation which has become explosive because of the protests of those who suffer from it are the privileged prepared to discuss corrective means.\n191.\tOnce again, the fruitful result of the seventh special session offers a practical example of what I have just described. Without the repeated protest, which grew each day more vehement, of the countries of the third world against the prevailing international economic order, we would never have succeeded in getting the wealthy nations to pay attention to the causes of the poverty of the majority of mankind. Nor would we have succeeded in making the industrialized countries finally agree to negotiate the means of improving the situation of the developing countries.\n192.\tWhat is more, had there not been the increase in the price of oil through the agreed action of OPEC, it would not have been so easy to achieve the consensus by which the Assembly at the conclusion of its seventh special session, approved the resolution on development and international economic co-operation [resolution 3362 (S-VII)].\n193.\tFor the OPEC decision not only caused a dislocation in the finances of the highly industrialized countries. Above all, it was a very serious challenge to the existing international economic order. Within that order, the industrialized countries were accustomed to having a decisive influence because of their control of the machinery of the world economy, the prices of the basic commodities that they take from our countries, and the prices of the goods and services that the countries of the third world have to purchase from them.\n194.\tNow, for the first time in the history of the modern world, a group of countries removed from the major centers of political and military power such as the OPEC countries have taken a decision that fundamentally affects the prices of a basic raw material, despite the desires of those who so far have dominated every facet of international trade.\n195.\tThat decision has made it clear that there is no reason to perpetuate the dependence in which the countries of the third world have lived in relation to the sale and marketing of commodities. It has meant that that dependence can even be reversed if the developing countries act together and decisively in the defense of their interests. That is why all the countries of the third world have supported the OPEC decision, although many of those countries, such as Costa Rica, which do not have the good luck to be a producer of oil, are affected by the vertical spiral in the price of oil.\n196.\tBut let this serve as an opportunity to issue a warning that OPEC must not take it for granted that this support will continue for any further increases in prices which they may wish to decree, including the increase of 10 per cent which came into force yesterday particularly since the majority of its members seem to have forgotten their solidarity with the nations of the third world. Nevertheless, we are still hoping that the countries that are newly rich because of their oil exports will give tangible proof of their intention to use their growing resources to finance a system\nof economic co-operation which by iis scope will differ fundamentally from the systems established by the highly industrialized nations.\n197.\tAs I had l he opportunity of saying a few days ago in the Security Council, it is Costa Rica's aspiration that all the independent States of the world should be Members of the United Nations. Universality is essential if this Organization is to be truly representative of the international community. And precisely because we have faith in it, we believe that it is not only very desirable but also necessary that all Stales which have conflicts between themselves should enter and remain within the Organization.\n198.\tThat is why we have favored for many years  and not only now the admission of the two States into which the Vietnamese nation has been divided. We did not object to admission when South Viet Nam had a capitalistic orientation and was at war with pro-Communist North Viet Nam. Of course , we do not object now when the two States have the same socialist organization of a totalitarian nature. Indeed, those who were against the simultaneous entry have now become their most ardent sponsors.\n199.\tWe believe that the indiscriminate application of the principle or universality is in conformity with the criterion that ideological and political pluralism is indispensable for the peaceful coexistence that we all so much welcome. If we do not accept the right of each State to adopt the political and economic systems which, in the opinion of its Government, de jure or de facto, are most in accord with the historical facts, we violate the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another State. Without respect for that principle, international harmony is inconceivable.\n200.\tFor the same reasons, we have always been in favor of the admission to the United Nations of the two States into which the Korean nation has been divided. We regard as unacceptable the argument that the admission of both States would be an obstacle to their eventual unification. My delegation maintains that, on the contrary, the presence of the representatives of North Korea and South Korea in all the forums of our Organization would make contacts between them easier and would enable the international community to exercise a moderating influence in order to find formulas that would make it possible to overcome the obstacles to the reunification of the Korean people that exist today.\n201.\tThe fact that North Korea does not now wish to become a Member of the United Nations is re ally-no reason to prevent the admission of South Korea, which docs. That is why 1 maintained in the Security Council that the refusal to include in the agenda the Republic of Korea's application for admission was an act of discrimination totally incompatible with the principle of universality.\n202.\tBehind that attitude it is not difficult to see the real designs of many delegations. Their refusal to recognize the very existence of the Republic of Korea, while they fully support the Democrat*: People's Republic of Korea, reflects a dangerous tendency to use ideological and political pluralism only when it is convenient to socialism of a totalitarian nature, and to reject that pluralism when ut applies to States that\nare scornfully described as satellites of capitalist imperialism.\n203.\tThat enables us to place the item entitled \\\"The question of Korea\\\" m its proper perspective. That question has been on the agenda of each session of the General Assembly for 28 years.\n204.\tAs is well known, an armistice is. by basic definition, a temporary military agreement suspending hostilities while a peace treaty is negotiated between the belligerents.\n205.\tRegrettably, the temporary nature of the armistice that put an end to the tragic war in Korea has been prolonged for more than 22 years now, and it appears that it wit! be prolonged for many more years because our Organization cannot, if it acts responsibly, set aside an instrument that was signed by the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, as the sole representative of one of the belligerent parties, until a peaceful settlement of the conflict has been reached\n206.\tThe division of the Korean nation into two States, each of them supplanted by the respective sides in the cold war. was never accepted by the valiant people of Korea. The attempt to achieve reunification by force unleashed the bloody war of 1950, Since the end of the conflict, both Stales have continued to proclaim their unwavering decision to achieve the reuniOcatkw of their nation under a single Government That aspiration has been endorsed by this forum. That is why the General Assembly at its twenty-eighth session was w pleased it* hear that both parties had undertaken talks inwards peaceful reunification. And that is why we are discouraged that those talks not only have not progressed but. on the contrary, have led to increased tension.\n207.\tMy delegation agrees that the United Nations is obliged to lend iJs assistance so that a solution can be found to the question of Korea in accordance with the purposes and principle of the Charter.\n208. In extending that assistance, the United Nations must bear in mind that the baste principle of self-determination must be applied exclusively by the Korean people. The key to the question is to know what that people really wants, or at least what is preferred by a majority that will undertake Jo respect the opinion of the minority. So far no other authentic formula has been invented for discovering the will of the people than a free vote. This matter concerns two Stales recognized by a growing number of the members of the international community. The popular consultation cannot be left lo either one. A referendum requires supervision of the entire process by our Organization.\n209. Here is the crux of the problem, because many Governments do not believe in direct popular consultation. I must confess that for us who have lived within a representative democratic system, their position is difficult to understand If sovereignly resides in the people, as all admit, we fail lo understand how a man, or a group, can legitimately arrogate to itself representation without prior popular consultation. Because for us. I repeat, in only true way to determine the wishes of a people is to consult it through the machinery of a free referendum.\n210.\tAny other way of representing the popular will is based on an assumption which, for us who are democratic, is difficult to accept namely, that people are not wise enough to choose their own course and, therefore, the choice must be made only by a man or a group which is the self-designated interpreter of the popular will.\n211.\tIn order to achieve the ideal of the peaceful reunification of Korea on the basis of the complete exercise of the self-determination of the Korean people, the armistice must be kept in force since it prevents new military clashes, and we must, by every possible means, bring about a constructive dialog between the representative of the two States concerned.\n212.\tAs a means of giving greater participation to the two Korean Governments in decisions on matters of direct concern to them, we believe it is desirable to dissolve the United Nations Command in Korea. But to that end we must first have the parties directly concerned adopt adequate measures so that, on the disappearance of the military Command of our Organization. there be no fundamental change in the operation of the armistice.\n213.\tThat is why we have sponsored draft resolution A/10142 and Add. 1-7 now before the Assembly.\n214.\tMy delegation would have no difficulty in supporting, in its essential premises, draft resolution A/10191 and Add. 1-3. if guarantees are given that force will not be used to unify Korea, and that the political structure  and orientation of the unified Korean State is chosen exclusively and directly by the people of the peninsula through the machinery of a free referendum under international supervision.\n215.\tThe conflict in the Middle Hast has for decades cast a shadow on the panorama of the peace of the world. That is why it has been the subject of constant attention by the United Nations. The partial agreements achieved have the nature of emergency measures to halt hostilities. Now, for the first time, an agreement has been reached between Israel and a neighboring Arab country which docs not have armed conflict as an immediate antecedent. The agreement just initialed by Egypt and Israel for a further disengagement of troops in the Sinai is the result of a dialog which was started before, not after, military confrontation.\n216.\tThis agreement, therefore, has a far greater importance than its immediate effects might indicate. Israel and E-gypt have proved that it is possible to hold direct negotiations between the belligerent parties in the region. And this is a remarkable improvement in view of the repeated refusal of the Arab States to sit and discuss their problems with the representatives of the State of Israel whose existence they have unrealistically been determined to ignore. Now it can be seen that the result of direct negotiation has no substitute as a means of arriving at a peaceful solution of the conflict. My delegation hopes that the example will have the effect of inducing the other belligerent parties to negotiate directly with their neighbor on agreements which will, in the near future, bring about a lasting peace.\n217.\tI wish to express the admiration of Costa Ricafor the valor and statesmanlike vision evinced by the\nPresident of Egypt, Mr. Sadat, and by the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Rabin, incoming to this agreement, I also wish to congratulate the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Kissinger, whose perseverance and extraordinary diplomatic skill were so important a factor in negotiating that agreement.\n218.\tIt is true that the Sinai agreement is only a first step on the long road towards solution of the Middle East conflict. There remain extremely difficult questions to be solved such as: first, the security of the State of Israel within frontiers which can only be final when a peace treaty is reached that its neighbors recognize; secondly, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territories occupied during the 1967 war; and thirdly, the recognition and practical implementation of the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine, which includes living in peace within its own State.\n219.\tMy delegation considers that Security Council resolution 242 (1967), supplemented by its resolution 338 (1973), contains all the necessary elements for the solution of these problems. The difficulty resides in the fact that application is hampered by those who would try to destroy its harmonious balance by the immediate application of the paragraphs of those resolutions which are to their liking, and the indefinite postponement of the implementation of the paragraphs which are not.\n220.\tI believe that this deadlock can only be overcome when all the parties involved in the conflict evince the same determination, perseverance and flexibility which Egypt and Israel demonstrated in the direct negotiation of the disengagement agreement for Sinai, which has deservedly been the subject of so much applause in this Assembly.\n221.\tTwo important decisions, both taken at the meetings held in the month of July 1975 in the capital of my country, are proof of the intention to strengthen the inter-American system which, on a regional basis, helps to achieve the purposes of the United Nations. One relates to the reform of the inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance of 1947, and the other, the lifting of sanctions which have been imposed on the Republic of Cuba since 1964.\n222.\tThe inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, as its name indicates, is not a military alliance, nor is the idea behind it to take advantage of States which are not parties. Basically, it is a covenant for the defense, in a spirit of solidarity, of a State party which is the victim of aggression from within or outside the continent. We consider the Treaty to be our best instrument for national defense, and on this we based the decision we took in 1948 to do away with our armed forces.\n223.\tThis led us to co-operate enthusiastically in the reform of its text, not only to adjust it to the new conditions of inter-American policy, but also so as to avoid dangerous expansionist interpretations, as had occurred in the case of Cuba.\n224.\tThe new text which was approved in San Jose no longer gives such flexibility to the consultative organ which administers the Treaty, to impose sanctions on a State unless it is for very serious acts which constitute genuine aggression in accordance with the definition adopted by the United Nations.\n225.\tTherefore, in future, the consultative organ cannot interpret that a given ideological definition or a heterodox form of political organization adopted by a Government of the Americas can be considered tantamount to aggression which affects peace in America and which, consequently, justifies pacifying action or the imposition of sanctions.\n226.\tThe measures taken against Cuba in a very debatable implementation of the Treaty were the result of the cold war, which is now thawing out. Their application for more than 11 years had made them obsolete and turned them into a source of disagreement within the inter-American family.\n227.\tThat is why Costa Rica was determined that the organ of consultation itself, which in 1964 decreed the prohibition of States members of OAS maintaining diplomatic, consular or trade relations with Cuba, should make that inoperative.\n228.\tThat purpose was finally achieved during the sixteenth consultative meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of States members of OAS held at San Jose on 29 July 1975.\n229.\tThe Government of Costa Rica hopes that, by eliminating that cause of friction in inter-American relations, a more propitious atmosphere will be created for dedicating the efforts of the inter-American system to improving the conditions of life of our peoples.\n230.\tThere still remains a vexatious item in inter-American relations, and that is that the Isthmian Canal Convention of 190310 is still in force. As long as Panama does not recover the full exercise of its sovereignty over the entire territory of the Republic, as long as an unacceptable colonial enclave remains in the very heart of that sister nation, the Latin American countries will not be free of the apprehension caused by the presence of a world super-Power within the inter-American community.\n231.\tThe negotiation of a new canal treaty which recognizes the just aspirations of Panama has become a test case as regards the sincerity of the inter-American policy of the United States. The cause of Panama is not that of Panama alone; because of its very merits it has become the cause of all Latin America.\n232.\tPeace and security through disarmament were the principal objectives of the founders of the United Nations. Regrettably, so far nothing really effective has been done even to limit the arms race, much less to disarm Member States.\n233.\tThe Secretary-General, in the introduction to his report on the Work of the Organization, severely criticizes this situation. He points out the discouraging fact that in a world increasingly concerned with the problems of social justice and economic development total expenditure on arms exceeds $300,000 million per year.\n234.\tThe international traffic in arms has become a sadly profitable business, to the extent of more than $20,000 million per year.\n235.\tIt is not only the great Powers which are involved in this arms race; small and medium-sized States waste resources which they should devote to solving their grave internal problems on acquiring weapons, which in most cases they use only to subject their own peoples.\n236.\tThe Secretary-General was quite right when, on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the signature of the Charter, he appealed urgently to nations large and small to give proof individually of moderation in acquiring arms, while intensifying their efforts to negotiate agreements leading to disarmament.\n237.\tIt is a great satisfaction to state that Costa Rica welcomes and puts into practice the appeal made by the Secretary-General. Since 1948 my country has dissolved its armed forces and since then has spent not a penny on instruments of war.\n238.\tFor Costa Rica the objectives of disarmament, or at least of arms limitation, are clear: first, to ensure peace by eliminating or limiting elements whose only purpose is war, secondly, to liberate resources so as to increase economic and social co-operation.\n239.\tAt present the amounts disbursed by developing countries for military purposes are 20 times higher than expenditure on development assistance. In 1973, for example, the developed countries allocated 6.6 per cent of their gross national product to military expenditure, while they contributed only 0.26 per cent to development assistance.\n240.\tIf the great Powers were to channel 1 per cent of the resources they devote to military expenditure to international economic co-operation there would be more than $2,000 million more for assistance to peoples who are trying to find a way out of poverty. This would represent an increase of 20 per cent on what is now spent on that noble purpose.\n241.\tFor the reasons I have stated, my delegation has supported and will continue to support every measure proposed in this Assembly intended to reduce military expenditure and to promote disarmament. We take all proposals made at their face value. We refuse to attribute to those proposals propagandist intentions or attempts to gain a position of advantage in the arms race objections raised by other delegations which are more suspicious or less interested in the solution of the problem.\n242.\tIn order to express in a single sentence all the importance which we attach to this matter, I should like to end my statement by saying that for Costa Rica the disarmament question in itself justifies the very existence of this world Organization.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "111.\t  Mr. President, on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria I would like to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the high position of President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly and to express our conviction that under your leadership the current session will contribute substantially to the affirmation of the positive developments of our times.\n112.\tThe year 1975 has been rich in memorable anniversaries linked with particularly remarkable events which have exerted, and continue to exert, a great influence upon the destinies of peoples all over the world. These events are the thirtieth anniversary of the victory of the anti-Fascist coalition over fascism in the Second World War and the thirtieth anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations.\n113.\tThe defeat of fascism and militarism radically changed the entire course of historical development, and caused profound and dynamic changes in the social and political structure of the world.\n114.\tThe main aim of the forces which unleashed the Second World War was to establish world domination. The result was their total defeat and the liberation of scores of peoples from Fascist slavery. The aggressors aimed at liquidating socialism. The result was the creation and consolidation of the world socialist system. And finally they aimed at redistributing the colonies. The result was the final and irreversible collapse of the colonial system of imperialism and the formation of over 70 new States. These results were achieved thanks to the victory of all peace-loving and democratic forces. All progressive people cherish feelings of warm gratitude for the exploit of the peoples of the Soviet Union, which endured the main burden of the war and played a decisive role in winning the victory.\n115.\tAs far back as the dark days of the war, nations and statesmen were faced with the question: on what basis should the future world be built so that the victory over the dark forces shall become a turning- point in mankind's history and not a new period between two wars?\n116.\tIn the past 30 years mankind has more than once witnessed acts of aggression and military conflicts. More than once has universal peace been put to serious test. However, the peace-loving forces succeeded in frustrating the warmongers' plans. There occurred changes in the balance of forces in the world which favored the forces of peace and progress. That process, of course, did not take place all at once, nor did it come about by itself. It was the result of many years of efforts. We have always considered the struggle for the reduction of tensions as the cause of peoples and countries from all continents. The relaxation of tensions in international relations assists the struggle of progressive and democratic forces against reaction, while the successes scored by these forces deepen the process of detente, widen its scope and assist in turning it into an irreversible process.\n117.\tIn between the twenty-ninth and the thirtieth sessions a number of events took place which confirmed that detente is emerging as a predominant trend in international relations. The principles of peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems are being translated into concrete deeds. The most brilliant manifestation of this trend is the successful completion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, a unique and unprecedented event in international relations. It became possible thanks to the consistent peaceful policies of the Soviet Union and the other countries of the socialist community, as well as to the political realism shown by the Governments of the European countries, the United States and Canada.\n118.\tThe results achieved by the Conference unani-mously received the highest assessment by the leaders of the participating States. These results met with wide approval throughout the whole world. As the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and President of the State Council of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Todor Zhivkov, declared, these results are a brilliant manifestation of the affirmation of the principles of the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems, and a proof, too, that today there are no issues that cannot be solved through negotiations.\n119.\tThe Final Act of the Conference represents a remarkable international document. It is permeated from beginning to end by the spirit, the goals and the principles of the United Nations.\n120.\tThe Helsinki decisions mark a new state in the relations among European countries, which will be built on the basis of just and progressive principles, unanimously adopted. These decisions will play the role of a powerful accelerator to the process of the reconstruction of the political, economic, scientific- technological and cultural relations between States with different social systems.\n121.\tIn the past Europe has twice become the centre of world wars that have had millions of victims and caused mass suffering and the destruction of enormous material wealth. Today Europe shows the way that must be followed so that detente can embrace all parts of the world. For that reason we are particularly gratified to note the high assessment, by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Lima in August, of the results of the All-European Conference, and of the favorable impact they will have on the development of international relations and co-operation among States.\n122.\tThe principles adopted at the Conference fully correspond to the foreign policy principles and goals of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. The clear-cut aspirations of our country to peace and co-operation determine the character of its relations with the countries of Europe and other parts of the world.\n123.\tIn particular the People's Republic of Bulgaria is actively contributing to the creation of an atmosphere of security and confidence among the Balkan States. Bulgaria is not guided by short-term considerations, and has never used for self-seeking interests the crisis situations that have arisen in the Balkans. We look upon our efforts for the strengthening of peace in that region as our contribution to peace and security in Europe. The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria will make unceasing efforts in the future also for the further development of co-operation among the Balkan countries and for the well-being of all peoples of the region.\n124.\tThe victory of the peoples of Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia, who won their right to independent existei ce in a heroic struggle, also contributed to the expansion and deepening of the process of detente. An end was put to the foreign intervention, and broad perspectives were opened up for the stabilization of peace and security in that part of the world.\n125.\tThe Bulgarian delegation notes with regret that the admission of the two Vietnamese States to the United Nations is being delayed by a totally unjustified and groundless pretext. There exists no moral, political or legal reason whatsoever to refuse the right of the two Vietnamese Republics to be full-fledged members of this Organization. That was confirmed by resolution 3366 (XXX), unanimously adopted by the General Assembly, which calls upon the Security Council immediately and favorably to reconsider the applications of the two Vietnamese States. We are convinced that commonsense will triumph during the thirtieth session and that the representatives of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam will occupy their lawful places among us as Members of the United Nations.\n126.\tThe removal of the economic and political blockade against Cuba has also been a contribution to the struggle for detente.\n127.\tThe policy of detente favors the national liberation struggle of peoples against foreign oppression. The process of decolonization has been notably accelerated recently, and the peoples in a number of colciial countries have won their national independence.\n128.\tOn behalf of the People's Republic of Bulgaria I welcome the representatives of Mozambique, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and Papua New Guinea on the attainment of their independence and their admission to the United Nations as Members.\n129.\tColonialism is moribund. The United Nations has made a not insignificant contribution to that process. Fifteen years ago the General Assembly adopted a historic document the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. The unity of action of the socialist countries with the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America in the struggle for the implementation of that Declaration was strengthened. At the current session the United Nations should draw up a balance-sheet of its activities in this field and outline further measures for the total and final elimination of all vestiges of colonialism, racial discrimination and apartheid.\n130.\tThe phenomena and processes which are developing in the present-day international situation confirm that detente creates favorable conditions for reaching a just solution to even the most acute international conflicts, for broadening international co-operation and for successfully resolving vitally important socio-economic problems, particularly the problems which confront developing countries.\n131.\tIn this situation it has become possible to raise the question of the reconstruction of international economic relations on a new and just basis. We welcome the positive decisions of the seventh special session of the General Assembly as a new and important step in this direction.\n132.\tIt should not be forgotten, however, that the forces hostile to peace and detente have not resigned and have not been disarmed and that they have not given up their attempts to launch an offensive in different countries or regions or even to return the world to the atmosphere of the \\\"cold war\\\". We have never imagined the road to detente to be smooth and without obstacles. It is the fault of certain militaristic circles and advocates of the policy of acting from a position of strength, who are actively assisted by those whose policy is based on the arms race and who dream of a new world holocaust, that there still exist centers of tension and military conflicts in a number of areas of the world.\n133.\tThe Bulgarian people are justifiably alarmed by the continuing crisis in the Middle East, which conceals a great threat to peace. The danger of a new military clash in this area has not been removed and will not be removed until Israel withdraws from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967, until the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine are restored, including the right to create their own State, and until the right of all peoples and States to live in peace and security in the region are assured. A just, overall and durable settlement to the conflict cannot be achieved by partial measures, but only within the framework of the Geneva Conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, which is the sole legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine.\n134.\tOne of the unsolved issues is that of Cyprus. It continues to disturb relations in the Balkans and in the Eastern Mediterranean and unsettles peace. The Bulgarian Government, whose position on the Cyprus problem is well-known, is hopeful that a solution will be found which will correspond to the interests of the people of Cyprus, the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots, as well as to the interests of peace and security in the Balkans. Undoubtedly, the United Nations can play a positive role in the settlement of the Cyprus problem by activating its efforts for the implementation of its own decisions.\n135.\tThe United Nations must, already at the current session, take a decision to dissolve the so-called \\\"United Nations Command\\\" and to bring about the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed on the terri-, tory of South Korea. The United Nations will thus help in practical terms the just solution of the Korean question, the peaceful reunification of the Korean people, and will undo the harm caused to the United Nations authority more than a quarter of a century ago.\n136.\tThe United Nations is also required to make ever more energetic efforts for the restoration and respect of human rights in Chile, for the release from prisons of the heroic sons and daughters of the Chilean people. World public opinion must not allow the Chilean tragedy to be repeated in any other part of the world.\n137.\tIt is necessary to put an end to any attempts at outside interference aimed at checking the democratic development of Portugal.\n138.\tOur Government shares the view, expressed by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in the introduction to the report on the work of the United Nations, that the attention of Member States should be directed towards increasing the United Nations contribution to the solution of the major issues of our times and, in the first place, to the strengthening of world peace. We consider that the United Nations is in a position to do a great deal for the elimination of existing hotbeds of tensions and conflicts. One of the ways to do this is for all States to adhere to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)], which was adopted on the initiative of the Soviet Union five years ago.\n139.\tWe are deeply convinced that lasting peace and security are incompatible with the arms race. The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria considers that it is of vital importance to supplement political detente with military detente. The fact that today nearly $300,000 million are being spent annually on armaments cannot but cause anxiety. The Secretary-General had every reason, when stressing the dimensions of this unprecedented spending for military purposes, to point out the imperative necessity of taking effective measures for ending the arms race and for disarmament.\n140.\tThe constructive spirit displayed at Helsinki at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe ought also to stimulate the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe in order to overcome the standstill in the negotiations. We believe that there exist conditions for reaching positive results in the talks, provided that all participating countries adopt a realistic approach and do not attempt to obtain one-sided advantages.\n141.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria, which along with other countries of the socialist community has always fought for general and complete disarmament, viewed with satisfaction the Soviet-United States agreements concluded in Vladivostok in November 1974 and regards them as real steps towards the limitation of the nuclear arms race.\n142.\tThe achievement of progress in the field of disarmament necessitates above all political will and a realistic approach. The achievement of new genuine results leading towards general and complete disarmament is hindered to a considerable degree by the unrealistic positions of certain Governments, by this raising absurd pre-conditions, creating artificial obstacles and undermining the work of the Organization in this important sphere.\n143.\tWe believe that the convening of a world disarm-ament conference with the participation of all countries, including all nuclear States, will prove extremely useful. The need for convening such a conference as soon as possible is being recognized by an ever wider circle of States. This fact necessitates turning to the practical preparation of the conference at the current session by enlarging the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference. Those who boycott the preparation of the conference and impede the implementation of four General Assembly resolutions, find themselves in growing isolation, because they defy the will of peoples and oppose the decisions of our Organization.\n144.\tThe implementation of the General Assembly resolution 3254 (XXIX) on reducing the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council and resolution 2936 (XXVII) on the non-use of force in international relations and on permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons will be a sizable step towards halting the arms race and will allow the release of the considerable means so much needed by developing countries at present.\n145.\tThe People's Republic of Bulgaria attaches special attention to the work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva. We hope that the Conference will be able very soon to conclude its work on the Soviet and United States drafts, identical in content, on a convention on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of technology to influence the environment. The work on such major problems as the creation of nuclear-free zones and the prohibition of chemical weapons must be brought to a successful completion without any delay.\n146.\tThe current session of the General Assembly could leave an unforgettable imprint on the history of the world Organization by taking decisions which would open broad perspectives leading to effective disarmament. A real and concrete basis in this respect is furnished by two important proposals submitted to the General Assembly a few days ago.\n147.\tI have in mind the new initiatives of the Soviet Union which once again undeniably bear witness to the unwavering concern of the Soviet Government not to allow, even for a moment, any slackening of effort in such a field as disarmament, which is so vitally important to all peoples and States.\n148.\tThe Soviet proposal for the conclusion of an agreement on the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and of new systems of such weapons [see AII0243, annex] is of exceptional importance to halting the arms race. Its implementation will help to cut off all attempts aimed at using the latest achievements of science and technology for military purposes and will contribute to expanding international scientific and technological co-operation for development purposes. Experience shows how difficult it is to halt the arms race in a particular field of armaments once it has begun.\n149.\tThe struggle for the prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests assumes an important place today in the efforts of the peace-loving forces to reduce and remove the thermonuclear danger. This question is of key importance for the prevention of the further proliferation of nuclear weapons, for halting the arms race and for beginning nuclear disarmament. The 1963 Moscow Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water and the 1974 Soviet-United States Treaty on the Limitation of Underground Nuclear Weapon Tests constitute important achievements in the endeavor to resolve this problem. As is known, however, there still exist at present possibilities for testing and perfecting nuclear weapons.\n150.\tIt is only the complete prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests that will contribute effectively to curbing the nuclear arms race. This determines the great significance and timeliness of the new Soviet proposal for the conclusion of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests [see A\\10241, annexJ.\n151.\tThe Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria welcomes and fully endorses the proposals initiated by the USSR. Those proposals constitute a new outstanding contribution to the further relaxation of the international climate and to disarmament. Owing to the great importance of these issues the question of their immediate settlement should, in our view, be placed at the center of the efforts of the current session of the General Assembly in order to achieve speedy progress on the whole range of disarmament problems.\n152.\tThe course of historical development shows that the desire of the peoples for a limitation of the arms race and for effective disarmament always faces stubborn opposition. At times that opposition has been due to political short-sightedness, to the theory, which has proved to be absolutely groundless, that it is necessary to prepare for war to strengthen peace. The opponents of disarmament were the representatives of those social circles which saw in conflicts and wars means for establishing their domination over other peoples and nations, political leaders who were dreaming of the creation of empires and world domination. The results of this short-sightedness and criminal intent were always tragic for the peoples. Those who love military adventures, those who are advocates of the arms race, have always borne a heavy responsibility, which in recent history led such people to the bench of the accused at Nuremberg. But in our time, a time of thermonuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, this responsibility has become much more significant and becomes particularly heavy when attempts are being made to indulge in pseudo-revolutionary phraseology and demagogic slogans to disguise over-ambitious political aims.\n153.\tNeither slander nor negation can diminish the significance and the political realism of the Soviet Union's proposal aimed at removing the obstacles in the path of efforts to stop the arms race and clearing the way to general and complete disarmament.\n154.\tWe are convinced that those proposals will find the same wide response in the world community and the same wide support on the part of the States Members of the United Nations as they have given to many other initiatives of the Soviet Union. Indeed, that will be the best possible answer to the slanderers and the opponents of disarmament, peace and understanding among peoples.\n155.\tThe United Nations was born amid the thunder of gunfire and embodied in itseif the wi'' and determination of nations not to permit again in the future the tragedies of war. During its 30 years of activity the world Organization has contributed to the preservation of universal peace and to the promotion of positive processes in international life.\n156.\tIn the course of past years, under quite different and sometimes particularly complicated circumstances, the Charter of the United Nations has stood the test of time and has proved its vitality.\n157.\tIf the United Nations has not always been successful in its undertakings, this is not due in any way to flaws in the Charter; on the contrary, this has been the direct result of the non-observance of its principles. Whenever States built their policies upon the strict observance of the Charter, conditions were created for a peaceful and just solution of international disputes, crises and conflicts; the Organization's contribution was then really effective. And, vice versa, when the principles of the Charter were violated, when countries diverged from them, tensions flared up in the world and there emerged a real threat to peace and security.\n158.\tThat is why Bulgaria is against any revision of the Charter. We are firmly convinced that the enhancement of the role and effectiveness of the United Nations can be achieved solely on the basis of the strict observance of the principles and provisions of the Charter.\n159.\tAs a member of the socialist community, the People's Republic of Bulgaria will continue to make its active contribution to the realization in the practice of international relations of the lofty principles and goals of the United Nations.\n160.\tWe are profoundly convinced that all the objective conditions exist for the current session of the General Assembly to adopt decisions which are worthy of its thirtieth anniversary and which will correspond to the innermost aspirations of the peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like to join my colleagues in saying how very pleased I am that we are meeting this year under your distinguished presidency. Those of us who have worked with you in the European Community know your qualities of wise judgment, combined with great insight and cool decision, and we are very glad that this year those qualities of yours are placed at the disposal of the United Nations. We look to your presidency because we believe it will strengthen the United Nations and we hope your term of office will add distinction to an already distinguished career and will do honor to Luxembourg.\n58.\tBritain extends a welcome to the newly independent countries of Mozambique, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe and Papua New Guinea, which are this session assuming their places as full and equal Members of our Organization. To them I wish all success.\n59.\tI should like too to thank our Secretary-General for his valuable and balanced report on the work of the Organization. The burdens on the Secretary- General grow no lighter, and I am glad that at this difficult time we have in that vital position a statesman of such proven diligence and dedication.\n60.\tThere is a certain resolute tenacity with which the major problems cling to the agenda of the General Assembly. They are a reminder of the limitations of the machinery of the United Nations in achieving a peaceful settlement of disputes unless the will is present to come to an agreement.\n61.\tBut the thirtieth year has not been barren: in fact, it has been a better than average year for the negotiators, as opposed to the war makers.\n62.\tAt the seventh special session and elsewhere, the Member nations have firmly committed themselves to try to bring about a world in which men and women will be made more equal through constructive policies of co-operation, rather than hurling threats and counter-threats at each other. The special session was an event of great significance, and I pledge that the United Kingdom will co-operate fully in the tasks ahead. While at this General Assembly we discuss the broad political questions that face us, my country will not forget the need to respond with urgency and a sense of justice to the manifest social and economic inequalities in the world today, despite the burdens that the world economic recession is imposing on the inhabitants of the advanced industrial countries. In return we ask the oil-producing countries not to impose additional burdens on our economies, for what the world needs is a period of prolonged expansion. Despite our hopes, it is not yet certain that the expansion will endure, but it will certainly be set at risk if heavier burdens are thrust on to those more advanced countries which must be the pace setters.\n63.\tIn the weeks and months to come, my Government would like to see progress in the military and political fields of potential conflict.\n64.\tIn the Middle East, for the first time, there is a break in the ice. For the first time, Israel and one of its Arab neighbors have concluded an agreement which was not forced upon them by military constraints. For the first time they have jointly stated that the conflict between them shall not be resolved by force, but by peaceful means. I should like to express my admiration for the courage and statesmanship which President El-Sadat of Egypt and Mr. Rabin of Israel have shown in the negotiations which led up to the agreement. I should also like to congratulate the United States Government, and in particular President Ford and Mr. Kissinger, on their perseverance and their skillful diplomacy. I should like here to express our thankfulness that President Ford was spared yesterday, and to say that our thoughts are with Mrs. Ford, too. The agreement which Egypt and Israel have concluded is not only to their mutual benefit; it benefits the rest of the world as well.\n65.\tThe progress that has been made does not mean that peace is around the corner. It is not. The problems which still remain are much larger than those which have been solved. Chief of these is the problem of the Palestinians, which has not yet been touched. What, then, is the way forward? First, in our view, a complementary step on the Golan Heights must be achieved, and achieved soon, to provide the proof that the latest agreement was not an end in itself but part of a continuous process leading to a comprehensive settlement. The commitment to further negotiations that has been spelled out in this newest agreement must be fulfilled. Syria and the other Arab States need to be convinced of the benefits of peace and that will require a further negotiating round. Following that must come the central problem of the Palestinians and the future of the West Bank, and at this point we shall be attacking the problem of a comprehensive settlement, and for this task a comprehensive forum, such as Geneva provides, would seem to be required. But if all the parties show the same resolution, perseverance and, not least, the flexibility that were shown in the recent negotiations, I am convinced that an ultimate solution could be reached that would ensure security for the State of Israel and justice for the Arab people.\n66.\tThe dilemma which faces the parties in the Middle East is a familiar one. On the one hand, any attempt to reach a full settlement all at once is likely to founder because the gap between the positions of the two sides is too wide to be bridged. On the other hand, any partial resolution of the problems may appear to favour one side at the expense of the other in the stages before a full settlement is reached, and therefore arouses opposition.\n67.\tThe new agreement between Israel and Egypt is important, not only in its practical effects though I would not wish to belittle them as in its example. Israel and Egypt have demonstrated to others that mutually beneficial agreements can be reached in the Middle East without sacrificing the interests of either party.\n68.\tAs this agreement matures it will give the Israelis cause to believe that they can put trust in the word of Egypt; and the Egyptians and after them others  will have cause to believe in the goodwill of Israel. This is the lesson and the real achievement of the recent negotiations. It provides a new foundation on which it should be possible to build, and a demonstration of the value of compromise.\n69.\tWe shall need a combination of methods. Problems on which partial steps can be taken should continue to be handled in that way. But the core of the problem, namely, the settlement of the Palestinian people, may well need a wider negotiation leading to a comprehensive solution. We know that it will be very difficult to achieve a peace which fulfills everyone's needs, but history has proved that peace is indivisible and the world cannot afford to settle for an incomplete solution,\n70.\tAs regards Cyprus, I note with regret that the talks that have been pursued intermittently during the last year between the parties have made very little progress despite the patient efforts of Mr. Wald- heim, to whom we extend our grateful thanks. The British Government adheres to resolution 3212 (XXIX) and affirms that its implementation would assist the process of reaching a settlement. If a solution is to be acceptable to both sides it will require to deal with the settlement of the refugees, the constitutional relationships between the parts of the island, the powers of the central Government, and the nature and physical delimitation of whatever zones are agreed upon.\n71.\tA solution based on such an agenda is difficult, but not impossible; but it does mean that a declaration of independence by any part of the island is ruled out. Such a declaration would perpetuate the conflict and result in continuing tension that could spread wider than the island itself, Therefore we call upon both sides to resume their discussions and to come forward with positive proposals for a solution.\n72.\tDespite the lack of progress made so far in these direct talks, we are not convinced that any different forum is likely to be more successful. We wish to see the direct talks renewed, together with the continuing presence of a mediator to assist the parties. But in the end the main responsibility for success will rest with the Turkish and Greek Cypriots themselves.\n73.\tOn Namibia we share with the international community a deep concern that the inhabitants of the Territory as a whole should be given the opportunity to express their views freely on their political and constitutional future. All political groups must be allowed to take part peacefully in the process of self- determination, and above all there must be a real sense of urgency.\n74.\tAs a member of the Security Council, we have joined with France and the United States in making formal demarches to the South African Government. \nWe observe some signs that the South African Government is taking a new look at its policies towards Namibia, but it is clear that the movement is not taking place quickly enough. We look to South Africa to make clear and positive progress without delay.\n75.\tFor our own part, Britain has contributed to the United Nations Fund for Namibia, to the proposed Institute for Namibia at Lusaka, to a United Nations Children's Fund project for aid to Namibian refugees; and we are one of the largest contributors to the United Nations Educational and Training program for Southern Africa, which includes provision for scholarships for Namibians. We have also provided funds to enable the South West Africa People's Organization to send students to Britain for English-language training, which will enable other forms of educational assistance to be given. In Namibia, as elsewhere in southern Africa, we shall continue in co-operation with other countries to work for self-determination, justice, racial equality, independence and peace.\n76.\tTurning to Rhodesia, I should like, first, to pay tribute to the efforts which the Presidents of Botswana, the United Republic of Tanzania, Mozambique and Zambia have made during the last year in conjunction with the Prime Minister of South Africa to promote a negotiated settlement in Rhodesia. It is a matter for regret that so much effort has not met with greater success, though some progress has been made and a first meeting between the regime and the African National Congress at Victoria Falls did reach agreement on a number of points.\n77.\tI see two prerequisites for further progress towards a negotiated solution. First, the Europeans, and particularly Mr. Smith, Prime Minister of Rhodesia, should realize that to rely on disunity among their political opponents as a justification for postponing essential changes is to invite disaster as history has frequently demonstrated. Second, there must be a clear and unified leadership on the African side; and that is something which the Congress itself must achieve.\n78.\tWe believe that agreement on the change to majority rule in Rhodesia is essential if peace is to be maintained in the area. If this is not achieved there will be a long slide into armed struggle and irreparable damage will be done to the country and to its neighbors.\n79.\tTo prevent such a disaster I call upon both sides to resume their discussions, and I urge the four Presidents and also the South African Government not to be discouraged by the difficulties which have arisen. I trust they will resume their efforts. We for our part remain ready to play our full part. Meanwhile, until a just settlement is achieved, the United Nations sanctions must continue to be applied effectively as one of the instruments for maintaining pressure on the illegal regime.\n80.\t. Now I turn to disarmament. The Secretary- General, in his report, has reminded us of our responsibility for disarmament. Every year the nations pile up more and more arms. Every year the arms bill grows larger. Every year the capacity for destruction more frightening. In some parts of the world such as the Middle East, competition for arms is never ceasing. Hardly any continent is exempt from the pressure. No one who cares for the progress of the human race towards decent standards of living can help but be appalled at the enormous waste of resources on weapons of destruction. A number of countries, some of whom are among the poorest, are now spending as much as 10 per cent of their gross national product for military purposes. What a boost it could give to the world's hopes if all of us could agree to limit to a maximum of even 5 per cent the amount of our gross national product we allocate for defense. This would presuppose that countries would move step by step to such a figure and would need to enter into serious multilateral negotiations with one another for reductions in their military establishments. That is indeed what we are doing in the negotiations that are now beginning on force reductions in Central Europe. If these negotiations could be paralleled in other regions of the world it would be a hopeful beginning.\n81.\tProbably the greatest potential risk that faces us is the nuclear danger. Of course, we welcome the steps that are being taken to control nuclear arms by the United States and the Soviet Union. We believe there should be no insuperable difficulties in bringing the arrangements made at Vladivostok to a successful conclusion. We look forward to a new strategic arms limitation agreement being signed before the end of this year. But that agreement, although important, does no more than put a brake on the present nuclear arms race. It is necessary to move onwards to an actual reduction in the number of nuclear weapons, and we ask both the United States and the Soviet Union to press to a successful conclusion the next round of talks on this subject that is due to take place in 1977.\n82.\tThe Soviet Government has put forward a proposed draft treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests [A! 10241, annex]. The United Kingdom has consistently supported this goal. We wish the initiative well. However, I cannot fail to point out that it will require the adherence of all the nuclear-weapon States and provision for verification, and that so far it has not been possible to meet these conditions completely.\n83.\tWe should also examine with care the proposal made by the representative of the Soviet Union at the preceding meeting [A/10243, annex] in the document that was circulated among us.\n84.\tBut even before we solve these problems a new danger is coming to view that I now wish to discuss. It arises from the overlap between the desire of certain countries to use nuclear material for civil purposes and the increasing risk that such material may be employed for military purposes. The metals uranium and plutonium are used not solely in nuclear reactors to produce power for civil purposes, for highly enriched uranium and plutonium can also be used to make nuclear weapons. Those who possess a nuclear reactor have already taken the first step to being able to pro-duce a nuclear weapon. If they then move from that to the second step and acquire plants to enrich their uranium and to reprocess the fuels that have already been used in their nuclear reactors, then they will be a long way down the road to producing nuclear weapons. Up to the present, it is the nuclear-weapon States that alone possess such plants, namely, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and China. But other countries are now beginning to consider whether they, too, should order reprocessing and enriching plants. If and when they do so, and the plants are in working order, they will be able to produce weapons material at a rate which would enable several thousand nuclear weapons a year to be produced. To give a comparison, the present nuclear programs will accumulate more than 1 million 1 million kilograms of plutonium within the next 10 years; and by contrast, the bomb which fell on Nagasaki and created such havoc and such destruction was the equivalent of no more than about 10 kilograms. A million kilograms within the next 10 years  and 10 kilograms destroyed Nagasaki. The spread of these plants would enable the whole of mankind on this planet to destroy itself. Clearly, the statesmen of the world assembled here have a moral duty to act before it is too late.\n85.\tThe United Nations should concern itself with this problem immediately and add vigor and impetus to the work that is being done in the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA],\n86.\tI put forward five points for consideration, to try to contain this problem. First, the Members of the United Nations should solemnly affirm that each and all of them will not convert nuclear materials from civil use to military use. Secondly, this solemn declaration should be reinforced by an agreement to accept a common system of international inspection through the IAEA. There should be one set of rules for all countries in the world. Thirdly, all civil nuclear materials and facilities should be brought within the common inspection system. Fourthly, the IAEA should assume responsibility for inspection of enrichment and processing plants, in addition to its present task of safeguarding nuclear reactors. Fifthly, the new set of common rules should be based on monitoring nuclear material and accounting for its use at all stages through the life of the fuel.\n87.\tBritain intends to make a specific proposal along these lines to the IAEA. In this way we shall follow up the intentions of the recent conference on non- proliferation, although our proposals are not based on that Treaty and have a wider purpose. They are intended to give practical expression to the pledges that have already been made by many Governments that they will not convert nuclear material from civil to military purposes, and I hope that the General Assembly will give support to them.\n88.\tThirty years ago at the very first session of the General Assembly in London my great predecessor Ernest Bevin pledged that the British Government would use to the full every instrument created by the United Nations and give it its whole-hearted support. I was present when he made that speech. Looking back, I believe my country, as a permanent member of the Security Council during the whole of that period, has faithfully redeemed the pledge that Ernest Bevin gave. Now, today, I repeat that undertaking at a time when the potential dangers facing the world are at least as great as they were when the United Nations was founded. None of us expects the United Nations miraculously to solve all the world's problems. But patient effort, understanding of each other, a consciousness that we are all citizens of the same world, and that none of us can escape the consequences of each other's actions this, I believe, will enable mankind of all colors and all creeds to do as the founders of the United Nations did, and as our forefathers did, to rise to the challenge of our times.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "73.\t  Mr. President, we, the small countries, welcome your election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly, since this not only represents a recognition of your personal qualifications but is also a tribute to the principle of the equal sovereignty of States, which is so important in relations between nations large and small.\n74.\tWe are also pleased to pay a tribute of appreciation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, for the fruitful work done under his skillful guidance as President of the twenty- ninth session and the seventh special session, which culminated in the historic resolution on development and international economic co-operation [resolution 3362 (S-Vll)].\n75.\tIt is also a sincere pleasure to transmit to the Secretary-General the appreciation and gratitude of our people for his tireless efforts to achieve peace, security and international co-operation in accordance with the principles of the Charter and the best interests of mankind.\n76.\tWe welcome with particular enthusiasm the entry into the Organization of the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the People's Republic of Mozambique, to which will shortly be added Angola, Papua New Guinea and Suriname. These nations, as new Member States, bring to the international community young blood, fresh ideas and a lusty dynamism, to expand the tasks of the United Nations for the benefit of other people who desire freedom and justice in the world.\n77.\tBecause of the spirit of fraternal solidarity of the Governments and peoples of Latin America, the Republic of Panama has been proclaimed as the single candidate of the region for the vacancy to be left in the Security Council at the end of this year by the sister republic of Costa Rica.\n78.\tThis noble gesture of the fraternal Latin American countries is a striking recognition of the contribution made by Panama during the life of this Organization to the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as of its adherence to the principles and purposes of the United Nations, which it proved by the contribution of the contingent of soldiers from the National Guard of Panama which served with distinction in the operations of the United Nations Emergency Force in the Sinai area, in compliance with the mandate established by the Security Council.\n79.\tBut, parallel with this, our selection is not to the principle of equitable geographical distribution alone, but is an expression of the concerted action of the States of the Latin American continent, which look to Panama with affection as the harmonizing center of the efforts of this part of the world to improve the standards of living and well-being of their peoples in a spirit of integration.\n80.\tOur presence on the Security Council will coincide with two political events of extraordinary importance for the future both of my country and of Latin America. I am referring to the negotiations which have been going on for 11 years between Panama and the United States to arrive at a new treaty which will put an end in every sense to the perpetuity of the concession relating to the Inter-oceanic Canal, and to the Latin American summit meeting to be held in Panama on 22 June 1976 to commemorate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Amphictyonic Congress, which was convened by Simon Bolivar, our Liberator, to establish international mechanisms which would ensure the independence of our countries from any foreign domination.\n81.\tThe significance for our countries of these events may be measured by the statement made in the capital of the isthmus by the President of Venezuela, Mr. Carlos Andres Perez, when he signed the Joint Declaration together with the Heads of Government of Colombia, Costa Rica and Panama, on 24 March 1975. At that time the great Venezuelan statesman, in referring to the call of the Liberator, said:\n\\\"Afterward, Simon Bolivar forges ahead, seeing afar, pointing out to all our peoples the only path, that of unity. And today we agree here in Panama that next year all the nations of Latin America will celebrate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Amphictyonic Congress, but celebrate it with an act of total sovereignty.\\\"\n82.\tBesides the mental resonance of the words, we are now making preparations, at the initiative of the Heads of Government I have mentioned, to build a monument in Panama City which, because of its size and symbolism, will bring to the conscience of Latin American generations the grandeur of the thinking of our Liberator and the commitment to transform into reality his concept of unity for the genuine integration of Latin America.\n83.\tIt is with a genuine feeling of honor and pride that I must state that it is no mere chance, but the concatenation of historical events, that resulted, at the ministerial meeting held in Panama from 31 July to 2 August this year with the participation of the 26 Latin American.. States, in a consensus being reached on the establishment of a Latin American Economic System [SELA] and an agreement to convene in Panama City, starting on 15 September, a working group which has already prepared a draft statute to be submitted to the ministerial conference which will meet again in Panama City, starting on 15 October. For my country, as the geographical centre of the continent, which maintains friendly relations with all the nations of the region, it would be a great honor to be the headquarters of an essentially Latin American institution of such hierarchy and importance in the development process of our peoples.\n84.\tSELA, which is conceived of as a regional instrument for consultation, co-ordination, co-oper-ation and economic development of a permanent character with its own juridical personality, made up of sovereign Latin American States, will have as its fundamental purpose to reconcile the interests of all Latin American countries and to promote the preparation and development of joint programs and projects by setting up multinational companies and by combining the basic interests of the Latin American region with the new international economic order.\n85.\tThe interest evinced by our Government in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is understandable in view of the fact that Panama is essentially a maritime country. The merchant fleet flying the Panamanian flag is one of the largest in the world. Panama's coastline measures almost 2,000 kilometers on the coasts of the central zones of the Atlantic and the Pacific, and its territorial sea, continental shelf and national sea-bed cover a larger area than the parts of the land that have emerged from the sea.\n86.\tOur main natural resource the geographical position of the isthmus is largely a function of the oceans, considered as highways of transport and trade. But that is not all; another of our vital natural resources, the River Chagres, has been made into a canal so that it flows out into the two oceans, thus traversing the full breadth of the American continent at its narrowest part.\n87.\tAlmost 15,000 ships pass through the 80 kilometers of the Panama Canal every year, that is, a substantial proportion of all the ships which sail the seas. Although it is not a natural strait, but a river valley, we are aware of its role in peaceful exchanges and in the progress of mankind, and we intend, in a desire to allow quick and safe transit for the ships of all the world, to set up a regime of great liberality without any discrimination, while at the same time we would have a regime of permanent neutrality, guaranteed by the international community.\n88.\tBut this open and generous attitude of the Republic of Panama comes up against the anachronistic situation which not only gives the United States the use of the main instrument of exploitation of Panama's geographical position, namely, the Panama Canal, but also prevents Panama from using its principal ports on the Atlantic and on the Pacific.\n89.\tAt the sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held at Caracas, Panama denounced the continuance of this anomalous situation, which paradoxically transforms a country which its physical geography makes essentially maritime into a State which is in a geographically disadvantageous position.\n90.\tWhat is even more serious is that that situation is the result of colonialist practices carried out in the heart of our continent by the Government of the United States.\n91.\tThe colonial situation which the Canal Zone represents and the illegitimate appropriation by the United States of the ports of Boca-Balboa on the Pacific and of Cristobal on the Atlantic were vigorously denounced. This led us to sponsor the draft text on territories under foreign occupation or colonial domination, which received broad support, and which was intended to exclude from the new law of the sea we are drafting any colonial situation which infringes the rights of free peoples and sovereign States, as in the situation which persists in the isthmus of Panama.\n92.\tWe firmly believe that in this respect our attitude is one of the greatest contributions that can be made to the success of the Conference on the law of the sea. The Republic of Panama reiterates its willingness to continue to participate actively in the work of that Conference. To that end, our national Government is carefully studying the informal negotiating texts which were prepared by the chairmen of the three committees at the end of the meetings held at Geneva during the spring of 1975. The delegation of Panama will attend the meetings convened for New York in March 1976 with every readiness to participate in negotiations intended to make of the seas and the law of the sea instruments of peace at the service of all nations.\n93.\tPanama, as a State desirous of peace and inter-national co-operation, shares the concern of the majority of the peoples of the world in opposing imperialist and colonialist policies. The struggle undertaken by the non-aligned countries to defend their right to political and economic independence has aroused in the peoples of Latin America growing feelings of solidarity and support. That is so because the non-aligned movement is viewed as an international anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist movement, which is also opposed to power politics, policies of hegemony and schemes of domination based on offensive racist discrimination.\n94.\tPanama, which for seven decades has been struggling against a smoldering colonialist situation which affects its territorial integrity, views the non- aligned movement, directed to the defense of the interests of the peoples of the third world, as the natural mechanism for endorsing with dignity its independent foreign policy in international forums, since this non-aligned movement advocates the appli-cation of United Nations ideals. Therefore the State of Panama has not only adhered to the Lima program for Mutual Assistance and Solidarity,  which is already known to this Assembly, but has become a fully fledged member of the group of non-aligned countries, which also strive for the establishment of a new international economic order which will represent their total and complete emancipation through the recovery of and control oyer their wealth, their natural resources and their means for economic development.\n95.\tWe believe it timely to recall in this respect the consistent position of Panama in favor of landlocked countries or those in geographically disadvantageous situations; and in this context we have very much in mind the noble nation of Bolivia. We therefore reiterate Panama's backing for Bolivia's just aspiration to have direct access to the sea.\n96.\tFor the Republic of Panama, \\\"whose principal natural resource is its geographical position, while the inter-oceanic Canal is the means for exploiting that resource, the pronouncements of this General As-sembly are of the utmost importance in regard to the Declaration and the program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-Vlj and 3202 (S-VI)]\\ the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)]] the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]\\ and, as a corollary, resolution 3362 (S-VII) on development and international economic co-operation adopted at the seventh special session, since the basis for all these pronouncements is the exercise by States of full and permanent sovereignty over their wealth, natural resources and economic activities.\n97.\tThe Security Council, when it met in the city of Panama from 15 to 21 March 1973 to consider those problems of Latin America which might endanger peace and security in the region, considered that the question of the Panama Canal had been a constant source of conflict between my country and the United States.\n98.\tThe overwhelming international support which Panama has received since then is beyond challenge. All the Latin American countries without exception expressed their unanimous solidarity. That is no doubt why in beginning the new dialog it was decided to include on the agenda the question of the Panama Canal, since this is a matter of common interest for all Latin America.\n99.\tIt is understandable that, a few days before the Tlatelolco meeting, in Panama on 7 February 1974, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Panama, Juan Antonio Tack, and the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Henry Kissinger, signed a declaration on a series of fundamental principles which serve and must serve as guidelines for the negotiators in the efforts to arrive at a just and equitable treaty which will do away once and for all with the causes of conflict between the two countries.\n100.\tThis is a formula intended to break the deadlock in the prolonged negotiations, recognizing first the fundamental aspiration of the people of Panama to abrogate the Hay-Bunau Varilla Convention of 19032 and its amendments, thus paving the way for a new agreement which will put an end to the existing colonial situation in the heart of the territory of Panama.\n101.\tIn that declaration it was furthermore agreed, in point 2, that the elimination of the concept of per-petuity should be brought about by stipulating a fixed period of duration for the Canal concession. An end to perpetuity will, in our opinion, mean a beginning of the end of the colonial structure in the so-called Canal Zone.\n102.\tIt is worth while emphasizing that in points 3 and 4 of the Tack-Kissinger declaration it is agreed:\n(a)\tTo reaffirm that the territory in which the Canal is situated is Panamanian territory;\n(b)\tTo recognize the right of the country with territorial sovereignty to exercise full jurisdiction over this territory;\n(c)\tTo end speedily the jurisdiction of the United States over Panamanian territory;\n(d)\tTo return to Panama the Panamanian territory on which the Canal is situated;\n(e)\tTo grant to the United States of America for the duration of the new treaty the right to use the lands, waters and air space necessary for the functioning, maintenance, protection and defense of the Canal and the transit of ships.\n103.\tIn regard to jurisdiction, the Government of Panama trusts that an agreement will be reached with the United States for the abolition of the Canal Zone, so that my country, as a territorial sovereign, can assume full jurisdiction over that part of its territory. For such an agreement to be effective the so-called government of the Canal Zone must cease to function in no more than three years' time. Accordingly, the Governor and administrative machinery which now exist would disappear, as would the United States police, because the Panamanian National Guard would take over their functions. Likewise, foreign courts would be removed and United States laws would no longer be applied, since Panamanian law would prevail, and justice would be administered by Panamanian judges. Panama would also take over public services and be in charge of post offices, which have so far been in foreign hands. On the same criterion, the so-called Panama Canal Company would cease to exist. It was set up by the United States Government, and we shall set up a new organization in accordance with the stipulations of the new treaty.\n104.\tIt is the firm intention of Panama to proceed with the negotiations on the Panama Canal question, but on the understanding that these negotiations must move effectively and in the correct direction, \u25a0 which is the elimination of the anachronistic North American colonial enclave in the heart of the nation of Panama against the will of its people. Our goal is now none other than total and complete decolonization, in harmony with the spirit of our times, singularly expressed in the magna carta on decolonization [resolution 1514 (XV)] and in the Economic and Social Council resolution on the permanent sovereignty of peoples and nations over their natural wealth and resources [resolution 1956 (LIX)].\n105.\tIt is fitting to recall in this respect that in point 5 of the Tack-Kissinger declaration it is recognized that \\\"the geographical position of its territory constitutes the principal resource of the Republic of Panama\\\". Similarly, in point 6, both countries have agreed that \\\"the treaty will also stipulate that the Republic of Panama will assume total responsibility for the operation of the Canal when the treaty comes to an end\\\". In the agreement that exists between the two points I have mentioned the foundations are laid for the effective exercise by Panama of its right to economic self-determination.\n106.\tThese principles contained in the joint Tack- Kissinger declaration clearly establish the formula with which the negotiations must culminate, which is a Panamanian Canal under Panamanian control. This formula would be in accordance with the pronouncement of the Secretary-General before the Security Council on 20 March 1973, when he advocated a solution for the Panama Canal question which, in his opinion:\n\\\"... can only be based on the respect for law and the search for justice. A solution will have to take into account basic principles which are enshrined in the Charter, such as the principle of territorial integrity, sovereign equality, the obligation to settle all international disputes by peaceful means and the principle which by now has become an accepted common standard, namely, that any State is entitled to put to full use and for its own account all its natural potentialities.\\\"3\n107.\tIn order to put an end to colonialism in our territory, the Panamanian Government has proposed that the new treaty, as regards all its aspects, including defense, should not last longer than the end of the present century, This extremely reasonable position has nevertheless given rise to frequent statements in the United States press that the United States should endeavor to insert in the treaty a clause whereby that country would be responsible for the defense of the Canal for a longer period namely, 50 years and that at the end of that period it would have the right to continue to defend the Canal for an indefinite length of time.\n108.\tHistory proves dramatically that the Panamanian people has always opposed any formula which\n' might be equivalent to perpetuity and not only the Panamanian people: all the peoples of Latin America, Asia, Africa and the world repudiate this typical formula of rampant colonialism, which mankind believes it has overcome through the declarations of this General Assembly, but which some narrow- minded people without a sense of history try to project into the twenty-first century.\n109.\tPanama's position has been clearly defined by the Head of Government of Panama, General Omar Torrijos, who, in a recent interview with the Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez, stated that \\\"in the negotiations Panama seeks an orderly step-by-step process of demilitarization and neutralization of the Canal,\\\" in which the Panamanian National Guard will play a growing role while that of the United States army decreases.\n110.\tIn this respect it must not be forgotten that in the Hay-Bunau Varilla Convention Panama and the United States undertook to apply to the Panama Canal the principles of neutralization stipulated in the Constantinople Convention of 1888 Respecting the Free Navigation of the Suez Maritime Canal, of which the signatories were England, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey and Russia.\n111.\tA regime of that kind would to some extent accord with the proposal made at the Potsdam Conference in 1945 by the then President of the United States, Harry S Truman, to the effect that, in order to safeguard the future peace and security of the world, international marine waterways should be open to free and unrestricted use by all the nations of the world,\n112.\tThere can be no doubt that, in accordance with international law, the Panama Canal, like the Suez Canal and the Kiel Canal, must be governed by a general body of rules of common application to this type of international waterway but subject to the competence of territorial sovereignty. In other words, the regime applicable to the use of these waterways \nmust not, according to authoritative opinions, aim to withdraw the Canal from the control of the coastal State but rather to impose upon that State certain obligations intended to facilitate the free passage of merchant ships and warships of all flags, without discrimination, in time of war and in time of peace.\n113.\tTruman's Potsdam proposal, which was no doubt formulated in response to the Soviet position with regard to the regime of the Turkish straits, paved the way so that, through the agreement of the international community, all international waterways could be used freely for international navigation subject to the jurisdiction, competence and control of the country with the territorial sovereignty, which in the case of the Panama Canal is the State of Panama.\n114.\tI wish to end on a note of optimism. I am prompted to it by the positive results of the seventh special session, which once again displayed a spirit of concord and co-operation which basically inspires all countries at present regardless of their degree of development, their ideologies or their aspirations.\n115. We are pleased to note that we are coming closer to peace because of the initiatives taken by Egypt and Israel in the Middle East, and we express the hope that the territorial integrity of Cyprus will be safeguarded.\n116.\tWith the cessation of the war in Indo-China and the signing of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which opens new prospects for peace in other regions of the earth, it is most encouraging that the General Assembly, in its resolution on development and international economic co-operation, has now decided resolutely to eliminate the injustice and inequality which afflict vast sectors of mankind by means of practical measures to attain the general objective of a new international economic order.\n117.\tThese and other auspicious events, among which I should like to mention the progress made in the decolonization process in Africa, are of utmost relevance to the position achieved by the United Nations after 30 years. In this regard it is fitting to refer to the introduction to the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization [AllOOOllAdd.l], a valuable document in which Mr. Waldheim shows how, despite obstacles, our Organization has progressed slowly but surely, without haste but without pause, like the star of which Goethe wrote.\n118.\tAs for my country, I wish to say that Panama offers its firm though modest support for all those efforts without flagging for a second. To Panama it is vital and necessary that this climate of international dialog and concord be maintained, because our cause is intimately linked to international peace and the spirit of solidarity and equality among nations. In this respect I should like to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Panama, our gratitude for the firm support the vast majority of nations and Governments here represented have given to the legitimate aspirations of my country in the vital and decisive question of the Panama Canal. That question is one of the very problems which serve effectively to indicate whether or not it is true that the great Powers have learned the tragic lessons of our times and have in fact decided to walk hand in hand with the small nations and those less favored by history towards the heights of peace and concord which are the ultimate ideal of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of Uruguay would like at the outset to congratulate Mr. Thorn, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, on his election as President of the General Assembly. We welcome the choice of a young but at the same time mature statesman of a noble country, with great traditions from the past and a great capacity for action in our time.\n66.\tWe also pay a tribute to Mr. Abdelaziz Boute- flika, the Foreign Minister of Algeria, who presided over the work of the General Assembly during a particularly dynamic year in the life of the Organization.\n67.\tWe welcome the admission of the new Members  the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the People's Republic of Mozambique which thus carries forward our progress towards universality.\n68.\tMay I be permitted, first of all, to make a statement general in nature, one which will be especially appropriate inasmuch as this is the thirtieth anniversary of our Organization. Uruguay comes to this new session of the General Assembly animated by the same spirit by which it was inspired when we signed the Charter in San Francisco.\n69.\tToday, we share, as we did then, the objectives of the Charter, and we will work tirelessly to attain them in the context of a policy of peace and co-operation with all nations. In accordance with its tradition, Uruguay hopes that international coexistence will be consistently governed by law, and that within that context every people will be able to achieve its own destiny, free from interference by others.\n70.\tAs a symbolic manifestation of respect and fidelity to the objectives that brought our Organization into existence, and as an expression of the permanence and continuity of our foreign policy, my Government has chosen to incorporate into our delegation at this session two distinguished personalities of our country who were among the signatories to that historic document.\n71.\tI have preferred to depart from the traditional approach of analyzing one by one the principal items of the agenda, and instead will concentrate my attention on the most important concepts and facts of international politics and economics as we in Uruguay see them. I believe that the general debate will thus gain in depth and will shed greater light on the essence of each country's thinking. The Uruguayan delegation wilt set forth, in the appropriate Committees, its specific views on each item. For the moment, I shall state specifically that there is no change in the traditional political line of my country. As always, that line gives expression to a position that is independent and cannot be categorized. It does not act in accordance with the needs of any bloc, but rather from a faithful assessment of the facts in accordance with our own principles.\n72.\tFor this very reason, Uruguay will energetically oppose any attempt to use the machinery and institutions of the United Nations for promoting any propaganda objectives or encouraging any type of ideological domination. Such action is contrary to the spirit and letter of the Charter, and from the political point of view is a source of discredit to this Organization and makes ineffective the impartial performance of the lofty duties with which this Organization is entrusted.\n73.\tThe United Nations was born in order to save the world from a new war, a war like the one that was just coming to its end. That type of war, the weapons that existed at the time, the causes and motives that precipitated that conflict, the ideologies that brought the factions together, the power relations existing among the victors, and the general feelings of all the other nations all these were the realities and the known elements of that time.\n74.\tIn the time that has elapsed since there have been notable and overwhelming changes. Today, the original group of founding Members sees its number tripled. A large and varied assortment of items involving the most complex technical questions and the profoundest aspirations of men all over the world now enriches the agenda of the General Assembly.\n75.\tIdeological divisions and political and economic power have followed tortuous and often surprising paths.\n76.\tConflicts have broken out which at the time could doubtless not have been foreseen, and the course of those conflicts, in general, has been very far from feeling the beneficent effect of the governing machinery provided by the Charter. Even the kind of war which today we may fear or undergo is different.\n77.\tPerhaps this change, which has been so profound in so short a time, is what distorts our understanding }f the new facts that refuse to fit into the traditional categories.\nWorld war gave way to the cold war, and the rold war, in turn, to coexistence. Each of these periods vas a milestone in the history of this Organization.\n79.\tIn the political field today the most noteworthy fact is detente. My country, of course, fully supports the aim of reducing tensions and warding oft the danger of an atomic disaster. I believe that all nations must unreservedly and unhesitatingly give their support to that aim. We must, however, state that such a policy is limited in scope, confined as it is to relationships among the great Powers. To be sure, it reduces the risk of nuclear war, even the danger of a wide-scale conventional war. But for dozens of small and medium-sized nations that want to live in peace and build their lives for themselves, free of foreign interference, this does not represent a concrete solution.\n80.\tAs a matter of fact, detente does not do away with power politics or the ideological struggle. These today take different forms; the battlefield changes and the weapons employed change; from war declared between nations we have now passed, over and under frontiers, to war that is undeclared and within nations. No longer is it a question of mere propaganda intended for theoretical dispersion; it is a combined action utilizing all media and resources.\n81.\tTerrorism and subversion are its concrete expression. These obstruct the development process and impair political sovereignty in determining a future in keeping with the values that characterize each society. Closely tied each to the other, so that they are almost one and the same, united in an international activity that recognizes no limits and that day by day reaches into more countries, they still are able to enjoy the open and explicit support of certain countries.\n82.\tWe must bear in mind that these activities do not affect one country or one group of countries alone; they affect even the most highly developed ones, those with the highest social and economic standards. Prosperity and culture do not serve as barriers. It is one and the same destructive design which in each area assumes a different political guise, adapted to local circumstances, but always with the same urge to violence and domination as the concrete expression of power politics.\n83.\tIts very behaviour represents a return to outmoded forms of coexistence and a sure obstacle to the free development of every community, even though this inhumane and irrational tendency claims at times to have a monopoly of change towards a new society.\n84.\tWe should try to achieve, therefore, a clear awareness of the fact that, despite declarations and agreements, there is a pitiless struggle for power taking place on as many fronts as there are nations, and that the very principles and basic values of civilization are everywhere imperiled.\n85.\tWithout this awareness it will not be possible for us to understand the most frightening political phenomenon in the world today, and even less to face the challenge it represents,\n86.\tThis is not the first time that my country has spoken about such facts, We did so, quite properly, when we ourselves were subjected to a similar type of activity. Perhaps for that reason the international community did not at that time fully understand the magnitude and significance of the danger and tended \nto attribute it to local factors, as was claimed in certain distorted and false propaganda. Now that we have succeeded in pushing back the massive attack launched against us, and while we are mounting a permanent guard against any other such attempts, I wish to repeat once more our warning to all countries and to urge the community of nations to act against the unmistakable international wave of terrorists and subversives motivated by clear political aims of domination or, if that is not immediately possible, destruction.\n87.\tI wish to call attention to these facts, for my country cannot and does not rest content with an international peace that is superficial and limited to the immediate concerns of the great Powers.\n88.\tUruguay wishes to see international law respected. Let each country develop from its own strength and in accordance with its own values the response it regards as appropriate to the arduous problems of coexistence. Let no one set himself up as a censor of other people's political, economic and social systems, Let a plurality of political and ideological solutions be respected by all. Let no one infiltrate, subvert or commit aggression against others, or seek to exercise domination over others.\n89.\tAll this is more than a starting-point; it is at the same time an objective of international law. If there is no strict compliance therewith, there will be no peace in the true sense. And the small and medium- sized nations will have to continue to mount a constant guard over their freedom, menaced by a war that cannot be prevented by detente.\n90.\tWhen the Charter was signed the dominant economic concern was the devastation wrought by the war and the need to get the economy back on the traditional course. Thirty years later, aware now of the interdependence of all nations, we are trying to meet the needs of developed and developing countries and bring them together in a more balanced and just system. At the same time we are trying in the immediate future to attenuate the effects of the present crisis.\n91.\tAs soon as the first indications of the magnitude of this crisis appeared, by the end of 1973, all major international activities in the economic field assumed a dual purpose: on the one hand, the search for a global organization of the world economy and, on the other, the need to assist those affected by the emergency.\n92.\tI should like to say very firmly that my country is in strong disagreement with the orientation and results of this general process on both sides of the picture, and we say this in a very forthright and direct manner.\n93.\tFirst of all, in general an attitude of confrontation has prevailed. In practical terms, that attitude could not and did not lead to any concrete results.\n94.\tIf we are trying to lay down guidelines for restructuring the international economy, there must be a straightforward, genuine and sincere consensus among all participants, and that can be reached only on the basis of generally acceptable and negotiated formulas.\n95.\tBuilding up majority votes in international organizations in favor of specific resolutions is not enough for us, the developing countries, nor can that satisfy our legitimate and vital interests, if it does not lead straightaway to concrete and tangible action.\n96.\tIn today's interdependent world, solutions adopted in isolation or antagonistic solutions are no longer feasible. There can be no response to a given problem unless it comes as a result of co-operation on the part of all.\n97.\tSecondly, the idea of reform of the whole international economic order, unless it is practical and realistic, will not have any effect on the most urgent problems. At times it may, and indeed does, happen that the proposal that appears the most ambitious and far-reaching will delay steps that are already clearly needed and, by their very nature, indispensable for any future order.\n98.\tIt is clear that with regard to such vital and urgent questions as those of agriculture, food and population, there cannot be complete understanding on all aspects of the world economy. I believe that if we can agree on satisfactory formulations in these essential areas, it will be sure to have a multiplying effect, promoting mutual confidence among nations and opening the way for the integrated solutions we all desire.\n99.\tMy country, therefore, proposes that international efforts be concentrated on those areas, which are recognized by one and all as priority areas, in an attempt to reach solutions and adopt practical measures based on a broad political consensus.\n100.\tThirdly, I shall now speak of the inadequacy of the means of action taken in the face of the crisis. In April 1974 I explained in the General Assembly how my country had been adversely affected by increases in the prices of oil and other raw materials, I mentioned then certain encouraging figures concerning the Uruguayan economy towards the end of 1973, and spoke about the favorable outlook at the time; but I also spoke about the negative effect that importing 100 per cent of our fuel at the new prices would undoubtedly have on our economy.\n101.\tThe forecasts made at that time applied not only to my country, but to a broad range of countries that were at one and the same time developing countries and net importers of oil. Unfortunately our predictions have been borne out by the facts. In Latin America in one year the deficit in the balance of payments of oil-importing countries tripled. The deficit then amounted to the value of half of all the exports of those countries.\n102.\tAnother prediction that was proved true concerned the fact that the industrialized nations would be able more rapidly to absorb that deficit, by relying on the diversity of their economies, on their capacity to attract surplus capital, and unfortunately on restrictive measures with regard to imports from the most severely affected countries.\n103.\tClearly, this situation has resulted not entirely from any action or failure to take action, but is due to external factors over which Governments and peoples have no control whatever.\n104.\tIt was only natural, then, to assume that the international community would adopt a policy of decisive support for those who were suffering this grave affliction. I must say, however, in all frankness that the activities of the innumerable meetings which have been convened on the subject have not so far produced any effective measures. The amount of special resources devoted by the international community to this end is far from sufficient to meet the needs; the inadequacy of the resources has forced countries to resort to commercial loans, frequently on very difficult terms, in order to offset the debts incurred as a result of higher oil prices; even international loans, such as the oil facilities of the International Monetary Fund, have to be repaid over a fairly short period of time, require the payment of interest and increase the foreign debt, thus limiting the credit margin available for development. All the additional resources have to be devoted exclusively to the maintenance of a normal level of fuel supply and cannot be invested for economic and social development.\n105.\tTo this we should add a very important negative factor. In the Special Program that was adopted by the General Assembly, it was specified that the purpose of emergency assistance was to meet the needs of those countries most affected by the crisis, and a set of criteria was laid down to determine which were those countries [see resolution 3202 (S- VI), sect. A'].\n106.\tHowever, in the distribution of assistance, the per capita income alone has been taken as a criterion, and as a result a number of seriously affected countries have been excluded. It is clear that that criterion by no means indicates the degree to which each country has been affected.\n107.\tIn this regard, the Organization of American States last week unanimously recommended that international and regional financing organizations should revise that criterion. According to the present manner of applying the rules, with per capita income as the criterion, in Latin America only two countries could qualify for special assitance. In the circumstances, nations which as a result of the crisis are facing the worst of problems are not receiving the special assistance which was provided precisely to meet the needs of the crisis.\n108.\tI should therefore like to make clear my country's strong disagreement with application of the criterion. Not only does it not conform to the rules contained in the resolution of the General Assembly; unfortunately by reason of its limited and haphazard character it also has no significant impact on the situation of the poorest countries, which, in the opinion of my country, are not being helped by present resources, For them, massive amounts of resources should be accorded in grant form.\n109.\tHere I should like to say that the tendency to use emergency assistance for permanent problems conceals the fact that assistance specifically intended for the poorest countries provided by countries with the greatest resources has decreased in absolute value and in real terms. The commitment to contribute 0.7 per cent of the gross national product, in accordance with the goal of the Second United Nations Development Decade, is not being fulfilled. If that contribution were actually made, it would solve the problems not only of the poorest countries, but also of the rest of the developing countries.\n110.\tThe situation is the same, for example, with regard to the replacement of the resources of the International Development Association, which provides loans on favorable terms to countries with the lowest incomes.\n111.\tThe inadequate contributions of the industrialized countries and those countries that have profited by the new oil prices cannot be supplemented by emergency resources that are intended precisely for the countries most adversely affected by the present crisis.\n112.\tThis trend has even deeper implications and goes beyond the question of the distribution of emergency resources. Implicitly, yet with singular force and clarity, it raises the question of whether the development of the poorest countries should be achieved through a reduction of the standard of living of other countries, including not only the industrialized countries but also those developing countries with the most promising economic and social statistics.\n113.\tTo put it another way: should the vital and unchallenged needs of the most backward countries be met by reducing the moderate amount of progress achieved by the less backward? Should not the international community rather promote the progress of those countries whose economies are backward without inhibiting progress in other countries?\n114.\tNeither on the international nor on the national level does my country accept the class war in either theory or practice. Instead, we believe that it is an imaginative, constructive and concerted effort which will make it possible to maintain and increase progress in the most advanced countries and at the same time promote a more rapid advance on the part of the backward countries.\n115.\tThis opinion is not only the result of our political and ethical convictions; it is also based on our practical experience of present-day economics: in our interdependent world there can be no solutions adopted in isolation. Prosperity, if it is to be lasting, must be widespread.\n116.\tI should like to bring out another point with which we are not in agreement. The inadequacy of international financial measures is revealed at a time when restrictions are also being imposed by the developed countries, and by EEC in particular, on imports of certain primary commodities which are essential to the economies of the developing countries affected by the crisis. This is true of meat. The Organization of American States at last week's meeting took a stand on that subject, expressing deep concern over the matter and hoping that the restrictions would be lifted.\n117.\tThus the situation arises where a group of nations severely affected by the rise in oil prices are at the same time prevented from exporting to their usual customers, the developed countries, those products which are the mainstay of their economies. Furthermore, those same developed countries, by means of a policy of subsidies, are vying with one another in other markets, by reducing their prices and flooding the market.\n118.\tThis complicated set-up has a critical effect in the present circumstances. It is also a grim expression of an underlying problem. \n119.\tFirst, the international community has not found the means to ensure the stability of the basic exports of the developing countries. Without the condition of stability it is impossible to save or to accumulate capital to allow investment for the diversification of the economy. Any employment policy is also inhibited thereby.\n120.\tSecondly, the rules governing the world economy all conspire to force the infant industries of the developing countries to confine themselves exclusively to a policy of efficiency and competitiveness. But no such criteria are applied to the agricultural policies of all developed countries, and as a result there is distortion and waste.\n]2h It happens then that in developed areas of the world, industry subsidizes inefficient agricultural production, blocks the access of products produced more economically in other areas, and even competes in third-country markets with the help of subsidies.\n122.. Thus a paradox arises: economic rules, instead of being more flexible to help those countries which are most backward, are, in fact, less rigid for the most advanced countries.\n123.\tWe wish to point an accusing finger at this unjust contradiction.\n124.\tWe are all familiar with the harsh laws and practices of international economic life. But faced with such a simultaneous accumulation of negative factors, with no particular attenuating circumstances, one cannot help but wonder what outlook there is for co-operation to foster development.\n125.\tAs I have already stated, there can be no doubt that it is necessary to give top priority to the questions of agriculture, food and population. Together with their tremendous economic significance, they have \u25a0ven greater humanitarian implications.\n26. Recently we have heard many pleas for an increase in the production of food as a means of meeting vital and growing human needs.\n127.\tThat brings home one of the most startling facts, which is, without exaggeration, both an indictment of and a challenge to the present international order: namely that there are some peoples which are experiencing serious difficulties in selling the food that they produce and at the same time there are some peoples which go hungry because they cannot afford to buy that food.\n128.\tThus it is not production capacity that is lacking in these cases; there is only a lack of international financial machinery to co-ordinate supply and demand; international machinery to bring, for example, proteins produced at the lowest cost in the Southern Hemisphere to the millions of undernourished human beings everywhere,\n129.\tIt is my belief that concentrating our efforts to find a concrete answer to this question will help us to set aside our abstract speeches and our documents, replete with generalities, to get away from the \\\"ins\\\" and \\\"outs\\\" of United Nations procedures and to embark on a practical and eminently humane task.\n130.\tMany years ago, when Uruguay's commodity trade was flourishing and prosperous and when the outlook was even more promising, my Government proposed the creation of a food bank as a way of simultaneously meeting the financial needs of production and consumption of the countries with the lowest incomes. We acted out of a deeply held sense of solidarity with the poorest peoples and we felt that it was our moral duty to use our food-producing natural resources in the widest possible way and not just to benefit the richest societies.\n131.\tToday we renew that proposal, which is more urgently needed than ever. It is a material and moral imperative.\n132.\tAt the same time we must express our disappointment over the operational failure of the machinery set up by the World Food Conference which was held last year within the framework of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n133.\tOn behalf of my Government, I repeat that we firmly intend to increase our food production in so far as the terms of trade and of financing allow.\n134.\tDuring the recent seventh special session of the General Assembly a resolution on development and international economic co-operation [resolution 3362 (S-VIJ)] was adopted.\n135.\tIn spite of our general disagreement with many issues, this is promising. The substance of the discussion was more constructive. Practical ideas were presented by industrialized and developing countries in a search for joint solutions.\n136.\tWe believe that the ideas put forward by the delegation of the United States,-1 for example which met with a favorable response in other countries- represent a very profound approach to many problems which are of interest to the entire world. The document of the Group of 77 is an important statement of the views of the developing countries. A financial security network for Latin America was proposed that, in addition to being a system that would benefit the whole region, might help to raise income levels and improve employment conditions in those countries for which Latin America is an important market,\n137.\tThe final resolution reflects many of the ideas which were contained in the documents I have just mentioned and thus represents a step forward towards a definition of principles. But I very much fear that if its implementation is postponed and if too many subjects are taken up, it will be difficult to put into practice and the solution of urgent problems may be delayed. Moreover, if the present criteria continue to be used with regard to the allocation of assistance  as I mentioned earlier then the international action we are trying to initiate now will have no practical effect in many countries.\n138.\tUruguay will support the implementation of the various guidelines set forth at the seventh special session; but we shall pay special attention to case- by-case solutions that concern vital aspects of the present situation.\n139.\tI should like to refer to a few of the more outstanding issues in an effort to make a contribution to concrete solutions.\n140.\tMy Government believes that a fund to stabilize income from the export earnings of developing countries is of the greatest importance and therefore we give it our fullest support. We should adopt a very careful scientific approach with regard to the manage-ment of the fund so as to prevent the exclusion in practice of certain nations by the establishment of general rules.\n141.\tMy Government also concurs with the belief that trade is the chief means of promoting development. For this reason, we support Brazil's valuable proposal to negotiate a general agreement on trade between the developed and developing countries.\n142.\tIf expansion of trade is to take place then, first, negotiations within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] must not be confined just to subjects of major interest to the industrialized countries. They must come up with special rules to govern trade between developed and developing countries, bearing in mind the concept of non-reciprocal treatment stated in the Tokyo Declaration issued by the Ministerial Meeting of the Contracting Parties to GATT held from 12 to 14 September 1973.4\n143.\tSecondly, we believe that the agricultural policies of the industrialized countries, particularly EEC, and agreements on products which were concluded between those countries should not restrict trade in those products through protectionist policies and should not lead to sharp fluctuations in international prices to the detriment of the developing countries,\n144.\tThirdly, non-tariff barriers should be changed in keeping with the technological possibilities of developing countries; and health regulations should not be more restrictive for foreign exporters than for nationals.\n145.\tFourthly, exports of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods from the developing countries should enjoy a stable system of access to the markets of the industrialized countries.\n146.\tLastly, I would like to mention the fact that my country is ready to enter into agreements on commodities with exporting and importing countries in an attempt to better organize production and trade. These agreements should not be limited to a narrow range of products which are of interest primarily to industrialized consumers. They must cover each and every product which is of substantial interest to one or more producing country.\n147.\tMy Government believes that dialog and the joint working out of solutions are the right course to take.\n148.\tIt is precisely in that context and in that spirit that Uruguay has presented its views in various forums. We have done so firmly and dispassionately, and we have tried to show the realities, as dramatic as they are little known, in certain countries very directly affected by the crisis.\n149.\tThe President of France himself recognized this situation in a recent statement when he said:\n\\\"As regards the developing countries which produce few goods, the prices of which have not increased and in certain cases have even decreased, their situation is tragic inasmuch as they must bear\nthe burden of the increase in the prices of oil, foodstuffs and manufactured goods\\\".\n150.\tIt is obvious that some solutions which are desirable in themselves such as access to capital markets, and increased exports are not feasible in practical terms over the short term.\n151.\tIn order to arrive at appropriate solutions we must approach the present situation on the basis of concrete criteria. In this spirit, I should like to sum up the measures which my Government thinks should be adopted.\n152.\tThe trade rules and policies of the industrialized countries must be revised, including the elimination of protectionist policies, as regards the commodities and manufactured goods of the developing countries. The resources provided by industrialized and oil- producing countries must be increased in order to contribute to funds for assistance to the poorest countries, in particular the International Development Association. Countries whose balance-of- payments positions have been most adversely affected by the prices of oil and other essential imports must be helped, and the criteria used in the distribution of resources must reflect the harm which has been done. A fund must be created as soon as possible to stabilize the export earnings of developing countries, and buffer stocks must be established. Effective machinery must be established to provide incentives to agriculture in the form of a food bank which will ensure economic conditions for the production of agricultural products and access for the most needy, and there must be basic commodity agreements between producers and consumers on each and every product of substantial interest to one or more producers. There must be appropriate institutional reforms within the United Nations system to concentrate and better co-ordinate action on the part of the international community to benefit those countries most adversely affected by the emergency and those most in need of assistance.\n153.\tFinally, I should like to say, on behalf of my Government, that we wish to put forward a concrete proposal concerning financing for countries at the intermediate level, the developing countries with medium and higher levels of earnings. Many of them are Latin American countries which have been left on the periphery of the most urgent international assistance. A mechanism should be created for them similar to the \\\"third window\\\", which might be called the \\\"fourth window, and which should deal with the tremendous additional needs of those countries by means of a specific financial instrument with relatively higher interest rates.\n154.\tIf any subsidy were necessary it would be limited to reducing the tariff which the administrators of the system, whether the World Bank or regional banks, those who lend the funds on terms compatible with development financing needs, would have to pay.\n155.\tThe United Nations today is at a cross-roads: either we shall be satisfied with a rhetorical and ideological, purely superficial, approach to problems, or we shall penetrate to the substance, the essence of situations in order together to find generally acceptable solutions which reflect a genuine consensus.\n156.\tThe first approach, obviously the simpler one, could lead to ineffectiveness and discredit us in the eyes of world public opinion, which, little by little, would separate the Organization from all relevant issues.\n157.\tThe second course offers more difficulties, but is the only way for the United Nations to play a significant role in the world, enjoy the respect and confidence of all and achieve the objectives and hopes of the founders 30 years ago, of its new Members and of all the peoples of the world.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "114.\t Mr. President, it is a pleasure for the delegation of the Republic of Afghanistan to see you as the elected President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. We are certain that under your able and wise guidance the proceedings of this session will be conducted in a successful manner.\n115.\tAllow me, on behalf of the delegation of Afghanistan, to express our most sincere appreciation to our distinguished outgoing President, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, for the remarkable and successful manner in which he guided our deliberations during the twenty- ninth session and for the patience, fortitude and wisdom he displayed in conducting the proceedings of the recent seventh special session of the Assembly.\n116.\tDuring this session, we will be celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the United\nNations, On this occasion, we should not only assess and evaluate the past, but also plan with foresight for the future. It is the time to seek and dispel doubts which impede the effectiveness of the United Nations and to restore the hopes and trust of the world's people in the future of this Organization. The United Nations is indispensable in our view. Of course, it is not perfect and can be further improved and made more effective through a strict adherence to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\n117.\tThe period of time from the inception of the United Nations to the present has been characterized by an increased recognition of the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination, the need to terminate colonialism and alien domination, and the equality of States, as well as by the translation of this recognition into reality.\n118.\tThe realization of the right of peoples to self- determination has not been an easy task. The United Nations has played a major role in the historic process of decolonization. At this session, the membership of the Organization consists of 141 sovereign States as compared to the initial 51.\n119.\tThe people and Government of Afghanistan welcome and congratulate the Republic of Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, and the Republic of Cape Verde on gaining membership in the United Nations as the result of their long and arduous struggle against colonialism and the attainment of their undeniable right to self-determination. We look forward to co-operating with them in this Organization.\n120.\tThe Afghan Government regrets that the two Viet Nams were not among those listed in the roster of new Members in this world Organization. In the view of my Government, they are fully qualified for membership in this Organization and we earnestly hope that the Security Council will reconsider its previous decision and, consequently, pave the way for their membership in the world body. My delegation supports the recent decision taken by the General Assembly [resolution 3366 (XXX)] in that respect.\n121.\tAfghanistan is indeed happy to see the lawful representatives of Cambodia occupying their rightful place in this Organization.\n122.\tThe foreign policy of Afghanistan is based on the principles of non-alignment, free judgment of international issues, positive and active neutrality, and peaceful coexistence among all peace-loving nations of the world.\n123.\tAs I mentioned at the Conference of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Lima in August, Afghanistan has persistently supported the non-aligned movement. Our support of this movement is not new. Afghanistan, as stated by President Daoud during the first Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, has maintained this policy since before the First World War.\n124.\tIn our view, at the present time more than ever before it is necessary for the non-aligned countries to respect and adhere to the principles and values laid down by the founders of that movement. We should not allow the movement to lose the increasing dynamism and influence which it has had in bringing about peace, security and the evolution of the era of confrontation to one of dialog, understanding and detente in international relations. In pursuit of this policy, Afghanistan has been a faithful supporter of the United Nations and has always striven, on the basis of the lofty aims and purposes of the United Nations, to strengthen international peace and security.\n125.\tWe earnestly believe that in an atmosphere of peace, security and tranquility, nations can achieve their national aspirations and the well-being of their peoples. It should be mentioned that, after the establishment of the revolutionary regime in Afghanistan, our foreign policy has happily taken a much more active course. On the basis of such a policy and personal contacts between the leaders of Afghanistan and other friendly nations, we have been able to understand more clearly each other's positions and views on various issues of mutual interest. As a result, we are convinced that we can make a contribution and play a more positive role in international affairs.\n126.\tDespite our continuous efforts the only country with which, regrettably, we have not been able to establish friendly relations, is Pakistan. As has continually been brought to the attention of world public opinion and this Organization, the only impediment to friendly relations between our two countries is the settlement and realization of the legitimate and human rights of our Pashtun and Baluchi brothers.\n127.\tIn conformity with our firm conviction that all international political problems can be solved by peaceful means, we have always endeavored to resolve the only existing political difference I repeat, \\\"the only existing political difference'' with Pakistan, in accordance with the aspirations and wishes of our Pashtun and Baluchi brothers and their national leaders, through peaceful negotiations.\n128.\tI wish to say to our Pakistani brothers that only with courage and an open mind can the desired atmosphere and conditions be created to resolve this sole political difference between friends and brothers. The present situation should not be allowed to destroy the prevailing rapprochement which had created hope for a solution of this issue, or to disturb peace and tranquility in our region. Political courage and goodwill will further our efforts for an honorable and just solution of this important problem. I avail myself of this opportunity to repeat a paragraph from my statement delivered last year in the General Assembly with regard to this issue:\n\\\"If we really desire peace, co-operation, understanding and living together, let us leave aside resentment and pride. As responsible human beings, we should have the courage to acknowledge and assess issues and events with foresight, and bear in mind that our actions will be judged by history and by future generations. In facing and solving problems, we need foresight and courage. In our present world, where we live in a close, interrelated community, we must face the grave issues before us responsibly and realistically. Realism is essential to success in the search for the necessary solutions,\nToo We \\\"welcome the spirit of detente a recent animation of which has been the holding of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. We have been of the view that detente should not be limited to certain geographical areas, but should encompass all areas of geographical proximity, as all problems of interest to the international community, Its success can be manifested in the resolution of world-wide issues of importance to the members of the international community.\n130\tA review of recent world events reveals, inter alia positive developments in certain parts of the world However, many critical situations still remain unsolved.\n131\tIn the Middle East no significant progress toward a lasting and durable peace has been achieved despite certain efforts. Israel still continues to occupy the territories of three sovereign Arab countries and denies the national and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. This policy is undoubtedly a serious threat to international peace and security and a challenge to the cardinal principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n132.\tAfghanistan is strongly convinced that the Palestinian question forms the core of the Middle East impasse. Therefore, we are of the opinion that, until this vital question is solved on a just basis, it will be almost impossible to arrive at a solution of the Middle East problem.\n133.\tAnother major conflict in this area is the question of Cyprus, which we have followed with concern and regret. No significant progress has been achieved to date. We hope that the independence, the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of Cyprus, based on the inalienable rights of the two communities, will be preserved. We appreciate and support the efforts of the Secretary-General in this regard.\n134.\tAs a result of the policy of the Portuguese Government, the birth of sovereign States in the Portuguese colonial Territories has been facilitated. With regard to Angola, we agree that this Territory should be safeguarded against external interference and we hope that the Government of Portugal will be able to maintain the present state of rapprochement between the parties concerned for a final peaceful settlement.\n135.\tMy delegation wishes to appeal to the liberation movements in Angola to resolve their differences and to concert their efforts for their people's national cause and for the fulfillment of their inalienable right of self-determination.\n136.\tHowever, despite those encouraging achievements on the African continent, the situation in South Africa still constitutes a major threat to international peace and security. The Government of South Africa has continued its illegal occupation of the international Territory of Namibia and has shown contemptuous disregard for United Nations decisions, in particular, Security Council resolution 366 (1974). In our view, it is the responsibility of this Organization to consider all appropriate measures under its Charter, especially those provided in Chapter VII, to secure the full and speedy compliance of South Africa with these decisions.\n137\tAfghanistan condemns the continued oppression of the people of Zimbabwe by the illegal racist minority regime of Rhodesia with the assistance of South African forces. My delegation reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Zimbabwe to self- determination on the basis of majority rule.\n138\tSince the early days of the United Nations, high priority has been given to disarmament, but, unfortunately, it still remains one of the most intractable problems of multilateral diplomacy. Afghanistan has always been in favor of general and complete disarmament. It has acceded to the Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and attaches great importance to the implementation of that Treaty.\n139.\tWe have always supported the banning of nuclear tests in all environments and again hope that a treaty banning all nuclear-weapon tests will be concluded in the near future. The Government of Afghanistan, as a matter of principle, advocates the establishment of nuclear-free zones recognized internationally on the basis of the agreement of the countries directly concerned. The establishment of such zones should be an effective measure for curbing the spread of nuclear weapons. We advocate the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East to which Afghanistan belongs. To this end, the accession of all countries in the region to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is indispensable, as the full co-operation of all States, particularly the nuclear States, is decisive. An important prerequisite for the establishment of such a zone is that countries that possess nuclear weapons should refrain from introducing or using them in the region.\n140.\tWith respect to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, on behalf of the Afghan delegation, I wish to state that this proposal meets our approval.\n141.\tDespite an impasse with regard to the convening of a world disarmament conference arising from disagreements among some States, we believe that the idea seems to be gaining momentum and hope that the outstanding obstacles can eventually be overcome.\n142.\tAnother subject to which we attach great importance is the finalization of a new just and comprehensive legal order governing the sea, one which would ensure the rights and interests of all States, whether coastal, land-locked, developed or developing. In our view, extensive and constructive negotiations among \\\"interest groups\\\" at the fourth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea scheduled for next year in New York are required.\n143.\tIt is a well-known fact that the recognition of inevitable and irresistible changes in international relations has thrust into prominence the reality of the interdependence of all members of the world community, a reality which found a forceful expression at the sixth special session of the General Assembly in the spring of 1974. The seventh special session was another step forward towards achievement of that ideal based on co-operation between all members of the international community on the basis of sovereign equality and the removal of disequilibrium and imbalances, especially the unfavorable terms of trade of\nthe developing and least developed countries. The seventh special session's adoption of the resolution on development and international economic co-operation [resolution 3362 (S-VII)] translated many of these plans and programs into action. While more could have been achieved, it must be stated that what actually was achieved at this session is a reassuring and hopeful sign that, through co-operation, equal partner-, ship and constructive dialog, it will be possible for the world community to solve its differences and to achieve an equitable, harmonious and healthy balance in the world economy in the light of the new international economic order.\n144.\tIn conclusion, I wish to state that the passage of time has shown that we have gathered many times under this roof and in this Hall to work out our problems. Many years have gone by and this session marks the end of the third decade of the historic establishment of this world body at San Francisco. Although we have no doubt witnessed significant success during this rather long interval, on the other hand, it is evident that we have so far not been able to achieve all our envisaged global goals and ideals.\n145.\tOur world is a world of challenge, a challenge to achieve a better life and a brighter future for the human race. Let us face this challenge through cooperation and constructive dialog, rather than confrontation, and let us find peaceful and conciliatory ways and means of attaining our objectives.\n146.\tMy Government has always had firm belief and strong faith in the United Nations and is desirous of a more active role for this dynamic world Organization.\n147.\tI hope that the optimistic results of the seventh special session and, hopefully, the current thirtieth session of the General Assembly will herald a new and bright era for all nations of the world in the dawn of the fourth decade of this world body.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\n165. Mr. President, speaking on the first day of the general debate, my delegation is privileged to be among the very first to congratulate you warmly on your election. I pledge to you, Sir, the full co-operation of my delegation as you conduct the deliberations of this august Assembly to what we hope will be a fruitful conclusion.\n166.\tI take this opportunity to reiterate the admiration of my delegation for the manner in which your predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Foreign Minister of Algeria, served our Organization at the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session of the General Assembly.\n167.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts, together with those of his staff, in the quest for world peace.\n168.\tIt is with the greatest pleasure that I extend greetings and welcome, on behalf of my delegation, to the representatives of Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe. The independence of these countries, after a long and valiant struggle, is a landmark in the process of decolonization. Their admission to the United Nations, which demonstrates commitment to the Charter of the United Nations, should inspire us all to render greater support to those of our fellow men subjugated by racist and minority regimes.\n169.\tThis session of the General Assembly is following hard upon the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Lima in August. That Conference was devoted to a comprehensive and candid assessment of the international situation, in both its political and economic aspects. Important and specific areas of action in the search for a new world order were identified. The Lima Conference was, therefore, a further contribution by the non-aligned countries to the cause which they have always championed, that of justice, security, peace, and economic and social development for all.\n170.\tMy delegation is confident that our work at this session will be greatly facilitated by the positive and important decisions adopted by the non-aligned countries at Lima. This is indeed as it should be, not only because the non-aligned movement represents the vast majority of countries and peoples but, equally importantly, because it stands for the very principles, ideals and purposes of this Organization. The non- aligned movement is therefore the greatest defender of this vital international Organization.\n171.\tThe seventh special session, on development and international economic co-operation, was concluded only a few days ago. That session was devoted to the consideration of a crucial and urgent issue in contemporary international life. Like the sixth special session, it was convened at the initiative of the non- aligned countries, and attests to the persistent search, on the part of those countries, for imaginative ways and means of resolving international problems through co-operation and consultation.\n172.\tAt the Lima Conference, my delegation expressed its view that the seventh special session would realistically be expected to constitute an important step in a lengthy and painstaking endeavor to establish a new international economic order.\n173.\tIn this respect, the significant results of the Lima Conference represent one important facet of that common endeavor to achieve an equitable distribution of the world's resources and amenities. The Conference was marked by a serious effort to strengthen genuine solidarity and collective self- reliance among developing countries, as a pre-condition to the elimination of their individual vulnerability. The other facet of that common endeavor has rightly been the major preoccupation of recent international conferences. The intent and purpose of such conferences and special sessions is to eliminate the prevailing relationship of excessive imbalance, dependence and inequality in the international economic system, on the basis of a new and neutral set of rules to govern international conduct.\n174.\tFollowing the conclusion of the seventh special session, we have all been engaged in an effort to examine in earnest the outcome of the intensive negotiations conducted over a period of 15 days. On the basis of a preliminary assessment, it could be asserted that those negotiations were satisfactory. In particular, the spirit which permeated those negotiations, a spirit of constructive, positive and candid dialog could, if maintained and sharpened, strengthen the moral authority of the United Nations in the fulfillment of its noble tasks.\n175.\tWe are able to discern in this most recent phase of international negotiations strong signs on the part of some of our privileged partners of a long overdue perception of the world as a unit; a world in which opulence and power monopoly, on the one hand, could not securely coexist with poverty and exploitation on the other; a world the nature of whose problems demand a global and integrated response involving all States, on the basis of equality and with full respect for sovereignty.\n176.\tAny such positive indication of a change of heart is a welcome gesture of goodwill. It heralds the beginning of a new era of serious negotiations on the basis of genuine partnership. It now remains to be translated into concrete actions in all the fields concerned.\n177.\tMy delegation welcomes the emphasis being placed on special measures relating to the particular needs of the most seriously affected among developing countries as well as of those which, like my own country, Zambia, are seriously handicapped by their geographical and geo-political location. In the case of the latter, as a follow-up to the decision of this Assembly at its seventh special session, my delegation would urge that this session accord due consideration to the relevant report of the Secretary-General on the establishment of a special fund for subsidizing the additional transport costs of the land-locked developing countries.\n178.\tMy delegation is hopeful that the spirit of the seventh special session will obtain equally in the continuing and projected negotiations on other issues of global concern, in appropriate international forums. In this regard we are mindful, inter alia, of current negotiations within the framework of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. In particular, my delegation recognizes the urgent need to reconcile the diverse legitimate interests of the landlocked and the coastal States. We hold the view that the critical issue relating to access to the sea as well as the question of ensuring the equitable distribution of the benefits accruing from both the exploitation of the resources of the sea and the sea-bed, and from other uses of mankind's common heritage, should command priority attention.\n179.\tAllow me to make a brief comment on the subject of International Women's Year, to whose objectives we are fully committed. In a world in which millions live in dire poverty, suffering from the evils of underdevelopment, in which world peace is constantly threatened and millions still labour under the yoke of apartheid and foreign domination, we need to utilize all the human resources available. We cannot afford to exclude more than half of the world's population women from full and effective participation. In our efforts to create and foster a new equitable international economic order, social development and peace, we should involve equally every man and every woman. My delegation trusts that this session will map out a meaningful implementation of the World Plan of Action adopted at the Conference at Mexico City.\n180.\tThe international situation today is characterized by significantly positive and negative trends. Our Organization can feel relieved and gratified that the long and costly war in Indo-China has ended; that Portuguese colonialism in Africa is almost a thing of the past, thanks to the valiant armed struggle waged by the liberation movements; and that serious efforts are being undertaken to resolve the problems of the Middle East and Cyprus. Moreover, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has at last been held. AH these are positive developments which should contribute to the strengthening of international security. But, clearly, a lot remains to be done.\n181.\tThe international community has a duty to assist the people of Cambodia, Laos and Viet Nam in their arduous task of national reconstruction. The Korean questions must be resolved. The process of decolonization in southern Africa must be completed. Just and permanent solutions must be found to the problems of the Middle East and Cyprus The arms race must stop.\n182.\tMy delegation takes this opportunity to declare its warm admiration for the peoples of Viet Nam,\nCambodia and Laos and to congratulate them heartily upon their victories, We welcome the presence in our midst of the representatives of the lawful Government of Cambodia. In this regard, it is a matter of regret to us in Zambia that the United States saw fit to veto the applications of North Viet Nam and South Viet Nam for admission into the United Nations. This was clearly a vindictive act. It is all the more deplorable since, regardless of the immense suffering imposed on them for decades, North and South Viet Nam do not feel any bitterness towards the United States and have, in an admirable and exemplary manner, expressed themselves in favor of reconciliation- It is the sincere hope of my delegation that the United States will, during the reconsideration of the two applications by the Security Council, seize the opportunity also to demonstrate a spirit of reconciliation. As demonstrated beyond doubt last Friday, the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations is in favor of the immediate admission of North and South Viet Nam into the United Nations.\n183.\tThis brings me to the question of Korea, a divided country. The Korean people are committed to the reunification of their country. As evidenced by the North-South joint communique of 4 July 1972, they would prefer this much cherished and noble objective to be realized through peaceful means. Thousands of foreign troops are stationed in South Korea under United Nations cover. The United Nations cannot, in good conscience, stand aloof. It is. therefore, incumbent upon our Organization to facilitate the process for the peaceful reunification of Korea. This means we must act to put an end to the abuse of the United Nations flag by the foreign troops in South Korea and we must demand their immediate withdrawal. The reality of the situation is that the presence of foreign troops in South Korea is not conducive to the efforts for a peaceful reunification of Korea and is contrary to the spirit of the North- South joint communique of 4 July 1972.\n184.\tI referred earlier to the regrettable decision of the United States to veto in the Security Council the application of North and South Viet Nam for membership in the United Nations. This was done on the pretext that the Security Council had applied double standards by refusing to consider a similar application by South Korea. My delegation can only interpret any attempt to seek the admission of South Korea to the United Nations as intended to perpetuate the division of Korea. North and South Viet Nam freely agreed between themselves to apply separately for United Nations membership. Yet, in the case of Korea, it is a well-known fact that North Korea is. for well-founded reasons, opposed to the separate, albeit simultaneous, admission of the two parts of Korea to the United Nations. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which is tirelessly striving for the peaceful reunification of Korea, would rather see Korea join the United Nations as one united country.\n185.\tThe question of the Middle East has for many years been on the agenda of successive sessions of the General Assembly. It has also engaged the attention ot the Security Council perhaps more than any other issue. In an attempt to resolve the problem, both the Security Council and the General Assembly have adopted numerous resolutions. Yet, not only does the problem persist, but today it constitutes one of the greatest threats to international peace and security.\n186.\tIt is quite obvious to my delegation that the problem of the Middle East will persist for as long as the basic question of the rights of the Palestinian people is not-resolved. Moreover, Israel must withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. My delegation welcomes the recently concluded interim Sinai agreement between Egypt and Israel as a positive step to this end. In this respect, my delegation wishes to express its admiration and support for the tireless efforts made by Egypt in the search for a just solution to the problems of the Middle East.\n187.\tWe in Zambia continue to follow the developments regarding the problem of Cyprus. We have great sympathy for the people of Cyprus, who for many years have lived under a persistent threat to the independence, territorial integrity, sovereignty and non-aligned policy of their country. It is obvious that there are important issues that will have to be resolved in order that the two communities in Cyprus may live in harmony with each other and work together for their national prosperity. In this regard, I cannot over-emphasize the importance we attach to the inter-communal talks taking place under United Nations auspices between Greek and Turkish Cypriot representatives. It is such a dialog between the two communities which could settle whatever grievances one side may have against the other. My delegation, therefore, is opposed to any form of external pressure or interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus. Such interference, whether on ethnic pretexts or on so-called strategic considerations, in our view tends only to compound the problems of Cyprus and to perpetuate the misery of its people.\n188.\tIn the area of arms control and disarmament we do not have any cause for relief. On the contrary, we have every reason to feel distressed and gravely concerned, for the arms race not only persists but appears to be intensifying in both quantitative and qualitative terms. The nuclear arms race, with its inherent dreadful consequences, is particularly dis-quieting. The nuclear-weapon Powers appear decidedly to have turned a deaf ear to international public opinion, which is overwhelmingly against their trade.\n189.\tWe live in a world afflicted by hunger, ignorance and disease. The just concluded seventh special session of the General Assembly was an earnest endeavor to hasten the process of the social and economic development of the entire human race. It is now our common obligation to display political will and resolutely to commit ourselves to this end. The halting of the senseless arms race and the release of funds saved from disarmament for economic and social development, particularly that of the developing countries, would indeed be a significant contribution to this noble and worth-while cause.\n190.\tIt is equally regrettable that hardly any progress has been made towards the convening of a world disarmament conference. We in Zambia remain firmly convinced that a world disarmament conference should be convened as soon as possible. Indeed, as agreed by the Foreign Ministers of non-aligned countries at their recent conference in Lima, it will be desirable to convene a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament if a world disarmament conference cannot be convened in the foreseeable future.\n191.\tOne of the problems of great concern to the United Nations today is the continued great-Power rivalry in the Indian Ocean. Despite the constant demands by this body for the full and immediate implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, the great Powers have continued to refuse with impunity to co-operate in this regard, particularly with the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean.\n192.\tThe rivalry has increased further, culminating in an even greater threat to international peace and security. We would urge the great Powers concerned to respect the wishes and aspirations of the littoral and hinterland States and in this regard to comply with relevant United Nations resolutions.\n193.\tWe in Zambia feel that an early convening of a conference of littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean, at the highest level possible, would contribute significantly towards the realization of our demand for the Indian Ocean to be transformed into a zone of peace.\n194.\tThe need to appraise critically both the functions and the structure of the United Nations has become more urgent. This should not be interpreted as detracting from the viability of our Organization, which has, over the years, proved itself quite capable of adapting itself to new situations and requirements. It is evident, however, that the present political, economic and social context in which our Organization operates has not only changed over the 30 years of its existence but has in fact changed radically.\n195.\tIt is therefore gratifying that Member States have recognized the urgent need for corresponding radical changes within our only universal instrument of peace, security and development. Accordingly, Zambia welcomed the recent convening of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. In the same spirit we welcomed the recent establishment by the General Assembly at its seventh special session of an Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System.\n196.\tThe United Nations continues to serve as an indispensable forum for harmonizing diverse points of view, for conducting negotiations and for undertaking commitments. The number and variety of international discussions in recent and planned major conferences reflect the hopes and confidence which the world community continues to place in the United.Nations. Such hopes and confidence in the Organization are also manifested in the desire of the newly independent States to accede to its membership.\n197.\tThe prerequisite for a revitalized United Nations lies in the overhaul of its power structure so as to make it conducive to the fulfillment of the purposes and objectives of our Organization. The force of the developing countries is now an indisputable reality, and is increasing rapidly. The contribution of those countries to the success of the Organization continues to be invaluable. Their hopes in the Organization are paramount. And yet their interests and preoccupations are denied complete fulfillment by an undemocratic and anachronistic structure.\n198.\tThe necessary structural changes within the United Nations are, of course, possible. However, the ultimate achievement of such changes will depend on the political commitment of Member States, for an organization is what its members wish it to be. For its part, Zambia would like to reiterate its continued commitment to the lofty ideals of the United Nations and to pledge its usual support in the implementation of our common decisions for the good of mankind.\n199.\tI referred earlier to the admission of Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe to this Organization. I expressed the great pleasure of my delegation that they have now joined this family of nations as a result of the successful struggle they waged to liberate themselves from foreign domination. Our Organization is closer today to realizing the proclaimed principle of universality. But the principle of universality of membership of our Organization will not be fully implemented until all the people living in countries still under foreign domination and oppression achieve their legitimate right to self-determination and complete independence. It is in this spirit that I should like to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the situation in southern Africa. The status quo of racist and minority exploitation and oppression of the majority in this area, which in itself constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security, is not from any aspect in the interests of this Organization.\n200.\tAs Members of this Organization, we therefore have a joint and solemn responsibility to support the struggle in southern Africa for majority rule and independence. Numerous resolutions on the question of decolonization and independence under majority rule in southern Africa have been adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council. They have gone unheeded not only by the racist minority regimes of southern Africa but also by a number of Members of our Organization. In particular, certain Western Powers are known to be persistently indulging in economic and military activities which have the effect of sustaining the racist minority regimes in our part of the world. Their economic and military collaboration with the racist minority regimes contradicts their publicly professed desire to see change in southern Africa in favor of the majority population.\n201.\tZambia is committed to the total liberation of Africa. In the context of southern Africa this means an end to the white minority and racist domination and the realization of majority rule. The means to this inevitable end will either be peaceful or through an armed struggle by the liberation movements. Both options are open and it is up to the racist minority regimes to choose either. Our position in this regard is clearly reaffirmed in the Dar es Salaam Declaration on Southern Africa.1\n202.\tThe independence of Mozambique last June and that of Angola scheduled for this November have dramatically altered the situation in southern Africa. No sane person can any longer be in doubt as to the outcome of the armed struggle for the liberation of the rest of southern Africa. The racist minority regimes cannot now survive an onslaught by the liberation movements. But being the die-hards that they are, they will stop at nothing in their desperate and futile attempt to resist majority rule. We are therefore, at a cross-roads in the situation in southern Africa; the inevitable change comes either by peaceful means or through a heavy toll on human and material resources that an armed struggle entails.\n203.\tIn recent months, independent Africa in cooperation with the African National Council of Zimbabwe, has made serious efforts to bring about majority rule in Zimbabwe by peaceful means. These efforts are, in both letter and spirit, in accordance with the Dar es Salaam Declaration of the Organization of African Unity. We are seeking black majority rule, whose time is long overdue. It cannot be post-poned indefinitely. We shall, therefore, not permit the Smith regime to buy time in these efforts and thereby abuse the patience and goodwill of the nationalists of Zimbabwe to negotiate a peaceful transfer of power. The racist minority regime has frustrated the efforts for peaceful change. It must therefore bear the consequences.\n204.\tI wish to make it perfectly clear that, should armed struggle become inevitable in Zimbabwe as a result of the intransigence of the racist minority regime, my country, Zambia, as in the past, will nol be found wanting. We shall continue to render our full support to the liberation movement in its just struggle for independence. We have demonstrated this in the past and we shall not hesitate to do so again. Our commitment to the fundamental principles of liberty and justice, as enshrined in the Charter of our Organization, makes this imperative.\n205.\tIn this regard, I wish to express the hope of my delegation that the African leaders of Zimbabwe will resolve their differences in the interest of unity. To allow division in the ranks of the nationalist movemenl is to play into the hands of the enemy. Nothing could please the Smith regime better. Unity is imperative, whether it is for the purpose of conducting peaceful negotiations or for waging an armed struggle.\n206.\tSouthern Rhodesia will now be a test case as to whether majority rule in the rest of the countries of southern Africa which are not yet independent will be realized through peaceful means or on the battlefield. Time and again one hears of the Western countries' abhorrence of violence as a means for effecting change. Yet the reality of the situation in southern Africa is that the racist minority regimes persist because of the support, overt and covert, they enjoy from a number of powerful Western countries. If these Western countries genuinely believe in the right of the subjugated people of southern Africa to self-determination and independence, they must desist forthwith from all forms of collaboration with the racist minority regimes. It is totally unrealistic and untenable for them to abhor violent change and yet do nothing practical to foster peaceful change. Such a policy, based on economic greed, so-called strategic military considerations and \\\"kith and kin\\\" attitudes, in fact preserves the status quo.\n207.\tThe problem of Namibia cannot but be of particular interest to the United Nations. In persisting in its illegal occupation of Namibia, South Africa poses a direct challenge to the authority of our Organization. The apparent inability of the United Nations to compel South Africa to withdraw from Namibia, an international Territory, has done a lot to erode the prestige of the United Nations. Yet it could not be said that the United Nations lacks power to do so. For it is a fact that the stringent powers vested in the Security Council which could be utilized have not yet been put to a test in this case. Efforts to get the Security Council to take meaningful punitive measures against South Africa have been frustrated by the United States, the United Kingdom and France, the three Western permanent members of that organ which have twice deemed it necessary to exercise jointly their right of veto for the purpose of protecting South Africa. My delegation condemns unreservedly such irresponsible behavior on the part of those Powers which, while exposing their connivance with the South Africa racist regime in its oppression of the people of Namibia, also does tremendous harm to the cause of justice and peace.\n208.\tOur Organization must redouble its efforts to force South Africa out of Namibia. South Africa's terrorist and racist activities in Namibia are on the increase. Moreover, it is shamelessly making strides in the much detested policy of bantustanization of Namibia, a policy of \\\"divide and rule\\\". In short, all the evils of apartheid are today rampant inNamibia.\n209.\tIn an effort to hoodwink and confuse the inter-national community, South Africa recently sponsored what it called constitutional talks in Namibia. Those so-called constitutional talks, which excluded the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], the authentic voice of the people of Namibia, were clearly intended to divide and create antagonism among the people of Namibia and thus to promote strife.\n210.\tIt is futile for South Africa to disregard SWAPO and to refuse to recognize the authority of the United Nations over Namibia. South Africa must agree to deal with SWAPO and the United Nations Council for Namibia. It must show seriousness by agreeing to free elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations for the purpose of electing a constituent assembly for the whole territory of Namibia as one political entity. It is only such a constituent assembly, elected by the people of Namibia in proper elections under United Nations supervision and control, that will have any authority to prepare a constitution for the sovereign and independent state of Namibia. The sooner South Africa is prepared to accept the United Nations decisions on the question of Namibia, the sooner it will be possible to organize the peaceful and orderly transfer of power from South Africa to the people of Namibia.\n211.\tThe Decree on the Natural Resources of Namibia, adopted by the United Nations Council for Namibia, represents an important measure in the interests of the people of that Territory. Its acceptance and the co-operation of all States Members of the United Nations in its enforcement would be a practical demonstration of the seriousness with which we ought to take the United Nations responsibility for Namibia.\n212.\tThe situation in South Africa itself cannot escape mention. The South African regime must know that it will never command respect and win acceptance internationally as long as it remains committed to the abhorrent policy of apartheid. It must abandon this evil policy and desist from fostering so-called homelands the sole purpose of which is to perpetuate the exploitation, oppression and repression of the black majority. Moreover, the South African Government must immediately and unconditionally release the leaders of South African nationalist movements currently in detention or under restriction. It must permit free political activity in South Africa and agree to deal with the nationalist movements as the authentic representatives of the black majority and not the leaders of the so-called homelands.\n213.\tI cannot conclude my remarks on southern Africa without referring to the question of Angola. My delegation urges all the leaders of Angola to sink their differences and together work for the welfare of their people in a united Angola. No country or group of countries should take advantage of the present situation in that country, There must be absolutely no interference in the internal affairs of Angola, and its territorial integrity must be preserved. We in Zambia look forward to the independence of Angola, as scheduled, on 11 November this year. We are confident that the Portuguese Government will, as it must, honor the agreement in this regard.\n214.\tIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm Zambia's determination to continue to support and implement the United Nations economic sanctions against the rebel colony of Southern Rhodesia. The enormous economic burden which Zambia is squarely shouldering is a result of this policy. In this connexion, my delegation wishes to reiterate the expression of its gratitude to all those countries which have offered us assistance to alleviate our economic difficulties. It is the hope of my delegation that the international community will be more forthcoming in supporting us materially to enable us to meet this challenge more effectively.\n"

        "file_text": "\n183.In connexion with the well-deserved election of Mr. Thorn to the Presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly, I should like to extend to him the sincere congratulations of the President and founder of the Popular Revolutionary Movement, the President of the Republic of Zaire, Citizen Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga, and also of the entire Zairian people comprising the Popular Revolutionary Movement. As an experienced political leader of his country and an ardent advocate of peaceful coexistence among different States, he has always rendered signal services to the international community. Today, the latter in its turn pays him a heartfelt tribute by calling upon him to preside over the work of this session, which is being held immediately after the important and historic seventh special session devoted to development and international co-operation. The intellectual and human qualities which have made him a universally recognized statesman, will, I am sure, enable him to help our Assembly always seek an appropriate general consensus on the numerous and difficult problems which appear on our very heavy agenda.\n184.\tI should like to take this opportunity to associate myself with previous speakers and to extend my congratulations to his predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria, who brilliantly directed the work of the twenty-ninth session as well as the seventh special session.\n185.\tI would be remiss were I not to pay a well- deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the ceaseless efforts which he has made to defend the great humanitarian principles which we all endorse and which, reproduced in the Charter of the United Nations, form a platform for international co-operation and for human justice on a planet-wide and world-wide basis.\n186.\tMay I recall before this Assembly and with a certain degree of emotion, that on 4 October 1973, from this self-same rostrum, the President and founder of the Popular Revolutionary Movement, the President of the Republic of Zaire, Citizen Mobutu Sese Seko, denounced the injustices committed by rich countries against the poor countries because the former have everything, and the latter have nothing, to say. After this courageous denunciation, he concluded his brilliant statement, which was a charter for international peace and co-operation, by expressing the hope that \\\"thanks to it and through it [United Nations], we shall be able to do more to promote co-operation among the inhabitants of our planet in the economic, cultural, scientific and technical fields, for the building of a better, fairer and more just world, in absolute respect for the authenticity of everyone.\\\"6\n187.\tToday, the delegation of Zaire is gratified to see, after the sixth special session and particularly after the seventh special session, which has just concluded its work, that our Organization has unequivocally expressed its resolve \\\". . . to eliminate humanity and to accelerate the development of developing countries, . . .\\\"7\n188.\tAfter debates which have often been difficult but which have always been imbued with a spirit of mutual understanding, all States Members of our Organization have finally endorsed the principle of creating a new international economic order whose foundations have been defined in the Declaration and the program of Action as well as in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.\n189.\tThe work of the seventh special session witnessed the group of industrialized countries and the developing countries resorting to concerted action as a way to work together in order to put an end to the imbalance at present existing between these two groups. Thus, international solidarity henceforth will be embodied in more realistic forms than those of the past.\n190.\tApart from this wish for a better future for all inhabitants of our planet a hope which has been kindled by the seventh special session it has also been clearly confirmed that a new reality in the world has been brought about by it. The world is at present divided into two groups: first, the \\\"haves\\\" or the industrialized countries and, on the other hand, the \\\"have-nots\\\" or the developing countries. Some even prefer to call them rich and poor countries.\n191.\tWe shall not dwell on purely semantic problems, but, rather, deal with this brutal reality which, as has been stressed by the President and Founder of the Popular Revolutionary Movement, Citizen Mobutu Sese Seko, in his statement of 4 October 1973 in the United Nations, has meant that our world \\\". . . is no longer divided by ideology, nor even all that much by race or by political geography, but by economics . . .\\\"8\n192.\tDuring the work of the seventh special session, we have seen this division strikingly illustrated in the discussions which took place between two quite distinct major groups: the Group of 77, or the developing countries, and the industrialized countries divided into two subgroups, the Western countries and the socialist countries.\n193.\tThe new reality of the present world obviously will require a revision of the old cliches which were characteristic of the geopolitical definitions which the industrialized world, whether it belonged to the right or to the left, always sought to impose upon us.\n194.\tThis revision is particularly essential for the developing countries, which must realize that their state of under-development and the poverty which is a characteristic of all of them, must also encourage them to co-operate first among themselves and to harmonize their relations with the industrialized countries.\n195.\tThis revision is equally indispensable for the industrialized countries, which must henceforth understand that for us the developing countries both their level of development and their close co-operation, which is channeled through the various arrangements which are always arrived at by the two major blocs, make both blocs alike appear to us wealthy. Let us, above all, not forget that poverty can only be defined with reference to wealth and this is found among the industrialized countries.\n1%. It is this fresh reality which has made the developing countries aware of their condition and it is in this light that efforts to diminish the gap between the rich and the poor have been carried out vis-a-vis not merely one section of the industrialized countries but all industrialized countries without exception.\n197.\tBy enshrining the idea of concerted action between the rich and poor alike, the seventh special session has confirmed the correctness of the policy of positive neutralism, of belonging neither to the right nor to the left nor even to the centre, advocated by Zaire, which wishes to remain authentically itself in its relations with all countries. In fact, by entering into direct dealings with all the industrialized countries without distinction, and dealing with the problem of under-development, the poor have admitted that now they must have contacts with all rich countries without taking account of ideological differences. And the rich countries, by agreeing to negotiate with the poor countries as members of a single group, have also admitted thereby that the solution to the problem of under-development is part and parcel of international solidarity and not something which pertains to ideological confrontation.\n198.\tThe spirit which marked the seventh special session is a major step forward for the cause of international co-operation and world peace. In all events, one thing is quite certain if the spirit of the seventh special session continues to animate all States Members of our Organization in their relations, one can say without fear of contradiction that the cold war has been outlawed once and for all, not only among the great Powers but also throughout the entire world. For the great Powers will no longer have to look for client-States; on the contrary, they will have to work together in order to assist the countries lacking in capital equipment in accordance with the proposals formulated by the rich and the poor together during the seventh special session.\n199.\tInternational solidarity having now been defined, it is now for the poor countries themselves to make serious efforts to resolve their development problems. In order to do this, they must remain authentically themselves in order to be able to produce the necessary political will to bring about national, continental and intercontinental development which would take into account above all the interests of their populations. The authenticity which is permanently reshaping our political plans will now make it possible for us really to control our natural resources. It will make it possible for us to foster solidarity among the developing countries and will strengthen our relationships with the industrialized countries, whether they belong to the left or to the right.\n200.\tThe serious consequences of the world crisis, which are felt with unprecedented acuteness by under- equipped countries must serve as experience and as a stimulus to bring about more active solidarity among the countries termed the third-world countries. Zaire, for its part, believes firmly in this solidarity, which it ardently hopes will be established immediately at the continental level and then at the intercontinental level.\n201.\tSo that this solidarity may be a reality in the\nAfrican continent, Zaire has decided, in the field of\ntrade with other African countries, to accept payment  \nin the local currencies of those countries. That step will undoubtedly give our people and the other peoples of Africa confidence in our national currencies. Thus we shall cease to think in terms of dollars, French francs, pounds sterling, deutschmarks, and so on. The development of inter-African trade, as well as the resulting development of African economies, will undoubtedly lead to the convertibility of African currencies.\n202.\tSolidarity among the developing countries must affect all areas of endeavor. This solidarity must obviously be the fruit of development efforts to be undertaken by each of our countries both nationally and regionally. To achieve this we must above all rely on our own strength to resolve the development problems which confront us. The hunger which is rife in many of our countries will finally disappear only when our populations are able to produce their own foodstuffs. We certainly cannot deny the benefits of external aid, but Zaire believes firmly in the efforts which a country must itself make in order to resolve its own problems. This is the policy of salongo which in Zaire takes the form of mobilizing the population in order to improve both agricultural and industrial production. Through the policy of salongo, agriculture, which is the main priority in Zaire, will develop to such an extent between now and 1980 that by then our country will become self-sufficient in food.\n203.\tIt is obvious that an independent development policy necessarily implies for our countries sovereignty over their natural resources. Furthermore, this is perfectly in keeping with the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.\n204.\tExperience in Zaire in this field has clearly demonstrated that sovereignty over natural resources creates the best conditions for co-operation between foreign investors and ourselves. In effect, since Zairianization, it has been possible for the State of Zaire not only to offer advantageous conditions for foreign investors from the West or the East, but also to provide them with reasonable guarantees. And something of paramount importance since Zairianization, any foreigner who invests in Zaire under our investment code receives free the land on which he can set up his enterprise. In Zaire, where land belongs to the State, anybody who is capable of working it will receive free the necessary land for his commercial or industrial enterprise. That was not the case before Zairianization took place.\n205.\tNow that all the States Members of our Organization have made the United Nations the focal-point of genuine international solidarity, Zaire welcomes the determination which has been evinced by both rich and poor to reduce the major gap existing between them. The Paris Conference of producers and consumers of commodities which has just been convened by the French Government to take place on 15 October will undoubtedly constitute a concrete expression of the international solidarity which the seventh special session has just endorsed.\n206.\tZaire wishes to make it quite clear that it is in favor of co-operation between industrialized and developing countries; it is therefore opposed to confrontation.\n207.\tOn 4 October 1973, speaking at this rostrum, the President and Founder of the People's Revolutionary Movement, the President of the Republic of Zaire, Citizen Mobutu Sese Seko, in connexion with the colonized countries of Africa, said:\n\\\"Now that we have achieved political, economic and social stability, we cannot be happy while our brothers of Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia are still languishing under the yoke of the Portuguese colonialists, the British settlers of Rhodesia and the racists of South Africa.\n\\\"... It is therefore an imperative political duty for Zaire to make its material and military contribution to all its neighbors that are still subjected to colonialism of any sort.\\\"9\n208.\tToday the fact that several of those countries have become independent and are now Members of the Organization is something which Zaire sincerely welcomes. We extend to our brothers and sisters, the representatives of Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe, our sincere congratulations on the victory of their respective peoples over colonialism and racism, I associate myself with previous speakers in welcoming them to our midst.\n209.\tWe also welcome the legitimate return to our ranks of the representatives of the Royal Government of Cambodia, whose valiant people has justly regained its national independence.\n210.\tOur Organization, which has already been in existence for 30 years, is now passing through a new historical phase which obviously makes necessary a revision of its structure. It would be difficult for changes not to take place within the United Nations when, during the seventh special session, this very Organization has already endorsed the need for a new international economic order as the only way to adapt our world to the requirements of our times.\n211.\tThe majority of the Members of the United Nations recognize that the world situation is different from that which obtained when the United Nations was founded at San Francisco. Furthermore, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in one of his reports very clearly expressed this general view. He said:\n\\\"The evolution of the post-war world including the introduction of nuclear weapons, the establishment of regional military pacts, the accelerated pace of decolonization, the extraordinary advances of applied science and technology, dramatic increases in population and the emergence of a large group of independent developing nations has created a new geopolitical structure in the past 30 years. Thus the basis of power, both political and economic, in the world as a whole has changed radically in a way which could not be foreseen at San Francisco.\\\" [Al100011Add.I, sect. /.]\n212.\tWe scarcely need to recall or to dwell on the fact that in 1945 there were only some 50 founder Members of the United Nations. Traumatized by the world cataclysm which they had just stayed by the defeat of Nazism, they virtually turned our Organization into the sort of holy alliance that had appeared in Europe at another time after a cataclysm very similar to the one we all deplore. Now that the United Nations has a  it not quite obvious and proper that we should turn our Organization into a genuine framework for international solidarity where there are neither large or small States but simply States.\n213.\tWe recognize the merits of our Organization as far as the cause of peace is concerned. Zaire is well qualified to say this. My country will never forget the efforts made by the United Nations to restore peace to Zaire, at that time the Congo, which was then in the grip of serious internal problems. We are still grateful to the United Nations for this.\n214.\tHowever we believe that new historical conditions require that our Organization be adapted to this evolution. Hence in this connexion we would reiterate the position which our President expressed in this self-same Hall. Zaire therefore proposes\n\\\". . .a revision of the Charter of the United Nations to adapt it to the present situation in the world, taking into account particularly the representation of the African continent and also the fact that those that were defeated yesterday have, in their turn, become today great Powers, and the decisions of our Organization should be applied by all its Members without differentiation and should not remain a dead letter in this forum\\\".10\n215.\tWe are particularly insistent on adapting our Organization to the present conditions in the world because the confidence which we continue to place in it encourages us to attempt to make it operational and effective in the task of preserving world peace and bringing about international solidarity as defined at the sixth special session and particularly at the seventh special session.\n216.\tEvents in Viet Nam and Cambodia as well as those in the Middle East are ample proof of the inability of the United Nations to play a positive and effective role in restoring peace to those areas.\n217.\tIn Viet Nam as in Cambodia the determination of the people was necessary, as well as the indefatigable support of all peace-loving peoples, for those countries to be able to recover their national independence.\n218.\tZaire would like to take this opportunity to hail the victory of the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples over imperialism. For the people of Zaire this is also a victory of genuine individuality. The Vietnamese and the Cambodians wished to be themselves, and have proved that every people can live, can govern itself, can develop and flourish ^according to its own habits and customs, that is in accordance with its own authentic personality.\n219.\tAlthough national independence and peace have returned to Viet Nam and Cambodia the same is not true of Palestine, Zimbabwe, South Africa or Namibia. In those countries the racists and the Zionists refuse to grant their respective populations their right to self-determination and to a homeland.\n220.\tZaire, therefore, unreservedly condemns the policy which is being pursued by Israel against the people of Palestine. The Palestinian people represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization, with which Zaire has excellent relationships, can always count on our support.\n221.\tThe racist policies of the white settlers of Zimbabwe, as well as the apartheid practices by the white minority in South Africa and Namibia, are unreservedly opposed by Zaire, which gives its total support to the fraternal peoples in those countries who are struggling for their national independence.\n222.\tIt is essential that our Organization continue to exert pressure on the minority regime of Pretoria to force it to recognize that the people of Namibia should enjoy their right to national independence and to the territorial integrity of their country.\n223.\tZaire would like to take this opportunity to thank France, whose President, Mr. Valery Giscard d'Estaing, during his recent official visit to Zaire, announced the decision of his Government to decree an embargo on the sale of arms to South Africa. We would venture to hope that the example of France, which condemns the policy of apartheid, will be followed by other major Powers; thus the minority regime of Pretoria will be forced to respect the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\n224.\tOur unreserved condemnation of the racist policy of Ian Smith in Zimbabwe and the policy of apartheid in South Africa and Namibia should by no means be construed to mean that Zaire is in favor of driving the white minority into the sea. All that Zaire demands from the white racists in Zimbabwe and South Africa is that they respect the principle of majority rule, that will take account of the interests of all the people, whether black or white, in the area.\n225.\tRegarding the situation in the Middle East, Zaire's position, which was clearly spelt out from this rostrum on 4 October 1973 by the President and Founder of the Popular Revolutionary Movement, President of the Republic, Citizen Mobutu Sese Seko, remains unchanged. May I remind you of what my President stated at that time which was as follows:\n\\\"Zaire, which has now reached the moment when it must choose, must dispel all misunderstanding and remove a certain ambiguity resulting from its African vocation. Zaire has therefore to choose between a friendly country, Israel, and a brother nation, Egypt. But between a friend and a brother the choice is clear and our decisions are made in full independence and freedom from all pressures.\n\\\"Therefore, by virtue of the prerogatives conferred upon me by article 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of Zaire, I announce to all the world the breaking-off of diplomatic relations with Israel, such severing of relations to continue until Egypt and the other Arab countries involved shall have recovered their territories at present under occupation.\\\"\\\"\n226.\tSince certain parts of the territories of Egypt and other Arab countries are still occupied by Israel, the position of Zaire concerning the breaking off of diplomatic relations with Israel therefore remains unchanged.\n227.\tThe situation which at present prevails in Angola is undoubtedly disturbing for Africa and particularly for Zaire, which shares more than 2,600 kilometers of frontier with that country. Zaire, which has supported and is still supporting the people of Angola in their struggle for national independence, will continue to observe strict neutrality respecting the three liberation movements, as it has done since the Kinshasa\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjold Library\nAgreement of 1 June 1975 signed with the Portuguese Government.\n228.\tWe are convinced that the stability of the political situation in Portugal which, until 11 November 1975, will remain responsible for the administration and security of Angola, will make it possible for that country to take the necessary steps to restore peace to its colony. Thus the three liberation movements will be able to agree together on the political platform which will make it possible for them to accede to national independence under peaceful conditions.\n229.\tZaire has great respect for the principles of international law and justice, principles which we have all accepted and which are the very aim and object of the Charter of the United Nations. Thus the right to self-determination of peoples, which all Member States have endorsed and defended, should not be applied in a discriminatory fashion according to the avowed or avowed interests of certain international circles even if these are disguised as progresist.\n230.\tThus in the case of Cabinda, which is a Territory under Portuguese administration and which is separated from Angola by Zaire, my country would make an appeal to the Portuguese Government requesting it to grant the people of Cabinda the right to self- determination. A positive attitude on the part of Portugal in this connexion will make an important contribution to safeguarding peace in an area which has already been shaken by conflicts whose outcome cannot be foreseen.\n231.\tZaire would therefore reaffirm its position that Portugal should grant the people of Cabinda their right to self-determination. In this connexion, in order to make it possible for the people of Cabinda freely to decide their own future, Zaire is in favor of a referendum being organized in Cabinda under the aegis either of the United Nations or of the Organization of African Unity.\n232.\tIn its relations with other countries, Zaire maintains diplomatic relations with all those countries which respect not only its authenticity but also the principles embodied in the Charter.\n233.\tDuring the Vietnamese war, Zaire maintained diplomatic relations with the four signatories to the Paris Agreement, namely, the United States, North Viet Nam, South Viet Nam and the Government of the National Liberation Front of South Viet Nam. Now that the war is terminated in Indo-China, we will continue to maintain good diplomatic relations with the United States, North Viet Nam and South Viet Nam. According to the internal logic of our authenticity, Zaire supports the admission to the United Nations of North Viet Nam and South Viet Nam.\n234.\tTurning to the Korean problem, Zaire, which has observed strict neutrality as regards the two entities, that is, the North and the South, considers that our Organization should take steps which will help to bring the views of the two parties closer together. Zaire, which maintains excellent diplomatic relations with both the North and the South, hopes that the two parties will work peacefully towards unity if this is the will of their populations. However, if the latter should decide otherwise, our Organization will have to admit to membership both Korean entities, as has been the case for both Germanys and as undoubtedly will shortly be so for the two Viet Nams.\n235.\tRegarding the situation on the island of Cyprus, where our Organization is involved in the difficult undertaking of maintaining peace, Zaire is in favor of national reconciliation. We appeal to the two Cypriot communities to seek through negotiation peaceful arrangements which will satisfy their respective interests.\n236.\tSince concerted action among States has become a principle accepted by all in seeking solution or settlement of the disputes which may arise among them, Zaire considers and ardently hopes that this principle will continue to prevail in the negotiations at present under way on the law of the sea.\n237.\tAfter the seventh special session it is only natural that our Organization should promote the re-adaptation of the law of the sea within the framework of solutions which will contribute to restoring the balance between the industrialized and the developing countries.\n238.\tWe hope that the great Powers will not take advantage of their technical superiority and their almost exclusive possession of great financial power arbitrarily to exploit the minerals which exist in the sea-bed. We appeal to them to continue to respect the spirit of the seventh special session and to display, in the forthcoming negotiations on the law of the sea, the same liberal spirit of understanding which they showed throughout the work of that session.\n239.\tWhen we consider our poverty we note with some bitterness that over and above the economic exploitation we have been subject to there has also been the savage and systematic plundering of all our works of art by the colonialist Powers. Our invaluable artistic works have been purely and simply plundered. They are to be found in all the main cities of the industrialized countries. There is not a single museum enjoying a world reputation in industrialized countries of the East or the West in which African works of art are not to be found.\n240.\tMay I draw the attention of our Assembly to the fact that these African works of art which are the pride of the ethnographical and archaeological museums and institutions of the industrialized countries of the East and the West were acquired practically free of charge. In other words, as citizen President Mobutu Sese Seko said on 4 October 1973 in the United Nations \\\"Those works, which were acquired for nothing, have increased in value so much that none of our countries has the material means to recover them.\\\"12\n241.\tTherefore the delegation of Zaire reiterates its appeal to all the industrialized countries, whether of the West or of the East, to understand the need to restore to the developing countries all the works of art they are holding. If those same industrialized countries thought it\\\" was quite normal that they were entitled to recover immediately after the Second World War their works of art which had been stolen by the Nazi regime, commonsense, justice and equity recommend that they restore to the developing countries their works of art. Thus the industrialized countries would be making an effective contribution to strengthening the cultural riches of the countries lacking in\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjold Library\n242.\tZaire would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium, which has accepted the principle of restoring our works of art which are to be found in a number of Belgian museums. The encouraging negotiations at present under way between the Kingdom of Belgium and our country for the return of our works of art to Zaire will undoubtedly lead to a positive outcome. It is our sincere hope that this example set by Belgium will be followed by other industrialized countries and that in the course of this thirtieth session our Organization will be able to draft a resolution which will lead to the establishment of clear procedures for restoring to the developing countries the works of art which are held by a number of industrialized countries of the West and the East.\n243.\tThanks to the dynamic activities of General Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire has recovered its territorial integrity and its stability. Its peoples are reunited in the People's Revolutionary Movement and have become responsible for their own future.\n244.\tPhilosophically speaking, the Republic of Zaire is governed by what we call the concept of authenticity. This has been defined by citizen President Mobutu Sese Seko as:\n\\\"... being an awareness on behalf of the Zaire people of the fact that they should go back to their own sources, seek the values of their ancestors in order to judge which of them will contribute to their harmonious and natural development.\n\\\"It is the refusal of the Zaire people blindly to espouse imported ideologies. It is the affirmation of Zairian man or of man in general, wherever he may be, whatever he may be, with his own intellectual and social structures.\\\"\n245.\tThe Zairian people, which considers authenticity, of which Mobutuism is the Zairian expression, as the only absolute weapon against imperialism and injustice, is therefore following its own process of structural development. It wishes to espouse neither the ideas of the left, nor the ideas of the right, because imperialism and exploitation are met with at every turn. Our people has chosen to be itself, in other words, to be authentic, because it is convinced that the problem of Zaire cannot be validly solved apart from the Zairian people themselves.\n246.\tHowever, the Zairian people recognizes that recourse to authenticity is not narrow nationalism, a blind return to the past, but, on the contrary, an instrument for peace among nations, a condition of existence among the peoples, a basis for co-operation among States, for authenticity is not only increased knowledge of one's culture, but also respect for the cultural heritage of others.\n247.\tWe are therefore convinced that only respect for the authenticity of every people will make possible harmonious relations among States. Consequently, this will strengthen the universal nature of our Organization within which all States endowed with different social and political structures will be able to co-operate in the interest of restoring the balance between industrialized and developing countries, as well as serving the cause of world.peace.\n248.\tThat is why the Republic of Zaire, which has great respect for the universality which is characteristic of the United Nations, is anxious to work for its maintenance. Even if some Member States for reasons with which we all disagree for the time being attach an ambiguous interpretation to the resolutions of our Organization, it is our duty to exert on them and those Powers which support them the sort of pressure that will compel them to respect the recommendations of the United Nations. This pressure must therefore be exerted inside the United Nations and not outside it. What we must do is strengthen the Organization, not weaken it.\n249.\tThus, the Republic of Zaire has decided as a matter of principle categorically to reject the idea of the expulsion, exclusion or suspension of any State from any international organization. Zaire's position is therefore geared to States, not to the representativity of States.\n250.\tSince we are so keen on strengthening the United Nations, we in Zaire consider that it is in the context of a new spirit of consultation and mutual understanding which should henceforth underlie the work of our Organization that the problem of general disarmament and peace should be solved by all Member States.\n251.\tZaire, which supports any initiative designed to bring about general disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons, is in favor of a straightforward policy, not a demagogic one. We cannot approve the attitude of those who speak about disarmament and the prohibition of the manufacture of nuclear and bacteriological weapons but continue to step up the manufacture, refinement and testing of those weapons.\n252.\tAll States Members of the United Nations must therefore be concerned about the problem of general and complete disarmament and the prohibition of the manufacture of nuclear and bacteriological weapons. Continuous pressure must be exerted on the major Powers to force them finally to decide to destroy those arms which permanently imperil all mankind.\n253.\tOur Organization must also work to protect nature. Zaire highly appreciates the efforts made by the United Nations in this field. My Government, on the initiative of its President, Citizen Mobutu Sese Seko, has drawn up a far-i caching program to safeguard our natural environment, which is of inestimable value to our people.\n254.\tThis year, which is dedicated to women, has seen our country actively involved in the implementation of various programs suggested by the United Nations. Although women in Zaire enjoy the same rights and opportunities as men, our President felt that he should personally organize an international women's symposium in Kinshasa last May.\n255.\tDuring that international meeting female delegates from various African countries and countries outside Africa had an opportunity to learn of the experience gained by Zairian women in their authentic society. Zairian women also took advantage of that meeting to learn from their foreign sisters what was happening elsewhere.\n256.\tThe World Conference of the International Women's Year, held in Mexico and organized by the United Nations, was a major occasion for representatives of women throughout the world to report\non their respective experiences. That Conference undoubtedly contributed to the development of under-standing among peoples and the strengthening of inter-national co-operation.\n257.\tZaire is gratified that during the work of the seventh special session the industrialized countries displayed a certain degree of generosity towards the developing countries. We have resolved to follow that example of generosity in our relations with all countries.\n258.\tThus, so far as Portugal is concerned, which is now suffering from a very difficult situation in respect of its colony of Angola, Zaire has decided that, apart from the Angolan refugees estimated at more than 1 million, it will welcome up to 400,000 Portuguese refugees who, for reasons of safety, may desire to leave Angola temporarily. All arrangements have been made to make it possible for those refugees to work and live normally until the situation in Angola becomes stable.\n259.\tIn conclusion, I should like to express to the President, on behalf of the Zairian delegation, the hope that the work of the present session over which he is presiding with such dynamism and perspicacity will consolidate the spirit of concerted action among the industrialized and the developing countries the\nspirit which was so characteristic of the seventh special session thus making our Organization an effective tool for achieving the harmonious development of all Member States, for strengthening international cooperation and for bringing about genuine world peace."

        "file_text": "127.\t The election of Mr. Thorn as President of this Assembly pleases us and makes us confident in advance that under his presidency this session will bring about useful results.\n128.\tAt the same time I should like to congratulate Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, for his important contribution to the previous session of the General Assembly and to the seventh special session. We congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the moral and intellectual courage he has displayed in his work and for his interest in the new problems of the world.\n129.\tThe thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations invites us to think deeply, not only on the future of the Organization but also on the future of the world.\n130.\tThe most serious mistake that could be made would be to underrate everything the United Nations has done, during these 30 years, for peace in the world. No less serious a mistake would be to ask more from the United Nations than it actually can give. The Organization now has before it important problems in regard to restructuring itself. There is no doubt that over the past 30 years the emphasis and intensity of many subjects has changed. The legitimacy of the United Nations is now more complex and more demanding. As we come closer to new social and economic processes we shall have to become more dynamic and act more speedily. We are beginning live in an era of negotiations and compromises as well as of choices of alternatives. Understandings and compromises are possible but not always easy to achieve. In the next quarter of a century, the United Nations must contribute to outlining perspectives and discovering new horizons. The essential aim in the years to come will be to achieve a just world for all mankind.\n131.\tThe United Nations was not born to shape a Utopia but to strengthen a specific community of free nations and help to formulate, in political and universal terms, the broad outlines of human development.\n132.\tThe continuity of this great forum of nations and great world assembly for over a quarter of a century is proof of its moral vigour, its growing influence, and its genuine possibilities of existence and improvement.\n133.\tThis has been a period of ever more complex mutations and changes in historical development. From pre-cybernetic society, some countries are moving ever more rapidly towards a post-industrial society, and from a world characterized by purely continental relations we are entering a period of historic simultaneity. This era, deeply influenced by multi- continental relations, ties and bonds, confers a global meaning to all that we aspire to, undertake or plan.\n134.\tThe process of identification of the cold war has ended. Traditional models have been eroded. The time of automatic alignments is past.\n135.\tThe era of social changes we live in has incorporated into the world of political decisions countries which today belong to this Organization and which aspire to be protagonists and not merely witnesses of international political decisions.\n136.\tThe new countries thus constitute an emerging political power that is essential to the political and economic balance of the world. The developing countries now form a community of fundamental peoples no longer to be ignored or brushed aside. Their aspirations, their desire to participate in decisions and to affirm their destinies are not incompatible with the well-being of developed nations. On the contrary, the stability of the developing countries of the third world, the forcefulness of their identity and their dedication to stable goals of internal growth give them not only confidence in the international political and economic order, but contribute to the stability of the industrial countries. In the nineteenth century and until the Second World War, the balance of the world depended exclusively on understanding among the great Powers. At the present juncture in the life of man, the balance of the planet depends on all countries, whether they be poor or developed, large or small.\n137.\tThe developing countries have no reason to apply automatic thinking which might lead them to repeat mistakes or processes of the industrial society. An important task for the new nations will be to conceive and devise their own formulas which will in some ways be original. Regrettably, there is not as yet sufficient communication between the third world and the industrial nations. Our countries find difficulty in getting their opinions and views brought to inter-national public attention and, to a certain extent, there is lack of information on the social and economic problems caused by poverty.\n138.\tWe shall have to find a way out of these mechanisms of world-wide lack of information or counter- information which at times affect the prestige and the image to which the developing countries are entitled as far as world public opinion is concerned. There must be a review of the procedures and institutions of world public information so that in some way we can improve the balance of information and thus meet the information needs of all countries and not just of certain isolated countries or groups of countries. The present crisis is essentially the collapse of the standards and patterns of behaviour of the industrial society. There is no need for us to be heirs to those standards and patterns.\n139.\tThis inevitable political change constitutes a historic event which is called interdependence, which has recently been dramatically revealed by the energy crisis and inflation. Both phenomena are the consequences of an economic and social system and of an artificially constructed type of balance directed towards the preservation of the economic health of the industrial nations alone. It was an unjust arbitrary order and the source of permanent imbalances and disturbances, which went hand in hand with habits of waste, uncontrolled military expenditure and unforgivable ethical omissions and negligence.\n140.\tUnrestrained consumerism and placing value exclusively on material assets as the only references of human growth and the yardstick of universal progress are the most notorious aberrations of that world order.\n141.\tFor a long time the consequences were suffered only by the developing countries and by all the countries which now constitute the third world. More recently the effects of the system have been felt also by the industrial countries, which are now discovering a fundamental fact: the interdependence of nations. We, the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, have so far been the traditional victims of dependence. Most of us in Latin America have enjoyed political independence since the beginning of the nineteenth century, but we remained involved within implacable mechanisms of economic subordination, from which we now wish to be free. Even now that interdependence is given a conceptual value, the dependence of the weaker countries still subsists. For interdependence to mean what it really should mean, concrete agreements are necessary which will alter the assessments and perspectives of the past.\n142.\tThe United Nations and other international organizations allow us to evaluate the experiences gained from multilateral relations. Furthermore, bilateral relations are increasingly useful when they are frank, honest and to the point. But, in addition to this, it is necessary to point out the importance of concerted action whereby groups of nations agree on certain subjects. In that way, certain imbalances are being corrected and others can be rectified in the future.\n143.\tThe decision to raise the price of oil was not a mere whim of irresponsible or adventurous Governments with the intention of committing aggression against the industrial nations or disturbing the world's economic balance. It was a decision of sovereign countries which did not want to continue to permit the devaluation of their resources. It is impossible to think that the traditionally poor countries are prospering at the expense of the rich countries. That would be tantamount to saying that a plutocracy of the poor was coming into being.\n144.\tThe oil-producing countries are being accused of being the cause of the present economic imbalance, but the fact that the incidence of increased oil prices in the inflationary process is insignificant when compared to other inflationary prices which pre-dated the rise in the price of oil is overlooked.\n145.\tDuring the years when oil prices were kept artificially low, the inflationary process continued to intensify. Inflation had been in evidence in previous years, while it was in the last two years that the oil- producing countries decided to increase their prices.\n146.\tThe changes which have occurred during the past two years pose unprecedented international problems, especially for the developing countries. It is assumed that the current account deficit of these countries might rise from $10,000 million in 1973 to over $30,000 million in 1975. Less than one third of that deficit can be attributed to oil prices. The remaining two thirds is the result of increased prices of manufactured goods and of food and the deterioration in the prices of products exported by the developing countries.\n147.\tThe members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] are aware of their international responsibility. The Conference of Sovereigns and Heads of State of the Member Countries of OPEC, held at Algiers in March 1975, is proof of their maturity and of a highly developed sense of international co-operation. OPEC is not an aggressive group intent on taking decisions against the industrial nations; it is a serious, thoughtful organization which in no way wants to assume irresponsible attitudes. One of the absurdities of the present economic order is the dichotomy which has been created between producers and consumers. In the world today we are all producers and we are all consumers.\n148.\tToday every country, large or small, has an international responsibility. This is one of the most significant changes in the present political order of the world. The nation which I represent is fully conscious of this fact.\n149.\tThe President of Venezuela has proposed to other member nations of OPEC the setting up of a fund of between $1,500 million and $2,000 million for the non-imbursable financing of the increase in the price of oil resulting from the adjustment of prices, for the benefit of third-world countries which are not oil producers.\n150.\tThe basic problem of the current economic order is to provide stability for the development plans of the third-world countries, which have been hardest hit by inflation, deterioration in export prices and monetary upheavals. It is to be hoped that the forthcoming UNCTAD meeting will represent an important advance toward this objective, Poverty is an accusation against the entire present historical order.\n151.\tThe problem would be simplified if we quickly took concrete steps to create certain systems which, like the Agriculture Development Fund, established balances.\n152.\tIt would be, to say the least, arbitrary to imagine that responsibility lies exclusively with the oil-producing nations. That would mean absolving the great industrial nations from their international responsibilities and would also be contrary to the fundamental concept that in a world of increasing interdependence, responsibilities are also interdependent.\n153.\tFor Venezuela, the policy of defending natural resources is continuous and traditional, not only as a co-founder of OPEC, but also in carrying out important internal decisions. Recently, we have adopted two historic decisions: the nationalization of iron and the nationalization of oil.\n154.\tBoth decisions are the result of a national consensus which was arrived at within the pluralistic democratic society which is the essence of the Venezuelan political system. By enactment of pre-existing laws and regulations resulting from the free debate of public opinion and political parties, as well as from previously known programs, we have nationalized iron and oil. Therefore, this is not an international conspiracy against any country, nor against any specific interests; it is the affirmation of a free and sovereign people, conscious of the importance of its resources and conscious, too, of its will to administer them without any dependence or subordination.\n155.\tThis is part of an even broader policy to which the President of Venezuela is committed, namely that of developing ecological balance and all non-renewable natural resources. The Government of my country has fully identified itself with the goals of protecting the waters of rivers, lakes and oceans, the flora and the fauna from depredation and aggression. We are also aware that a policy of this type must be carried out on a world-wide level. That is why we believe in the increasingly important role which the United Nations can play in this respect over the coming 25 years.\n156.\tWe must defend the planet for all mankind and we must do so in universal democratic terms, so that the resources of nature may benefit the vast majorities and not be for the exclusive benefit of a few.\n157.\tAt this new session of the Assembly, we face the imperative necessity to remember that it is urgent to establish a climate of international trust. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, held recently at Helsinki, and other events, have given rise to optimism. In connexion with that Conference the attempt by industrial countries better to appreciate the development problems of the third world must not be overlooked. Understanding must be followed by action. We think that the future conference to be held in Paris will provide an opportunity for a useful dialog to define world international co-operation in specific terms. Most of what was said in the past serves no useful purpose today. We must find a new conceptual order to express the new political and economic system. dialog between industrialized countries and the developing countries is possible.\n158.\tThere exist alternatives for understanding and compromise. It will be necessary to strengthen the credibility of agreements and the good faith of arrangements. It is not possible to continue to deal with oversimplifications. We must place problems within a rational context.\n159.\tRaw materials, development, oil prices, the cost of manufactured goods and food are not part of separate constellations. They are all integrated into a vital process of reciprocal inter-connexions and clear ties.\n160.\tIn other words, in this Assembly new types of solidarity have been ushered in. My country had a concept of international solidarity from the time it emerged as an independent nation during the first quarter of the nineteenth century. Oil was unknown to us then; we were simply a small agricultural society on the northern shores of South America. But even at that early stage Simon Bolivar convened a Congress in Panama to define the strategy for continental unity. Long before we became an oil-producing nation, we were a Latin American nation. Now we are fully convinced that to be identified with Latin America alone is not enough; we must, on the contrary, think and act within a broader framework: that of solidarity with the countries of the third world,\n161.\tBeyond these alliances, Venezuela believes in its role as a participant in any and all initiatives aimed at fostering the mechanisms of world co-operation, which means simply that we are identified with the fate and future of mankind. In this effort, we recognize no difference between great or small, capitalist or socialist, industrialized or non-industrialized nations, whether north, south, east or west.\n162.\tAs an oil-producing country Venezuela has, with modesty but good will, defined several programs for international co-operation. With Central America, with nations of the Caribbean and other countries in the southern part of our continent, we have reached important agreements. Venezuela has pledged funds for international co-operation to a total of $2,724 million, which amounts to more than 8 per cent of our gross national product, thus largely exceeding the quota fixed by the United Nations for the developed countries. We realize, however, that isolated initiatives are not in themselves sufficient, and that is why, with other oil-producing and non-oil-producing nations, we are developing a broader plan to contribute to international development.\n163.\tIn accord with the resolution unanimously adopted during the seventh special session of the General Assembly, which constitutes a substantive change in international economic relations, we must all act with the necessary loyalty to ensure that those principles will dispel doubts and suspicions and effectively contribute to the creation of an atmosphere favorable to the holding of concrete negotiations. We have agreed that we must not return to the past and therefore any manifestations of dissent from the agreements adopted here may cast serious doubts on the sincerity of the consensus and the flexibility demonstrated so far.\n164.\tThe forthcoming Paris Conference will meet under the auspices of the agreements adopted here. In our opinion, it will be the first negotiation with a historical perspective between industrial countries and developing countries, whose points of view concerning a global approach to world economic problems were fortunately accepted. We attach paramount importance to that Conference. Interdependence in the future, the soundness and stability of the world economy and of the new international economic order will depend on the wisdom, lucidity and understanding of the negotiators, as well as on the political will which is demonstrated.\n165.\tOur active participation in the struggle against colonialism and racial discrimination is already well known and forms part of the history of these 30 years of our Organization.\n166.\tIn welcoming today three new Member States, the Republics of Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe, thus adding independent countries to the United Nations, we cannot but rejoice to see the inevitable end of the colonial era in the world.\n167.\tIt is with equal pleasure that we greet the independence of Suriname, a Latin American country which is a brotherly neighbor of Venezuela and which we hope will join us in the United Nations during this session.\n168.\tIt is not only at the economic level that we express solidarity, but also in terms of global and regional politics. We seek a peaceful and lasting settlement in the Middle East which will solve the problem of the Palestinian people. We look forward to an equitable solution in Cyprus, Rhodesia and Namibia, and we hope, with most of the peoples of the world, for the eradication of apartheid from South Africa. A similar sense of international solidarity leads us to hope for a prompt political solution in the Korean peninsula which may end for ever the unrest and disturbance in that area.\n169.\tIn Latin America, Bolivia and Panama have our complete solidarity. We hope that the problem of landlocked Bolivia, which was explained at this meeting by President Banzer of Bolivia, will be solved harmoniously by the countries concerned, and we are pleased at the progress which he announced. We also hope that the matter of the Panama Canal will not become a source of growing irritation between Latin America and the United States. We look forward to practical solutions in those two cases and to rational and balanced formulas. The case of Panama affects the dignity for all the countries of Latin America.\n170.\tInternational solidarity is inconceivable without a world disarmament system and without the extension of denuclearized zones, concerning which Latin America sets a precedent. The peaceful use of nuclear energy is an opportunity not to be wasted, and my country is interested in increasing the possibilities of its development. But we do not forget that the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] must be made more comprehensive. Nuclear energy should be used under stable, assured conditions, and any prohibition tending to avoid abuse will be welcome. Means of mass destruction must be subject to controls to protect mankind from the risk they represent. The United Nations must tackle boldly one of the most dramatic problems that can affect the international rule of law: the nuclear threat. Dire warnings to that effect have been heard at this Assembly. The use of nuclear energy should be subject to reliable control so that its peaceful use may not unexpectedly be turned into an instrument of aggression. The strength of this Organization depends largely in the future on the means of inspection and control that may be developed to deal with the nuclear threat. In this matter no warnings or scruples could ever be exaggerated. Nuclear non-proliferation, like disarmament, must become an accomplished fact. It is also necessary, as a practical formula, to study the relationship that should exist between the gross national product of a country and its expenditure on weapons.\n171.\tDisarmament will not create Utopia, but it presupposes the development of a policy and of action.\n172.\tThe maturity being shown by the international community is undeniable. That is why it is important for each country to be convinced that regional conflicts are factors not only of local disturbance, but of contagious, world-wide unrest. Fortunately, it is now possible to envisage world peace in practical terms. Peace is no longer merely an abstract ideal, an illusion or a hope, but a necessity originating largely in the forces of development which the world society has created in recent years. International confrontation increasingly becomes so costly a risk that it is possible and more realistic to explore and exploit the definite alternative of peaceful coexistence. Peace is no longer an ideal, it is a real political possibility.\n173 In the years to come I think we should be engaged in accelerating in the world the processes of political democratization and of greater participation by citizens in the decisions of society. Similarly, efforts must be intensified to assert the value and dignity of human existence. In this respect the United Nations has achieved much undeniable progress, but a great deal remains to be done. Venezuela, as a democratic nation, is fully aware of the importance of these values.\n174.\tSimilarly, we must think of the action necessary to control the phenomena of violence of any and all types, and all their manifestations. Some of these phenomena originate in economic imbalances or centuries-old injustices. But political solutions will be necessary, and the time is right to devise them and plan for them.\n175.\tAll this, in short, leads us to affirm that the condition of mankind and of the ethical forces of individual and social conduct will prevail over the distortions and mutilations that industrialized civilization has developed. World order can be based on mankind, and mankind alone. The trust, hope and optimism we invest in the United Nations therefore raise these essential questions: Can we be optimistic about the future of mankind, or is it necessary to remain motionless? Can the present be changed? Is it possible to raise the idea of justice in political and ethical terms? And do we or do we not accept the fact that the condition of mankind is based on freedom and the free exercise of man's creative powers? To that end we must rescue the irreplaceable principle of international honesty from wreck.\n176.\tVenezuela is a country which believes in and identifies with the fundamental values of human life, democracy and freedom, and we wish to reaffirm that in international controversies or dissension we are willing to listen and to understand. As a nation of Latin America and of the third world, we hope that our motives will be understood; that our dignity will be valued, for it is not incompatible with the dignity of any other country; and that our word will be respected as an expression of good faith.\n177.\tThere are two ways to conclude an address to the General Assembly: with pessimism or with optimism. I conclude my statement with optimism.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t  Mr. President, permit me first to join my colleagues in congratulating you on your election as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. This gives me great pleasure, as our two nations are linked by a very special and fruitful co-operation. Your election not only testifies to your excellent personal qualities but also reflects the important role which can be played in the United Nations by the smaller nations. I wish you all success in this high office, and you can feel certain of our confidence and support.\n2.\tLet me also at the outset place on record our appreciation for the tireless efforts made by Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General, and his staff to implement the objectives of the Charter.\n3.\tWe are very happy to welcome the three new Members, Cape Verde, Mozambique, and Sao Tome and Principe, and look forward to their co-operation and their contribution to the work of our Organization.\n4.\tAs I did not have the opportunity to attend and address the seventh special session of the General Assembly held earlier this month, allow me to comment in a few words on the promising results of that session devoted to development and international economic co-operation. During the session all Members showed a willingness to co-operate and compromise in attempting to solve the big and far-reaching economic problems facing the world community. The recession in the world has affected both developed and developing countries. In the most severely affected countries the situation is so serious that a considerable part of the population is engaged in a daily struggle for survival against poverty and starvation.\n5.\tThe fact that we were able to move from confrontation to co-operation at the seventh special session despite these enormous difficulties I consider to be an achievement of major political significance. Despite the economic difficulties, the political will to contribute, to co-operate and to assist the developing\ncountries was clearly displayed. Now we must implement the decisions of the special session. No substantial success can be expected without concentrated effort and without goodwill on the part of all. It is clear that both realism and generosity will be needed to bring about the necessary changes.\n6.\tThis session marks the thirtieth anniversary of the Assembly. I will not take much of your time in evaluating the achievements and the short-comings of our Organization; this has been done thoroughly by previous speakers. Let me, however, express the hope that we have learned from past mistakes and that the achievements made will inspire us to redouble, in the future, our efforts to find solutions to the vast and challenging problems before us.\n7.\tI fully endorse the sentiment expressed by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [AIIOOOI/Add.l], that this Organization of ours has been able to adjust to a changing world and has met many unforeseen challenges. We should still further strengthen the United Nations as the global forum for the promotion of security, peace and solidarity.\n8.\tI shall now mention very briefly our views regarding some of the major international questions facing this Assembly.\n9.\tThirty years ago the founders of the United Nations decided that the primary function of the Organization should be the maintenance of international peace and security. Despite determined efforts in the United Nations, the central question of disarmament and arms control has so far defied solution. The production and stockpiling of arms and the international trade in armaments have reached terrifying proportions, with no reduction in sight. Besides the tragic waste in human and material resources in a world where millions of people are living in appalling misery, the armaments race creates a highly dangerous threat to the survival of mankind.\n10.\tThe United Nations was founded at the conclusion of the most terrifying and destructive war in history and at the beginning of the nuclear age. Since then, the world has lived in the shadow of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction.\n11.\tThrough efforts made in the United Nations some important international agreements have been concluded in the field of nuclear energy and armaments. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], to which over 90 countries have become parties, has, however, proved only partially effective and we have to face the fact that the danger of nuclear proliferation is increasing. This should be a matter of grave concern to us all, and I hope that the Assembly at this session will give close attention to the general problems of , arms control and disarmament, and in particular to halting the increasing danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n12.\tMy delegation welcomes the continued process of decolonization in Africa, as evidenced by the admission at this session of the three new African States, to be followed shortly by Angola.\n13.\tThe Icelandic delegation has always supported in the United Nations the struggle of the peoples of southern Africa to achieve self-determination and independence. Despite determined activity by this Organization over the years, racial inequality and apartheid persist in parts of southern Africa. We must continue to apply pressure until self-determination and the basic human rights of the populations in that area are guaranteed.\n14.\tThe violation of human rights is not limited to any one part of the world and has to be condemned wherever it occurs. The question of human rights and dignity must therefore continue to receive the highest priority in the United Nations. In this connexion I wish to express satisfaction with the significance attributed to humanitarian questions and human contacts in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, signed at Helsinki by 35 heads of Government on 1 August 1975.\n15.\tThe United Nations is, in this anniversary year, approaching full universality of membership. Member nations now number 141, representing over 95 per cent of the world population. We expect shortly to be able to welcome additional nations as Members.\n16.\tAt this point I want to reaffirm the belief of my Government in the principle of universality as regards membership in the United Nations. And following that basic principle, the Icelandic delegation will oppose any moves to exclude or suspend any Member State by any means not in strict conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, or to restrict its rights as a Member of the Organization or of its organs or of associated organizations. We believe that any such efforts will be harmful and might destroy the effectiveness of the United Nations as an instrument for peace.\n17.\tThe recent interim agreement between Egypt and Israel is a most welcome development which we consider to be a significant step in the direction of a peaceful settlement in the Middle East. We compliment all those concerned with this agreement on their statesmanship, wisdom and courage. It is to be hoped that this momentum thus achieved towards negotiating the extremely complex and delicate problems in this area will not be lost but will lead to a lasting solution. This is no easy task, but we appeal to the peoples in the Middle East to show restraint and a genuine will to work together to achieve a just solution of the problems, as the alternative is likely to be open conflict which would pose a grave danger to world peace. An over-all settlement would have to respect the rights of the Palestinians and the rights of all States in the area to secure and recognized borders.\n18.\tThe highly useful role of the United Nations peace-keeping forces in the Middle East deserves to be praised as, without their existence, the disengagement agreements would have been much more difficult to achieve.\n19.\tThe problem of Cyprus is still with us. We hope that the talks being conducted under the auspices of the Secretary-General will continue, as we feel that negotiations between the two communities under his able and devoted guidance will prove to be the best available means of reaching a satisfactory and permanent solution of this vexing problem.\n20.\tThe Assembly is once again faced with the question of Korea. Progress on this vital issue depends on the genuine efforts and goodwill of the two Korean States, without which there is little that the General Assembly can accomplish. As the peaceful reunification of Korea is the announced policy of the two Governments, we must hope that conditions will be created for them to resume negotiations towards this end.\n21.\tThe Government of Iceland has followed the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea with great attention and continues to attach the greatest importance to its deliberations. Considerable progress has been made by the Conference in some fields and a wide range of agreement has emerged. However, in some other fields, like the regime for the international sea-bed area, considerable work still needs to be done. My Government has taken a keen interest in these deliberations and will continue to work for the successful conclusion of the Conference.\n22.\tAt the end of the third session of the Conference, which took place at Geneva from 17 March to 9 May 1975, my Government had to take stock of the situation. We had then before us the single negotiating text prepared by the Chairmen of the three main committees which will become the basis of the work of the fourth session in New York in March-May 1976. Still another session, or even sessions, may be required before the Conference can conclude its work.\n23.\tIn the meantime my Government was faced with the following situation.\n24.\tFirst, the fish stocks in the Iceland area continue to form the foundation of our economy a matter of life or death to our people.\n25.\tSecondly, almost one half of the total demersal catch in the area continues to be taken by foreign nationals from distant-water fishing States, particularly the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of the small size of the fish taken by vessels from the United Kingdom, actually more than half of the number of fish have been taken by foreign fishermen. The vessels engaged in this fishing are heavily subsidized in various ways by the Governments concerned.\n26.\tThirdly, foreign nationals are continually increasing their capture of immature fish so that the replacement of stocks is increasingly endangered. This is shown, for instance, by the fact that the most important fish stock in Icelandic waters, namely, cod, has now been reduced to spawning only once in its lifetime. And the average age of the fish caught is now much lower than ever before. The total fishing effort is now 100 per cent greater than it was 20 years ago, but the catch is even less than it was then. The implications are evident.\nrj Fourthly, the present Icelandic fishing fleet is fiillv capable of utilizing the total allowable catch in the area. A special committee of the International Council for Exploration of the Sea and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Commission has estimated that a 50 per cent reduction of the fishing effort in the North Atlantic area would not reduce the total catch. Fishing mortality in the Iceland area will have to be drastically reduced in order to achieve optimum utilization.\n28 In view of all these facts the Government of Iceland decided to take the necessary action consonant with the progressive development of international law as reflected in the consensus reached at the Conference. We decided not to establish an economic zone for the time being because some aspects of that concept still have to be worked out. We decided not to adopt rules with regard to the territorial sea, pollution, scientific research, or the delimitation of the continental shelf for the same reasons. Nor would we interfere with international navigation in any way.\n29.\tBut with regard to the one vital issue the problem of foreign fishing we could not delay taking the necessary action any longer. Consequently, on 15 July 1975, regulations were issued extending the Icelandic fishery limits to 200 nautical miles. Where the distance between Iceland and other States is less than 400 nautical miles, the median line or equidistance principle is employed. The new regulations will take effect on 15 October 1975. At the same time a scientific management program is being established which will call for the exercise of great restraint on the utilization of the Icelandic fishing fleet even after foreign fishing is discontinued. The purpose of the program is to ensure the optimum sustainable yield under scientific management. It will constitute a thorough revision of previous management programs, which so far have always been hampered by the interference of foreign fishing. The management program will be based on scientific principles of conservation.\n30.\tThe action which the Government of Iceland has taken is in conformity with the consensus which emerged at the Conference on the Law of the Sea that a coastal State can decide the total allowable fishing catch within a 200 mile zone and can also determine its own capacity to utilize that catch. When the coastal State does not have the capacity to harvest the entire allowable catch, it shall give other States access to the surplus of this allowable catch. These principles, which are also embodied in articles 50 and 51 of part II of the informal single negotiating text emanating from the Conference, undoubtedly have the support of the overwhelming majority of the States participating in the Conference.\n31.\tIt is, of course, also quite clear that some States still fight this kind of solution since they would like to continue their past activities and send large trawler fleets to utilize the fishing grounds of other nations without their consent. But the time has come to face the fact that such practices are opposed by the overwhelming majority of the Members of the international community and that the system on which they are based is obsolete and quite unacceptable to the nations whose resources the distant-water fishing States want\nto use. Instead of opposing the concept of the exclusive economic zone, they should be con tent that they do not have to compensate for the immense riches which they have taken out of those resources in the past. As far as my country is concerned, those obsolete policies have many times in the past jeopardized our economic survival and we cannot tolerate that situation any longer.\n32.\tHowever, my Government is willing to facilitate reasonable interim adjustments to mitigate economic hardship for foreign fishermen, but two major considerations must then be kept in mind. On the one hand, our policy in this field has been known for almost 30 years now and cannot come as a surprise to anyone least of all to the nations whose fishermen have frequented or worked our area. On the other hand and I emphasize this we will not submit to economic pressures such as those exercised by the Federal Republic of Germany, which has enacted a landing ban on our trawlers in German ports and exercised its veto to prevent the application of tariff concessions in the European Economic Community.\n33.\tIt is our hope that our new regulations will be respected by all concerned and that we will be able to use our natural resources in conformity with the principles which were supported, as I said before, by an overwhelming majority at the Conference on the Law of the Sea. This is our intention and this is what we shall do.\n34.\tIt has been maintained in some quarters that the Government of Iceland should have waited for the completion of the work of the Conference and that by acting now the further work of that Conference has been made more difficult. My Government does not share this view. On the contrary, by adhering strictly to the principles overwhelmingly supported by the Conference, my Government has emphasized its respect for the Conference and it is our conviction that our action, as well as any similar action taken by other States, will, rather than hinder the work of the Conference, promote its success,\n"

        "file_text": " I should like to extend to the President my heartfelt congratulations on his election to that high office and responsibility. It gives me particular pleasure to have this opportunity to do so as our two countries have traditionally promoted bonds of friendship and co-operation. I should also like to express the sincere appreciation of my delegation to the President of the twenty-ninth regular session and seventh special session of the General Assembly, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who guided those important sessions very successfully and imbued the proceedings with the dynamism of his personality and of the non-aligned policy of his country.\n159.\tIt is with great pleasure that I welcome the admission of new Members to the United Nations: the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, and the Republic of Cape Verde. Their admission symbolizes both new victories of the liberation struggle of peoples for freedom and independence and the right of all States to participate, on an equal footing, in the affairs of the international community. We expect that we shall soon have the opportunity to welcome here the representatives of independent Angola, which is now encountering great difficulties caused by interference from external factors taking advantage of the discord and conflict among the internal political forces of Angola.\n160.\tRegrettably, the admission of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam has been prevented by the use of the veto in the Security Council, contrary to the positions and demands of most of the States Members of the United Nations. Thus, membership was denied to the two Republics of Viet Nam, whose people had made an inestimable contribution to the strengthening of the principles that constitute the essence of the United Nations.\n161.\tThe current session coincides with the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations, which emerged as a result of the great struggle of the peoples against fascism, whose aim was to subjugate countries and peoples and to smother the freedom and destroy the dignity of man. Therefore the United Nations from the very outset, notwithstanding the weaknesses which reflect the contradictions of the contemporary world, has embodied all the fundamental values that express the most profound aspirations of mankind to peace, freedom and progress.\n162.\tThis session is taking place in a period of very important international conferences, such as the recent Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non\nAligned Countries at Lima, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the world conferences on population, food, the law. of the sea and the International Women's Year, the Second Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the seventh special session of the General Assembly. These gatherings reflect an involvement of peoples and countries in the concerted effort to create conditions for equitable international cooperation unprecedented in history. The non-aligned countries are making a decisive contribution to all these important endeavors to eliminate the anachronistic relations and structures based on force, subjugation and exploitation, and to establish new and more just economic and political relationships.\n163.\tOn behalf of my delegation, I should like to single out in particular the constructive contribution of non-aligned countries to the resolution of key issues on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. By increasingly reflecting the need for a world united on the basis of common interests and problems, non-alignment has become a world policy, or, as stated in the Lima documents, an active option of all countries striving for independence, equality, peace, economic and social progress and democratic relations among States. This is also clearly emphasized by the interest in the policy of non-alignment displayed by an ever-growing number of countries from various geographical areas, of differing political systems and levels of development.\n164.\tAt Lima, as on previous occasions, the non- aligned countries took the position that the key problems besetting the contemporary world can be solved, not within the framework of closed groupings, irrespective of their strength, but only by the broadest international co-operation and sharing of responsibility within the context of equitable relations among peoples and countries.\n165.\tWe should like all international factors to appreciate fully this basic message of Lima. The non- aligned countries, as a universal factor influencing ever more directly the over-all development of international relations, have already assumed their share of responsibility for resolving international issues of interest to the international community in general. They again confirmed this by their contribution at the seventh special session of the General Assembly.\n166.\tThe strategy of the policy of non-alignment in the struggle for peace, equality, and economic and social progress proceeds from a realistic assessment of the role of all international factors exercising a crucial influence on the development of international relations and general development in the world, and thereby of the role of the big Powers and relations between them. This strategy also realistically appraises the major changes in the relation of forces, one of the most characteristic features of which is the emergence of the non-aligned countries and their ever-growing unity, as well as the solidarity of developing countries a solidarity that is increasingly reflected in activities aimed at solving current international economic problems.\n167.\tIt is our deep conviction that no strategy for solving international problems that fails to take into account such international factors as the non-aligned and developing countries and their solidarity can achieve lasting success.\n168.\tWe are likewise convinced that solidarity and mutual co-operation among non-aligned countries, as well as among developing ones, is of the utmost importance for the safeguarding of peace, the promotion jf more equitable international relations and the settlement of pressing international issues. Moreover, we believe that any attempt to destroy this unity and solidarity, which is based on common aspirations ind interests that always outweigh the differences :hat may exist among them or that may arise over specific issues, is doomed to failure.\n169.\tThe current session of the General Assembly s taking place in a year of highly significant developments that reflect the complex processes in t^e world ts well as broad and intensive efforts aimed at creating conditions for the solution of international problems hrough equitable international co-operation.\n170.\tA characteristic of the present-day world is he growing activity of forces which refuse to accept iny relationships based on inequality and dependence. iVe are witnessing continuing change in the world generated by the success of the struggle of peoples >n all continents for independent national and progressive social development and for a substantive transformation of political and economic relations and structures.\nE71, The victory of the peoples of Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos, the mortal blows dealt to the colonial system in Africa, the successes of Latin American countries in the battle to strengthen their political ind economic independence, and the democratic ind progressive changes made in the internal relations )f many countries are vital factors constantly altering he relation of forces in favor of liberation, progress ind peace. The international community has made major strides towards identifying the issues relative the new international economic order and has taken initial steps towards its establishment. The successful conclusion of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe has significantly encouraged he relaxation of tension.\n72. These positive processes and results have to some extent moved mankind away from a world war, must they have not secured a lasting peace for all countries. There are still bloc and other divisions in the world, as well as profound economic inequalities and vast social differences. The practice of obstructing positive processes by force, sanctioning interference internal affairs and attempting to legalize this practice is being pursued intensively. Imperialist, neo-colonialist and hegemonistic pretensions are not diminishing, and in some areas are even gaining strength. The world economic situation is deteriorating, while the position of the developing countries particularly adverse. The arms race continues unabated. Some of the most dangerous crises remain unresolved or are being aggravated, while new ones threaten to flare up. The process of detente is still omitted. Such a development calls for the urgent and resolute involvement of the entire international\ncommunity in the settlement of outstanding inter-national issues and the establishment of more just\neconomic and political relations upon which alone a\nstable peace and the unhampered development of all countries can be founded.\n173.\tYugoslavia, as a European, non-aligned, socialist country, attaches exceptional importance to the outstanding results of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, held at Helsinki, and for this reason we wish to draw due attention to that Conference at the current session also. The Final Act of the Conference not only indicates the progress achieved with regard to the relaxation of tension in Europe but also outlines conditions for the further deepening and extension of that progress to other areas of the world and to all spheres of international relations.\n174.\tThe President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito, in his statement at the Helsinki Conference said, inter alia:\n\\\"Our attention should now focus on the implementation of the decisions contained in the documents that we are going to adopt ... We shall thereby be making an important contribution towards realizing the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations, which, in a great measure, have also inspired this Conference.\\\"\n175.\tMy delegation believes that it will be necessary to exert persistent efforts with a view to ensuring that the decisions contained in the Final Act will not only be implemented consistently and fully and become an integral part of international life but also become a creative lever for the democratic transformation of the world and for the overcoming of existing bloc and other divisions, both in mutual relations among the participating States and in their relations with other countries and regions in the world. Consequently, the stress laid on the relations of Europe with the rest of the world is of great significance because, parallel with changed relations within Europe itself, it is necessary to ensure Europe's ever more effective contribution to progressive and peaceful processes in the present-day world.\n176.\tYugoslavia endeavored from the outset to ensure that the Conference should reflect the close interdependence of European security with security in the broader area of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, and that the participants in the Conference should contribute to solving development problems and other international issues in a spirit of equality and respect for the interests of all countries.\n177.\tYugoslavia is aware of its great responsibility  both as a participant in the Helsinki Conference and as host to the next Conference, to be held at Belgrade in 1977 to contribute as much as possible, through its initiatives, to the realization of the principles and positions formulated in the Final Act.\n178.\tI wish to stress in particular that my country, which has consistently pursued a policy of good- neighborly relations, will, by relying now also upon the Final Act, make even greater endeavors to strengthen all-round co-operation with its neighbors.\n179.\tI also wish to point out that we hope that the documents of the Helsinki Conference will stimulate broader co-operation among the countries of the region in which my country is located, more specifically among the Balkan and Mediterranean States. For its\npart, Yugoslavia will strive to contribute to the utmost towards the development of such co-operation as will be significant and beneficial to all the countries of these regions.\n180.\tThe Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Lima, devoted special attention to the problems of the Middle East, Palestine and Cyprus, to the acceleration of the decolonization process in Africa, to the struggle against apartheid and racial discrimination, to the problem of Korea, to the problems of Latin America and the Caribbean, to the situation in the region of the Indian Ocean, to the problems of disarmament, to the problems of international economic relations, to the position of developing countries, and so on. It expressed its solidarity with all peoples under colonial domination in their struggle for liberation and emphasized the necessity for lending assistance to the peoples of Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos for the rehabilitation of their countries devastated by war.\n181.\tAll the final documents of the Lima Conference have been distributed as a document of the United Nations [At 10217 and Corr.I], and the Foreign Minister of Peru, General de la Flor Valle, very ably presented the positions and decisions of the Conference to the seventh special and the present session of the General Assembly.\n182.\tIf I were to outline in this the most important world forum the viewpoints of Yugoslavia on the most important issues on the agenda of our current session, I should have to repeat many positions taken by the Lima Conference, since my country contributed, within the limits of its possibilities, to the formulation of these positions and decisions, and will therefore continue to work even more resolutely, through its entire foreign policy activity, towards their implementation.\n183.\tI should like now to refer to some of the crises and problems which I mentioned earlier.\n184.\tThe situation in the Middle East constitutes a source of most immediate danger for peace in the region and in the world. The responsibility of Israel for its policy of constant aggression, occupation and denial of the national rights of the people of Palestine has long since been established. If Israel persists in its present behavior, then nothing else remains but to take resolute steps, including such measures as are provided for under Chapter VII of the Charter to compel it to implement the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\n185.\tThe agreement on disengagement in Sinai initialed recently represents a new, important development which could constitute a positive step towards the establishment of a durable peace, provided it accelerates the movement towards a just and comprehensive settlement based on the withdrawal of Israel from all territories occupied after 5 June 1967 and on the implementation of the legitimate national rights of the people of Palestine, including its right to establish its own State, as a basic pre-condition of guaranteeing the independence and security of all the peoples and countries in the region. We believe that there should not be a stalemate after the present step, r nsJ\u00b0uldt there ^ any long delay in undertaking the next steps towards the settlement of the crisis- otherwise a new, dangerous aggravation of the situation may occur in the Middle East.\n186.\tThe merit of each step taken towards finding a solution to the problem of the Middle East must be measured by the extent to which it contributes to the attainment of the national rights of the Palestinian people. Unless substantive progress is soon made towards this end it will become impossible to take any decisive step towards a lasting settlement of the Middle East crisis. It is precisely the fact that no progress has been made in this respect that is causing the gravest concern. My delegation attaches great significance to the position taken by the Lima Conference, namely, that the non-aligned countries should commit themselves directly and positively to the search for a lasting and just settlement of the Middle East crisis.\n187.\tRespect for and the ensuring of the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus is a constant concern and responsibility of the United Nations. My country, therefore, resolutely urges the speedy implementation of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. The non-aligned countries reaffirmed their full solidarity with non-aligned Cyprus at their recent Conference. We proceed from the belief that the solution to this problem can be found only on the basis of resolution 3212 (XXIX), a resolution unanimously adopted by the General Assembly, since all the parties directly involved voted in its favor. This resolution represents the only generally accepted basis for the settlement of the Cyprus crisis, through the equal, mutual agreement of the two Cypriot communities. It was submitted to the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly by the group of non-aligned countries.\n188.\tIn this connexion, the contact group of five non-aligned countries for good offices played a very constructive role. In the meantime, the group continues to be active and remains willing, within the framework of its mandate, to contribute further to this end. As a country maintaining friendly relations with Cyprus, Greece and Turkey and belonging to the same geographic area, and, naturally, as a non-aligned country and a member of the contact group, Yugoslavia has from the beginning been actively engaged in the search for a lasting and just settlement of the Cyprus problem.\n189.\tDespite the major steps taken towards a definitive dismantling of the colonial system, the imperialist and neo-colonialist forces persist in their efforts to preserve as many of their remaining positions as possible. This is attested to by the involvement of these forces in Angola and by the support they extend overtly or covertly to the Republic of South Africa, its occupation of Namibia, the racist regime in Southern Rhodesia and so on, all of which are situations constantly fraught with the danger of a crisis of world dimensions. Now more than ever before, a mere general moral and political condemnation of colonial and racist systems is no longer sufficient. Today it is necessary to move to concrete and resolute actions against colonialism, racism and apartheid, utilizing in this all the possibilities in extending effective assistance to the national liberation movements and to the Organization of African Unity with a view to achieving the complete liberation of the African continent.\n190.\tThe artificial perpetuation of the division of Korea not only constitutes a denial of the inalienable right of the Korean people to unification but also endangers peace and security in Asia and in the world. For these reasons, we support the policy of the non- aligned Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which has opted for peaceful unification without outside interference. It is indispensable to abolish the United Nations Command, to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea and to create conditions for transforming the armistice agreement into a treaty on durable peace. Only by removing every foreign influence will it be possible to create conditions in which the North and the South of Korea will find a solution on the basis of the three principles of national reunification contained in the joint communique of 4 July 1972.5\n191.\tThe countries of Latin America and the Caribbean are making an exceptionally important contribution towards the contemporary processes of national and social emancipation and progress in the world through their struggle against neocolonialism and for the eradication of colonial enclaves, for the exercise of sovereignty over all their natural resources, for the broadest, free and equitable international co-operation.\n192.\tThe countries of this region, which are at the same time exposed to various pressures by forces that do not favor these processes, deserve the full support and solidarity of the international community. We particularly support the struggle of the people of Chile against the Fascist dictatorship of the military junta, as well as the right of Panama and Cuba to establish full sovereignty over their national territories.\n193.\tThe fact that the essential questions of disarmament have not yet been moved off dead centre and that the arms race, especially the nuclear arms race, is spreading and accelerating fearfully, not only brings into question all the results achieved so far in reducing tensions, and becomes the source of new relationships of monopoly and domination, but constantly keeps the world on the brink of nuclear catastrophe. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons {resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] has remained, in the final analysis, an instrument of monopoly for the production of nuclear weapons and the development of nuclear technology. The provisions of this Treaty were strictly adhered to only by the signatory countries which do not possess nuclear weapons and nuclear technology. An extremely unfavorable effect also results from the tendency to withdraw the disarmament negotiations from the direct influence of the United Nations, transferring them to other institutions, or bilateral channels which, in spite of possible partial solutions, cannot replace the United Nations.\n194.\tMy delegation believes that it is high time that we reverse the trend and reach a turning-point in solving this fateful problem which affects all areas of international relations. It is in the most vital interest of all nations that the arms race be halted at the earliest possible time and that the process of general and complete disarmament start. We, together with many other countries, therefore call for the most urgent convening of a world conference on disarmament and, if this continues to be hindered, we believe that it is necessary to hold a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, as requested also by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries at Lima, where the great majority of the States Members of the United Nations were represented. The General Assembly must take the initiative and accept the responsibilities entrusted to it by the Charter instead of remaining paralyzed by the differences of views of the big Powers.\n195.\tThe adoption of the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and3202 {S-VI)] marked an orientation towards a fundamental change in the existing system of international economic relations. The seventh special session of the Genera] Assembly of the United Nations, the initiative for which was given by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, held at Algiers, represents an effort to implement the resolutions of the sixth special session.\n196.\tThe results of the seventh special session, taken as a whole, are an important step in the right direction, both in changing the position of the developing countries in the world economy and in the interest of the entire international community. The immediate and potential significance of the unanimously adopted resolutions of the seventh special session is that these resolutions have established priorities, indicated specific courses of action, pre-scribed negotiating forums and set a time-table for the execution of a number of measures all based on principles and criteria which until yesterday were not acceptable to certain developed countries whose role in the development of the world economy and international relations is of particularly great importance,\n197.\tWe should like to believe that the seventh special session has opened a new phase in the relations between the developed and the developing countries. The further development of these relations will depend on how and when the agreements reached at the seventh special session are carried out, how and when we shall go beyond them towards the full implementation of all the essential decisions of the sixth special session, for which particular responsibility rests on the developed countries.\n198.\tAlthough the results achieved in certain vital areas are still far from what the developing countries proposed and rightly expected, and although almost all the most important differences of principle remain primarily regarding the nature of the new international economic relations, the document adopted by consensus at the seventh special session of the General Assembly [resolution 3362 (S-VIF)] is in itself an extremely important politically agreed framework and basis for further activity, within the United Nations system, towards achieving concrete agreements containing obligations for their implementation.\n199.\tHaving this in mind, we consider it essential to follow most closely the implementation of the agreement reached, which should evolve in all the organs and organizations of the United Nations concerned with the problems dealt with in that document. The results of these activities should first of all, through the Economic and Social Council, be concentrated in the General Assembly. The results should, in our opinion, be reviewed at the thirty-first regular session of the General Assembly.\n200.\tIn the light of the results of the seventh special session, the Paris conference, which will convene on the initiative of France and consider the questions of energy, raw materials and development, should adapt itself to the decisions of this session, The conference should concern itself with the implementation of the decisions of the seventh special session because of the role it might play in realizing the most important provisions of those decisions, because of the possible impact affecting the interests of all countries, primarily of the developing ones, and because of the consequences involving the role of the United Nations in the economic field.\n201.\tIn view of the importance and the complexity of the situation, the General Assembly should, at its thirtieth regular session, in our opinion, take the following actions, which should be the subject of specific decisions: request all organizations of the United Nations system to accord, in their activities, the highest priority to the questions contained in the document of the seventh special session which are within the framework of their competence; call on them to submit reports, through the Economic and Social Council at its sixty-first session, to the General Assembly at its thirty-first session with a view to establishing an indispensable link between the Paris Conference and the United Nations; address a request to the participants in the Conference to keep the United Nations regularly informed, through the Council, of the results of the work of the Conference; obtain an understanding that all agreements possibly reached at the Paris Conference should be subject to consideration by the General Assembly.\n202.\tThree decades of the United Nations give us an opportunity to review the road traversed by the world Organization.\n203.\tWe have always considered that the United Nations is the most appropriate instrument of universal international co-operation, as it was founded on equality and respect for the interests of all countries. It is of exceptional importance that the United Nations should continually contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the solution of urgent and long-range international problems. Yugoslavia, for its part, has contributed to its utmost to the fulfillment of the tasks confronting the world Organization.\n204 The strengthening of the role and effectiveness of the United Nations is as was so properly stated by the Secretary-General in his very substantive introduction to his report on the work of the Organization most closely connected with and most directly depends on the political behavior of the Member States, on their attitude towards the obligations they have undertaken in virtue of their membership and of the resolutions adopted by the Organization. The Charter itself has stood the test of time, and, despite certain short-comings and even some outdated provisions, it remains a basis for the regulation of relations among all States. However, the non-implementation of any decision, including even the most widely adopted, due to the behavior of some Member States, is one of the greatest weaknesses of the United Nations, which undermines the confidence ofl e inVe?- national public in its effectiveness.\n205.\tAs long as certain Member States act from positions of strength, exert pressure, utter threats interfere in internal affairs of other states or commit aggression against the independence, sovereignty or territorial integrity of other States; as long as they occupy foreign territories, negate or violate the right of peoples to self-determination, practise racial discrimination and apartheid or violate fundamental human rights; as long as they do not recognize the right of States to dispose in a sovereign manner of their own natural resources and wealth; and as long as they, in any way whatsoever, maintain or establish relationships of foreign domination and hegemony, there can be no international order that would be in harmony with the Charter and with the principles of sovereign equality and equal rights of States.\n206.\tHowever, there is no doubt that the United Nations, despite all the difficulties and resistance, has achieved significant results in many areas of international co-operation. With the admission of a large number of new countries, decolonization, and constructive action in a number of crisis areas, with the advancement of co-operation in new fields, the laying of the foundations of a new international economic order, the substantial contribution it has made to the process of relaxation of tension, and with its humanitarian activities, the world Organization has fundamentally changed its character, shape and role. The great advance towards achieving universality and the new relation of forces in the United Nations make possible an ever-greater consideration and gradual resolution of the most important and acute world problems, and enable all Member States, regardless of their size and degree of development, to exert a greater influence on the development of the United Nations and on essential changes in the world.\n207.\tAlong with the other non-aligned countries, Yugoslavia devotes special attention to the constant strengthening and effectiveness of the work of the United Nations. Within the framework of the United Nations, the non-aligned countries constantly strive for its democratization and adaptation to the needs of the international community. They do not desire confrontation, nor do they wish to impose their will on other countries; on the contrary, they favor such relations as will enable all countries to participate in, and contribute to, the search for appropriate solutions, in spite ofthe tendencies towards preserving outdated relationships of dependence and exploitation.\n208.\tThe United Nations has always been a living organism. It reflects the changes in the world and, in its way, reflects the progressive processes in international relations conducive to the freedom, independence, equality and unhindered development of all countries and peoples. The United Nations encounters resistance from forces that attempt to discredit it and reduce its importance. The so-called credibility crisis was artificially provoked. The generally accepted interdependence of all members of the international community is demonstrated in the common search for just solutions of existing international problems, which will lead to the further strengthening ofthe role of the United Nations.\n209.\tSpeaking about how we view the future of the United Nations in this year of the thirtieth anniversary of its existence, we, of course, harbor no illusions\nthat our goals can be achieved easily or without considerable difficulties. However, we are convinced that, today, the United Nations is basically on the right path and that, through concerted efforts, solutions can be found that are in the over-all interest of the world community.\n210.\tIn conclusion, my delegation believes that this session of the General Assembly would fulfil its task provided it adopted appropriate decisions which would amount to concrete contributions along the following lines: removing the main danger spots by implementing existing decisions; undertaking concrete action for the liberation of peoples who are still under colonial and racist domination; taking a decisive political initiative in the entire area of disarmament; ensuring that the decisions of the seventh special session are put into practice through the timely involvement of the entire system of the United Nations; expanding the process of relaxation of tension to all geographic regions and areas of international relations; ensuring that all important international problems of interest to the whole international community are solved within the United Nations or in close contact with it.\n211.\tIf this session achieves progress along these major lines, we are convinced that an atmosphere of constructive co-operation will be maintained and this will enable us to solve the problems facing the United Nations.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "119.\t  Mr. President, on behalf of the Hungarian delegation may I warmly congratulate you on your election to the presidency. I am convinced that under your guidance the present session will help to promote the further improvement of the international atmosphere and the settlement of unresolved international problems.\n120.\tThe year 1975 is one of great celebration. This year we have celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the victory over fascism. This corresponds with the anniversary of the liberation of my country and the anniversary of the creation of the United Nations. The countries of the earth have traveled a long road since the 1940s and the 1950s, a period of great tension, to the present situation of excellent relations and cooperation among countries with different social systems. A very positive role in this connexion has been played by the States members of the Warsaw Pact, the twentieth anniversary of which is also being celebrated this year, States which have by their constructive proposals contributed greatly to the fertile international atmosphere prevailing at present.\n121.\tThe thirtieth session of the General Assembly is convened at a period in which the process of detente has become the main trend in international life. This conclusion has been convincingly borne out by inter-national events in recent years, which indicate that international life has entered a new phase, with detente and peaceful coexistence steadily gaining ground and the concepts and practice of the cold war becoming more and more a thing of the past.\n122.\tIn this extremely favorable development of events, a great role has been played by the socialist countries, and first and foremost by the Soviet Union. The development of their relations with the capitalist countries and, in particular, the improving cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States  has contributed, and will undoubtedly continue to do so in future, to the solution of several complicated inter-national problems.\n123.\tOf course, we must not lose sight of the fact that detente and peaceful coexistence also have their adversaries, The vestiges of the cold war and of fascism, the various representatives of international reaction who benefit from the arms race, and the enemies of social progress alike, are all trying to disrupt the co-operation between countries with different social systems and to defer the settlement of outstanding international problems, while hatching plans to stir up international tension.\n124.\tThese groups enjoy the support of anti-Soviet politicians self-proclaimed socialists who are harboring dreams of world power.\n125.\tThese days, the forces of peace outnumber the forces speculating in war, but they will be able to triumph only if they concert their efforts and firmly repel the attempts to threaten peace and security.\n126.\tIt was two months ago yesterday that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe concluded its work. We who were fortunate enough to be able to attend the third phase of the Conference, to hear the statements of the highest-ranking leaders of the participating countries and to be present at the signing of the Final Act of the Conference, all felt that we were witnessing an event of historic significance. The Governments of the countries signatories of the Final Act summed up the principles for peaceful coexistence among countries, determined the broad policies for developing their relations, and worked out some specific ways and means of pursuing those ends, thereby creating favorable conditions for continuous efforts to consolidate peace and security in Europe.\n127.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's Republic attaches extreme importance to both the Conference and its Final Act. We believe that in months and years to come the signatory countries will have to use their best endeavors to implement the provisions of the Final Act. We, for our part, have already adopted a series of measures to this end. We expect our Western partners to take similar steps for the implementation of the document signed. On this will largely depend whether the enterprise of making Europe a region of stable peace and security, of mutual understanding and fruitful co-operation among States, as well as of stability, can hope to succeed.\n128.\tWe are aware that it will be no easy task to implement the provisions of the Final Act. In the Western countries there are more than a few people who are opposed to peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems and who have also spoken out against the Conference itself. It may be supposed that these forces will be seeking to hinder, on some pretext or another, the efforts to translate the provisions of the Final Act into real terms. The adherents of peace and security will need all their strength to thwart such machinations.\n129.\tLet the adherents of peace draw strength from the awareness that a Europe and a North America living in conditions of lasting peace and security would, in view of the vital importance of those continents in world politics, have a favorable influence on the fate of the entire globe.\n130.\tAn outstanding international event of the recent past has been the historic victory of the Vietnamese people and the restoration of peace in Indo-China. It is quite clear that the importance of this event goes well beyond the confines of the region of South-East Asia and contributes its share to the consolidation of international peace throughout the world.\n131.\tThe Government and people of the Hungarian People's Republic have, from the very outset, stood by the heroic people of Viet Nam and have supported their self-sacrificing struggle. We have also supported a just settlement of the Vietnamese question and fulfilled the obligations we had assumed in the International Commission for Supervision and Control and made our contribution to the restoration of peace. We continue to support the Vietnamese people now that there is a case for the admission of their States to the United Nations. We condemn the maneuvers of those who, in disregard of the position taken by the overwhelming majority of Member States, have blocked the admission of those two countries, We are convinced that their admission would strengthen our Organization and enhance its effectiveness. The Hungarian delegation hopes, therefore, that the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam will become Members of the United Nations as early as this year.\n132.\tMy Government warmly welcomes the victory of the peoples of Laos and Cambodia, which has been another contribution to the consolidation of peace and security in the region of Indo-China.\n133.\tSeveral speakers before me have already emphasized that political detente can be durable and be broadened in scope only if it is supplemented by measures within the context of disarmament. Our delegation is pleased to note that last year some headway was made in this respect as well.\n134.\tWe continue to attach great importance to the Soviet-American Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, the results of which are bound to serve the interests not only of those two world Powers but also of each and every country in the world. Precisely for this reason, we look forward with some expectation to an eventual new agreement in this respect.\n135.\tWe are following with great attention the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces in Central Europe. The proposals made by the Warsaw Pact countries are aimed at reaching an agreement that will guarantee the security of all the countries concerned and preclude the possibility of any of the parties gaining unilateral military advantages. It is time for the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to act on the basis of similar considerations and to show due regard for the principle of equal security.\n136.\tTwelve years have passed since the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water was signed in Moscow. Mankind pinned great hopes on achieving, on the basis of that treaty, a general and complete cessation of nuclear-weapon tests, but certain Powers for different reasons raised objections to a complete ban on nuclear-weapon tests.\n137.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's Republic enthusiastically welcomes the Soviet proposal presented at this session for the general and complete prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests and regards it as a timely initiative of very great importance for the future of mankind. It is our hope that all Governments will ultimately comply with the demands of the peoples and will agree to the complete prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests.\n138.\tMy Government similarly lends warm support to another highly important proposal made by the Government of the Soviet Union concerning the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and of new systems of such weapons. The adoption of this proposal would be a significant step towards curbing the arms race.\n139.\tThe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI)} entered into force on 26 March this year. The socialist countries, which made considerable efforts to achieve that Convention, will continue to struggle for the complete prohibition of chemical weapons.\n140.\tWith regard to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva, we cannot but welcome as a significant result of its work the elaboration of a draft convention, proposed by the Soviet Government, on the prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military or other hostile purposes. We hope that the draft presented by the two Co-Chairmen on 21 August will be found by the General Assembly to constitute an appropriate basis for the conclusion of the Convention.\n141.\tMy Government invariably supported as impor-tant and timely the proposals presented by the Govern-ment of the Soviet Union at the previous session of the General Assembly and widely supported by Member States. We attach particular importance to the early convening of a world disarmament conference.\n142.\tIt has never been, nor will it be, an easy task to have disarmament measures adopted. Influential circles which seek to continue and even to step up the arms race still exist in the West in defiance of their Government's officially declared foreign policy course. It is important for the peoples struggling for peace and security to isolate the fanatics of the arms race and to compel them to adopt an attitude in keeping with the interests of the peoples.\n143.\tThe States Members of the United Nations have to make further efforts to solve outstanding international problems because those hotbeds of international tension which poison international life have a negative effect on further progress and may well imperil the results achieved so far in the process of detente.\n144.\tA favorable development in the European situation and the future of the region bordering on Cyprus are overshadowed by the events connected with that island State. The Hungarian People's Republic unswervingly favors the complete independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. We demand the immediate withdrawal of all foreign military forces and we are strongly opposed to any plan to divide the island State into two parts. My Government believes that the time has come for the Security Council to adopt effective measures for the immediate implementation of its earlier resolutions.\n145.\tWe should like to see the talks between the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus leading to early success through the mediation of the Secretary- General.\n146.\tThe Government and people of the Hungarian People's Republic, in common with all of progressive mankind, welcome with gratification the favorable changes that have taken place in Portugal after the overthrow of Fascist rule. We are glad to see that, in the spirit of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, the Portuguese Government has taken consistent and effective steps to ensure the attainment of independence by its colonies. Certain events, however, that have occurred in Portugal in recent months give us some cause for concern. We find it inadmissible that certain Western politicians are interfering in Portugal's internal affairs. It is solely for the Portuguese people to decide on their future and to choose their way of life. No one is entitled to interfere, either overtly or covertly, in the internal affairs of the Portuguese people.\n147.\tTurning to the Middle East region, we think that the situation there is still explosive. My Government insists on the need for a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East situation. In principle, we have no objection to the partial results achieved by political means, but only provided that they form part and parcel of a comprehensive settlement taking due regard of the interests of all the parties concerned. In connexion with the recent agreement on the disengagement of Egyptian-Israeli forces, we do not share the optimism of those who brought it about. We are concerned because the agreement fails to solve any of the crucial problems, fails to provide for the complete evacuation of the Arab territories occupied in 1967, and fails to provide recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian Arab people and for guarantees of the security of all countries of the Middle East.\n148.\tIn our view, the most appropriate forum for solving the Middle East conflict is still the Geneva Peace Conference, with the participation of all the interested parties, including the PLO, the Soviet Union and the United States. A settlement of the question, whether it is sought at the Geneva Conference or by other means, cannot be lasting without the participation of the socialist countries, and primarily of the Soviet Union, because without it there can be no agreement guaranteeing the just interests of the Arab peoples.\n149.\tThe fact that international reaction and the imperialist forces are on the move inevitably recalls the tragedy that overtook the people of Chile two years ago. The Chilean Fascist regime continues to keep thousands of patriots in prisons and concentration camps and continues to persecute the progressive forces. The Chilean people, however, continues its heroic struggle, in which it enjoys the support of the progressive forces and public opinion throughout the world.\n150.\tNor can we overlook the attempts that can be observed in other Latin American countries. Inter-national and internal reactionaries are plotting to bring about coups similar to the Fascist coup in Chile. Those attempts might dangerously aggravate the international situation, for the reactionary regimes resort precisely to an increase of international tension as a means of holding sway over their peoples.\n151.\tThe progressive forces of Latin America throw up great obstacles to the schemes of the reactionaries. The example of socialist Cuba and other countries of this continent which are pursuing a progressive policy makes their effect increasingly felt on the region of Latin America.\n152.\tThe Hungarian People's Republic has from the very outset supported the noble efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the peaceful reunification of that country. My Government demands the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea. It was in this spirit that, together with several other States, it requested the inclusion in the agenda of sub-item 119 (a) entitled \\\"Creation of favorable conditions for converting the armistice into a durable peace in Korea and accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of\nKorea\\\". Our delegation, as one of the sponsors of that proposal [AIIQ191 and Add.I-3), hopes that a significant majority of Member Slates will support the draft resolution and thereby contribute to the settlement of a problem which has long been ripe for solution.\n153.\tMy Government is of the opinion that conditions for the establishment of a collective security system in Asia are developing in parallel to the extension of detente. I am referring to this question mainly because 1 am convinced that the establishment of a collective security system in Asia would not only be fully in keeping with the endeavors of the peace-loving peoples of the Asian continent, bul would also contribute significantly to the consolidation of peace and security in general.\n154.\tThe socialist countries have long professed their conviction and given evidence of this conviction by putting forward initiatives and proposals that the economic advance or the developing countries and the reform of international economic relations on new and more equitable foundations are closely interrelated with the results achieved in consolidating peace and security. The gradual realization of the aspirations of developing countries mainly lies in changes in the international correlation or Forces and in the new realities that have emerged En the United Nations and in other international forums. An important stage in this process was marked at the seventh special session by the General Assembly, which, in the resolution adopted [resolution 3361 (S-VIlj] made a great stride forward in seeking the ways; and means of solutions.\n155.\tIt was 15 years ago that the United Nations adopted a Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. We are truly overjoyed to be able to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of this event with the attainment of independence by numerous colonial peoples.\n156.\tAllow me, on behalf of the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic, to welcome the newly admitted States Members of the United Nations: namely, the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, and the Republic of Cape Verde. My Government has not delayed to recognize these countries as independent and sovereign States. We are convinced that their participation in the work of the United Nations will serve the cause of progress and peace.\n157.\tIn voicing our pleasure and satisfaction over the progress made in the elimination of the colonial system, we must not forget that some monopolistic- capitalist circles are trying to slow down this process.\n158.\tIn Angola, heavy roadblocks continue to be built up on, the way to the country's independence and peaceful development. The intervention of Powers moved by neo-colonialist interests sows discard be-tween the liberation movements and brings fresh trials to the patriots struggling for the country's genuine independence.\n159.\tThe complete liberation of the African peoples cannot be prevented, even by the inhuman racist regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa. World public opinion is becoming evermore resolute in its demands that the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe be allowed\nto decide their own destiny and to become the real masters of their native lands.\n160.\tIn conformity with the relevant resolution of the General Assembly, my Government has transmitted to the Secretary-General its views regarding the revision of the Charter. We think that, although during the past 50 years substantial changes have taken place in the world, (he provisions of the Charter are still adequate to give effect to the aims and purposes of the United Nations. If in this area there have been, or probably still are, problems, the fault lies not with the Charter. Every Member State should pursue a line of policy consistent with the principles of the Charter, which we have all accepted.\n161.\tWe are firmly convinced that if the efforts to revise the Charter succeeded, the effectiveness of our Organization would be greatly weakened, whereas, by making better use of the possibilities offered by the Charter, we can enhance the efficiency and authority of our Organization.\n162.\tMy Government is likewise firmly convinced that the work of our Organization has become more effective in recent years. In this a major portion of the credit belongs to the Secretary-General, to whom I take this opportunity to convey the best wishes of my Government.\n163.\tIn conclusion. 1 can assure you. Mr. President, that the Hungarian delegation v,iH. at the present session of the General Assembly, also do everything in its power to ensure the successful outcome of the work of our deliberations.\n"

        "file_text": " Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to extend to you the warm congratulations of my Government and of the Greek delegation. Your election to the presidency of the General Assembly is undoubtedly a tribute to your eminent qualities as a statesman and also to your country, with which Greece is linked by traditional and fruitful friendship. Your vast experience of international affairs and your personal prestige will help us to tackle successfully the work of this thirtieth session.\n156.\tI am equally happy to express our appreciation of the lofty spirit and the great competence with which your predecessor, Mr. Bouteflika, conducted the work of the preceding session.\n157.\tWe should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General, Mr. Waldheim, both for the activities he is undertaking in the discharge of his responsible duties and for his tireless efforts, inspired by profound humanitarianism, to bring about a settlement of the Cyprus problem and to allay the immense human suffering on that island.\n158.\tFinally, we are pleased to welcome the admission to the United Nations of the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, new Members to which we address our warm congratulations and our sincere wishes for the prosperity of their peoples.\n159.\tThe period preceding this session of the General Assembly was one of the most rich and fertile in the field of international meetings, both at the world level and at the regional level. At the world level, I should like specifically to refer to the efforts that have been made to reinforce peace and security, as well as those designed to give expression and new impetus to solving the acute problems which confront the developing countries in particular at a stage in our history dominated by the rapid change in social, economic and political conditions.\n160.\tThis activity could profoundly change the framework of ideas within which we are used to living and lead us towards a more dynamic period characterized by the urgent search for a more satisfactory restructuring of our society.\n161.\tThe concept of the interdependence of nations is rooted in the minds and hearts of our peoples and engenders a feeling of solidarity among human beings which should henceforward serve as a basis for the political thinking of their leaders. Was not this interdependence abundantly affirmed during the work of the seventh special session of the General Assembly that has just finished its work? I conclude from its deliberations that the grand design of our Organization for the coming years must be the programming and implementation of a new world economic order. A step in that direction was taken when the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] was adopted and the program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-W)] was drawn up during the sixth special session of the General Assembly.\n162.\tUndoubtedly, in order to move towards this new economic order we shall have to display both courage and originality. Certain positive indications lead us to believe that this is, in fact, the wish of the international community. It is quite obvious that we have now passed the stage of preliminary studies and improvisations and are now getting to the heart of the problem namely, the revising and restructuring of the economic, trade, financial and monetary institutions in order to settle on a long-term basis the crisis which besets us.\n163.\tThis crisis, one of the salient features of which is the slowing-down of the rate of economic growth of developing countries, has thrown into relief, if there was need to do so, the gap separating the economically developed countries from the rest of the world.\n164.\tWhile there is no doubt that the causes of the present economic inequalities between States are rooted in the remote past, it is none the less true that there might be a risk of its increasing were we not resolved to take the necessary steps progressively to reduce the distance separating the levels of development of our peoples. These measures, which would obviously benefit the less wealthy peoples, would certainly also be profitable, if we consider their long- term effects, for the economically advanced countries, not only because such a policy is the best guarantee of peace but also because the progress of the industrialized countries depends on the capacity of the developing countries to purchase their products.\n165.\tHence it seems to us to be essential to mobilize our collective efforts to offset a crisis which is particularly damaging to the weakest, and to set up an international system which responds to the needs of the present international economic situation.\n166.\tPolitically speaking, it is appropriate to refer to the happy outcome of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The principles enunciated by the Conference at Helsinki are undoubtedly neither new nor original; they are to be found in the Charter of our Organization, which is already 30 years old. But there can be no doubt that the very fact that 35 States Members of the United Nations felt the need to reaffirm them in a solemn document is certainly not devoid of political importance. The message of Helsinki is one essentially of hope not only for Europe, an old continent sorely tried by the vicissitudes of history, but for mankind as a whole, because we have now promised that the principles of the Final Act will animate us in our relations with all the countries of the world.\n167.\tGreece, which made its own dynamic contribution to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, has left no stone unturned bilaterally to strengthen its ties and relationships with all countries, particularly its closest neighbors to the north and south.\n168.\tConcerning the development of relations between Greece and its neighbors to the north, I should like to emphasize how easy it is to promote co-operation among countries with different social, economic and political systems provided there is goodwill on both sides. I would even go so far as to say that relations between Greece and its northerly neighbors can already serve as an example and a precedent. They have given rise to a new initiative, this time on the multilateral level. In the spirit of Helsinki, the Prime Minister of Greece on 18 August proposed to other Balkan leaders that they convene at Athens an inter- Balkan conference to bring about co-operation in the fields of economy, transport, energy and the environment.\n169.\tIn the south, our relations with the Arab countries are based on a long common heritage which goes back to the very distant past. Hence our close links with the friendly Arab peoples. On this occasion I should like to reaffirm our position on the question of the Middle East namely, that any settlement, if it is to be fair and lasting, must be based on respect for and application of the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. Pursuant to the principle that the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible in international relations, Greece has always supported the evacuation of the occupied Arab territories and a solution that will guarantee the existence of all countries in that region and at the same time respect the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine. Consequently we support any effort at negotiation which would lead to a lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East in accordance with the above-mentioned principles.\n170.\tQuite naturally, another chapter in the foreign relations of Greece, which, thanks to the country's return to democracy, have made decisive and rapid progress, is that of the reactivation and consolidation of our relations with our friends and allies in Europe, those nations linked by the European ideal. We share that ideal because it is designed to serve the cause of peace and co-operation among peoples for the common good.\n171.\tIn contrast to the positive trends observed in our foreign relations, I am sorry to have to say that the question of Cyprus still bears all the marks of a human tragedy and of an acute crisis. Despite resolution 3212 (XXIX) which was passed by this Assembly, and those passed by the Security Council, despite the four successive stages marking the inter-communal talks under the personal sponsorship of the Secretary- General, and despite the constructive spirit which was displayed by the negotiator on behalf of the Greek Cypriot community, none of the essential aspects of the Cyprus problem has been properly solved. Thus, one third of the population of the island approximately 200,000 people are still refugees in their own country and are living far from their homes, contrary to all humanitarian principles, are deprived of their property and stripped of their goods in flagrant violation of the Charter. Furthermore, no progress has been achieved on the question of the withdrawal of foreign troops, so that 40 per cent of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus and 70 per cent of its economic resources remain under foreign military control and occupation, in the name of a community which does not exceed 18 per cent of the population. We are still faced with the fact that foreign troops still occupy a substantial part of the territory of an independent country, a Member of the United Nations and a member of the group of non-aligned countries.\n172.\tFurthermore, we have witnessed a series of faits accomplis, leading to the creation of irreversible situations, while the threat of other faits accomplis still hangs over this sorely tried island. I am quite certain that the General Assembly will agree with me that such methods do not result in peace but rather in the creation of explosive situations with which, unfortunately, Cyprus is all too familiar.\n173.\tThe Greek Government regrets that it is faced with such a situation at a time when it is inaugurating a policy of peace and concord with all its neighbors. We support the Secretary-General in his efforts to reach a peaceful solution, and we are also grateful to the large number of countries which have expressed their active interest in bringing peace to Cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations.\n174.\tI hope that my account of the main trends in our foreign policy makes it quite clear that Greece is devoted to the concept of the interdependence of nations, to the idea of their solidarity and their cooperation in a spirit of justice, peace and progress. At the same time, we are looking after our national security, desirous as we are of defending it against any pressure or threat.\n175.\tI shall now turn to some subjects of general interest which appear on the agenda of the present, session and on which I should like to express the position of my Government.\n176.\tThe problem of disarmament is essentially a dual one: it is eminently political because it is, after all, related to the security of nations; but it is also an economic problem, hence its influence on the life of our peoples. The stockpiling of nuclear and conventional weapons is in contradiction with the concept of international detente and the peoples' sense of security. It also represents an incalculable waste of the economic resources that are so sadly lacking in the developing countries, without even mentioning the general scarcity of natural resources which is such an ominous threat to all mankind. It is therefore logical that we should be quite definitely in favour of disarmament under international control and that we should regard this as an essential condition for the consolidation of world peace.\n177.\tIn connexion with the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, a prerequisite, we feel, for the reduction of armaments and later on for general disarmament, satisfactory and convincing assurances should be given to those countries not possessing nuclear weapons to persuade them that they have nothing to fear from voluntarily forgoing the possession of nuclear weapons. Practical steps should also be taken so that those countries which do not possess nuclear weapons can, on an equal footing and under the same economic and technological conditions, enjoy the benefits to be derived from the utilization of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\n178.\tRegarding the resources which would be liberated by the reduction of armaments, we share the view that these should as a matter of priority be used to finance the development of the countries which need it. In this connexion Greece supports the idea of the creation of practical machinery within the framework of the United Nations.\n179.\tFinally, we attach particular importance to strengthening the role of the United Nations in the maintenance and consolidation of international peace and security. Undoubtedly, up to now the United Nations has played a very positive role in preventing armed conflicts, particularly by localizing areas of confrontation and by keeping opposing sides apart, and it is my duty to emphasize especially my great appreciation of the way in which the United Nations Force has discharged its functions in Cyprus in circumstances which have been extremely difficult and sometimes extremely dangerous. But the role of the United Nations should not be simply a preventive one. The Charter contains provisions which, had they been implemented, would have endowed our Organization with the necessary means of imposing respect for its decisions and of protecting the international order from any infraction. I am referring particularly to those parts of the Charter which for the most part have remained a dead letter up to the present day. Of course, I am not unaware of the practical difficulties of a political and an economic nature which their application would encounter, But it must be said, on the other hand, that in international society, as in national societies, stability and security are essential conditions if there is to be any progress and any smooth and harmonious development. In the atmosphere of detente which prevails at present and which justly gratifies us today, has not the time now come to think about the complete application of the Charter? Mankind aspires to peace and tranquility. It is up to all of us not to dash its hopes and not to thwart its aspirations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t  It is with great pleasure, Mr, President, that I congratulate you on your assumption of office as President of this thirtieth session of the General Assembly of our Organization. I am confident that under your capable leadership we shall make further progress towards putting into practice those time honored principles which should inspire our discussions. I wish also to take this opportunity to thank your predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, for his guidance of our deliberations during the twenty- ninth session as well as the seventh special session.\n2.\tThe commitment of my Government and the people of Guyana to the advancement of the struggle for freedom everywhere is well known. But nowhere have we followed the tide of that struggle more closely, nowhere have we provided more of such assistance as we could muster than in Africa. It is therefore with a special sense of satisfaction and pride that we welcome into our Assembly the delegations of the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the People's Republic of Mozambique. At this time we also look forward confidently to the early admission of the new State of Papua New Guinea.\n3.\tIn welcoming these new States we must at the same time pledge our total support and that of the United Nations system to assist in the task of rebuilding and reconstructing their societies. As we who trod this path before know so well, the decolonization process is only the first phase. In the wake of victory comes added emphasis on economic liberation, cultural reaffirmation and psychological decolonization.\n4.\tMost of us have inherited economies which had been distorted or malformed economies based on a single crop or mineral, with enclaves organized as parts of the metropolitan country. Such infrastructure as existed was limited to that required to move a crop or mineral quickly to Western Europe or to keep a cheap source of labor barely alive. Indeed, we are still grappling with the ramifications of those problems.\n5.\tAs the institutions of the post-war international economic system have lost their legitimacy and their operational capacity, as we have come to see clearly that it is this system which has made us poor and has confined us to menial roles, it is inevitable that all the vital economic issues be increasingly politicized. There can be no turning back. As we utilize the instrument of our solidarity to create a new international economic order it becomes necessary that we build viable States, States which can secure for our peoples a fair share of the gains of the emerging global system. This viability requires the establishment at the national level of institutions for the mobilization of skills and savings. It requires the assertion of control over our natural resources. It requires the conscious creation of a relevant infrastructure. It requires the consolidation of a national identity, It requires vigilance against the sustained hostility of powerful transnational corporations, against the activities of subversive agencies of Governments for ever intent on the protection of investments which have for generations pillaged the wealth of developing countries.\n6.\tThe occasion for imperative change is made the occasion for instigating disorder and promoting discontent, for destabilizing Governments whose only fault is the resolute pursuit of nationally agreed objectives. In ways now all too familiar, the political and economic security of developing States, and especially small States, is undermined.\n7.\tIt must be a cause for concern that the United Nations system itself in some aspects supports subtle forms of intervention and penetration. While on the one hand our Organization provides a valuable and irreplaceable forum for the ventilation and resolution of conflicts, on the other hand it can and does lend itself to the exercise of pressures for the maintenance of the existing system of economic relations. It is well known that institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have withheld legitimate assistance or have imposed rules in the attempt to enforce acceptance of approaches to development which, were they allowed, would secure the continued dominance of some few States.\n8.\tAs we deliberate and debate during this thirtieth anniversary session we must resolve that the decision-making structures of the United Nations system, which are from time to time utilized to thwart change, are democratized and made more responsive to our objectives and our aspirations.\n9.\tBut much more is necessary. We must give consideration to the possible range of responses of this Organization to the activities of Governments which, claiming to be pursuing their national security, initiate measures which are designed to destabilize other Governments. Moreover, our Organization must increasingly acknowledge and support the legitimacy of the strategies and techniques of development which we deem necessary to meet the urgent expectations of our peoples in the developing world.\n10.\tIn this context, the consolidation of the developing world, which has been initiated and advanced by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Group of 77, should be seen as an arrangement, not for confrontation, but for the enrichment of the whole human community, a community of States each contributing to our planetary heritage special resources of experience, talent and wealth. It should be one of our priorities to give further meaning and deeper content to that solidarity through measures such as schemes for the promotion of the regular exchange of news and information among developing countries, the institution of forms of regional security such as zones of peace and the support of programs of economic co-operation among developing countries.\n11.\tThe seventh special session, devoted to development and international economic co-operation, is now behind us. Meeting as we do immediately after that session we have a responsibility to assess its results objectively, analyze its decisions and determine its significance for future developments in international economic relations. We must seek to place the session in its historical perspective.\n12.\tGuyana acknowledges that the special session has served to advance the dialog on the establishment of a new international economic order. The measures proposed in the field of trade, transfer of resources, industrialization, science and technology and food and agriculture will, if implemented, represent positive gains since they are designed to eliminate some of the more glaring inequalities in the international economic system. Because of the unanimous adoption of the final resolution, the session has been hailed as an important turning point in the attitude of the developed countries to crucial issues of development. Its results have been seen by some as the inauguration of a new era of accommodation and understanding between developed and developing countries.\n13.\tBut can we dare hope that a new direction has in fact been charted? Can we dare hope that we are embarked on a novel and challenging course? While we are prepared to keep an open mind on the question, while we are content not to prejudge the issue, there is the possibility that, notwithstanding expressions of commitment, notwithstanding professions of good faith, we may well fail to achieve the objectives we seek so earnestly. It may be that we shall be offered weak substitutes, where nothing but radical remedies will suffice, We must not forget that the annals of this Assembly are filled with noble resolutions, grandiloquent statements, gestures in the grand manner, but that in many cases these remain mere paper pledges, rarely honored, seldom fulfilled.\n14.\tOur political commitment will be judged by our willingness to translate principle into action. As we set out to implement the measures we have agreed upon, let us hope that the way forward will not be impeded by obstacles which seem to appear at every conceivable turn, obstacles engineered by those who only recently helped to engender consensus.\n15.\tMoreover, we must not assume that the declared acceptance of some of the principles for which we in the developing world have fought has put an end to the debate. Concepts have been acknowledged; commitments have been expressed; good intentions have been declared; but our full demands have not yet been met. The struggle must therefore continue unabated until the developing world achieves the legitimate objective of a just and equitable international economic order.\n16.\tAs I stated in this Assembly at the seventh special session, while compromise can provide a basis for consensus, compromise is not an acceptable objective if it sacrifices essential principles or militates against just and equitable solutions. This is where we in the developing world stand. This is the principle upon which we act.\n17.\tThe prospects for lasting peace in the Middle East begin and end with the rights of the Palestinian people. For their struggle is an integral part of the liberation struggle throughout the world. This area, the ancient cradle of so many cultures and religions, is today the arena in which is being played out the competition and conflict of the interests of major Powers, Powers which are intent on supporting the expansionist aims of Zionism, or securing the control of communications or of energy resources.\n18.\tIn the welter of such turbulence we must continue to insist that the foremost responsibility of the international community in this area is the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people.\n19.\tAt the same time we welcome the recent agreement which has been negotiated, the first agreement not spawned in the immediate wake of armed conflict. It may be that such gradualist approaches can lead to an ultimate peace. I sincerely hope so. Such a peace must be founded on an acceptable solution to the Palestinian problem and on an Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied by force.\n20.\tThe situation in Cyprus has deteriorated following the breakdown of the talks between the two communities. This is a tragic turn of events; for peace in Cyprus will only come about through arrangements reached, without duress, between the two communities themselves. The history of Cyprus and the relationship which the two communities have with mainland States make for a complex and difficult problem. It was in appreciation of this background that the General Assembly, in resolution 3212 (XXIX), established a balanced set of principles which Guyana firmly believes can serve as a framework leading to a final settlement. That resolution was adopted unanimously by the General Assembly. It was accepted by all the parties concerned.\n21.\tThe inter-communal talks were only one aspect of that arrangement and it is a matter of regret to my Government that the other requirements of that resolution have so far not been carried out. In particular, very little progress has been made in the resettlement of refugees. There has been no progress at all in the withdrawal of foreign troops from that unhappy land. It is important that the guarantor nations recognize that a settlement in Cyprus cannot be imposed from above if it is to be permanent and that the two communities must be left free to conclude a mutually acceptable agreement. The history of our times suggests that a political settlement will have no chance of survival if it is dictated by one side possessing military advantage. Guyana, for its part, remains opposed to policies based on aggression and nourished by intervention.\n22.\tGuyana follows with keen interest the struggle for independence of the people of East Timor. We have always upheld the policy that all peoples should be given the opportunity to chart their own course for development without external interference of any sort. In this respect, we support the liberation movement in East Timor. We call upon those forces which may wish to intervene in an attempt to redirect the course chosen by the East Timorese to desist from any activity which would violate the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination.\n23.\tWe live in an era in which the United Nations has recognized the right of all peoples to self-determination and independence. This period has seen the emergence of many newly independent countries which have over the years, with increasing vigor, asserted their own unique identity on the international stage. Within this hemisphere, a new community of independent nations has arisen to join the Latin American republics with their proud revolutionary traditions. There has been an increasing consciousness of regional identity. There has been an almost unanimous rejection of all forms of colonialism and exploitation.\n24.\tIt is therefore paradoxical that an anomalous situation exists in Latin America running counter to the aspirations of colonial peoples for independence and for the beginning of genuine economic development. I refer to the question of Belize, a country forced against its will to retain a colonial status it despises and repudiates, because of the bellicose threats against its territorial integrity made by one of its neighbors, which happens also to be a fellow developing country. The territorial claims that have been made on Belize have no justification whatever. They are rejected by the people of Belize, to a man, whose only desire is the attainment of the full independence of their country.\n25.\tFor over 10 years, the people of Belize have seen their yearnings for independence frustrated because of the spurious and absurd territorial claims of a neighbor whose friendship they seek but whose over lordship they emphatically reject. Guyana calls on the international community to set aside indifference, to identify itself uncompromisingly and unequivocally with the people of Belize struggling for independence and the preservation of their territorial integrity. Belize must be allowed to be free.\n26.\tThe dynamics of change in Latin America, \\\"stimulated by developments at both the national and the international level, have resulted in the creation of new institutions. They have also led to the reform of others which have long been resistant to change. The creation of the Latin American Economic System is designed to provide a forum in which the nations of the continent can meet and resolve their problems among themselves and meet free from super-Power influence and domination. Guyana therefore fully supports the aims of that system. It has the potential to become an effective instrument for development in the region. It nurtures possibilities of overdue reform.\n27.\tThere has been an increasing democratization of international relations. It has become clear that hemispheric relations must be based on the fundamental right of every State to participate unconditionally in hemispheric institutions. Every State has a right to exercise its sovereign equality in such institutions. We therefore welcome the recent action taken to effect reforms in the structure of the Organization of American States [04SJ. Nevertheless it is our duty to point out that these reforms do not go sufficiently far in transforming OAS into an institution consistent with the needs of the developing countries of the region. Locked in the interstices of structure and procedure are the seeds of disadvantage and inequality. These need to be removed.\n28.\tHistory is replete with considered apercus on the need for disarmament. Those who at various times held the preponderance of power have always been the most reluctant to disarm. The Romans used to say that if you shorten your spears you lengthen your frontiers. Conversely, those who have found themselves inferior in technical apparatus have always been the most vocal in calling for disarmament. It is ridiculous, to my mind, to cultivate the acquisition of an arsenal one dares not use. But, then, the muses of trade and of comedy are the same. The strategic strait-jacket in which we now find ourselves is not removed by references to theories of limited warfare, be they nuclear or otherwise.\n29.\tThis world Organization can no longer leave discussions on disarmament to be held in secluded forums. The time has come for us to decide on a date for the holding of a world conference on disarmament or, alternatively, a special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on disarmament. We must not be deterred by the fact that the failure of the old League of Nations was its failure to deal with disarmament. The majority of mankind was not represented in that institution. In any case, that failure should inspire us to new and sustained endeavor.\n30.\tFor developing countries, the daily tribulation is the diversion of resources which might otherwise be used to assist development. The awful, tragic waste in the sciences of deterrence and destruction exhibits the nadir of human purpose. The demands on men, money and material, on time and energy, represent a catastrophic limitation on the possibilities of man.\n31.\tOver the 30-year period in which our Assembly has been meeting the attitudes to non-alignment have shifted from indifference and disrespect to growing understanding and support. We must now acknowledge and put on record in this Assembly some of its major achievements.\n32.\tIt is non-alignment that has fostered acceptance of the principle of coexistence, the principle that differences in social and economic systems or in ideologies should not preclude international co-operation on the basis of equality.\n33.\tIt is non-alignment that has sustained and guided the most profoundly transforming global process of all time, namely the movement of decolonization and liberation.\n34.\tIt was non-alignment, with its insistence on the sovereign right of States to pursue independent policies free from the pressures of bloc entanglements, that significantly defused the conflicts that once threatened mankind with a global holocaust.\n35.\tAnd let us not forget that it is the non-aligned movement that has ensured that this Organization, which began as a victors' club to police the boundaries of an uneasy peace, has developed into a body whose operations are increasingly informed by the perception that peace and security are inextricably interwoven with economic development and economic security.\n36.\tIt is non-aligned solidarity coupled with that countervailing power which is derived from programs of collective self-reliance and economic cooperation, it is non-aligned persistence and insistence that have made it possible to begin work on the creation of a new international economic order.\n37.\tWe must not let slip our guard. Among the superPowers it seems that confrontation has given way to consultation and that there is the thin veneer of detente. Whatever the propagandist rationalizations, it is certain that we are dealing with the same old Adam. Competition and rivalry on land and sea continue to threaten the stability of States. Old techniques of encirclement and envelopment, of penetration, of subversion and of destabilization remain the order of the day. Hegemonic policies persist. The pursuit of client States remains a domestic imperative.\n38.\tNever has there been a greater need for the principles of non-alignment. Those of us who have been forced to cling giddily to the rim of the revolving earth must continue our efforts to banish terror from the dictionary of international affairs. We must not let the history of the last quarter of the twentieth century become the monopoly of two or three States. We must not let the technological advances of man become a trap for his extinction or a force for his dehumanization.\n39.\tIn southern Africa, where racism has been built' up into a conscious political ethos, my Government remains un-waving in its denunciation of apartheid and white-minority rule. The herding of great masses of the population into bantustans, the practice of a scheme of influx control, the promotion of tribal rivalry, all designed to produce a cheap source of labor and to underscore the exploitation of man by man, are facts which my Government finds utterly repugnant. The strategies outlined in the Lusaka Manifesto of 1969 and the Dar es Salaam Declaration of 1975 have produced significant success. The Lisbon- Salisbury-Pretoria axis has been shattered. The enemy has been isolated. The high priests of racism are being dealt with one by one. Portuguese colonialism in Africa is fast being relegated to the footnotes of history. The way ahead is clear. Victory is assured.\n40.\tHaving crossed his Rubicon in 1965 by a unilateral declaration of independence, the rebel leader Ian Smith has now had to face up to the political realities of the continent, and justice, which limped behind him for 10 years, has finally cornered him in Zimbabwe.\n41.\tGuyana supports the new moves and contacts in southern Africa, moves designed to augment the use of force and the threat of force as instruments of redress for the grievances of the majority. It is very tempting for some who are far removed from the- battlefield and who suffer no casualties to be plus royaliste que le roi and to indulge in the unworthy and ignominious exercise of the impugnment of motives and judgment. Guyana has unwavering confidence in the judgment of those four Titans of the Zambezi  Botswana, Mozambique, Zambia and the United Republic of Tanzania which have sought to establish that peace hath its victories no less renowned than war.\n42.\tIn the after light men will applaud the unswerving determination and honesty of purpose of those who struggled through the dark days until their hopes were sustained by the triumphs in Mozambique.\n43.\tWith South Africa as its neighbor an emergent Zimbabwe will inherit problems which will tax the strength of its political institutions and the cultural cohesion of the Shona and the Nbele people. Accommodations must be made so that the unity which is symbolized in the African National Congress grows from strength to strength. We support the valiant fighters of Zimbabwe in their struggle and we entertain no doubt that they will grasp the chalice of opportunity and so quaff of its contents that white minority rule will vanish from Zimbabwe, and vanish in the immediate future.\n44.\tIn Angola a fierce power struggle continues,  fanned by big Power rivalry and the machinations of trans nationals. Guyana adheres strongly to the view that the people of Angola must be left alone to pursue their own destiny. The achievement of political freedom must not further be stained and tarnished by the blood of those who aspire to such freedom. Unity is the essential imperative. From this all else flows. The birth pangs of Angola have been sufficiently painful and poignant. We entertain every hope that the resultant offspring will take its place in the family of nations and make its contribution to the onward march of man, as one entity resolved and resolute.\n45.\tIn Namibia the illegal occupation persists. The attempts to exclude the South West Africa People's Organization [,SWAPO] from the task of restructuring the future of the Territory must be boldly condemned. SWAPO is the legitimate representative of the people of Namibia. This is an irreversible political fact. There are some who hold that movement of any kind in southern Africa is a sign of progress. This is a view which my Government and my delegation cannot entertain. If the South African regime wishes to show that its present strategies are bona fide it should exhibit a greater awareness of the power of international opinion and should show itself to be more responsive to the criticisms which have found expression in the numerous resolutions of the United Nations and other organizations.\n46.\tThe final victory is in sight; but there will forever be pockets of resistance, lagers of repression which would seek to stem the onrushing tide. It is our clear duty to sustain the momentum which has brought us thus far. It is our clear duty to renew our dedication to the principles of the Charter. It is our clear duty to reassert that we shall never cease to oppose all vestiges of apartheid, racism and colonialism, whether in southern Africa or elsewhere.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff184.\t  Mr. President, it is part of a nice tradition at the opening of each session to extend warm congratulations and expressions of support to the President elected by the General Assembly. I should be failing in my duty if I did not join the voice of the delegation of Rwanda to the chorus of praise addressed to you. The honor falls upon me today to express to you on behalf of my delegation our very high esteem and to assure you that we shall contribute fully to the total success of the present session. I do so not out of habit or because of a feeling of conformity but because of the wise choice which conferred upon you the presidency of this session of the Assembly. Your outstanding qualities as a politician and a diplomat of experience warrant the almost unanimous trust which does honor not only to you but also to your country. We are certain that your perspicacity and experience will help each of us to make the fullest and most loyal contribution to the common cause. Our joy is all the greater since there exist between the Republic of Rwanda and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ties of fruitful friendship, rendered especially valuable to us by long years of co-operation and prospects of such co-operation in the future. I take this opportunity to reiterate through you to the Government and people\nof Luxembourg the appreciation of the people of Rwanda of the great contribution made to it in support of its development efforts.\n185.\tMajor-General Habyarimana, the President of the Republic of Rwanda, President-Founder of the National Revolutionary Movement for Development, and President of the Committee for National Peace and Unity, never ceases to tell our nation that Rwanda must rely for its development first of all on the efforts of its own sons and daughters. Nevertheless, in this world, which we should like to see united and with its economies complementing each other, the assistance of friendly countries is not only welcome but also obviously necessary to enable Rwanda to make rapid advances on the road to progress.\n186.\t] should like also to pay a warm tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, President of the twenty-ninth session and the seventh special session of the General Assembly, for his very high sense of responsibility. It is very difficult to find sufficiently eloquent words to describe the manner in which he discharged his lofty mission. At both sessions he never ceased to make the fullest contribution to the cause of the United Nations, firmly convinced, as we all should be, that the future of our Organization cannot be conceived of without a just peace and the equitable distribution of the wealth of our planet. His well known dynamism and his clear sightedness do honor to the United Nations and to Africa. I congratulate him with emotion and I hope that his example will long continue.\n187.\tI am very happy to reiterate the full confidence of the Government of Rwanda in the Secretary-General. My Government is happy to see the responsibility and competence with which he carries out his noble mission. We follow with interest and satisfaction the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General to make of our Organization an effective and dynamic instrument in the service of peace, of the dignity of the human person and the well-being of all peoples. His many trips to Europe, Asia, America and Africa bear witness to his constant concern to assume, in addition to his daily functions, all his burdensome international responsibilities. We extend to him our very warmest appreciation.\n188.\tIt is a particular pleasure for me to welcome Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe, the Cape Verde Islands and very soon Angola, into the family of the United Nations. The warm welcome we extend to them is as intense as the joy we feel in finding ourselves amongst brothers and friends after so many years of struggle for the national independence and the liberation of Africa. That struggle is known to all of us and many of us know its price. We extend our sincere congratulations to all those who have resolutely and with devotion committed themselves to the defence of their inalienable rights to self-determination and independence. To all those martyrs, to all our heroes of today and of yesterday, I should like, at the beginning of my statement, to pay a solemn tribute which I know is not only mine but also that of the unanimous African peoples.\n189.\tThe independence and the admission to the world Organization of the sister States which I have just mentioned is a source of great satisfaction to us.\nWe have reason to be pleased at the happy changes in Portugal and the abolition of the pernicious regime of Salazar and Caetano. Regrettably there are still unjust and oppressive Governments which threaten innocent populations with the holocaust of war and the specter of death.\n190.\tThe humiliation and the frustration inflicted on the people of Zimbabwe by a handful of white colonialists, to which the United Kingdom has remained indifferent, the regime of apartheid in South Africa, the illegal establishment of the regime of Pretoria in Namibia, and the fratricidal struggles in Angola on the eve of independence, the still explosive situation in the Middle East, the misery and desolation left behind in Indo-China after long years of unlawful war: these are matters of pressing concern to us.\n191.\tI already had occasion to state on all these problems the position of my Government which is reflected in our determination to work for the maintenance of international peace and security, for the development of friendly relations and relations of cooperation based on the principles of equality, mutual respect, economic relations based on the acknowledgment of the legitimate rights of all the parties concerned and finally for the necessary solidarity among all nations.\n192.\tThe Government of Rwanda will continue, under the enlightened guidance of its Chief, Major-General Habyarimana, President of the Republic of Rwanda, President-Founder of the National Revolutionary Movement for Development and President of the Committee for Peace and National Unity, to draw inspiration from those principles. Our domestic and foreign policy, in particular with regard to our friends and neighbors, will always be made to serve the goals of our Organization. Indeed, we consider that the commitment of all nations to that ideal is the only way to secure happiness and prosperity for all peoples.\n193.\tAn over-all view of the international situation and more particularly of the questions before us at this session clearly shows that, although there are positive results in some areas, in others the situation remains disquieting, not to say disastrous.\n194.\tIn Africa we registered with relief the practical measures taken by the new Portuguese regime in favor of decolonization. None the less, we deplore the deterioration of the situation in Angola at a time when the eradication of colonialism and the struggle against racism are entering their most decisive phase. The information we have about that sister State is in no way reassuring. In fact, scenes of violence and fratricidal struggles lead to bloodshed and tears. Negotiations to put a final end to the fighting are difficult to the extent that it is not always easy to find common ground for understanding when foreign or outside influences play a role of hegemony which has been wisely and patiently prepared.\n195.\tYet, it is our duty to warn the leaders of the liberation movements against any threat of explosion on their territory. A civil war could only be a delaying factor for them and it could also be damaging to the development of the nation and a threat to international peace and security. Therefore, they must overcome all contradictions and divisions created and inflamed by those bent on the destruction of Africa, and become\naware of the need to find democratic and peaceful solutions, the only ones that can open prospects for the peaceful future of the territory and the security of the continent as a whole.\n196.\tOwing to the goodwill shown by the Portuguese Government, we hope that Lisbon will keep to its commitments to the very end and grant independence to all the colonies in the best possible conditions.\n197.\tIn Rhodesia, the diplomatic and political combat waged for more than 10 years appears to us, if not useless, at least ineffective. Some like to think that the United Kingdom and its racist allies in Southern Rhodesia will arrive at a better understanding of the legitimate claims of the people of Zimbabwe. The experience acquired after long years of struggle has sufficiently shown that our Organization is facing a dialog of the deaf. In effect, instead of liberating 5 million men from the Rhodesian rebellion, the United Kingdom gives its financial and military support to Ian Smith against the people of Zimbabwe, who are inspired only by their faith and their rights against subjugation by a racist minority.\n198.\tOur Organization none the less has always hoped that the United Kingdom, which was the first State to sign the Charter of the United Nations after a violent war to liberate itself from Nazism, would feel honor bound to put down the Rhodesian rebellion, which is an outrageous affront not only to Her Majesty's Government, but to mankind as a whole.\n199.\tYear after year we face in South Africa the same mocking cynicism fomented by the same accomplices of the regime of Pretoria and Salisbury. A handful of voracious tyrants imposes terror and horrendous discrimination for too long for anyone to remain indifferent. Mass executions, assassinations and killings, imprisonments without trial, racist oppression of all types of which the Africans are victims, constitute the daily spectacle of Vorster.\n200.\tHow much longer will the world remain indifferent to the cries of anguish from so many millions of people? Vorster himself and his blood-thirsty clique distinguish themselves in Namibia by a savage repression of the only liberation movement SWAPO. And yet our Organization drove away that usurper from the Territory on the very day when Namibia was declared under the control of the United Nations Council for Namibia.\n201.\tThe Pretoria regime continues to disregard the unanimous will of the Members of our Organization and remains on that Territory to perpetuate its shameful policy of bantustans. In the meantime the world agrees in saying \\\"Namibia should become free with its territory intact\\\" while Pretoria stubbornly Balkanizes it and maintains its hegemony there. We have repeatedly condemned Vorster's regime. Resolutions and measures have been adopted to this effect, and each year we return to this forum to deplore the same horrors of apartheid, much to the amusement of the Pretoria representatives. Will the Organization capitulate to persistent provocations by Vorster? Will it ultimately declare an admission of failure in the face of that monster whose only equal was Hitler? All States must collectively and jointly seek definitive peaceful solutions, including the expulsion of South Africa from the Organization, in order to settle the problems\nof apartheid and racial discrimination, with which we are faced anew each year. Otherwise we shall have failed in abiding by all the good principles which should inspire us and which form the very basis of our Charter.\n202.\tAlthough the explosive situation in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia has received our attention because of the political immorality which prevails in that part of the world, the fate of other territories under colonial domination is equally deserving of our attention.\n203.\tFor some time now the United Kingdom has led us to believe that it would grant independence to Seychelles in 1975. The year is coming to an end but no practical step has been taken to that effect. Following the rather flexible yet sufficiently precise timetable given by the Government of the United Kingdom, it was supposed to grant independence in 1975. It is to be feared that the interests concerned with the military bases and foreign fleets are delaying the process of accession by that territory to its national sovereignty. This international forum should insist on the complete liberation of the Seychelles.\n204.\tWith respect to the Comoros, we welcome with satisfaction the proclamation of that Territory's independence. Difficulties persist, but we hope that the new independent State will settle its problems in full sovereignty without outside pressure or interference.\n205.\tThe case of the Sahara under Spanish domination has been submitted to the International Court of Justice. It is therefore desirable for the parties involved to refrain from any unilateral action while waiting for the Court to take a decision, and my delegation hopes that this will take place as soon as possible since any delay could only lead to disorder and contempt of justice. We honestly hope that peaceful solutions will soon be worked out in order to settle this dispute.\n206.\tIn the case of the Middle East, the reopening of the Suez Canal to international traffic, the unconditional reduction of Israeli forces in the vicinity of the Canal and the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations forces in charge of disengagement on the Syrian-Israeli front, have created a climate which favors the continuation of negotiations. However, my Government is pleased; with the recent agreement concluded between Israel and Egypt on the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Sinai and the Egyptian oilfields  thanks to the very praiseworthy efforts of the Government of the United States. Similar measures must be found in order to arrive at a just peace settlement which will take account of the interests of all concerned. In that connexion, withdrawal from the territories illegally occupied by Israel, respect for the right of the Palestinian people to dispose of their territory, mutual recognition and the security of the borders of all States of the region, including Israel, constitute prerequisites for a stable peace, an essential condition for fruitful co-operation between Israel and its neighbors. None the less, my delegation must condemn the attitude of Israel, which continues to flout the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations. In our view Israel's behavior constitutes a grave threat to international peace and security.\n207.\tThat is why, in the opinion of my delegation all the measures taken against Israel by the United\nNations should be not relaxed, but rather strengthened. Israel must finally understand that its behavior is intolerable, that its place among those who work for peace, justice and freedom in the world can only be justified today by the hope of all those who believe that if the United Nations shows itself firm and persevering, Israel will end up by understanding the value of the rules of international law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and will abide by them.\n208.\tThese are our views within the framework of the policy which my Government has followed concerning the Middle East.\n209.\tThe internal logic of the conflict in Cyprus leads us to stress that, without foreign armed intervention, without strategic interests on the part of certain Powers and without aims for annexation by the parties on the territory of Cyprus, the two communities should be able to find peaceful solutions to their specific problems. Outside interference should resolutely be eliminated from that territory if we wish to achieve consistent and stable solutions.\n210.\tMy delegation keenly regrets that the new axis in the struggle for influence in South-East Asia is slowly but surely moving towards South Korea. As we have said many times, it is up to the Korean people to take a sovereign decision on its reunification and freely to work out its destiny. To achieve that, first of all foreign troops must unconditionally leave South Korea, and contacts between the interested parties must be resumed.\n211.\tIs there any need to recall that the admission of Korea to our Organization should also be seen from the standpoint of a single representation for the whole Korean people without any division of any kind?\n212.\tIn Indo-China the war has for many years inflicted cruel suffering on the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples. We can only be happy that it has come to an end notwithstanding the aftermath and we hope that the brave Vietnamese people, which freed itself from foreign aggression, will come to occupy the seat which belongs to it in the family of free nations. I greet with enthusiasm the liberation of those peoples and ] encourage them to address themselves with as much determination as they had during that memorable war to national reconstruction, in peace, order and security both domestic as well as external.\n213.\tIn addition, it would be neither moral nor right for the major Powers involved to shirk their responsibilities now that it is necessary to reconstruct those countries which were so harshly struck. This is why we still think that all the States involved should be able to overcome feelings of disappointment and rancor in order to assist those peoples who were the victims of the longest war in modern times. It is in that context that the Government of Rwanda gives its firm support to the appeal of the Secretary-General to provide humanitarian assistance to Indo-China. We look forward to a generous response on the part of all, particularly the wealthier countries.\n214.\tThe Government of Rwanda appreciated the speedy and important action of many Governments and international organizations which gave assistance to victims of drought, famine and other natural disasters. My country was among those which received\nthe benefit of that assistance, and we reiterate our appreciation to all those who gave us their kind attention during those difficult times of want.\n215.\tWith regard to disarmament, we encourage the efforts of our Organization and the attempts of the major Powers to arrive at an international agreement to limit the armaments race. Indeed we feel that the enormous sums devoted to research and to the creation of destructive weapons would have far more appreciable results if they were put to the service of development and peace. We think that it is rather the moral view of the world that should be taken into account and not the ambition of keeping the world on its knees because some countries have enormous means of destruction,\n216.\tThe modern world needs peace and happiness. Those savage believers in Julius Caesar's precept that, if you want peace, you must prepare for war must understand that 20 centuries of effort towards friendship and co-operation among nations accuse and condemn them. It is indeed folly to speak of peace while manufacturing guns. That is why my delegation categorically condemns the arms race, and particularly the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n217.\tWe remain convinced that the world will not find salvation by striving to eliminate an excess of population, but rather by trying to make all men productive, without any discrimination whatsoever.\n218.\tRecent years have witnessed the adoption of many provisions, both national and international, which in varying degrees show that there is an awareness of the imperative need to ensure greater social justice and in particular better social conditions for women.\n219.\tInternational Women's Year, 1975, was greeted by statements by Heads of State, legislative measures by many Governments, seminars, conferences, lectures and many other public celebrations.\n220.\tAll those activities and measures showed in a striking fashion the timeliness of stressing particularly respect for the fundamental rights of women, who are equal but also complementary to men.\n221.\tAt a time when nations need all their living forces in all areas, it is necessary to renounce prejudice and exclusivity.\n222.\tWomen must be effectively and fully integrated in the process of development so that they may contribute to the group to which they belong their share of activities and prosperity.\n223.\t\\\"If by her nature woman is intended to be a. mother, she is also an educator. The major part\\\", Alexandre Vinet said, \\\"and the most decisive part in the education of both sexes is in the hands of women. A great power has been given to them. To withdraw it from their hands is impossible.\\\"\n224.\tIt is therefore understandable that the role of women in our society can be neither underestimated nor ignored. That is why we cannot remain indifferent in the face of the urgent need to ensure equal rights, possibilities and responsibilities for men and women.\n225 We express our very warm feelings of sympathetic understanding of the efforts made by our Organization to ensure the integration of women in political, economic and cultural life.\n226.\tIt is now a question of bringing about a just restructuring of relations between industrialized and developing countries.\n227.\tBefore entering into the substance of the subject, I should like to express my satisfaction at the setting in motion and development of Arab-African cooperation. Recently we have witnessed the efforts which the Arab countries have made to assist other developing countries.\n228.\tWe hope that this example will become more widespread and will serve as an incentive to the wealthy countries to help the least favored nations. We also hope that other measures will be taken to give new and original scope to ever-changing international co-operation.\n229.\tWhat is the position today? By means of a permanent dialog the major Powers, which yesterday were divided into two antagonistic blocs, have little by little changed from a long cold war to move towards the climate of detente which is essential for the achievement of fruitful co-operation based on mutual respect.\n230.\tThe countries of the third world, which for a long time were exploited by the colonial Powers, became poorer and poorer because of the pillage and waste of their natural resources through a shameless policy of exploitation by those Powers, which became wealthy beyond measure and today eiyoy scandalous opulence, while three quarters of mankind stagnate in the most sordid misery.\n231.\tThe sixth special session of the Assembly, having established that certain States of the third world were on the very edge of the precipice because of the present world economic crisis, appealed to the rich countries to assist them in their distress.\n232.\tThat appeal was more or less heeded by those who still feel compassion for human misery, but the assistance provided was very far from what the hungry expected of international solidarity. Furthermore, the promised assistance was not given in time to those countries which needed it.\n233.\tSuch indifference in the face of those blatant inequalities among members of the same community constitutes an international moral crisis. And yet it is that international morality which links us and in whose name we preach this dialog which invites us to achieve without delay that common instrument of our future, the new international economic order based on justice, fairness and equality.\n234.\tWe were happy to see that throughout the work of the seventh special session, the parties involved and I am speaking of the industrialized countries and the countries of the third world  attempted to find points of convergence rather than of divergence.\n235.\tIt was therefore with true satisfaction that my delegation welcomed the unanimous adoption of resolution 3362 (S-VII) and its annexes by the General Assembly.\n236.\tIt is true that the road is long from words to deeds but, since the political will to act which previously was always lacking in our various meetings\nseems to have become manifest in that historic session, there are grounds for believing that a great step forward has been taken towards a change of attitude and that we are coming closer to the objectives of the Charter of our Organization.\n237.\tIs not this the very meaning of the existence of our Organization?\n238.\tThose wars which caused such unspeakable suffering originated in a poor distribution of the wealth of our planet. The United Nations, which was born of the ruins of one of those wars in order to prevent new scourges of that type which would create bad relations between rich and poor, should favor the development of that new international economic order.\n239.\tThe preamble to the Charter states:\n\\\"We the peoples of the United Nations determined\n\\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and\n\\\"to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and\n\\\"to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and\n\\\"to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, . . .\\\"\n240.\tIn quoting the Preamble of the Charter, I want to point out that even those countries which were not represented on that historic occasion and I mean countries of the third world in general and those of Africa in particular subscribed to the Charter when they were admitted to the United Nations.\n241.\tFurthermore, desirous of faithfully and fully discharging their obligations to the community and to promote the great ideals of this Organization, the countries of the third world, grouped in the great non-aligned movement, intend to play a major role in international relations.\n242.\tIn requesting the revision of the Charter to adjust it to the imperative needs and realities of our time, the countries of the third world, more concerned than others in the settlement of certain problems, such as colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, Zionism, racial discrimination and apartheid, of which they are frequently victims, wish to see a Charter that will be a code of conduct for all States in their international relations, and not a collection of privileges for those same Powers of yesterday.\n243.\tIn requesting the establishment of a new international economic order based on equality, fairness, independence and justice, the countries of the third world wish to translate into deeds the feelings which inspired the illustrious authors of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n244.\tIn that connexion, the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, adopted by consensus on 1 May 1974 by the General Assembly, are an eloquent illustration of that concern.\n245.\tThe unity which has characterized the attitude of the delegations of the non-aligned Member States is not a dictatorship by the majority, as some would have had public opinion think, but a real growth of awareness on the part of the majority of our Organization, which wishes to put an end to the economic disorder which stems from an anachronistic and obsolete economic order.\n246.\tThe countries of the third world, therefore, invite their partners, the developed countries, to examine calmly the proposals made to them in all honesty and objectivity in an effort to do away forever with that evil which afflicts both poor and rich alike.\n247.\tMy delegation welcomes the initiative taken by the President of France, Mr. Valery Giscard d'Estaing, to organize an international conference to deal with energy and other raw materials. This willingness to talk and to have a dialog, which is a constant element in the foreign policy of France, meets with the approval of most of us. If the preparatory conference did not succeed, the responsibility is that of those who always want to have their way. My delegation remains convinced that the obstacles of a psychological nature will be overcome and that that conference will finally take place. The interests of all, and the very survival of mankind, are at stake. It is regrettable that, since the third world made its voice heard to demand the establishment of a new international economic order, we find, at international conferences organized for that purpose, attitudes which are not constructive or which are merely negative on the part of certain Powers, and those not the least among them.\n248.\tThose attitudes which sometimes are accompanied by threats to use force, in order to take over the resources of others, are all the more regrettable in view of the fact that proposals of the third world conceal nothing that could in any way injure their rights or status as great Powers. The aim of the various proposals and declarations is simply the orderly development of the third world and the continued growth of the industrialized countries, thanks to the advantageous prices of raw materials to be established by common agreement,\n249.\tThe delegation of Rwanda thinks that the time has come to find an equitable solution to the very thorny problem of a reform of the international monetary system, whose ineffectiveness no longer needs to be demonstrated. To that end, we believe that only a Program of sincere co-operation among peoples can do away with the flagrant inequalities that exist today among rich and poor.\n250.\tThat is why we reiterate here our faith in the world Organization, which is a place where we can exchange and enrich our experience, the variety of which will lead all of us to feel, even more strongly than before, the need for solidarity.\n251.\tMy delegation expresses the wish that the urgent appeal made in this forum by the third world will be favorably received by the well-to-do countries which fn fact do have the magic key to the problem which affects us: namely, the problem of the fatal abyss which separates the rich and the poor on our planet.\n252.\tThe Republic of Rwanda, for its part, is happy to proclaim once again its faith in our Organization\nand its willingness to contribute to the improvement of relations among men.\n"

        "file_text": "the major Powers. With the emergence of scores of new, independent States, world economic and political relations have become increasingly complex and interdependent. Throughout these three decades, as its membership has nearly tripled, the United Nations has undertaken enlarged responsibilities on behalf of mankind, becoming more vital than at its inception and, indeed, indispensable.\n29.\tThrough its role in overcoming various difficulties in the aftermath of the Second World War, the United Nations has firmly consolidated its function as the one universal Organization charged with the maintenance of world peace and security. It has facilitated the process of decolonization and has contributed significantly to the economic and social advancement of the developing countries. It has been a vital forum for the deliberation of economic and social questions and of issues in the field of human rights.\n30.\tThe United Nations has also made it possible for us to deal together, from a world-wide perspective, with specific problems which reflect our growing interdependence problems, for example, related to international trade and economic development, the environment, natural resources and food.\n31.\tThe world has been transformed over the past 30 years, but the purposes and principles of the United Nations, as set forth in Articles 1 and 2 of its Charter, have lost none of their significance; on the contrary, they have become more relevant and more important. On this thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations, we, the Members of the Organization, would do well to rededicate ourselves to those purposes and principles, governing our conduct accordingly.\n32.\tOne of the major developments of the past year was the termination of the prolonged war in IndoChina. I welcome the fact that the nations of IndoChina have now begun their postwar rehabilitation and are directing their energies and resources towards economic and social development. Restoration qf stability in that area, and progress in development, will, I believe, help consolidate the foundations for peace in Asia.\n33.\tIn this new Asian environment, the maintenance of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula is essential. The fact that the United Nations has been directly involved with this problem for a quarter of a century demonstrates the extraordinary difficulty of achieving the peaceful unification of Korea. Our experience also indicates that, in seeking a solution to the Korean question, we must shun such abrupt changes as would create greater instability in the area. Rather, we should be guided by realism, proceeding in orderly stages towards the goal of peaceful unification. The draft resolution my Government is sponsoring at this session [see A/10327, para. 10] in the context of the discussion of the question of Korea calls for dialog among the parties directly concerned tor the purpose of working out appropriate arrangements whereby the United Nations Command can be dissolved without endangering peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. Our aim is to find solutions to the issues through dialog rather than confrontation. I appeal to the General Assembly at this session to pursue a realistic approach to this problem so that we may in time attain lasting peace on the Korean peninsula.\n34.\tIt has been most gratifying to learn of the agreement reached by Egypt and Israel for a new military disengagement in the Sinai peninsula. The fact that the negotiations persisted through many difficult phases and finally produced an agreement brightens our hope for still further progress towards a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The present agreement reflects the determination of the parties concerned to move towards peace and is also a tribute to the tireless efforts of Mr. Kissinger, the United States Secretary of State, as mediator. Japan offers its high praise to all those whose attitudes and efforts made this agreement possible.\n35.\tYet there is much more to be done. My Government strongly urges the countries concerned to maintain their momentum towards a peaceful settlement, specifically towards the speedy implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in accordance with Security Council resolution 338 (1973). The fundamental position of my Government is that the countries concerned should resolve the Middle Eastern problem through negotiations and that the following principles should be adhered to: first, the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible, and therefore Israeli armed forces should be withdrawn from all the territories occupied in the 1967 war; secondly, all parties concerned, including Israel, have the right to live in peace, and that right must be respected. Moreover, a just and lasting peace in the Middle East requires that the legitimate rights of the Palestinians be recognized and respected in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\n36.\tMy Government earnestly hopes for a settlement of the Middle East conflict in compliance with those principles so that a just and durable peace may at last come to the peoples of that region. Meanwhile, it goes without saying that Japan will continue to support humanitarian assistance to the refugees through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.\n37.\tThe situation in southern Africa has undergone a remarkable change in the course of the past year. People's liberation movements in the Non-Self- Governing Territories, which have earned world-wide support, together with the decolonization policy of the Portuguese Government, have brought about the birth of a number of newly independent nations. The United Nations has played an extremely important role in this process. However, the prospects are far from bright for an early solution of the issues of Southern Rhodesia and Namibia or the question of apartheid in South Africa. The situation in Angola also continues unstable.\n38.\tI believe that Members of the United Nations should multiply their efforts, both within and outside the Organization, in search of solutions for those political issues which still persist in southern Africa. In particular, Japan supports the countries concerned, and especially the neighboring African States, in their persistent efforts to correct the wrongs of colonialism and racial discrimination, which Japan has consistently opposed. We also strongly urge the Government of the Republic of South Africa and the white minority regime of Southern Rhodesia to heed the severity with which their policies are criticized by the international community and to bring about in their respective Territories the transformations which are essential to justice and tranquility for all the peoples of southern Africa.\n39.\tFor 30 years the United Nations has provided a universal and continuing forum for world disarmament, Despite efforts exerted through this Organization, however, the number of nuclear-weapon States has been increasing, nuclear testing has continued, and the race in both nuclear and conventional armaments is unabated. In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [AjlOOOIjAdd.1], the Secretary-General has pointed out the increasing danger of nuclear proliferation, and has called for greater efforts to reach agreement on truly effective disarmament measures. I concur wholly in this view.\n40.\tThe unanimous adoption of the Final Document of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [AjC.lj 1068, annex I] last May, aimed at consolidation of the regime established by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], should in my view be welcomed as one positive step forward in this direction. I should like to recall, however, that at that Conference many non-nuclear- weapon States, including Japan, emphasized a cardinal point: namely, that the nuclear-weapon States should exert more vigorous efforts in the future to achieve nuclear disarmament.\n41.\tIn this connexion, I should like to underscore our urgent appeal to the nuclear-weapon States to persist unwaveringly in their efforts to carry out measures for nuclear arms control and nuclear disarmament, including the new agreement now being negotiated between the United States and the Soviet Union in the context of their Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, and agreement on a comprehensive nuclear- test ban. At the same time, I wish to urge those nuclear- weapon States which have been conducting nuclear explosions outside the existing regime for disarmament, such as the partial nuclear test-ban Treaty and the non-proliferation Treaty, to join in the observance of these disarmament measures to add their weight to the efforts to achieve world disarmament.\n42.\tIt is necessary also to prevent further nuclear proliferation in the guise of nuclear testing for peaceful purposes. 1 urgently request that the current session of the General Assembly instruct the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and other appropriate international bodies to mobilize their expertise for the purpose of determining how the international community can control nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. Every country should refrain from conducting such explosions until an effective and reasonable international regime for the peaceful application of nuclear explosions has been established.\n43.\tThe Government of Japan has submitted the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to the Diet for approval of its ratification. The Government of Japan will continue its efforts to ratify that Treaty at the earliest possible date so that we may participate in name as well as in fact in international efforts for nuclear non-proliferation.\n44.\tInternational economic problems, including the basic problems of development, are today as crucial to us as the maintenance of world peace and security.\n45.\tWe expressed our basic position on these problems earlier this month during the seventh special session of the General Assembly. I welcome the fact that there emerged from that special session broad guidelines for our future course of action in these fields.\n46.\tIn recent years every country, including my own, has been suffering from recession, inflation and balance-of-payments difficulties. In particular, the economic difficulties of many developing countries have become critical. Japan fully understands the frustrations of these countries and supports their aspirations to greater economic security and development.\n47.\tRaising the living standards of peoples in developing countries and promoting their economic and social development can only be achieved through concerted and well-co-ordinated actions among all of us. Together we must strenuously seek to prevent the world economy from contracting. Every country, whether developed or developing, has the obligation to contribute to better balanced and more equitable international economic relations. We must continue the constructive dialog we began earlier this month, basing it on an objective and realistic appraisal of the world economic situation. Japan, encouraged by the spirit of dialog and co-operation that prevailed at the recent special session, will continue to dedicate its energies to achieving concrete results at forthcoming conferences in this field, including the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\n48.\tThe problem of development should not be considered solely in terms of economics. We should also embrace the broad area of social development, indeed the whole range of activities which contribute to human fulfillment, deepening our creative understanding in all these fields. In this connexion, it is gratifying that the United Nations University, which opened recently in Tokyo, is now approaching full- scale operations, and will soon organize a network of scholars from all over the world to engage in research activities of benefit to all mankind. I sincerely hope the University will receive the active support of all States Members of this Organization.\n49.\tHaving stated Japan's position on a number of specific issues facing the United Nations today, I should like, on this thirtieth anniversary, to share with the Assembly our thoughts concerning the functioning of the United Nations, with a view to strengthening the Organization.\n50.\tFirst, regarding universality of membership of the United Nations, starting with an original membership of 51 States, the United Nations has now grown to 141 States. In the process it has become an organization representative of virtually every race, religion and ideology in the world today. This representativeness has contributed to the Organization's fulfillment of its wide-ranging responsibilities under the Charter, and has greatly enhanced its effectiveness. I am convinced of the desirability of universality of membership so that the United Nations may continue to \nfunction as a genuinely representative forum for international co-operation. For this purpose it is imperative that membership be open, and remain open, to all peace-loving States able and willing to carry out the obligations set forth in the Charter.\n51.\tSecondly, regarding the decision-making process in the United Nations and the implementation of its decisions, with a membership of 141 States and the wide diversity of the tasks to be carried out, how can we hope to secure the co-operation of Member States in finding solutions to specific problems? And how can we actually implement our resolutions? These are not academic concerns; they are vital questions which affect the very raison d'etre of the Organization. In the process of decision-making in the United Nations, the essence of international co-operation lies in the willingness of all concerned to search, in a spirit of dialog and co-operation, for solutions which are both workable and mutually acceptable.\n52.\tIn that sense the recently concluded seventh special session was an encouraging experience. Thanks to the perseverance and the co-operative attitudes of Member States, that special session adopted by consensus a text [resolution 3362 (S-Vll)] which embodied a number of important and extremely complex agreements. It is precisely such experiences that confirm our hopes for the future functioning of this Organization and for the constructive role that the United Nations alone can play in the years ahead.\n53.\tThirdly, I would mention the problem of how to cope with the ever-accumulating financial deficit. Deeply deploring a possible deterioration in the effective and smooth working of the United Nations as a result of such financial deficits, Japan took the lead last year in making a voluntary contribution. We hoped that our initiative would set the pattern for a once- and-for-all solution to that problem. Few countries followed suit, however, and no solution is yet in sight. I should like to take this opportunity to repeat our request to Member States, especially to those which are major contributors to the financing of the United Nations, to extend their constructive cooperation. Since the size of the regular budget of the Organization tends to increase year by year, with the expansion of fields of activity, it is essential that we attempt to achieve more efficient, cost-effective uses of the financial resources of the Organization.\n54.\tI should like also to mention the importance of strengthening the functions of the United Nations by seeking improvements within the framework of the existing Charter, as well as through Charter review. It is Japan's hope that the review of the functioning of the United Nations, including a review of the Charter, initiated this year by the Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter of the United Nations, will lead to constructive results.\n55.\tJapan, as an active Member of the United Nations, has renounced the option of becoming a military Power and has long since determined to entrust its peace and security to the justice and faith of the peace- loving peoples of the world. That spirit of pacifism, in pursuit of international harmony, is the source of our policy of co-operation with the United Nations, lhat policy has been and will continue to be a fundamental commitment of Japan's foreign policy, since we consider the United Nations to be the core organization for perfecting international co-operation and achieving world peace.\n56.\tIn conclusion, on this occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, I wish to reaffirm, in the name of the Government and people of Japan, our determination to continue to work for international co-operation and the cause of peace. We shall adhere strictly to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We shall devote our redoubled efforts, in co-operation with all Member States, to strengthening this indispensable Organization and to making it an even more effective instrument for achieving the aspirations of this generation and fulfilling the best hopes and dreams we share of a better and more peaceful world for generations to come.\n"

        "file_text": "91.\t Mr. President, Europe and in particular the member States of the European Economic Community feel deeply honored by your election to the presidency of the General Assembly of the United Nations at a time when our Organization is celebrating its thirtieth anniversary. The deep friendship between our peoples and our States, which you mentioned yesterday; my gratitude to you for the sensitive manner in which you paid a tribute to the memory of the great statesman Mr. Spaak, who was our first President; the high esteem in which I hold you; our constantly shared concerns are all reasons for the warmth of Belgium's congratulations and justify our confident certainty that you will make a decisive contribution to the success of our Assembly,\n92.\tMay I, first, congratulate the Secretary-General on his report on the work of the Organization [Aj 10001], As usual, it is an excellent one, and in the introduction [A!10001)Add. 1], without trying to please one side or the other, he clearly points to the weaknesses of international action.\n93.\tThe Declaration of the European Council made on 17 July 1975, by the heads of State and Government of the European Community, amply indicates Europe's interest in the role and future of the United Nations. After repeating their confidence in the United Nations, the nine Powers expressed their determination to pull together to help the Community to carry out its full responsibilities in an effort to foster conciliation and dialog.\n94.\tTo make such joint action possible the nine Powers are determined that the Charter and the rules of procedure now in force should be respected in order to ensure the rule of law.\n95.\tThe Charter, frequently termed the constitution or the basic instrument of our Organization, is the sole source of that law. It is that Charter, the purposes and principles defined in it and the machinery provided by it for their fulfillment that are endorsed by sovereign States when they join the United Nations. It is not by adopting measures which would do violence to the spirit and letter of the Charter that we can possibly hope to strengthen the role of the United Nations, nor a fortiori to modify its basic instrument. Indeed, it is within the framework of the Charter and in compliance with its principles that the United Nations has been able to play that major political role which is so readily acknowledged, and it is in that way that it has been able both to maintain and even to strengthen its universal character.\n96.\tDoes that imply that the Charter is perfect or that it should remain unchanged? We should realize the fact that over the 30 years which have passed since the United Nations was created, the world has seen much turmoil and has been the witness of many momentous changes. Is it not then logical to think in terms of a review in the Charter, and we appreciate the fact that some would like to move in that direction? We are convinced, however, that such an operation should be carried out in accordance with the procedures provided for in the Charter itself. Belgium agrees that amendments to the Charter which are indispensable for improving the performance of our Organization should be made, but at the same time we urge that careful thought be given to the nature of such an exercise and to its possible consequences. We believe that in such an important area it would be a mistake to yield to impulse because the results might very well fall far short of expectations.\n97.\tAmendment of the Charter is by no means the only way of resolving some of the difficulties with which the United Nations must deal. There are a good many others which should be studied as a matter of priority, in particular those which were brought out in the report of the Group of Experts on the Structure of the United Nations System.5\n98.\tThe whole world aspires to peace. Since it ensures security, non-recourse to violence is undoubtedly an important element in the building of peace, but it cannot alone build peace: peace can be ensured only if there is positive co-operation among States in all fields, and in particular in economic co-operation, which is a factor in social justice among peoples, However, once positive co-operation among States exists, individuals must be assured of respect for their human rights. To our way of thinking, that transcends the rights of States and the problem of their relations.\n99.\tHere, may I take up the following three major issues already mentioned: peace and security, international economic co-operation and respect for human rights.\n100.\tThe stability to which Belgium is particularly devoted involves security on the entire European continent. My country firmly believes that security cannot be attained by turning inward; it implies active commitments and a movement towards ever deeper and increasing solidarity.\n101.\tBelgium, with its security guaranteed by commitments which it has endorsed makes its contribution to the development of detente on the European continent. The Final Act of ] August which marked the conclusion in Helsinki of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe was an important stage in this process. Now it is for us to see to it that our deeds match our intentions. However, genuine detente is conceivable only if an improvement in political relations goes hand in hand with a concrete improvement in military security, and that means that satisfactory results must be achieved in the negotiations on the reduction of forces in central Europe.\n102.\tMilitary expenditure on a world-wide scale  more than $200 billion according to some estimates- consumes more funds than education and public health together. The proportion is reversed in my country where the defense budget, as a matter of fact, is less than half the budget for education. But what is particularly ominous in the world is the development of the nuclear potential, which today is capable of destroying 25 times the population of the world. Thus world public opinion is growing increasingly impatient about what must be done as regards disarmament and the control of weapons. In no other sphere have negotiations taken so long in getting under way, or proved so difficult when they have been begun.\n103.\tThere is little likelihood that 1975 will prove any less discouraging. The problems of nuclear armaments are more timely now than ever before,\nfor doubts are beginning to be felt regarding the effectiveness of the non-proliferation Treaty.\n104.\tAll States which, rightly, have refused to equip themselves with military nuclear capacity are entitled to call on all the nuclear-weapon Powers to discharge their special responsibility and to take concrete action to put an end to the arms race. If they do not do that, the present fragile equilibrium cannot be maintained. In the same context, and with the same objective, the two super-Powers might well point the way in their Strategic Arms Limitation Talks by fixing their strategic weapon ceilings lower than those envisaged in Vladivostok.\n105.\tWhile we appreciate the obstacles that exist regarding the fundamentally divergent positions of the nuclear States on nuclear disarmament, Belgium remains firmly in favor of the total cessation of nuclear tests for military purposes. No effort should be spared towards that end, but the results must be credible: there must be provisions of a binding nature and there must be control of the type accepted in the nuclear test ban Treaty.6\n106.\tThe undoubted importance of nuclear disarmament should not make us lose sight of the many and much more diversified dangers of the accumulation of conventional weapons throughout the world. Because of the political and technical complexity of these issues, regional negotiation is undoubtedly the form of negotiation which stands the greatest chance of leading to progress. Certain aspects of control of conventional weapons, in particular trade in weapons, could, however, be better dealt with at world level.\n107.\tIt is impossible to mention the problems of leace without referring to existing conflicts.\n108.\tThe agreement just entered into by the Egyptian and Israeli Governments should improve prospects for a settlement of the problem of the Middle East. The agreement reached, from the purely formal viewpoint, is, to be sure, a mere agreement on military disengagement. We believe, however, that thanks to the desire for peace and the wisdom of the Egyptian and Israeli authorities, this agreement has a special political dimension and may well constitute a decisive step towards peace. Of course, peace will not truly exist until a global settlement is reached, but we agree with Mr. Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, whose action made such a major contribution to the agreement, that peace must be built methodically and by successive stages. To be successful, the process must continue uninterruptedly. Therefore further progress must be made this time between Israel and Syria; concrete efforts must be made to satisfy the legitimate national aspirations of the Palestinian people so that they too may be able to live in peace with all the States in the area.\n109.\tI do not wish to leave the problem of the Middle East without also mentioning the present tragic events in Lebanon, a country with which we have ties of friendship. The territorial integrity and independence of that State are essential elements in the equilibrium \u2022 in the Middle East. May we express the hope that, without any foreign interference, peace may be restored to it very soon?\n110.\tBelgium is disappointed that the remarkable efforts of the Secretary-General have not made it\npossible for the dialog between the Greek and Turkish communities on the island to move toward a settlement of the Cypriot problem. Further efforts must be made as soon as possible and the United Nations role is to encourage the parties to reach an agreement. It is then essential that no unilateral action which might lead to a deterioration in this situation be taken.\n111.\tOur Assembly will be holding a debate on this subject. If it is to be constructive, it must be objective, and if it is to be objective it seems to me to be essential that the procedural rules which we adopted last year must once again be followed this year, and then the delegations of the two communities must be heard in the Special Political Committee before the debate in the General Assembly.\n112.\tThe views of Belgium on the problems of southern Africa are clear and have remained unchanged.\n113.\tThe recent declaration of the nine Powers on 26 August is a faithful, unequivocal and comprehensive reflection of our position on Namibia. Apartheid remains a policy which cannot be justified.\n114.\tIn Rhodesia and in South Africa over the past few months we have noticed that the positions of Pretoria and Salisbury have become more flexible; but they have become flexible to such an insignificant degree that we have not changed our position, for we are convinced that solutions can be agreed upon only when those authorities make an effort going far beyond the efforts which they have made heretofore.\n115.\tOn this occasion I would like to welcome, as the Foreign Minister of Italy did speaking as the acting president of the European Community [2357th meeting], the three new countries of Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe. The world Organization will find that their contribution is an appreciable one.\n116.\tTo my words of welcome to the three new Member States, I should like to add an expression of my regret that we do not have among us a number of Asian States, first and foremost of which are the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam. Universality is a principle which can brook no exceptions, and every State which meets the standards of Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Charter is entitled to join our Organization if such is its desire.\n117.\tThat is why my delegation voted in favor of resolution 3366 (XXX) of 19 September, calling upon the Security Council to reconsider the applications for membership of those two new States.\n118.\tIn thus stating our position, we must confess that, at the same time, we are deeply disturbed that the Republic of Korea has also introduced a similar request. Two States exist at the present time on the Korean peninsula. That is a fact, and the principle of unification, which some say is a prerequisite before membership can be considered, is particularly unconvincing because it is invoked in one case but not in others.\n119.\tThe disputes between the two legitimate Governments are a subject of great concern to us. My Government therefore hopes that further efforts will be made to rally the majority of the Members of this Organization in support of a resolution respecting the sovereignty of both States and maintaining peace machinery.\n120.\tMore than ever the unity of Europe remains the corner-stone of the policies of my country. Our objectives are the creation of an economic union and a strengthening of political union. But we will succeed in bringing that about only if our policies are based on the democratic values which are the foundation of the European Community.\n121.\tThe nine Governments of the Community have constantly worked together to build Europe, but that co-operation also extends to foreign policy problems. Hence the European countries have been concerning themselves very much with the political developments in Portugal. Europe is the cradle of democratic values and wishes to remain a rallying point for these values. The Portuguese people, repre-sented in democratic and pluralist institutions, would be welcomed in the Europe to which they belong.\n122.\tThis common political action among members of the European Community is a development which also finds expression within the United Nations. The nine Powers will establish common positions on issues discussed in our Organization, and they will state those positions increasingly through a single spokesman.\n123.\tThat unity has been just as effective in relations between the Community and the developing countries. In the Lome Convention signed on 28 February 1975, the Community wished to rethink its relations with 46 developing countries of Africa, the Pacific, and the Caribbean islands. In particular, by creating a fund to stabilize export earnings, and by bringing about a new form of industrial cooperation, the Convention of Lome has broken new ground.\n124.\tWe also welcome the results of the seventh special session of the General Assembly, which came to an end last week. There the member States of the Community negotiated as a single entity. Confronted with problems of equal difficulty and scale, our delegations demonstrated by their spirit of dialog and restraint that it was possible to agree on realistic conclusions adopted unanimously. For the first time, the conclusions adopted were based on mutual confidence going beyond the texts themselves.\n125.\tRegardless of the difficulties encountered, it is that spirit of understanding which made it possible for us to succeed finally in overcoming them. Now that those long and difficult negotiations have ended, that spirit must continue to govern us as we deal with the various problems before the international community. We must now begin on a positive and realistic course of action, My country accepts the implications of that and we will make a full contribution to the various dialogs which will continue, in particular, at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris and at the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\n126.\tMay I now turn to the last question, the question of human rights.\n127.\tLast year, from this same rostrum, I stressed the fact that Belgium had always considered the United Nations, ever since it was created, as the best\nguarantor of human rights; and that we had always expected that the United Nations would see to it that the law in this area was respected.\n128.\tIt must be admitted that human rights are still being violated in various areas of the world. Is there anything more regrettable in this connexion than the fact that some would hide behind the intangible barrier of sovereignty? In this respect, may I point to the forward-looking attitude of the countries of Western Europe which have established a European Court of Human Rights, where the principle of the sovereignty of States cannot be invoked.\n129.\tBelgium was one of the first countries to give its nationals the right to have access to an international court in the case of individual rights being violated. I would express the hope that that attitude will be the one taken by the participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. In view of the fact that the 35 member States of that Conference agreed to subscribe to the principles contained in the jointly prepared text the dialog between them on its implementation cannot in future be considered as interference in their internal affairs.\n130.\tI am pleased that in that area the United Nations has not been inactive. Far from it. Our Organization last year made an outstanding effort to deal with the serious problem of torture. The Fifth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders continued the task and its report [see A/10260] will help the General Assembly at this thirtieth session to farther the work. The Belgian Government is very pleased at that, since the reappearance of reports of the practice of torture, both physical and moral in several areas of the world, make the efforts of this Organization more urgently necessary than ever before.\n131.\tWe cannot praise too highly the tireless efforts of the High Commissioner for Refugees. In the performance of his duties, he may rest assured that he will enjoy the complete support of Belgium.\n132.\tBelgium has always welcomed and will continue to welcome political refugees to our land. Ever since the end of the war, our country has taken in about 70,000 refugees. They have come in successive waves from different continents, as a result of outbreaks of ideological, racial or religious intolerance. Often they have come from countries thousands of miles away, where the climate and the culture are quite different from those in our country; sometimes they did not know of our existence until they arrived. In our country they have enjoyed the advantages provided under the Convention on the Status of Refugees, signed at Geneva on 28 July 1951, which gives them the right to stay permanently and to obtain a priority work permit. At the same time, they enjoy the same social advantages as Belgian nationals. Furthermore, Belgian legislation allows them to apply for naturalization after they have been domiciled in our country for three years.\n133.\tFaithful to its mission in this regard, over the past 12 months my Government has continued to take in political refugees. Furthermore, this year we have actively participated in the work of the Group of Experts on the Draft Convention on Territorial\nAsylum created by the General Assembly at its twenty- ninth session.\n134.\tMy country is prepared to support every effort to give the High Commissioner expanded powers which would in particular make it possible for him to take action for the protection of refugees.\n135.\tIn response to efforts by the United Nations to protect the handicapped, my delegation this year will submit to the Assembly a draft declaration on the rights of handicapped persons.\n136.\tThe Belgian Government welcomes efforts made this year by our Organization to promote the status of women within the framework of International Women's Year. The Belgian Government has taken important action in Belgium within the context of the International Year and in line with this world-wide movement, nor has it> spared any efforts within the United Nations. Both in the Consultative Committee for the Conference of the International Women's Year and at the Conference itself, Belgian representatives actively participated in the preparation of the World Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Women's Year. If it is put into effect, as it should be, it will lead to considerable progress in the essential and legitimate cause of equality for women.\n137.\tIn spite of all these positive developments, we must recognize the fact that the United Nations does not seem to be properly equipped to ensure the protection of human rights.\n138.\tIt is thus with great pleasure that the Belgian delegation welcomes the inclusion in the agenda of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly of an item titled \\\"Alternative approaches and ways and means within the United Nations system for improving the\neffective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms\\\" [item 73]. We hope that the debate on the subject will be constructive and will come up with ways in which our Organization might fulfil its mission in this vital area.\n139.\tMy Government has always considered the co-operation of the United Nations with non-governmental organizations to be essential to the success of that mission. Here I should like to pay a tribute to the non-governmental organizations for their constructive and disinterested action in the area of the protection and defense of human rights. May I say here that my Government attaches considerable importance to what is being done by the non-governmental organizations, and we would vigorously oppose any attempt to reduce their jurisdiction in this regard.\n140. Automatic and widespread recourse to the system of United Nations commissions of inquiry seems to my Government to be highly desirable.\n141 On this subject, the Commission on Human Rights, which I should like to commend, decided to send a fact-finding Working Group on the Situation of Human Rights in Chile.\n\\t2l Jhl?elgia\\\" Government very much regrets that the Chilean Government, after at first agreeing to accept the group and allow it to carry out its mission at the last minute postponed that authorization. My Government expresses the hope that the Chilean\nauthorities will change what we feel was a highly regrettable decision as soon as possible.\n143.\tHowever, Chile is not the only country where human rights have come under attack. I have noted, furthermore, that the decision to send a fact-finding working group to Chile was not adopted until a year and a half after the beginning of the events to which the charges relate, and that only after difficult negotiations.\n144.\tSuch a procedure is very cumbersome, lengthy and dangerous because it is not automatic.\n145.\tCould we not take advantage of the opportunity provided by the debate on the agenda item I mentioned to see to it that the system of commissions of inquiry is more generally used? We should be able to make referral to such commissions automatic, to establish rules for their composition and to consider a general declaration, in which all States would express their readiness at any time to receive visits from such commissions.\n146.\tThese commissions should be sent out in accordance with procedures based on objective criteria.\n147.\tUntil all States accept that declaration, we could meanwhile facilitate its application by drawing up a list of all those of us who would be prepared to endorse the declaration forthwith.\n148.\tThat is, to be sure, an ambitious plan, but one which my delegation is prepared to discuss and to endorse immediately.\n149.\tI wish to conclude my speech on this note: any proposal to strengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations in the defence of human rights will be endorsed by Belgium.\n"

        "file_text": "180.\t  The delegation of Ghana sincerely congratulates Mr. Thorn on his election to the presidency of this thirtieth session of the General Assembly. We are very confident that, both in the open debates and in the corridors of quiet diplomacy which is so indispensable for resolving differences and smoothing relations among Member States, his reputation for impartiality, tact and sober judgment will be a great asset and a benign influence. His election is also a great honor to his native Luxembourg, yet another of those nations which, though small in size or status, are yet capable of producing ideas and men of towering stature to justify the underlying principle of the United Nations that it takes a world of all peoples, of all nations, big and small, to weave the seamless fabric of peace. Luxembourg has worked tirelessly to safeguard its sovereign statehood by becoming intimately associated with a whole range of efforts aimed at forging regional unity and integration and international peace and understanding. I cannot help adding that my admiration for Luxembourg in this respect is touched with a feeling of harmony as I notice that my own country, equally small, shares with Luxembourg this instinct of national pride and interest guided by a sense of international responsibility which has become a dynamic tradition of our foreign policy.\n181.\tIt is important also to note that Mr. Thorn assumes his office at a time when the atmosphere in this Assembly has been quite considerably cleared of the controversy which about a year ago overshadowed international co-operation and threatened to cause an ominous breach in the dialog between the developed and the developing countries of the world. Admittedly, that controversy has not yet been resolved, as we long for it to be, yet we cannot deny that under the able, firm and perceptive leadership of last year's President of the General Assembly, our brother Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Foreign Minister of Algeria, this Assembly was given the right perspective in its deliberations over the very delicate issue of raw materials and development. We express to him our deep sense of gratitude for his energetic and effective presidency.\n182.\tGhana wishes also to record its appreciation of the work of our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and his mostly silent, self-effacing and dedicated staff, both at Headquarters and in various centers all over the world. We pay them a warm tribute for their unflagging devotion to duty in the service of what the United Nations and its Charter stand for. To Mr. Waldheim, in particular, we wish to say further how happy and inspired we have been to see him persevere through the many moments of anxiety and flagging morale which he has known since the last session. If the 30 years of life of our Organization have taught us any valuable lessons, one of them must surely be that Governments of Member States ought to be more realistic in their conception of the role of the Secretary-General. We urge Mr. Waldheim to persevere further in his burdensome, arduous task, and we assure him of our continued support and cooperation.\n183.\tIt is now my particular pleasure to welcome into our midst three sister African nations: the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. Having regard to the paths they have traversed to attain independent statehood, the accession of those new nations to membership in our Organization cannot fail to enrich the experience of us all. This is also the moment to remember with heightened pride the role that the United Nations played in the struggles of those nations for self-determination and dignity. But as we share their feeling of fulfillment on entering this international community, so we become conscious of the even greater problems of nation- building that lie ahead of them. Let us therefore not make their membership of the United Nations become a mere commemorative stamp of modern statehood but rather a solid act of faith in our ability and readiness to offer the much-needed assistance to safeguard and consolidate their hard-won independence.\n184.\tAs we all know, this is the moment when we ought to have been able to look forward with confidence to the imminent accession to full sovereignty by Angola. Unfortunately, we can only sigh with anguish at the disturbing sequence of events which seems to be delaying that country's independence. In this period of grave crisis, efforts must clearly be directed towards assisting the feuding factions to compose their differences. Nevertheless, much careful thought must go into deciding what efforts will be admissible.\n185.\tRecently, some well-meaning Governments have called for United Nations intervention; but we, the States members of the OAU, guided by our past experience in these matters in Africa, have cautioned against such a course of action. The Angolan crisis is admittedly very grim, but the OAU is confident that, given the general moral support of the world, the rest of the countries of Africa can and will work successfully with their brothers in Angola to end the civil strife there. At the recent twelfth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government, held at Kampala, the OAU addressed itself urgently to finding an African solution to the problem. I wish to reaffirm Ghana's confidence in the OAU approach to the Angolan crisis. Naturally the solution will not be found overnight, and Ghana wishes to caution against any external attempts to exploit the current crisis in order to cause any unnecessary delay in Angola's achieving self-determination.\n186.\tBut if the prospects for Angola seem somewhat sombre, not so are those for the Seychelles and Papua New Guinea, Suriname and the Comoros, and we look forward to welcoming those countries into the United Nations.\n187.\tStill on the theme of the expanding membership of our Organization, one cannot help feeling puzzled by maneuver  aimed at impeding the entry into the United Nations of the two Vietnamese States. The Government of Ghana sees this as a matter of plain logic, amply dictated and supported by the trends of our time, that the ending of foreign military intervention in Viet Nam should have been acknowledged by the admission into the United Nations of those two States. We must therefore point out that the stale and musty repertoire of cold-war diplomacy which is being used to keep the brave Vietnamese out of the United Nations is as sad as it is futile. Ghana pledges its support to any moves aimed at bringing about, in the shortest possible time, the admission of the two Vietnamese States to the United Nations, without conditions.\n188.\tThere have been strong and hopeful indications in recent years that the world-wide movement of nationalist struggles for independence was entering a successful final phase. The nationalist triumphs in South-East Asia and in the former Portuguese strongholds in Africa are epic victories by any standards and as such cannot fail to inspire and sustain hopes of eventual victories elsewhere. Starting with southern Africa, attention has now been focused on the political scene in Zimbabwe, Namibia and apartheid South Africa itself.\n189.\tIt is well known that in principle the issues of Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa are separate and call for separate treatment. A few white settlers, rebelling against constitutional authority and suppressing by far the great majority of the citizens, a Territory under United Nations Mandate illegally occupied, a settler regime practicing racist policies that are revolting to the conscience of the whole world those are th\u00a7 three distinct issues. In reality, however, the apartheid republic of Vorster has become like a big horrid spider sitting in the center of the entire southern African region, entangling everything and everybody in its odious web. The result is that we cannot hope for a political solution in Rhodesia, for instance, without finding that big spider first of all ensuring that any such solution suits its purposes and, secondly, giving the impression that it was the spider itself that caused the great liberal change in Rhodesia, for which all Africa should feel grateful. Meanwhile, within its own republic, the spider spins the web of its spurious policy of bantustanism, which it labels as a policy of self-determination for the black South Africans. Mr. Vorster's webs are indeed assiduously spread as communications channels all over Africa, and along those channels he sells his curious concepts of enlightened influences in Rhodesia and magnanimous political and social concessions to black South Africans.\n190.\tSuch is the man Vorster we are dealing with in southern Africa in this day and age. Incredible as it may seem, he believes that he will succeed in splitting the opposition to his concepts. In spite of his efforts, however, Ghana remains firm in its support of nationalist movements in southern Africa.\n191.\tThe ninth extraordinary session of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, held at Dar es Salaam in April this year, resolved to appeal to the international community to support an intensified program of sanctions against South Africa. Since the Vorster regime continues to flout the decisions of the international body, we now have no alternative but to call for that comprehensive program of sanctions against it.\n192.\tWhat I have said about the southern African issue is symbolic of our strong feelings about the entire problem of continuing colonialism in Africa. It is time the whole of that continent was freed of this colonial evil; in particular I wish to mention that the people of Spanish Sahara and of the so-called French Somaliland (otherwise known as Djibouti) should all be allowed to exercise their inalienable right to self- determination. Africa must be totally free.\n193.\tTurning to the remaining areas of strife in the world, it becomes obvious that the Middle East should be of particular significance for our world Organization.\n194.\tWe share the view that the recently concluded Sinai Agreement between Israel and Egypt is of major significance and has the potential to advance peace in the area since, as between two of the major adversaries at least, it could engender the confidence and trust so essential to understanding and future cooperation.\n195.\tBut there are more than two adversaries in the Middle East and it would be dangerous to ignore the genuine fears of some that the Sinai Agreement could have the effect of becoming a source of conflict among the parties to the issue on the one hand, and on the other, leading to a situation in which the rights of the Palestinians become of secondary importance.\n196.\tWe are aware that this has not been the intent of the negotiators of the Sinai Agreement. Nevertheless, the genuineness of these fears should be acknowledged and appreciated. For as we can already see, an agreement designed to promote peace has engendered such violent passions in the Arab world that we face the clear threat of an even more turbulent and unstable situation in the Middle East.\n197.\tThis is why it is heartening to my delegation to note the United States' express commitment to sustain the momentum of negotiations, to consult regarding the reopening of the Geneva Conference, and to explore other possibilities for multilateral discussion and action. This course of action must be taken now, without a moment's delay, as evidence of a sincere desire to advance towards a final and comprehensive settlement of the problem.\n198.\tAll are agreed that no durable Middle Eastern settlement is feasible without a solution of the Palestine question, which has been the central problem at issue for more than a generation. The wars and the consequent occupation of Arab lands have come about because of this. It would appear to my delegation, therefore, that the Palestinians must necessarily be actively involved in the search for a permanent solution.\n199.\tA few years ago a proliferation of Arab organizations and groups were, through diverse ways, laying claim to representing the Palestinians. That confusion has been eliminated by the due recognition given to the Palestine Liberation Organization [.PLO] by all the Arab States, the OAU, the non-aligned movement, and this very United Nations, as the sole representatives of the Palestinian people. We have done this in the firm belief that the PLO will play a constructive role in the search for a just solution if given the chance,\n200.\tIt is now time to call on the Governments of the United States and of Israel to recognize how far we have traveled in this regard, and to publicly acknowledge the inevitable role of the PLO in any meaningful negotiations towards a final Middle East solution. To continue to maintain a posture of no contact with the PLO on the basis that it is a terrorist organization is to ignore the history of the problem itself.\n201.\tIn all the years that we have lived with this problem no period has offered such possibilities for a just and lasting solution as now. Ghana's plea is that the opportunity must be seized, and speedily, for failure to do this might well destroy all expectation that the Sinai Agreement could mark a turning-point in the Middle East situation.\n202.\tThe situation in Cyprus is no less dangerous. We reiterate our view that the basis for seeking a settlement of the issue consists in a search for an acceptable inter-communal relationship, the withdrawal of foreign troops from that troubled island, and upholding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. We congratulate the Secretary-General for his efforts to assist in finding an acceptable solution to the problem, and urge him to continue those efforts.\n203.\tA review of international flash-points must necessarily bring us to the perennial question of disarmament and its collateral measures. Those of us and we are the majority who, because of the restricted nature of the composition of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, are unable to make our voices adequately heard have joined in advocating the convening of a world disarmament conference. This, we believe, will contribute to freeing the prevailing deadlocks among certain nuclear Powers and thus creating the opportunity for a fresh and more universal approach to disarmament negotiations.\n204.\tWe also have on the agenda of this Assembly several proposals for nuclear-free zones in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and South-East Asia, in addition to a proposal for the creation of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. We urge all States Members of this Organization to give serious consideration and support to these proposals. The successful outcome of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe should now induce a more sympathetic understanding of the security concerns of those other regions. As a member of the expert group to study the implications of these questions, Ghana will make its contribution to the study.\n205.\tHaving just mentioned the call for a new world disarmament conference, I wish to remark that, although the numerous international conferences of our age are all essential for the complex aspects of our world's international relations, they tend to suffer from a cumbersome, time-wasting machinery which strains not only the resources of the United Nations, but also, and particularly, those of poorer nations which must take part in them. My Government therefore supports any action designed to find ways and means of making the complex international negotiating machinery run much more expeditiously and efficiently,\n206.\tTurning now to the world economic system, which is appropriately recognized as the axis of international relations today, our world body has already acknowledged the supreme urgency of the current crisis in this system by holding the sixth special session last year and the seventh special session this year. The decisions that we have taken so far, significant as they are, must be recognized as preliminary steps in a long and complex effort to create a new international economic order.\n207.\tAs the United Nations works out further measures for meeting the complex demands of this problem, it is interesting to recall that as far back as 1953 the then Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold, foresaw in the following words the international crisis that would result from an inequitable world economic system. He said:\n\\\"Whatever may be our political philosophy, we all recognize that it is impossible within any nation today to depend for long on inequality of economic conditions which the majority of the people believe to be unjust. What is a cause for unrest within a nation may become as much a cause for unrest and instability in the international community\\\".\n208.\tIf any further words of warning are necessary, they can be only that all our eloquence in the recognition of the crisis will not save us from even worse future crises if the initial recommendations now accepted are not implemented with sincerity and some urgency.\n209.\tIn West Africa, the seriousness of the world economic crisis has at least helped us to hasten the conclusion of the treaty establishing the subregional grouping called the Economic Community of West \u2022 African States. We have no illusions whatsoever about the obstacles impeding the successful functioning of the treaty obstacles that are internal and external, historical and present. But we hope we have a trump card in the overriding awareness of the damage which the lack of cohesion and solidarity has hitherto caused us in the way of stunted development and growth. So long as we do not lose this awareness, we should be able to make the necessary effort and sacrifice to succeed.\n210.\tAnother epoch-making development which my delegation is happy to mention in relation to the world economic crisis has been the successful negotiation and signing of the Lome Convention, regulating relations between the European Economic Community and the 46 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. The Convention envisages close co-operation in industry, accessibility for those countries to Community technology, and a trading scheme which seeks to stabilize, for those countries, incomes from raw materials entering the Community. But apart from these direct benefits from the Lome Convention, we are confident that the unity of purpose which characterized the stand of the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries throughout the difficult negotiations will form the basis for closer ties and increased trade among those same countries. This will be another significant step towards the realization of the new economic order which we all seek.\n211.\tAt a lower but more practical level still, the economic order concerns individual nations and even single vital units of exchange. For us in Ghana, one such vital single item is cocoa, which not only provides the bulk of our foreign-exchange earnings but in addition provides economic occupation for a large portion of the country's population. For this reason, the Geneva negotiations for a new international cocoa agreement under the auspices of UNCTAD are of particular interest to my country. And, on behalf of Ghana, my delegation wishes to seize this opportunity to express appreciation to those consumer countries which are already members of the International Cocoa Agreement. We entertain the expectation that their continued co-operation will be forthcoming. We hope that these negotiations will lead to the determination of new price levels which will be equitable and remunerative to producers and fair to consumers. In this regard we welcome the decision of the United States to participate in the negotiations.\n212.\tReflecting on all the issues which I have touched upon, and all the many others which I have necessarily omitted to mention, I feel overawed by the realization that for 30 years now the post-war world has been making this most elaborate pilgrimage to this General Assembly of an institution which a frightened world fashioned as some answer to its fears of self-destruction. It is an extraordinary aspect of the human situation that we seem endowed in equal measure with the capacity to be persuaded towards self-destruction and towards self-preservation. As we mark our thirtieth anniversary, then, the Ghana delegation wishes to be associated with the prayer that the counsels that make for self-preservation may receive an accretion of strength. The perils that looked so very distressing in the times immediately bordering the war period are still very much with us, although these may appear in subtler forms, shapes and shades. In the war period, our perils took the naked form of a gigantic armed conflict. Since then, they have taken the forms of political, social and economic upheavals. But naked or subtle, they all make the world an unsafe abode. Similarly, the same insidious forces of prejudice, intolerance and cynicism which virtually made the League of Nations stillborn are also shadowing and stalking our present world Organization. These conditions manifestly call for our re-dedication to our pledge of united strength, resourcefulness and vigilance.\n213.\tThe Ghana delegation is convinced that our Organization, which has already displayed a high degree of resilience, has in fact the growth capacity to make it equal to this challenge.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR would like to congratulate you on our election to the post of President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly and wish you success in your responsible work.\n48.\tWe should like to greet the SecretaryGeneral, who has made considerable efforts to implement the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n49.\tThis thirtieth session of the General Assembly is taking place at a remarkable time. This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the victory in the Second World War, as a result of which the United Nations was born. This is the year of the successful conclusion of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the year of the elimination of a dangerous hotbed of tension in SouthEast Asia, the year of the rapid downfall of the vestiges of the colonialist system, the year of further consolidation of peace-loving forces in their joint struggle for a just and lasting peace on earth and the solution of vital problems in the interests of all peoples.\n50.\tLooking back upon the unforgettable period when, in the course of fierce fighting, fascism, the antithesis of civilization and progress, which had sought world domination, was crushed as a result of the decisive role of the Soviet Union, we always experience a feeling of admiration for the immortal feat of the Soviet Union and other freedom loving peoples; but at the same time one cannot forget, and one will be unable to forget now or in the future, the sacrifices made for the sake of victory.\n51.\tThe war took 55 million human lives, and of those 20 million were citizens of the Soviet Union. The Byelorussian SSR went through a terrible time, when every fourth inhabitant perished in the struggle against the aggressors.\n52.\tSpeaking in Minsk on 16 May this year at the International Meeting of the Supporters of Peace, Mr. P. M. Masherov, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Byelorussian SSR, said:\n\\\"Lasting peace and the freedom of peoples are an unfailing ideal which has inspired the heroes of the struggle against fascism and which inspires us today. There is nothing more noble or more lofty than dedicating our efforts to making that ideal an immutable law of the life of mankind, so that not only we, all of us, but also our children, our grandchildren and our great grandchildren may be ignorant of the nature of war and so that all peoples may fully enjoy the benefits of peaceful creative labor and all the achievements of the human mind.\\\"\n53.\tThe victory over fascism and militarism had the deepest influence on the whole course of world development. Peace, so long awaited, was finally won. The world socialist system, the bulwark of peace and progress, came into being, and it is being strengthened. The age-old foundations of colonialism collapsed and a new, more favorable situation was created for the struggle of the working people of capitalist countries for social progress.\n54.\tOn those days in May, when all progressive mankind was celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of victory, the sun of freedom and peace rose over South Viet Nam. We welcome the outstanding victory of the heroic Vietnamese people, a victory won in their just struggle against foreign interventionists and their henchmen. The victory of the peoples of Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia, with the comprehensive support of the socialist States and all progressive forces, is an important contribution to the strengthening of peace and security in SouthEast Asia. It promotes the triumph of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, and it is only fitting that the General Assembly and all the members of the Security Council except one should have considered that the time had come to solve the problem of the admission to the United Nations of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR will continue, both in the Security Council and in the General Assembly, firmly to support the entry of the two Vietnamese States into the United Nations.\n55.\tThe experience of 30 years of postwar development demonstrates that peace can become a solid reality if we work for it persistently, if we adhere unswervingly to the principle of the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems, if we consistently strive for a just solution of current international problems. The positive changes taking place in the world arena cogently reveal that there is now an objective possibility of banishing war from the life of mankind.\n56.\tI should particularly like, in this connexion, to note the purposeful efforts of the Soviet Union and other States of the socialist community, efforts which have become a fundamental factor in ensuring the current positive processes in international relations.\n57.\tThe founder of the Soviet State, V. I. Lenin, stressed that \\\"All our policies and propaganda are aimed not at drawing peoples into war but at putting an end to war\\\". This Leninist principle of the negation of war and the assertion of peace is the very basis of the Program of Peace proclaimed by the Twenty fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It would be no exaggeration to state that any step forward in the improvement of the world political climate and the development of cooperation between States is linked with the implementation of that Pro , gramme of Peace.\n58.\tAt the present time, detente is focusing on the results of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which was an event of tremendous international importance.\n59.\tThe Conference struck a political balance in terms of the world after the Second World War and confirmed the futility and harmfulness of the policies of positions of strength and the \\\"cold war\\\". It opened up new opportunities for fulfilling the main task of our time the consolidation of peace and the security of peoples.\n60.\tThe principles of relations between States, which have been clearly formulated in the Final Act of the Conference, are bound to promote the creation on the European continent and in the world at large of an atmosphere of mutual trust and confidence in the free, independent and peaceful development of every' country. The course of the general debate has convincingly confirmed that all except one delegation, which believes that the worse things are the better are pleased that the States of Europe as well as the United States and Canada have agreed to observe in international relations such principles as the sovereign equality of States, including the right to choose and develop freely their political, social, economic and cultural systems; the non-use of force or the threat of force; the inviolability of borders; the territorial integrity of States; the peaceful settlement of disputes; noninterference in each other's internal affairs; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; equality and the right of peoples to determine their own destiny; cooperation between States; and the fulfillment in good faith of commitments under international law.\n61.\tThe charter of peace adopted at Helsinki also creates conditions for the expansion and substantial intensification of cooperation between States that participated in the Conference in the economic, scientific and technological fields and in the protection of the human environment, as well as in such questions as exchanges in the fields of culture, education, information and contacts between peoples.\n62.\tThe results of the Conference mean that detente in Europe and in the world at large is becoming increasingly filled with content. It is essential to put these principles and understandings that have been proclaimed into the actual practice of interState relations, at the same time complying with the laws and traditions of every country, in order that these principles and understandings may become an immutable law of international life. There is no greater duty to the past, present and future than the duty of finally confirming the results of the selfless struggle waged by the Soviet and other freedom-loving peoples against fascism, and of making Europe a continent of lasting and just peace.\n63.\tThe favorable influence of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe on the atmosphere in that continent and throughout the world is undeniable. Its results are very important, and not only for the peoples of Europe. Detente must be expanded, deepened and extended to all parts of the world. The right to peace is the inalienable right of every person, no matter what part of the world he or she lives in. We must preserve it and, at the same time, ensure for everyone the right to creative work and social justice. We must struggle for these fundamental human rights.\n64.\tComrade L. I. Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said at Helsinki:\n\\\"It is no secret that information media can serve the objectives of peace and trust, but they can also spread throughout the world the poison of strife between countries and peoples. We would like to hope that the results of the Conference will serve as a correct reference point for cooperation in these areas.\\\"\nUnfortunately, influential mass information media in certain countries have so far not given up the topics and phraseology of the period of the \\\"cold war\\\"; they have not turned their backs on allegations in depicting the life of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and a number of very important international events. They deliberately allow themselves to distort the substance and spirit of the Final Act of the Conference which, as a matter of fact, they have not even published. While concealing the real contents of the document adopted at Helsinki, the press in a number of countries is distorting facts, trying to mislead people and sow in their minds the poisonous seeds of suspicion, mistrust and hostility between peoples. To use. the words of the President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, Mr. Bouteflika, such information media \\\"attempt to counteract the present course of events in the world\\\".2 The interests of the case require that the information media of every country should heed the call of the times and become an instrument of peace and the strengthening of trust and cooperation among peoples.\n65.\tThe task of implementing the principles of peaceful coexistence and mutually advantageous and equitable cooperation is not being tackled only in Europe. Recently, serious improvements have been achieved in SovietAmerican relations; that has been of unquestionable utility in the improvement of the international climate as a whole. There is no doubt that the further development of normal relations between the USSR and the United States and the development of cooperation between the socialist States and countries of an opposite social system meet the interests of all those who want to see peace on earth strengthened and who do not want to permit a world nuclear catastrophe.\n66.\tInternational peace and security are equally necessary conditions for businesslike cooperation among all countries, large and small, developed and developing. Can we really imagine the possibility of any success in the economic and social development of countries in conditions of war?\n67.\tIt goes without saying that we cannot comfort ourselves with the idea that there is no war today, or remain content with what has been achieved. The' process of the consolidation of peace, the process of detente, is an uninterrupted process which requires constant forward movement. To halt on this path would mean endangering what has already been achieved.\n68.\tIt cannot be denied that so far not all the obstacles to lasting peace and good-neighborly cooperation for mankind have been removed. The forces of imperialism and neocolonialism, reaction and war have not laid down their arms. They are attempting to prevent the settlement of urgent international problems; they are attempting to drag the world back to the time of the \\\"cold war\\\"; they are advocating the use of force in international relations; they are intervening in the internal affairs of other countries. It is precisely because of these forces that there are still hotbeds of dangerous tension in the world and that militarily explosive conflicts arise.\n69.\tIn the Middle East Israel continues to hold the Arab territories it occupied in 1967. A just and lasting peace must be ensured for the Middle East. There is only one way of doing that: implementing the well known decisions of the Security Council and the General Assembly which provide for the total withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967; implementing the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including the right to create their own State; and ensuring the independent existence and development of all States of the region. In order to achieve a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East, what is needed is not separate measures, which do not get to the root of the problem, but the resumption of the work of the Geneva Peace Conference, with the participation of all parties concerned, including the PLO.\n70.\tCertain circles in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] have not ceased they attempts to liquidate Cyprus as a nonaligned and independent State with its territorial integrity. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR both in the Security Council and in the General Assembly has supported the idea that the partition of Cyprus is inadmissible, that the independent existence and territorial integrity of Cyprus must be ensured, that all foreign troops must be withdrawn from its territory, that foreign interference in its internal affairs must cease, and that the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots must be ensured an opportunity to solve their domestic affairs by themselves.\n71.\tA situation of tension still prevails in the Korean peninsula. The Byelorussian SSR has invariably supported the constructive proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea designed to unite the country on a peaceful democratic basis, and resolutely calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea, which will remove the main obstacle to the achievement of national unity for that country. The achievement of these aims would be promoted by the adoption by the General Assembly of the draft resolution entitled \\\"Creation of favorable conditions for converting the armistice into durable peace in Korea and accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea\\\", which has been submitted for the consideration of this session by a large group of States including the Byelorussian SSR [A/C.ll L.709].\n72.\tFascism, which was overthrown during the Second World War, has not yet entirely disappeared from the face of the earth. Its spiritual heirs have . usurped power in Chile and are pursuing a policy of bloody terror against the people of that country. The United Nations, in accordance with earlier decisions, must resolutely demand an end to the atrocities of the junta, and the liberation of the Chilean patriots, including the true son of the Chilean people, Luis Corvalan, who are languishing in dungeons.\n73.\tGratifying changes towards peace and social progress are occurring in various parts of the world. But the forces of reaction still refuse to look the facts in the face. The situation is complicated by the fact that the subversive actions of internal reaction are linked with foreign interference into the affairs of a number of States and peoples. The Byelorussian SSR categorically condemns such actions and wishes to express its solidarity with the just struggle of democratic forces in various parts of the world against reaction and imperialism. In connexion with the slanderous comments of the Chinese representative concerning Angola, I should like to recall the well-known fact that it is China itself, together with the imperialists, which is arming the separatists there for the purpose of preventing the patriotic forces from achieving the unity and independence of the whole of Angola.\n74.\tAmong the key problems of our day which still await a solution, the problem of disarmament occupies a special place. The unprecedented arms race imposed upon the world by the imperialists is swallowing up vast amounts of material resources. According to press reports NATO countries in 1974 alone spent more than $130,000 million for military purposes. The arms race is incompatible with detente. The improvement of political relations among States cannot for ever go on side by side with the arms race.\n75.\tEvery year since the very first session of the General Assembly the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries have consistently striven for disarmament, and have tried to use every possible means of solving this important problem. In recent years a number of multilateral agreements have been concluded which have, to some extent, put a curb on the arms race in certain directions. The primary and ultimate objective of all peace-loving peoples is to achieve agreement on general and complete disarmament. But, as we know, so far not everyone is ready to do that. And one delegation, posing demagogically as a supporter of disarmament, is in practice opposing all disarmament measures. So what are we to do: fold our arms and wait passively? Not at all. We consider that we should find a solution to the disarmament problem by taking every opportunity to limit the arms race. Our experience has confirmed that that approach is the correct one, an approach which has made it possible to conclude treaties and agreements, open to all countries, that have prohibited the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water and the proliferation of these weapons or their emplacement on the seabed and ocean floor, in outer space or on celestial bodies; an agreement providing for the elimination of bacteriological weapons; and also the conclusion of the SovietAmerican agreements on the prevention of nuclear war and the limitation of strategic armaments.\n76.\tWe can assert confidently that, were it not for these international agreements on disarmament, the situation today would be much worse.\n77.\tOn the initiative of the Soviet Union, with the active support of the States of the socialist community and other peace-loving countries, the General Assembly has adopted resolutions on the need to convene a world disarmament conference [resolution 2833 (XXVI)]; on the non-use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)]; on the reduction of military budgets of permanent members of the Security Council [resolution 3254 (XXIX)]; and on the drafting of a convention on the prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military purposes {resolution 3264 (XXIX)]. Our task today is to achieve the full implementation of the provisions of these decisions, at the same time exposing the opponents of disarmament and overcoming their resistance, and to obtain the participation of all countries in multilateral treaties on the limitation of the arms race and to make further progress along the road to general and complete disarmament.\n78.\tThe Soviet Government and the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, L. I. Brezhnev, this year personally took an important initiative, that of concluding an agreement on the prohibition of the development and the manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and of new systems of such weapons. The level of the development of modern science and technology is such that there is a serious danger of creating even more terrible weapons than nuclear weapons. It is time to erect a firm barrier to the creation of such weapons by means of producing and concluding an agreement providing for the renunciation by States of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new weapons systems. There is no doubt that any assistance to other States or international organizations in creating these weapons must be precluded. The conclusion of such an agreement would open up new and additional opportunities for the economic, scientific and technological cooperation of States.\n79.\tThe proposal of the Soviet Union on the \\\"conclusion of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests\\\" is also under consideration at this session [see All0241]. The conclusion of such a treaty would further develop the provisions of the Moscow Treaty of 1963, and the 1974 Treaty between the USSR and the United States on the Limitation of Underground Nuclear Weapon Tests [AI9698, annex /].\n80.\tThe prohibition of the creation of new types of weapons of mass destruction and the general prohibition of nuclear-weapon testing would contribute to the strengthening of trust between peoples and to a further improvement of the international climate, and would promote the achievement of the lofty purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n81.\tWe would like to express the hope that the States Members of the United Nations will view the new initiatives of the Soviet Union with sympathy and that the General Assembly will approve them.\n82.\tDisarmament concerns all countries without exception. Genuine peace means a world without weapons. Developing countries have a vital interest in disarmament because it would release considerable amounts of money to carry out urgent tasks of economic and social development. The peoples of capitalist countries, too, have an interest in disarmament because if they wish to overcome their serious economic difficulties to any degree, that is possible only if an end is put to the arms race.\n83.\tFor socialist countries, the struggle for peace, for detente and disarmament is inseparably linked with the struggle for social progress and national independence. This year will mark the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations, on the initiative of the Soviet Union, of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. During the ensuing period the forces of national liberation have won decisive successes in the elimination of the colonial system of imperialism.\n84.\tThe delegation of the Byelorussian SSR congratulates the new Members of the United Nations  the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe on their newly won national independence and State sovereignty.\n85.\tUnfortunately, the remnants of the shameful colonial system and such of its manifestations as racism and apartheid in southern Africa continue to poison the international climate. However, the peoples of the world are determined to make the positive changes which are occurring in the world irreversible and once and for all to eliminate racism, apartheid and the remains of colonialism.\n86.\tAlthough colonial empires have collapsed under the pressure of the national liberation movements, capitalist monopolies and transnational companies continue to remain the principal obstacle to the attainment of economic independence by the liberated countries. We well understand the aspiration of the peoples of developing countries to escape from the clutches of economic backwardness, to put an end to their economic dependence upon developed capitalist countries, to solve the problem of accelerated development and to rid themselves of poverty in their countries. Together with these countries, the socialist States are struggling to free international economic relations from those injustices and colonialist systems which have been implanted in them and which are being cultivated by the forces of imperialism. It was on the basis of this position that the Byelorussian SSR took its stand at the seventh special session of the General Assembly.\n87.\tThe peoples of the young independent States of Africa, Asia and Latin America in the course of building a new life can rely on lie friendly political, economic and moral support of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. The provision of assistance and support to the peoples of those countries is an integral part of the socialist foreign policies. At the same time, we should like to emphasize that the source of this assistance is our national wealth created at the cost of hard work on the part of our people and the conquest of the major difficulties caused by the ordeal of the war.\n88.\tThe socialist States are providing comprehensive assistance not because they have funds to spare which cannot be used at home, not because they want to invest their funds in other countries to exploit their natural resources and to earn profits, but because the cause of the liberation of peoples and the consolidation of the independence of young developing States is dear to socialist countries.\n89.\tThe year 1975 is International Women's Year, which, by the decision of the United Nations, is being celebrated under the motto of \\\"Equality, Development and Peace\\\". In the Byelorussian SSR, as in other socialist countries, women enjoy equal rights with men in all spheres of life.\n90.\tSoviet women are taking an active part in arrangements within the framework of the International Women's Year. The international meeting of women which was held in August this year in the capital of Byelorussia, the Hero City of Minsk, was dedicated to the problems of the participation of women in the struggle against fascism and for lasting and just peace on earth. Its decisions are designed to allow for a new contribution by women of all countries of the world to the struggle for a just and lasting peace on earth.\n91.\tIn the three decades of its existence, the United Nations has proved its viability and usefulness, primarily in the implementation of its chief function, the maintenance of international peace and security. For 30 years now the States Members of the United Nations have been developing multilateral cooperation in accordance with the Charter, which embodies the generally recognized democratic principles of international law, which have stood the test of time. Certain shortcomings in the work of the United Nations can be explained primarily by the fact that certain States have violated, and continue to violate, its Charter, and not by the fact that the Charter is bad. For these reasons, the Byelorussian SSR resolutely opposes all attempts to revise the Charter, whatever form they take. It is not on the revision of the Charter but on the solution of the problems facing the United Nations by means of unswerving observance of the Charter that the efforts of the United Nations must be concentrated.\n92.\tFor 30 years now humanity has been spared a world war. That is a tremendous achievement on the part of the peace-loving forces whose importance is becoming ever greater in the minds of people. In the favorable conditions provided by the reconstruction of international relations on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems and by international detente, the United Nations can and must contribute by its decisions to the strengthening of peace and international security; to the extension of the process of detente to all parts of the world; to giving real content to political detente and supplementing it by military detente; to the attainment of agreement on questions of disarmament; to the elimination of existing hotbeds of tension and conflict and of the remnants of colonialism and its consequences; and to the consolidation of cooperation among all States on the basis of respect for sovereignty and nonintervention in internal affairs, for the purposes of the economic, social and spiritual progress of the peoples of the world.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n146.\t It gives me great pleasure to extend to the President, on behalf of my delegation, our heartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. I am fully confident, that, with his known sagacity and prudence, he will lead the meetings of our session to success, and he will, no doubt, fulfill to the best of his ability the great responsibilities entrusted to him.\n147.\tI am also pleased to avail myself of this opportunity to express here my delegation's appreciation of the President of the previous session of the General Assembly, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria. Thanks to his abilities, all those historical and important decisions and recommendations were adopted during the twenty-ninth session and the seventh special session.\n148.\tI am further pleased to commend the great efforts exerted by Mr. Kurt Waldheim in fulfilling his responsibilities as Secretary-General of the United Nations towards achieving the Organization's objectives of maintaining world peace and security.\n149.\tIn the name of my country's delegation, I extend congratulations to Mozambique, Cape Verde, and Sao Tome and Principe for the victory they have been able to secure, and for the independence achieved by dint of their own efforts. I am deeply gratified to see the delegations of these States take their places here among us The Sultanate of Oman shares the world community's aspirations that the world will, in the near future, witness the disappearance of all vestiges of colonialist and racist regimes.\n150 This year several encouraging positive steps have been taken along the path leading to the consolidation of international peace and security and or consolidating detente among States. However, there remain many pressuring international problems which are closely intertwined with the issues of world peace and concord. Those require special consideration and attention.\n151.\tThe cruel situation imposed on the Palestinian people, and in which they have been forced to exist, makes it incumbent on this Organization to take strict and more effective measures to put an end to the afflictions and the sufferings of these people. Their rights were flouted and denied, their wealth pillaged and their property usurped. Nor was this the end of the matter, for they were further driven away from their country, and their very existence as a people was questioned, and some went even as far as to deny their existence.\n152.\tPeace in the Middle East cannot be achieved unless Israel withdraws completely from all the occupied Arab territories and fully recognizes the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The second disengagement agreement between the Egyptian and the Israeli forces in the Sinai is a significant step towards peace and constitutes further proof of the fact that the Arabs prefer a peaceful solution.\n153.\tHowever, we should bear in mind that that step will not by itself bring peace. All peace-loving countries and the United Nations, as an effective international Organization, should do their utmost to take effective steps for the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), both of which call for the total withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories and for Israel's return to the pre-June 1967 borders and its full recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people.\n154.\tThe fulfillment of these conditions is a prerequisite for a just and durable peace in the Middle East. The intransigence of the racist regime in Israel; its defiance of international law; its disregard of the United Nations Charter and various resolutions; its determination not to heed world public opinion, which calls upon it to desist from its illegal practices in occupied Palestine, to refrain from repeated aggressions against southern Lebanon, to withdraw from the territories of three Arab States Members of the United Nations which Israel has occupied by armed aggression and to abandon its plans to Judaize and change the character of the Holy Places in Jerusalem and Hebron all constitute a serious blow to the chances of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n155.\tMy delegation joins with those who have called for the strongest and severest sanctions against Israel, and in so doing continues to uphold the principles of this Organization in response to its close interpretation of the Charter and the expectations of the peoples of the world in regard to the United Nations.\n156.\tThe tragedy of the Holy Al-Ibrahimi Mosque calls for our undiverted attention, and it is our view that this Organization should put an end to the flagrant violations by the Zionist authorities of Islamic and non-Islamic Holy Places in the land of Palestine. The Al-Ibrahimi shrine is an Islamic mosque, in the full sense of that term, and its sanctity and holy status should be preserved. Aggression against any part of that Mosque constitutes a violation of Islamic sanctities.\n157.\tThe concern of my Government for the consolidation of world peace and security lies behind its full support for the efforts aimed at the declaration of zones of peace and nuclear-free zones in the Middle East, the Indian Ocean, South Asia, Africa and Latin\nAmerica. The establishment of those zones would pave the way for the world at large to live in peace and to be secure against these lethal weapons. My Government further supports steps taken towards putting an end to nuclear tests. In this regard, it does not approve of any action that may adversely affect the environment and consequently expose man's health and welfare to danger and disturb world security.\n158.\tThe Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] should be based upon the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Chief among these are, first, that all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State; secondly, that States shall refrain from intervening' either directly or indirectly, in the domestic affairs of any other State; thirdly, that States shall achieve international co-operation in economic and other fields on the basis of equality, mutual respect and benefit for all.\n159.\tIn this connexion, I regret the statement made by the Foreign Minister of Democratic Yemen [2371st meeting] to the effect that his country supports a bunch of outlaws in the southern part of my country. This constitutes a flagrant interference in our domestic affairs. It is a violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations and is absolutely unacceptable to us. I ask Democratic Yemen, which is a neighboring country with which we want nothing but understanding and co-operation, to desist from such interference in the common interest of our two peoples.\n160.\tIn the economic sphere, we are happy to note that the concept of the economic interdependence of sovereign States is an established reality nowadays. This is an indication of a definite and positive change in the political atmosphere as a result of which we are also witnessing a new political will to look seriously and effectively into the problems and obstacles that are hindering the economic and social progress of developing nations.\n161.\tIn this regard, a new formulation of economic relations between industrialized countries, on the one hand, and the developing countries, on the other, with a view to working out a new pattern for those relations based on equity and reciprocal interests has come to. be a highly pressing and important matter, as stipulated in the resolutions of the General Assembly's seventh special session.\n162.\tComing now to my country's position with regard to the important issues which urgently require solution, I deem it necessary to refer to the session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which was held from 17 March to 10 May 1975. It was hoped that the Conference would complete a convention that would govern all matters related to the law of the sea. However, the session came to an end without achieving any significant progress in reconciling the views of Member States. That has rendered conditions even more difficult for the attainment of an over-all agreement on the law of the sea.\n163.\tIn its internal legislation, guided by the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, my country has adhered to the concept\nof innocent passage through territorial waters including straits. Our legislation on the right to innocent passage through territorial waters has taken into consideration, in the first place, the interests of international navigation and the need to ensure the continuous and regular movement of shipping, on the one hand, and the protection of its own security and sovereignty, on the other. I wish to affirm here that that legislation is meant first and foremost to serve international navigation itself.\n164.\tIn conclusion, I should like to say that the attention of the whole world is focused on the United Nations as a court of last resort. We have spoken of the positive trend in the political climate and of the birth of a new political will. Needless to say that the primary task before this Assembly, which is meeting in just such a climate is to translate that will into concrete action designed to produce just and reasonable solutions to the problems confronting us all, whether rich or poor, developed or developing.\n165.\tThroughout history my country has always been an apostle of peace and an advocate of friendship and understanding among peoples. We have always called for understanding and co-operation among countries. Consistent with that record we firmly adhere to and stand by the principles of the United Nations. We have complete faith in its role and its responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "257.\t The delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic offers its sincere congratulations to the President on his unanimous election to the high post of President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly, and expresses the hope that under his able guidance the present session will make a fresh contribution to the furthering of the process of the relaxation of international tensions and to the cause of translating into reality the noble ideals of the United Nations.\n258.\tPermit me also to express on behalf of the Mongolian delegation our gratitude to Mr. Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, who has brilliantly discharged his duties as President of two sessions of the General Assembly.\n259.\tI should like also to take this opportunity to welcome the energetic efforts of our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, to enhance the effectiveness of United Nations activities as well as to promote mutual understanding and co-operation among States.\n260.\tThe present session of the General Assembly is taking place in a year which is of special significance for peoples of the whole world. This year, all progressive mankind has jubilantly celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the great victory by the peoples and countries of the anti-Hitler coalition over fascism and militarism. This historic victory of global significance has become an illuminating landmark and has had a powerful impact on world history. It is, indeed, this landmark that produced the historic process that led to a cardinal shift in the balance of forces in favor of peace and progress, to a mighty growth of the national liberation movements and to the complete collapse of the colonial system of imperialism.\n261.\tThe lessons drawn from the past war are both instructive and vitally important today. In this light we see the purposes and goals of the United Nations and the enhancement of the role and efficacy of its activities. The idea of creating a world organization that would be based on a firm alliance of peace-loving nations, and that would safeguard world peace and universal security, was born in the flames of great battles fought by freedom-loving peoples against the Fascist enslavers.\n262.\tThe United Nations, the thirtieth anniversary of which we have just celebrated, declared as its prime objective \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind\\\". Looking back on the three decades that have passed, we can state with confidence that the United Nations, as an important international instrument, has made a considerable contribution to the cause of preserving peace and security.\n263.\tIt is remarkable that the thirtieth anniversary of the ending of the Second World War and the foundation of the United Nations is being commemorated in a new and more favorable international situation.\n264.\tThanks to the consistent efforts by the countries of the socialist community and other peace-loving nations, the process of relaxation of international tension is gaining a more and more stable character and the principles of peaceful coexistence are increasingly applied in relations between States with differing social systems. On this basis, a tendency towards a fundamental transformation of international relations and the establishment of a new, just and democratic type of relations among States, as well as towards a new international economic order is gaining new strength.\n265.\tIn the opinion of my delegation all this testifies to the gradual ripening of the objective prerequisites for a transformation of the whole system of international relations in such a manner as would reliably guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of all nations, and peaceful relations, equal and mutually beneficial co-operation among all States, large and small.\n266.\tThe development of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States favorably influences the cause of furthering and deepening the process of relaxation of international tension. The periodic Soviet-American summit meetings and their fruitful and concrete results signify an important turning-point in further improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, and represent a tangible contribution to the cause of preventing a world war and preserving peace and international security.\n267.\tThe process of relaxation of tension has found its most visible manifestation in Europe. The fruitful outcome of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe marks the beginning of a new era in the process of detente, which has become the basic and prevailing trend in the political development of the world today. The Final Act, signed at the Conference at Helsinki, is a historic document of broad international significance. The Mongolian People's Republic assesses the results of the Conference as a great victory for all those who persistently stand for the consolidation of peace and international security, as a new convincing proof of the successful achievement of the program of peace set forth by the Soviet Union.\n268.\tThe experience of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe testifies to the fact that, with scrupulous and persistent efforts by nations, it is possible to find a common approach for, and mutually acceptable solutions to, even the most intricate and difficult problems. We entertain the hope that this positive experience of Europe will serve as a stimulus for the solution of similar problems in other continents.\n269.\tThe greatest event of the year is the historic victory of the peoples of Viet Nam and Cambodia, which has demonstrated the collapse of the imperialist policy of aggression and support for the anti- popular regimes in the countries of Indo-China.\n270.\tThe victory of the national liberation movements of the peoples of Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos has put an end to a dangerous hotbed of tension in South-East Asia, has substantially changed the balance of power in this region in favor of peace- loving and progressive forces, and has also facilitated the over-all improvement of the international atmosphere.\n271.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic, which has firmly sided with the courageous Vietnamese people in all stages of their heroic struggle, lends its full support to the application of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam for admission to the United Nations, considering\n. that they have earned an inalienable right to be Members of our Organization as a result of their long and just struggle for peace, freedom and independence.\n272.\tThe improvement of the international situation and the historic victory of the peoples of Indo-China provide favorable prospects for the consolidation of peace in Asia, which as a consequence of the policy of imperialist aggression in the post-war years has more than once become an arena of local warfare that threatened to grow into general conflict. The interests of the peoples of Asia and the cause of universal security demand that durable peace be established on this vast and most populous continent. To achieve this, it is necessary, first of all, to do away with all the areas of tension still existing in Asia.\n273.\tIt is obvious that, without at least diminishing and removing the threat of wars, eliminating the hotbeds of conflict and creating a reliable system of security for all States, it is impossible successfully to solve the problems, common to many of the Asian countries, of overcoming the economic, scientific and technological lag and of ensuring speedy progress.\n274.\tMy delegation considers that under these circumstances the creation of a system of collective security in Asia has become an urgent task of the day.\n275.\tThe historic African-Asian Conference, held at Bandung in 1955, spoke out as far back as 20 years ago, for the transformation of Asia into a continent of peace and co-operation. The well-known principles of Bandung, together with other fundamental ideas and principles, could serve as a basis for peaceful interrelations among Asian States irrespective of differences in their social order.\n276.\tWhile standing for the strengthening of peace in Asia, we by no means ignore the complexity of existing problems on the continent and the difficulties in the way of creating a system of collective security that are caused by reasons of an objective and subjective nature.\n277.\tWe are fully aware that it took almost a quarter of a century for the European nations to reach an agreement on questions of security and co-operation. And there is no doubt that in Asia, too, a certain time will be required to find a practical solution to this vitally important problem. But it is exactly the experience of Europe that persuades all of us that, only by persistent and consistent efforts by all States on the continent without exception is it possible to achieve those successes that have been obtained by the European nations in strengthening peace and security, mutual understanding and co-operation.\n278.\tThe actions of those who attempt to deny the international significance of the European experience reveal them as ardent opponents of detente, striving to vitiate the efforts of peoples aimed at creating a stable basis for peace and international security, openly hamper the implementation of the idea of collective security in Asia, frustrate the emergence of constructive measures towards the limitation of the arms race and towards disarmament, in order to achieve their great Power aims of hegemony and expansionism joining with the most reactionary forces of imperialism.\n279.\tWe are convinced that collective efforts aimed at the creation of a system guaranteeing the security of Asian States will yield results. In this connexion I should like to stress the importance of overcoming the spirit of disunity and distrust cultivated for centuries by colonizers and reactionaries in Asia. Therefore the normalization and development of bilateral and multilateral contacts among Asian States at all levels, as well as of a broad exchange of views on substantial problems for all of us, acquire greater significance.\n280.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic supports the expansion and deepening of such contacts in the search for ways and means of ensuring Asian security on a collective basis, with the participation of all States of the continent.\n281.\tWe consider that the United Nations, as a global organization for collective security, must make a worthy contribution to the cause of ensuring a durable peace in Asia.\n282.\tThe Mongolian delegation cannot fail to express its concern over the continuing explosive situation in the Middle East, which threatens peace and security not only in Asia but all over the world.\n283.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic considers that only the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967, the safeguarding of the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine and the creation of conditions for ensuring the security of all States of the region will pave the way for a just solution of the Middle East problem. In our opinion, to find a solution to the whole complex of Middle East problems it will be necessary to reconvene, at an appropriate time, the Geneva Peace Conference in which the representatives of the PLO should participate on an equal footing with the other participants.\n284.\tWe consider that the resolutions of the twenty- ninth session of the General Assembly, which supported the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine and recognized the international status of the PLO, are of positive significance for rendering justice to the Arab people of Palestine.\n285.\tThe positive settlement of the problems related to Korea occupies an important place in the strengthening of peace and security on the Asian continent. The peaceful reunification of Korea on a democratic basis, in full accord with the national aspirations of the Korean people, can be achieved only provided that the United States troops stationed in South Korea are withdrawn. Proceeding from that principle, the Mongolian delegation supports the adoption of the draft resolution on the creation of favorable conditions for converting the armistice into a durable peace in Korea and accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea [AI10I9I and Add.1-3].\n286.\tThe situation in Cyprus remains unsettled. We believe that the problem of Cyprus should be solved in conformity with the well-known resolutions of the Security Council, without outside interference and on the basis of full respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus.\n287.\tWe consider that the process of relaxation of tensions will be set on the most solid foundation if further concrete and effective measures are taken to limit the arms race and to further disarmament. The continuing arms race is not only incompatible with the spirit and aims of the process of detente but it profoundly contradicts the interests of strengthening peace and security. Detente and disarmament are inseparable components of the machinery for strengthening peace and international security.\n288.\tIt is necessary to note that positive changes in the world facilitate the adoption of co-ordinated measures to limit and check the arms race in order to pave the way for the solution of the most crucial problem facing mankind: general and complete disarmament.\n289.\tDue to the constructive efforts of the socialist countries and many other peace-loving States which ( have actively put forward concrete proposals, negotiations on disarmament problems today have a more tangible and practical content.\n290.\tMy delegation notes with satisfaction that in recent years negotiations on disarmament have been notably intensified, both within the framework of the bodies already in existence and through new conferences and negotiations.\n291.\tOne of the most important tasks in the struggle for disarmament remains the strengthening and ensuring in every possible way of the universality of international treaties and agreements now in force in the field of disarmament, in particular the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We should actively seek the strengthening of those treaties through universal adherence to and strict implementation of all their provisions. In this connexion we emphasize the positive significance of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The participants in the Conference reaffirmed their firm support for the Treaty, their unfailing devotion to its principles and objectives and their commitment to implement, completely and more effectively, its provisions. It is important to note that in the Final Declaration adopted by the Conference [AIC.111068, annex /] there is a clear definition of the role that the Treaty has been called upon to play in international efforts aimed at preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons, halting the nuclear arms race, taking effective measures for nuclear disarmament and broader co-operation in the field of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\n292.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic supports the establishment of nuclear-free zones in different parts of the world. We approach the problem of the establishment of such zones primarily from its close connexion with the provisions of the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n293.\tThe complete prohibition of nuclear tests has become a problem of great urgency and extreme importance. We consider that the complete cessation of nuclear-weapon tests in all environments, including underground tests, would greatly promote the achievement of the objective of nuclear disarmament; hence the delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic warmly welcomes and endorses the new initiative of the Soviet Union for the conclusion of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear weapon tests.\n294.\tAt present the progress of contemporary science and technology has reached such a level that these achievements could be used for purposes of development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction. In this connexion we fully support the proposal of the Soviet Union for the conclusion of an agreement on the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction and consider that proposal timely and urgent. To reach an understanding on concluding such an international instrument would represent a constructive contribution to the cause of\n, curbing the arms race and promoting the supplementing of political detente with military detente.\n295.\tThe delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic places particular importance on the identical drafts of a convention on the prohibition of military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques, which were submitted on 21 August by the Soviet Union and the United States in the Disarmament Committee [A110027, annex II, sects. 24 and 25], We consider that these drafts, being a concrete manifestation of effective co-operation between two great Powers, are also an important practical step towards the restriction of the arms race.\n296.\tWe believe that the participation of all countries of the world, in the first place of all the nuclear Powers and States with considerable military potential, in the efforts to curb the arms race, is a necessary precondition for elaborating effective and radical measures in the field of disarmament.\n297.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic actively supports the idea of convening a world disarmament conference. It stands for immediate practical preparation of the conference, which in our opinion should add a considerable impetus for bringing together and intensifying the efforts of all States in seeking new ways and means to solve various disarmament issues.\n298.\tThe implementation of the resolution of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly on reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and the utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries [resolution 3093 (XXVlll)], could serve the aims of further normalization of the international situation.\n299.\tSince the last session of the General Assembly many important events have taken place in the field of decolonization.\n300.\tMy delegation welcomes the birth of new independent States\u2014Mozambique, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe and congratulates the representatives of those States on their admission to the United Nations. We consider that, with the final completion of the process of decolonization, one of the dangerous hotbeds of tension in international relations would be removed.\n301.\tIt should be pointed out that in southern Africa there still exist strongholds of racism, where the indigenous population lives under the regime of apartheid, which has been resolutely condemned by the United Nations as a crime against mankind,\n302.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic is for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, the fifteenth anniversary of which is being commemorated today, as well as for a strict implementation of resolutions and conventions on decolonization and elimination of racial discrimination.\n303.\tWe submit that the programme'Of action and concrete recommendation elaborated by many authoritative forums of Africa and non-aligned countries, and by the World Congress of Peace Forces held in Moscow, are of particular importance for the cause of complete decolonization and elimination of racial discrimination.\n304.\tBrutal repressions carried out by the Fascist junta in Chile against Chilean patriots and democratic and progressive forces in that country continue to evoke deep indignation and protest on the part of world public opinion. The Mongolian People's Republic resolutely condemns the gross violations of human rights and democratic freedoms in Chile. We demand that the Chilean junta stop its bloody repressions and immediately release Senator Luis Corvalan and other patriots of Chile.\n305.\tDetente creates favorable conditions for the development of mutually beneficial economic co-operation among States with different social systems. In turn, the development of just and mutually advantageous international economic relations constitutes a reliable material basis for further normalization of the international climate and for promoting an atmosphere of mutual trust among nations.\n306.\tIn the final documents of the sixth and seventh special sessions, and the resolutions of the twenty- ninth session of the General Assembly, the close correlation between political and economic issues has been clearly formulated.\n307.\tThe deterioration of the economic conditions of the developing countries as an immediate consequence of the discriminatory economic and trade policies of the imperialist Powers makes urgent the task of restructuring international economic relations in accordance with the requirements of developing truly equal and mutually advantageous co-operation among States.\n308.\tIn this connexion my delegation supports the consistent implementation of the fundamental principles of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, which will be in keeping with the interests of all States, the developing countries above all.\n309.\tAs is known, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea still continues its deliberations. The Mongolian People's Republic being a land-locked country, has a special interest in a just solution to problems related to fuller realization of the essential rights of land-locked countries to free access to the sea and to the international sea-bed zones. At the same time the interests of both coastal and land-locked States should equally be taken into consideration.\n310.\tThe positive role played by the United Nations in preventing a world war, its valuable contribution to the strengthening of international peace and security, have proved to be the major achievement of its 30 years of activity. This testifies once again to the vitality of the Charter of the United Nations that has stood the test of time. At present the Charter, in its existing form, continues to meet the requirements of the day and to serve the cause of universal peace and international security, in particular the needs of further promoting the process of detente. It also contributes to strengthening friendly relations and the development of mutually beneficial co-operation among States.\n311.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic is of the opinion that under present circumstances the main objective of the States Members of the United Nations should be strict fulfillment of their obligations under the Charter. The Mongolian People's Republic will continue to exert its efforts towards further strengthening the role and effectiveness of the United Nations on the basis of strict observance of its Charter, and towards broader utilization of the vast potential embodied in the Charter.\n312.\tThe relaxation of international tensions further enhances the prestige and role of the United Nations and assigns it new responsible tasks of developing and consolidating all the positive trends in the world, and of making them durable and irreversible.\n313.\tIt is the hope of the Mongolian delegation that constructive and fruitful co-operation of the States Members of the United Nations, the realization of the provisions of the United Nations Charter, and due implementation of many positive decisions by the General Assembly, will still further strengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations and its authority in international affairs in the best interests of all peoples of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t I hope 1 am not too much mistaken if I say that it has been a matter of conscience in order, as it were, to justify the trip to New York that in previous years the representatives of countries of the size of ours have stood up to speak time and again at every session, to remind the world or if not the world which perhaps thought it could do without their opinions  at least all men of good will and peace-loving men of the interest they also and perhaps especially they  feel in the arrangement and the harmonious ordering of the affairs of our planet.\n2.\tFor some time now much if not everything has been changing. Thus neither military power nor geographical size is any longer the sign or synonym of wisdom and reason.\n3.\tIt is without doubt to this positive change in our outlook that we owe the joy and pleasure of congratulating the Prime Minister of Luxembourg on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. His outstanding intellectual and moral qualities and his great competence which have made of him a remarkable statesman in Luxembourg and in Europe, a country and a continent with which Burundi enjoys the very best relations, as he is aware, are also guarantees to us of the success of the work of our Assembly under his courteous but firm direction.\n4.\tOn behalf of my country and delegation I should like to pay a well deserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, who has just successfully concluded the work of the seventh special session of the General Assembly\nand brought the proceedings of the twenty-ninth regular session to a fine conclusion. Our Organization will long remember the decisive victories that were won thanks to the determination of that worthy son of Africa.\n5.\tI should be failing in my duty if I did not immediately discharge the agreeable task of conveying to the Secretary-General the sincere greetings that the Head of State of Burundi, Lieutenant-General Michel Micombero, addresses to him on behalf of the people of Burundi organized within their Parti de l'unite pour le progres national, on behalf of his Government and on his own behalf, just as he wishes to congratulate all the seen and unseen, known and unknown, members of the staff on their tireless efforts in the service of international peace and security.\n6.\tOn 16 September 1975 three new States solemnly joined the great family of the United Nations, thus bringing the number of Member States to 141. My delegation is pleased to see seated as free and independent nations the new African States of Mozambique, Cape Verde, and Sao Tome and Principe. The efforts of the freedom-fighters of those countries, to the great satisfaction of the peoples that supported them in their long liberation struggle for self-determination and independence, have yielded the fruits we had every reason to expect of them. Let us hope that our brothers and sisters in those countries will accept our sincere congratulations and our welcome among us. We are convinced that their experience will be of great benefit to the world Organization.\n7.\tOn 24 October 1975 we will celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations. It has accordingly entered a new and decisive phase of its evolution. The recklessness of childhood and the irrational selfishness of young adolescence are over and must now give way to the responsibility of the maturity that is beginning to seep into our Organization.\n8.\tThe end of the third United Nations decade coincides with the end of the era of blind power domination, colonialism and the most outrageous imperialism, a time when the exploitation and plundering of the world by the strong was organized on a grand scale in the name of either liberty or socialism, or simply democracy. That era, which is coming to an end, has seen the slow maturing and arduous birth of the third world, which has come to occupy its place among the strong, a right it enjoys by virtue of the fact that it includes two thirds of mankind on its territory and vast resources under it over which it intends henceforth to exercise full sovereignty.\n9.\tIn our view, then, that is the political basis for the new international economic order which repeatedly and in different places has been tirelessly called for by the third world.\n10.\tAn attempt has been made to look for aggressiveness in what is simple logic, merely because this offends old habits, particularly that of seeing and accepting as normal the fact that the third world should thank Europe or North America for granting it an infinitesimal share of the profits they are earning from the exploitation of its raw materials.\n11.\tThat aggressiveness was also discerned in the solemn declaration on general policy unanimously adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] at its tenth ordinary session no doubt because the African countries have decided to remain united and to strengthen their vigilance in the face of the maneuvers of imperialism.\n12.\tThat aggressiveness has also been discerned in the conclusions of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Lima from 25 to 30 August, which solemnly proclaimed the rejection of all forms of subordination or dependence and all interference or pressure political, economic or military. It is true that the economic declaration adopted at that Conference accused imperialism of having monopolized international economic affairs by monetary, tariff and trade methods.\n13.\tIt would be tiresome to enumerate the occasions when the poor have been accused of aggressiveness because they have dared boldly to claim their rights, of which they had long been deprived.\n14.\tLet us merely recall that last year, at the sixth special session of the General Assembly, an attempt was made to put into operation machinery which would do away once and for all with the era of unequal relations among nations. At that time we drew up a Declaration and a Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-Vl) and 3202 (S-V1)\\, an order which would be based on justice, thanks to which and within which co-operation among all States would very shortly at least that was our hope bridge the vast gulf dividing the developed and the developing countries.\n15.\tOn 12 December 1974 the General Assembly reflected precisely that by adopting the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)]. I would remind Members that 120 countries voted in favor of that resolution and only six countries voted against it. It is also worth recalling that in the preamble to that resolution the Assembly stressed the fact that that Charter would be an effective instrument for the establishment of a new system of international economic relations based on equity, sovereign equality and the interdependence of the interests of developed and developing countries.\n16.\tSuffice it for me to refer briefly to the Conference of Developing Countries on Raw Materials which, in February last, at Dakar, highlighted the special problems confronting our countries in this field, and to recall similarly the Lima Conference which was, for the non-aligned countries, an excellent preparatory meeting for the seventh special session and the present session.\n17.\tAlthough very encouraging and even, in certain respects, an agreeable surprise, the results of the seventh special session did not entirely satisfy our\nappetite. We had hoped that at that session concrete measures would be taken to bridge rapidly, if not immediately, the still sadly large gap between our just claims and the substance of the resolution adopted at the seventh special session [resolution 3362 (S-VII)],\n18.\tCertainly the unjust bases of the present economic system are beginning to collapse under the just and constant pressure exerted by the developing countries with an occasional helping hand from Europe which has now decided to make friends and equal partners of its former subjects.\n19.\tHowever, the just and equitable distribution of prosperity is not something that is going to happen tomorrow, if only because some of those who benefit from the system still consider sharing and equality as catastrophes from which they must protect themselves at all costs.\n20.\tMy delegation would like to suggest to those Powers which still favor the absurd situation produced by the old economic order to consider how great would be the advantage to them of anticipating events by fostering the debut of a new era in international economic relations, a debut that is in any case inevitable, In so doing, my delegation is not unaware of the narrowing of differences which occurred at the seventh special session. We simply wish, while expressing our pleasure at the fact that all States have chosen consultation and rejected confrontation, to express the hope, without undue optimism, that the time for recriminations and threats has passed for ever.\n21.\tThe confrontation of former days, objectively speaking, acted as a powerful brake on the execution of development Programs which many people hoped would become the essential activity of the United Nations together, of course, with its major role as an instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security.\n22.\tMy delegation and my country fervently hope that the practice of consultation will now make it possible for our Organization to transform itself in such a way as to become the ideal instrument of development and the regulator par excellence of co-operation.\n23.\tMy country, because of its size, is among the smallest States in the world; it is buried within the interior of the African continent, where the density of its population 130 inhabitants per square kilometer  and its galloping population growth 2.3 per cent per year are making its present situation among the 25 poorest countries on earth particularly difficult. Thus we fully appreciate the great value of the development Program undertaken in Burundi in various fields by the United Nations and its specialized agencies.\n24.\tThe President of the Republic of Burundi, Lieutenant-General Micombero, misses no opportunity to convey his gratitude and his satisfaction to the Secretary-General and to the directors-general and other leaders of the specialized agencies of the United Nations to whom and this is something which he has always made a point of saying and which I should like to remind you of here he has said that neither the current unfavorable situation nor the scope of the co-operation Program can ever justify our country's being drawn into any kind of shameful compromise.\n25.\tSince the interests of our people do not damage those of others, they are our only guide in our options and preferences.\n26.\tIt is in this spirit that we shall approach the next phase of our already fruitful co-operation. We feel, in particular, that everything possible must be done to make integrated development action entirely effective and to strengthen it within the framework of the new more favorable arrangements for the poorest countries. Thus we would like to draw your attention to two human aspects of co-operation, since the failure to take these aspects fully into account has been at the bottom of so many failures and unfortunate misunderstandings.\n27.\tThe first of these aspects is that, contrary to the current practice in certain organizations, experts should be assigned to national authorities as collaborators and not as judges of efforts, however groping they may be, by the Governments of States, which we never tire of emphasizing are sovereign.\n28.\tThe second aspect is that the realistic action of experts in the field should never be overlooked, or systematically challenged, nor above all opposed without serious grounds by headquarters officials motivated sometimes by interests incompatible with those of the States concerned, which are primarily responsible for projects. My delegation, when the time comes, will explain the practical situations to which it wishes to refer here.\n29.\tThe seventh special session laid particular stress on special measures to be contemplated for relieving, if not actually satisfying, all the needs of land-locked countries. It has thus been established that these countries, particularly when they have the sad privilege of being among the poorest of the \\\"have-nots\\\", can really make no progress in development unless special measures can be taken in their favor. It seems to me superfluous to remind the Assembly of our constant proposal that guarantees should be given to landlocked countries of free access to the sea. My delegation would simply like to confine itself here to expressing its gratitude to the Secretary-General, who was good enough to propose the creation of a special fund to finance the supplementary transport costs which have to be borne by developing countries with no access to the sea.\n30.\tOur central position on the spine of Africa, where we have today the good fortune to be surrounded only by brothers and friends, has convinced us that safeguard measures will never be watertight and that the new economic order will be illusory unless they are both based on total co-operation and understanding among neighbors, which would form nuclei around which and on the basis of which bigger groupings would be constructed.\n31.\tThat is the view of my Government, expressed in these terms by Lieutenant-General Micombero, President of the Republic of Burundi:\n\\\"My country is convinced that the establishment of this new international economic order will be brought about all the more rapidly if the victims of the injustices of the present order become more aware of the need for it and do everything in their power to accelerate its establishment. We, for our part, include among these means the establishment,\nas soon as possible, of a concrete Program, appropriate machinery and practical instruments for co-operation among all the poor relations of the present economic order, beginning with those whose interests are naturally linked.\\\"\nThat is why we are happy to have launched, along with the sister-Republics of Zaire and Rwanda, the idea and project of an economic community of the great lake countries, which will shortly go into operation and which will be joined, we very much hope, by our friends, which, like us, have borders on the same great African lakes.\n32.\tThe delegation of my country to the seventh special session also indicated our interest in the building of various communications between Burundi and its natural partners in East Africa.\n33.\tBeyond this Program of co-operation, which we call local and which we view as being extremely important, my delegation is a fervent supporter of the need for the fullest possible inter-African co-operation; that is the only co-operation, in our view, which would enable our continent to become a serious and credible partner at the very many tables at which countries meet to negotiate and at which its presence is becoming ever more in demand.\n34.\tWhether it is the embryonic Afro-Arab cooperation or the renewal, rather further away, of the Lome Convention, my delegation believes that Africa has everything to gain by presenting itself at negotiations after having established, at least at the regional level, an internal co-operation Program.\n35.\tPermit me now to turn to some political subjects, some of which have become traditional, in order to give the views of my delegation and my country on each of them, before concluding on the necessary revision of the Charter of our Organization.\n36.\tWhile, for two thirds of mankind the major item on the agenda is above all development, for others it is disarmament. We are told inter alia that nuclear tests should be ended, that the manufacture of intercontinental missiles should be reduced and that it should be agreed that at least no indiscriminate use should be made of a whole arsenal of toys, each more deadly than the other, but which people still do not want to give up.\n37.\tMy delegation deplores, and with good reason, the fact that so many billions are spent on the manufacture of deadly weapons, while at the same time millions of men and women are dying I was simply going to say of hunger.\n38.\tWe are therefore in favor of disarmament, provided that it is general and complete. But for it to be general and complete, we must not only prevent the manufacture of new weapons, but decide upon and actually destroy existing stockpiles. Until general and complete disarmament is brought about and we believe that at present that is not feasible we think that every State has the right and even the duty to acquire the necessary means for its defence.\n39.\tAmong the Powers which boast so loudly about disarmament, some are distributing freely whole shiploads of arms to the Angolan liberation movements. In Burundi we are following with special\nattention the development of the situation in the Territory.\n40.\tWe firmly support, just as we congratulate, all those who have exerted and continue to exert their influence and talents in an attempt to break the bloody deadlock of the Angolan problem. That was what Lieutenant-General Michel Micombero, President of my country, tried to do when, at the beginning of August, he issued the following urgent appeal to the movements and those who support them in their undertaking:\n\\\"The alarming problem of Angola, which is causing us the gravest concern, could easily be solved if all the liberation movements would listen to reason and agree to use the good offices ceaselessly offered to them by Africa.\n\\\"We have to note and denounce here the fact that our failure in that country also derives from the enemies of Africa who are arousing on all sides the appetite for power and are trying to persuade their antagonistic proteges that victory will come to them through force of arms. We would like urgently to appeal to those supplying arms for this fratricidal struggle in Angola to cease their deliveries. There have already been too many innocent victims.\\\"\n41.\tWe continue to hope that on 11 November next, the day scheduled for the independence of their country, our brothers will become free and sovereign once again in an Angola which will be united and, we hope, prosperous.\n42.\tThe southern part of the African continent remains subject to Governments whose philosophy is repugnant to the human conscience.\n43.\tIn Zimbabwe, the rebel Ian Smith continues to reject the principle of government by the black majority.\n44.\tThe Pretoria authorities, whose philosophy of government is based on apartheid and racism, continue to flout the international community by illegally administering the Territory of Namibia, which is the responsibility of the United Nations.\n45.\tMy country continues to believe that if the United Nations were to demand it in the final analysis this means if the great Powers so wished the Organization could compel South Africa to hand over to it the administration of Namibia.\n46.\tOur position on all the other questions relating to southern Africa is identical with that of the OAU. Burundi will never agree to deal with Pretoria or with the Salisbury rebels until they recognize unambiguously the principle of government by the black majority and until they actually and clearly renounce their theory and policy of apartheid and racial discrimination.\n47.\tBurundi's position is also identical with that of the OAU on the problem of the liberation of the peoples of Western Sahara and so-called French Somali Coast. Our brothers can be sure of our unswerving support for them in their struggle for self-determination.\n48.\tIn the Middle East the Arab Republic of Egypt and the State of Israel, with the assistance of the\nSecretary of State of the United States, have just concluded a new disengagement agreement in Sinai My country would like to congratulate the Egyptian and Israeli authorities, as well as Mr. Kissinger, on the step that has thus been taken towards peace.'\n49.\tIn spite of that agreement, tension which could explode at any moment will remain until a final and complete solution has been found. Israel's refusal to restore Arab territories which it has been occupying by force and to recognize the national rights of the people of Palestine is based only on its arrogance since the Arab countries no longer challenge its right to exist within secure and recognized frontiers.\n50.\tIt is for that reason that in that conflict the Republic of Burundi supports the just positions of fraternal Arab countries, in particular those just and peaceful positions of the Arab Republic of Egypt. The Republic of Burundi believes that the efforts now under way to defuse the situation in that part of the world should be encouraged and supported by all Members of the United Nations, and that those efforts should be accelerated and extended to all zones of conflict.\n51.\tAlmost 30 years ago the United Nations was confronted for the first time with the Korean problem. The development of the situation in Korea is closely linked with the history of the United Nations. The responsibilities of our Organization are immense in this problem. It was in particular because of the cold war that Korea was divided in order to meet certain strategic needs in Asia. In May 1972 the President of North Korea, Kim U Sung, formulated the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification of the country and greater national unity. In July of the same year the authorities of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and those of South Korea signed an agreement on the three principles of the independent and peaceful reunification of their country. In 1973 the General Assembly confirmed that agreement. However, Korea remains a country divided against the will of its people. That is why my delegation believes that the question of Korea should be settled by the Korean people themselves, without any outside interference.\n52.\tThe draft resolution annexed to document A/10191 and Add. 1-3, of which Burundi is a sponsor, calls for the dissolution of the United Nations Command, the withdrawal from South Korea of all foreign armed forces stationed there under the United Nations flag, and the replacement of the Armistice Agreement by a peace agreement concluded between the parties actually concerned in the Armistice Agreement in Korea. My delegation hopes that at this session the General Assembly will finally adopt that draft resolution.\n53.\tAmong the important events of this year, it is fitting to mention the heroic victory of the peoples of Indo-China. The collapse of the imperialist forces in Indo-China confirms the invincibility of a people determined to remain free and independent. On behalf of my delegation, I should like to pay the warmest tribute to those peoples, who are such a credit to us today.\n54.\tThe Republic of Burundi, which had always recognized the Provisional Revolutionary Government of Cambodia, welcomes with the greatest joy the\nauthentic representatives of the Cambodian people to this Assembly. After five years of fierce struggle, they have returned to their seats among us.\n55.\tThe satisfaction of my delegation would have been even greater if we had not had occasion to deplore the veto cast by the United States against the admission of the two Viet Nams to the United Nations. My delegation deems untenable the comparison made between the applications for admission of the two Vietnamese Republics and the problem of Korea, a country which, in the view of the United Nations, remains divided against the will of its people, who aspire to its peaceful and independent reunification.\n56.\tMy delegation would express the hope that the United States will no longer resort to the veto to oppose the admission of States that quite obviously fulfill all the requirements of the Charter.\n57.\tIn the three decades of its existence, the United Nations has undergone a radical transformation. Quite clearly, the Organization is entering a new, historic phase which could certainly not have been foreseen at the time of its foundation. Consequently, its Charter should be subject to appropriate review so that the necessary changes can be made to it.\n58.\tThat is why we feel that we should continue to consider the matter of a review of the Charter of the United Nations. My delegation believes that important amendments in this regard should relate to extension of the powers of the General Assembly and, above all, a redistribution of the powers of the Security Council.\n59.\tOn the question of the right of veto, my country can only wonder whether the United Nations is composed of five States and more than a hundred other State-like entities, or whether our Organization is made up of 141 equally sovereign States.\n60.\tIt remains quite clear to us that a country with a great population, exercising sovereignty over vast territory and similarly extensive resources, naturally has and logically and juridically, therefore, must have more weight than others which, being smaller, exercise their functions and sovereignty, just as large families do, over smaller areas.\n61.\tHowever, we believe that the right to defy all others cannot be justly exercised unless it is a matter of safeguarding the interest of groupings larger than national communities.\n62.\tHence in the absence of the pure and simple renunciation of the right of veto by those who enjoy it today, my Government would hope that this right will henceforth be distributed on a more equitable geographical basis and that, instead of being the exclusive possession of a few States, will become the prerogative of the various continental organizations.\n63.\tI had hoped to conclude this statement on a cheerful note which, I thought, might be inspired by the highly topical subject of International Women s Year.\n64\tUnfortunately, however, this Year has not been so encouraging as to allow us to forget the poverty and privation which is the daily lot of far too many people in the world.\n65\tWe in Burundi therefore feel that when less than 25'per cent of the world's school-age children have\nhad any schooling, and when for every 100,000 persons there are only one doctor and less than five hospital beds available to them and I shall not prolong this list; there would be no point in doing so  there is something wrong with counting heads among those who are privileged, because this would inevitably lead to establishing statistics about those, far too numerous, whom fortune has obstinately forgotten. What is to be gained, indeed, in finding out that there are more women than men, or vice versa, among those who can do nothing to ease their poverty?\n66.\tIn the circumstances, the International Women's Year has been designed and organized in my country to open the eyes of the women of Burundi to the difficult situation of all, and to the particular responsibilities of women to improve the situation, rather than to make them more aware of the futile or inevitable problems of their sex.\n67.\tWith this conviction and with this realism, the women of Burundi have taken part in all international meetings organized within the framework of this Year dedicated to women, of whom Patrice Lumumba once said that in training women we are training a whole generation. We hope this can be done without detracting from their charm and beauty.\n\n\n"

His election is a recognition of his qualities of leadership, of which the Assembly has already had proof.\n43.\tI should like also to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, who presided with distinction over the twenty-ninth session of the Assembly and its recently concluded seventh special session. His address at the closing session of the twenty-ninth General Assembly struck an eloquent note of conciliation which, we are confident, will continue to inspire the deliberations of the United Nations in its various forums.\n44.\tAs a visible symbol of the United Nations and with the access he has to Governments of Member\nStates, the Secretary-General is in a special position to exert his influence in promoting the attainment of the objectives of the Charter. I should like to pay my delegation's tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim for the initiatives he has taken and the understanding and discretion he has exhibited in discharging this responsibility, thereby enhancing the stature of his office and enlarging the beneficent role of the United Nations in world affairs.\n45.\tAs our Organization celebrates the thirtieth year of its existence, we are happy to note that the goal of universality of membership draws near. My country joins other Members of the United Nations in extending a warm welcome to Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe, and Cape Verde. The presence of those States here today as sovereign equals is a culmination of a long and heroic struggle by their peoples. Their triumph marks the fall of one of the few remaining citadels of colonial rule in Africa, which embodied an abominable system based on racial oppression and ruthless exploitation.\n46.\tWe look forward to the admission to the United Nations of Papua New Guinea and warmly congratulate its people on their achievement of independence. We have noted with appreciation the role that the Government of Australia has played in this regard.\n47.\tAngola, which is expected to join the United Nations next month, is troubled by a tragic, fratricidal strife, even as it approaches the goal of freedom for which all its people have fought unitedly, valiantly and for so long. We are confident that the people of Angola can resolve their differences and we believe that they should be allowed to do so without outside interference.\n48.\tThe dismantling of the Portuguese colonial empire has significantly changed the complexion of the political scene in the long-tormented region of southern Africa. It has materially and morally reinforced the just struggle of the valiant peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa against racism in its most odious form. The changed political map of Africa has obliged the minority regimes in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa to reassess their racist and colonial policies. We commend the efforts made by the African leaders to explore possibilities of a peaceful settlement, while Africa presses its advantage and intensifies its struggle for total emancipation. The people and the Government of Pakistan will continue to lend their full support to this struggle.\n49.\tMy delegation is gratified to welcome back to this Assembly the representatives of Cambodia, with which my country has warm and friendly relations. We are confident that in the near future representatives of the courageous people of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam will also be able to take their rightful places in the family of nations. We hope that the bitterness of the long and terrible war which ravaged IndoChina will now be forgotten and put behind us.\n50.\tMy Government supports the basic and fundamental right of the Korean people to self-determination and reunification by peaceful means. The goal of reunification of their country is accepted by the parties concerned as well as by the international community. There are differences, however, over the manner in which that goal can be achieved. We support the view that the Korean question should be resolved by the people of Korea themselves, free from all external pressure or interference. We consider that the time has come for the dissolution of the United Nations Command in Korea. We believe that the international community should encourage a dialog between the parties concerned and should refrain from any action which might hinder the process of reconciliation and reunification of the Korean people.\n51.\tI now turn to the situation in the Middle East. It has been repeatedly emphasized in this forum that no lasting peace can be established in the Middle East so long as the Arab-Israeli conflict is not justly resolved. The essential ingredients of such a settlement have also been repeatedly stated: they are set out in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and have been reiterated in many important forums. They include withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab Territories occupied by it in 1967, including the holy city of Jerusalem, and the restoration of the national rights of the people of Palestine. No settlement which does not conform to those conditions will last. Not until such a settlement is reached will there be durable peace in this region.\n52.\tIt is against that background that we view the recent agreement involving a limited withdrawal by Israel in the Sinai. We welcome it as a step but only a step towards the final settlement of the Arab- Israeli conflict. Even so, it has not been easy of achievement. We trust that the momentum it has generated will be maintained and that all concerned will continue to strive to resolve the basic issues that underlie the conflict in the Middle East.\n53.\tNo people can countenance the desecration of places of worship. The firing of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in 1969 and the recent partitioning of the Al-Ibrahimi Mosque in the city of Al-Khalil constitute an outrage against the religious susceptibilities of Moslems throughout the world. They are also a gratuitous affront to fundamental values shared by all religions and all peoples. Israel must undo such wrongs, repair the damage that has been done and desist in future from all such steps, as they can only aggravate an already explosive situation.\n54.\tWe are deeply conscious also of the need for an early solution of the conflict in Cyprus. Pakistan has always supported a settlement that would fully ensure for the two communities on the island the exercise of their fundamental rights and would enable them to live peacefully side by side with each other. We hope that the efforts made by the Secretary- General and the willingness to negotiate shown by the parties will pave the way for a final settlement and restore peace and tranquility in that area.\n55.\tTurning to the subcontinent, it is gratifying to note that progress towards normalization of relations between India and Pakistan is being sustained. Under the Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972, both countries are committed to promoting a friendly and harmonious relationship between them and to working for the establishment of durable peace in the subcontinent. Pakistan is resolved to continue to work for that objective.\n56.\tMy Government is also engaged in working for the establishment of normal, friendly relations with Bangladesh. We reciprocate the desire recently expressed by the President of Bangladesh to establish cordial relations with Pakistan. We believe that the establishment of such a relationship will not only redound to the mutual benefit of the peoples of both countries, but will also contribute to strengthening peace and stability in South Asia.\n57.\tTo that end we are resolved to continue to strive to normalize our relations with all our neighbors. Needless to say, we can succeed in doing so only on the understanding that each country will respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the other and will not interfere in the other's internal affairs. With Afghanistan, in particular, we have abiding ties historical, cultural, geographical and economic  and we have every hope that, given goodwill on both sides, friendly relations can be established between our two countries, to the great advantage of our peoples.\n58.\tI now come to an issue of universal concern  nuclear proliferation. Ever since India exploded a nuclear device last year, world attention has increasingly focused on the dangers of nuclear proliferation. We consider it entirely right that this should be so. Pakistan would strongly support the adoption of such safeguards as might be necessary to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We trust, however, that the safeguards would not be discriminatory in nature and would not unduly hinder the developing countries in proceeding with their programs for exploiting nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\n59.\tListening to debates on this subject, one gains the impression that there is a tendency to assume that all will be well with the world if only non-nuclear States are prevented from producing nuclear weapons. We consider that to be a dangerous illusion. The threat of nuclear extinction that faces the world will be scarcely any the less for the fact that only five Powers may produce and stockpile nuclear weapons. It is to that terrible threat that those weapons pose to life on this planet no matter who produces them that sooner or later the United Nations will have to address itself.\n60.\tIn this context, my delegation has noted with interest the proposals made by the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. Those proposals merit study in .appropriate forums. However, neither of them touches upon the alarming problem of the existing and steadily increasing stockpiles of nuclear weapons. There are already enough of those weapons to devastate vast areas of this globe within a matter of minutes. The only way to ward off such a calamity would be for the nuclear Powers to agree not only to refrain from producing more nuclear weapons but also to destroy existing stockpiles. There is no other way that will assure mankind that it will not be engulfed one day in a nuclear holocaust.\n61.\tThe dismal failure of almost all previous disarmament efforts does not warrant any hope that such an agreement will be reached in the foreseeable future. In the meantime, certain other steps need to be urgently taken. One such step is indicated in a resolution adopted by 40 members of the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers held at Jedda last July. That resolution urges the nuclear-weapon States to undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons under any circumstances against those non-nuclear-weapon States which are not protected by treaty guarantees from the nuclear Powers against a nuclear threat or attack.\n62.\tIt will be noted that this resolution specifically excludes States, such as those in Europe, which are covered by treaty guarantees by the super-Powers. This, it was hoped, would make the resolution generally acceptable. The proposed undertaking would not only give non-nuclear-weapon States a most needed sense of security against a possible nuclear attack; it would also act as a strong disincentive to nuclear proliferation, since the urge to become a nuclear-weapon State arises basically from the fear that one's adversary possesses, or may come to possess, nuclear weapons.\n63.\tAnother step that might help remove that fear from the minds of non-nuclear-weapon States is the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. The As-sembly has before it various proposals pertaining to the creation and strengthening of such zones in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and the South Pacific. In view of the establishment of nuclear-free zones in Latin America, the Antarctic, the sea-bed and the ocean floor, and outer space, these proposals represent a universal urge on the part of non-nuclear- weapon States to exclude nuclear weapons from their regions, thus enhancing their security and strengthening international peace. The establishment of such zones will also help accelerate the utilization of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\n64.\tFor our part, following the adoption last year by this Assembly of the two resolutions for a nuclear- weapon-free zone in South Asia [resolutions 3265 A and B (XXIX)], we have held consultations to explore ways and means of achieving the objectives of these resolutions. All States in the region have affirmed their commitment not to acquire nuclear weapons. However, differences of a fundamental nature remain to be resolved before an agreement can be reached. We look forward to holding further consultations in this regard with the countries concerned during the current session.\n65.\tIn the economic field, Pakistan has held that a dialog aimed at evolving generally acceptable solutions is the most effective means of promoting co-operation between the developed and developing countries. We believe that it is in the interest of the international community that the third-world demands for justice and equity be met. It was in this spirit that my Government appraoched the sixth special session of the Assembly last year.\n66.\tIn preparation for the seventh special session, the developing countries, motivated by the same spirit, advisedly selected a limited number of important issues as the basis for negotiations in that session. We are happy that a broad agreement was achieved on those issues, thereby preparing the ground for further progress in this Assembly and in the forthcoming conference in Paris and at the fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\n67.\tThe constructive spirit, reflecting a perception of a common interest, with which all countries approached those complex issues was the most significant feature of the seventh special session.\n68.\tThe same spirit will, we hope, animate discussions in this Assembly, the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation and other forums. We must also keep in view the need to ensure that the commitments and obligations already undertaken are implemented in full. Further, in keeping with the dynamic nature of the process of economic development, we must encourage the continuous and progressive evolution of the global dialog as an essential feature of that process.\n69.\tNo comment on the international economic situation can be adequate without a reference to the very serious and continuously deteriorating situation in the low-income countries. The developed countries have already demonstrated their ability to absorb the effects of the crisis resulting from the events of the past two years. But the crisis in the developing countries has persisted and the situation has, in fact, gravely deteriorated. The oil-exporting countries have pledged substantial resources for assistance to these countries, resources far in excess of the targets envisaged in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. However, the unprecedented escalation of prices of the essential imports of developing countries, coupled with deterioration in their terms of trade, has seriously jeopardized the maintenance of even minimum levels of consumption and development. In such a critical situation, it is imperative that all countries play their part in enabling those countries to restore, and indeed step up, their economic growth.\n70.\tIt is now generally recognized that, while development assistance, balance-of-payments support and debt relief can help tide the developing countries over their immediate difficulties, they cannot alone provide an enduring solution to the basic problem of under-development. The cure lies in the creation of self-reliant economies in the developing countries so that those countries themselves can create the capacity to meet their development needs. There is thus an urgent need for fundamental reforms to provide those countries with equal opportunities to share the economic growth and prosperity of the international community.\n71.\tThirty years is not a long period in the history of man or his institutions. Yet in this time span the world has changed beyond recognition and so has this Organ-ization, in terms of both the size of its membership and the nature and range of its concerns. Differences in political influence, military power and economic capacity among the nations of the world are such that formal independence does not always make a country master of its destiny. The concept of interdependence, arising from a recognition of mankind's common interests, has gained wise acceptance in recent years. To translate that concept into reality is the most important task facing the international community. In this regard, a particular responsibility devolves upon the small and medium-sized States. For, as the President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly observed, the center of decision in the United Nations has shifted and, I would add, not by virtue of numbers alone in the direction of the smaller, the weaker, the least wealthy countries. The impatience of those countries for change should not be misconstrued as unreason or hostility towards others. On the contrary, it can lend impetus to progress and co-operation among all.\n72.\tThe politics of the cold war and its polemics are gradually fading from the scene. The Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe signed at Helsinki will mark, we hope, not - only the formal end of the cold war but the beginning of a chapter of peace and co-operation not confined to one particular region. In the new world which is emerging, the old distinctions and groupings of countries are beginning to lose relevance. The establishment of a new world order, political as well as economic, calls for the creation of a new alignment of all those who are committed to removing fear, injustice and exploitation from the world, to building a viable system to maintain peace and prevent conflicts an alignment of those committed to the imperatives of peace and progress for all. There can be no doubt about Pakistan's place in such an alignment.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": " Sir, in electing you to the presidency of this thirtieth session, our Assembly wished to pay a tribute to your eminent statesmanlike qualities and, above all, to your country's constant support of the United Nations. Mali, which enjoys relations of friendship and co-operation with Luxembourg on the bilateral level as well as through the European Economic Community, can only rejoice at this choice. My delegation therefore extends to you its most heartfelt congratulations on this token of trust in you which has been manifested by the Assembly, and we wish to assure you of our frank and loyal co-operation. These congratulations go also to the Vice-Presidents and the other officers.\n98.\tMay I be allowed to take this happy occasion to congratulate once again my brother and friend, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, and President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, as well as of the seventh special session. Thanks to his integrity and personal efforts, a new dynamic spirit characterized the work of the General Assembly.\n99.\tAmong other important decisions to the credit of the twenty-ninth session were the suspension of the rebel State of South Africa and the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to a homeland. Those are revealing signs of the changes that have been emerging within our Organization recently. Indeed, those decisions are unique in the annals of the United Nations, which has always been subjugated by private interests contrary to the spirit and the letter of the Charter.\n100.\tAs to the just-concluded seventh special session, although it did not reach all its objectives, the results it did achieve are far from being negative; and in spite of the differences which exist among the parties and despite the tendentious comments, the session was, in our view, a success, in that it allowed us to renew the dialog between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres a dialog which had been interrupted during the sixth special session.\n101.\tMy delegation welcomes the presence among us of the worthy representatives of the brotherly peoples of Mozambique, the Cape Verde Islands and of Sao Tome and Principe, which have achieved their independence after bitter struggle. We pay a pious tribute to the memory of all those who have fallen while fighting for the triumph of the sacred cause of freedom in those countries. This tribute is also paid to the valiant Portuguese people, who in April 1974 joined hands with the oppressed people of Africa in fighting the Fascist and colonialist regime in Lisbon, thus opening up wide breaches on both flanks of the bastion of white power in southern Africa. My delegation has no doubt that these new States will make a valuable contribution to our work.\n102.\tMy delegation also addresses warm congratulations to the people of Papua New Guinea, which acceded to independence on the very day of the opening of this session.\n103.\tNow the authentic representatives of the Khmer people have returned to us, and once more occupy the seats that are theirs, which for five years were occupied by puppets and traitors to the Cambodian nation in the service of international imperialism. The debacle of the forces of aggression in Indo-China last March and April once again showed that the people are indomitable and that no material force in the world, however strong, can overcome their determination to live free and independent.\n104.\tToday, the cliques of Thieu, Ky, Lon Nol and others, who have in so cowardly a fashion fled their countries, live in golden exile in Taiwan or somewhere on the American continent. Where now are the voices that were raised at the twenty-ninth session to contest the representative nature of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia and the Front of National Union of Kampuchea? In delaying for four months the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations they deliberately prolonged the sufferings of the Khmer people and lengthened the list of victims of the murderous war imposed by the supporters of reaction.\n105.\tIn fact, from December 1974 until March 1975, more than 200,000 persons were killed or wounded in the fighting between the patriots and the usurpers. That was the heavy price exacted from the Khmer people by the prevarications and the weakness of our Assembly in settling the Cambodian crisis. My delegation hopes that our Organization will always remember that, and bear it very much in mind in its future discussions on whatever problems of peace and international security it may have to deal with. Mali, which from the very beginning took the side of the Cambodian revolution, considers the victory of the heroic Khmer people as that of all the progressive forces throughout the world. My delegation therefore salutes the true representatives of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia present here and assures them of its fraternal and militant co-operation.\n106.\tMy delegation also wishes to express its satisfaction to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General, for his ceaseless and untiring efforts both in New York and throughout the world in reinforcing the role of the United Nations in respect of the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security.\n107.\tThis year we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations. Rather than drawing up a balance-sheet, my delegation would like to review its actions during its first 30 years of existence.\n108.\tAlthough created, as the Charter proclaims, to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, and to promote social progress and better standards of life, it is none the less true that at the outset the United Nations was concerned only with the problems of the coexistence of the two blocs which emerged in Europe at the end of the Second World War. Allied to combat the Axis forces which threatened the very existence of both blocs, they were nevertheless bitterly opposed at the ideological level. Their only common ground in creating the United Nations was the fear of a renewal of Hitler's fascism. The safeguarding of international security was at that time envisaged for Europe alone. The concept of peace was obviously less universal in character than it is today.\n109.\tThat is why the United Nations remained indifferent to the colonial and imperialist wars that ravaged the continents of Africa, Asia and Latin America. The socialist countries were the only ones to give their diplomatic and material support.\n110.\tThat was also why in 1950 the United Nations became involved in Korea, in violation of the principles of the Charter, in what the doctrinaires of the cold war called the \\\"digging-in of communism in South East Asia\\\".\n111.\tThat was why the tragic problem of apartheid, which was denounced in the United Nations in 1947 by India and other Member States, continued to rage in southern Africa, with the active support and complicity of the Western bloc, which dominated the Organization through the large number of its Members. All decisions were oriented towards the interests of that camp, and the third world occupied only a very marginal place. At the same time the cold war was continuing between the two blocs, and each tried to spread its sphere of influence or its hegemony throughout the world. Thus the arms race heated up in the two camps.\n112.\tThe appearance on the international scene of the nations of the third world, freed from colonial domination, was a determining factor in the development of the United Nations. The Organization, which consisted originally of 51 States, now has more than 140 Member States representing 95 per cent of the total population of the world.\n113.\tRefusing to submit to the maneuvers of the two blocs that were sharing the world, the new States organized themselves, on the basis of their common destiny, into independent political forces. Thus the movement of the non-aligned countries, the Organization of African Unity and the Group of 77 came into being. Their participation in international life was to make a radical change in the balance of power within our Organization. Since then the goals of the Charter have taken on real meaning for Member States. Peace is no longer the privilege of Europe alone, which at the beginning was the center of interest for the concerns of the majority of founding Members. But unhappily this development has been halted, if not destroyed, by the reluctance and lack of goodwill on the part of those same Powers which enjoy excessive rights in our Organization.\n114.\tBy an irony of fate has not the United States just used, on some pretext of universality, its right of veto in the Security Council to block the admission of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam to membership in the United Nations?\n115.\tWhether it is a question of problems of peace, decolonization, economic development or human rights, our decisions continue to come up against the contempt and obstinacy of those Powers wishing to safeguard their privileges of yore which have nothing in common with the lofty ideals of the Charter.\n116.\tThe United Nations, its action blocked through the inertia of those Powers, sits passively by, watching flagrant violations of peace in the African, Asian and Latin American continents, and the steady worsening of the international situation. The destabilization policy embraced by some of those Powers continues to create insecurity in several regions of the world.\n117.\tThe Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, to which we subscribe fully, cannot make us forget the odious policy of apartheid, which still poisons South Africa, Southern Rhodesia and Namibia, while in Asia Korea remains divided with our complicity; Tel-Aviv persists in defying us in the Middle East despite all the relevant resolutions of our Organization on the tragic Arab- Israeli crisis; and the transnational companies continue constantly to undermine nationalist and progressive Governments.\n118.\tFurthermore, in spite of the international disarmament agreements that have been concluded the arms race continues both horizontally and vertically. Every year $300,000 million are thrown away on arms, to the detriment of the economic, social and cultural development of mankind.\n119.\tClearly, the detente that is emerging in Europe cannot reassure us about the future of mankind. Peace is all-inclusive; it cannot apply merely to a certain region, still less to one group of States. It is global or it is nothing.\n120.\tThus the detente in Europe, although essential to international security, is only one of its constituent elements. It must take its place as such within the framework of our general offensive in favor of universal peace. We must, of course, make every effort to bring it about and consolidate it. Political detente is uncertain as long as it is not accompanied by military detente.\n121.\tThe continued strengthening of the awesome arsenals of the major nuclear Powers and the proliferation of bases of death throughout the world are not likely to create between States the climate of confidence that is indispensable for the establishment of a true dialog on the general, complete and controlled disarmament for which we hope.\n122.\tThat is why the international agreements concluded thus far on this question do not bear on the substance of the problem but rather on its secondary aspects, thus permitting the vertical proliferation of this deadly weapon.\n123.\tThe freeze of the negotiations on mutual and balanced reduction of forces in Central Europe is also the result of the insecurity prevailing in the world.\n124.\tThe severe crises which persist in the Mediterranean region and in Asia more precisely in Cyprus, the Middle East and Korea are the detonators which could at any moment precipitate the holocaust which threatens mankind.\n125.\tWe are thus perfectly aware of the grave danger to the world caused by these abscesses on the flanks of Europe and Asia.\n126.\tIn regard to Cyprus, the Secretary-General must continue to offer his good offices to the parties, for the United Nations constitutes the most appropriate framework for the inter-communal talks which can only be successful if they are free from outside interference.\n127.\tThe sovereignty of the State, the territorial integrity of the island and the policy of non-alignment of its Government must at all costs be safeguarded.\n128.\tIt is under these conditions, and only under these conditions, that the people of Cyprus will achieve the peace it needs.\n129.\tRegarding the Middle East crisis, its settlement is dependent upon the unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories and the restoration to the Palestinian people of its homeland, which has been usurped by international Zionism.\n130.\tAfter having recognized in 1974 the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, our Assembly must in the course of this session take the decisive step of implementing that decision. That is the only possible reply to the challenge which the Government of Tel Aviv has continued to present to the international community for 27 years.\n131.\tA return to peace in that region requires a global solution.\n132.\tThe state of \\\"neither war nor peace\\\" which has prevailed in the Middle East since the October 1975 war carries within itself the seeds of a conflagration which could one day engulf the region.\n133.\tThe year 1975 has certainly been a most eventful year. Its first half was marked particularly by the debacle of the aggressive forces in Indo-China.\n134.\tThe longest and most murderous war of our time thus ended with the victory of the heroic Indo-Chinese peoples, who defended inch by inch the sacred soil of their homeland. The myth of material superiority has crumbled. The whole world has hailed the victory of the Vietnamese peoples as its own victory.\n135.\tHaving now regained their liberty and independence, the latter are getting ready for the task of national reconstruction and the peaceful reunification of their homeland. The last wishes of the Father of the Nation, the great Ho Chi Minh, to whose memory my delegation pays a solemn tribute, have thus been realized.\n136.\tThe United States of America, which has not yet recovered from its defeat in Indo-China, has thought of nothing better than to use its veto in the Security Council to block the admission of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam to the United Nations, to the surprise of all.\n137.\tThe international climate today does not lend itself to \\\"package deals\\\", that impudent bargaining, a relic of the cold war, which it offers us.\n138.\tMoreover, the Seoul administration, which is maintaining itself by repressing democratic and popular forces, is not a Government representative of the southern part of Korea. It cannot therefore aspire to the same treatment as that accorded to the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam, which are independent and sovereign States according to international law.\n139.\tKorea remains for the United Nations a country divided against the will of its people. All the resolutions which it has adopted on the question guarantee the unified character of the State and preserve its territorial integrity.\n140.\tThus a United Nations Commission for the Reconstruction and Peaceful Reunification of Korea was established by one of the first decisions of our Organization on the crisis.\n141.\tThus for our Organization to recognize that the Seoul administration meets the criteria for becoming a Member of the Organization, without the prior agreement of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, would be to violate its own resolutions.\n142.\tThere remains, in any case, a jurisprudence which is authoritative in the field and which has been applied recently.\n143.\tThe fate of the puppet cliques of Seoul could not possibly be linked to that of the legal Governments of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam.\n144.\tAs a guarantor of the territorial integrity of Korea, our Organization could not in conscience decide on its partition without denying itself, because that is in fact what is asked of it.\n145.\tThe so-called universality invoked by the United States tojustify its bargaining has not deceived anyone.\n146.\tRecognition of the Seoul administration as having the character of a Member of our Organization will certainly not resolve the Korean crisis, as some would have us believe. The solution is essentially to be found in the withdrawal of the United Nations from that country and the transformation of the armistice into a true peace agreement. That is exactly what is proposed in the draft resolution which was submitted for the Assembly's consideration by a certain number of countries, including my own [see A/10191 and Add. 1-3].\n147.\tI should not like to close this part of my statement on the problems of peace and war without evoking the problem of colonialism, which constitutes one of the main factors of insecurity in Africa. This anachronistic phenomenon, after having suffered a certain setback in the 1960s, seemed to have become stabilized at the beginning of this decade.\n148.\tBut with the overthrow of the Fascist and colonialist regime of Lisbon in April 1974, decolonization has taken a certain turn in Africa.\n149.\tIndeed, of four Territories under Portuguese domination, three have acceded to the status of sovereign State and are today full Members of our Organization. As to the fourth, Angola, the proclamation of whose independence has been set for 11 November, the situation is more and more alarming.\n150.\tThe subtle play of foreign interference, which my Government deplores and condemns, has led to the radicalization of positions within the country and to the deterioration of the internal situation. In order to stop the continuing civil war, my delegation urgently appeals to the national liberation movements of Angola to transcend their differences and establish unity of action before the date fixed for the accession to independence of the country. Furthermore, it calls upon all States Members of our Organization to refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of this country and to respect its territorial integrity. There is no doubt that the Angolan people, which has paid dearly for its independence and liberty, during 14 years of struggle against the colonialist regimes of Salazar and Caetano, will be able to reconcile its differences and achieve unity in order to assume its responsibilities, on 11 November 1975.\n151.\tThe independent State of the Comoros has been a member of the Organization of African Unity since the twelfth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government held at Kampala last July. Our Organization must take this fully into account and guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of that country.\n152.\tDespite some reasons for satisfaction in the field of decolonization, the African continent remains under occupation, in particular in the southern part by segregationist and colonialist regimes.\n153.\tIn Azania and in Southern Rhodesia, the white minorities stubbornly pursue their policy of separate development, while in Namibia, a Territory under United Nations trusteeship, the racist regime of Pretoria organizes a masquerade of consultations in order to institutionalize the policy of apartheid and accelerate the process of annexation of the country to the segregationist State of South Africa.\n154.\tThe United Nations must put an end to this situation and accept its responsibilities, in the face of these rebel regimes which openly flout the principles of the Charter.\n155.\tThe delegation of Mali for its part reaffirms its unreserved support for the national liberation movements struggling throughout the world for the independence of their countries.\n156.\tThe insecurity which characterizes the international situation is unfortunately also a feature of world economic policy. In fact, because of the injustice of the principles that govern economic relations among States, the world tends more and more to be divided in two the world of the poor and that of the wealthy. However, the latest energy and raw materials crisis revealed in good time the interdependence of States.\n157.\tNo country, be it rich or poor, has escaped inflation or the consequent recession. The established order seems to be cracking under the pressure of the injustices and contradictions that characterize it.\n158.\tA special session was convened to save the world from the chaos which threatens it. That session concluded that it was necessary to establish a new international economic order which would be based on the equitable distribution of the world's income. I am speaking about the sixth special session which: was convened here in 1974 on the initiative of the non- aligned countries.\n159.\tThe Declaration and the Program of Action adopted during that rescue session have been rejected by the industrialized market-economy countries which are trying to preserve the privileges they inherited from the old order.\n160.\tThe seventh special session gave us an opportunity to explain our points of view on the problems of development and co-operation. My delegation voluntarily is quite willing not to reopen the debate on those questions as they have already been thoroughly examined.\n161.\tI shall simply limit myself then to mentioning here that after long and laborious negotiations, the seventh special session made possible the resumption of the dialog between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres on the establishment of a new international economic order.\n162.\tThe United Nations of 1975 with its tendency towards universality is not the United Nations of the' 1950s. Today it cannot be content with arrangements that safeguard the interests of some of the Member\nStates to the detriment of the great majority of the international community.\n163.\tConfrontation has only narrowly been avoided. The thirtieth session gives us an opportunity to continue the dialog and to envisage broader international negotiations which should allow us to lay the foundations of a new international economic order. We must be able to overcome our limitations in order to control and direct events and to assume full responsibility for the evolution of our society.\n164.\tThirty years for a man, just as for an organization like ours, is the threshold of maturity. At that age the errors of adolescence can no longer be permitted. That is what we proved at the seventh special session. Our Organization will have to approach a new phase of its existence with the same spirit of joint responsibility if we really wish to meet the challenges the world is facing at this decisive phase of its evolution. That is, at any rate, the price of our salvation. It is up to the Assembly to speak,\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I should first of all like to convey to you my own congratulations and the congratulations of my country. I am personally delighted to see my colleague and friend, Gaston Thorn, preside over the work of the General Assembly. Through its excellent choice the Assembly has not only paid a tribute to a country dedicated to the cause of peace and international co-operation, but it has also secured for itself the talents of an exceptionally experienced, wise statesman who happens also to be one of the great architects of European construction. You, Sir, have continually laid emphasis on the task of opening up a united Europe towards the rest of the world, and particularly towards the developing countries. That concern, as you know, is fully shared by the French Government. Therefore France cannot but be gratified to see such a great European as yourself shouldering the burden and responsibilities that have been entrusted to you by this Assembly.\n2.\tI must say, too, how much we owe to the outgoing President, Mr. Bouteflika, on whom fell the important task of presiding, at times under difficult conditions, over the previous session of this Assembly and over the seventh special session.\n3.\tI should like, finally, to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, who presides over the work of our Organization with an authority, a competence and an impartiality that are universally recognized.\n4.\tThe annual meeting of the General Assembly is a particularly privileged moment for all of us who represent our Governments here, but who at the same time also feel responsible, for that very reason, for the higher interests of the emerging world community.\n5.\tThe crisis which we are going through, which perhaps for the first time in history affects the entire world, is the result of a genuine change, a complete breakaway from the old system of balances. The upheavals this crisis brings in its wake, the risks it comprises, pose a real threat to our future. But man's special characteristic is his ability to react to control his destiny.\n6.\tAn example of this healthy reaction was recently seen at the seventh special session, and this is probably the most encouraging feature of the whole of the past year. Faced with increasing dangers, we have all recognized the obvious globalization of the economic and political problems of our age, as well as the need to resolve them by appreciating all the consequences of our indissoluble solidarity.\n7.\tThis realization helps us to realize the importance, the very great importance, of the collective responsibility borne by our Governments. What we have to do is master and control what the President of the French Republic has described as \\\"the crisis of the human race\\\". It is outskirt bring under control the fever for change with which the human race is obsessed and master its course, because ultimately this crisis reflects the growing pains of all mankind. This is the price we have to pay for the tremendous progress we have achieved both in technology and in the political sphere. It is the fruit of persisting inequalities and injustices.\n8.\tIn mankind's long march towards the achievement of the goals of the United Nations, economic justice is still lagging behind political evolution, and the desire of the less privileged States to obtain their fair share of the fruits of economic growth is most certainly justified. However, where this political determination was expressed in ideological terms, and where the rich countries bridled in defense of their privileges, there was a risk of the emergence and exacerbation of disastrous tension.\n9.\tAt the end of 1973 and early in 1974, an infinitely dangerous trend started to divide the world into hostile blocs. France, through its President, underlined the gravity of the danger in time, and indicated the measures needed to avert it.\n10.\tThe President's appeal was heeded, and I like to think that it has contributed to the very favorable developments we have witnessed in recent months. The results already achieved, as regards both the final resolution of the seventh special session [resolution 3362 (S-VII)] and the now forthcoming resumption of the dialog proposed by France between the industrialized and the developing countries, guarantee that we are now taking the right course.\n11.\tAlthough the subject is important, I shall not dwell on the results of the seventh special session except to stress once again that the results obtained\nA/PV.2364\u2003\ncomplement the work that will be done at the enlarged conference which will follow up the second preparatory meeting in Paris. Let us note in this regard that the very importance of the subjects to be discussed demonstrates the political dimension of the undertaking, which was begun on behalf of our international community and in close liaison with the United Nations.\n12.\tIt is now, therefore, quite clear that we should set as our target the gradual establishment of a political and economic world order based, not on positions of strength, but on dialog, solidarity and respect for the interests of others.\n13.\tFor this we must keep our feet on the ground, but we also must demonstrate imagination and generosity in our response to the expectations of those who are least privileged, and all those whose problems come in the tragically brutal form of famine, death and loss of liberty.\n14.\tIn a world where the spirit of violence, alas, is prevalent, where odious acts of terrorism and the taking of hostages seem to be replacing conventional warfare, let us proclaim that such actions are contrary to human rights; they solve nothing and corrupt the noblest aims. But at the same time let us realize that in order to halt the momentum of violence, the rights of individuals and of peoples must be recognized everywhere.\n15. Let us make no mistake about the immensity of the task before us. A great deal remains to be done in order to achieve the tone and specific realization of the aims and objectives of our Organization. Tenacious determination, expressed through effective instruments, is required of us all.\n16.\tThe Charter has given us the framework for our common efforts; hence the importance of the effective-ness of the United Nations.\n17.\tOur Organization, which is now 30 years old, may have been disappointing to those who forgot that its ability to settle conflicts depended on the cooperation of Member States. It has in fact done some extremely useful work and, as our Secretary-General quite rightly noted in the introduction to his last report on the work of the Organization, it has: \\\"... shown a remarkable capacity to take on new tasks, to adjust to a changing world . . . within the conceptual and organizational framework laid down by the Charter.\\\" [A1100011.Add.I, sect. I.]\n18.\tBoth this flexibility and this strength are without . a doubt due to the wisdom with which the founders\nof our Organization, in San Francisco, were able to balance ideals and reality, rigorous principles and political realism. This balance, which has enabled it to withstand the test of time, is basic and we believe must be protected from all perfectionism.\n19.\tIt is obvious that, given the current state of affairs, the United Nations is not and cannot be a world government. The present phase in the history of mankind is one of affirmation of independence. It is also one of consultation, more necessary than ever among sovereign States. That observation places in its proper perspective the problem resulting from the emergence of majorities which, by the way, change in international assemblies. This is a natural phenomenon once the law of democracy and thus the law of numbers is agreed to, but it is a phenomenon that should not be allowed to obscure the real mission of these assemblies and above all ours which is to seek compliance with universally accepted rules and intentions. Nor has our Charter set up a world system in which the Assembly holds sway. It provides for permanent adjustment procedures among us; a good example of this is the division of responsibilities between the General Assembly and the Security Council, because it is based on realities that it would be dangerous to forget.\n20.\tIt is also obvious that the United Nations can be true to itself and fulfill its mission only if it respects the cardinal principle of universality, both by admitting any State that meets its requirements and by refusing to reject States whose policies might be unpopular, except for cases strictly defined in the Charter. In either case, the golden rule of universality, towards which decisive progress has been made in the past few years, must not be broken.\n21.\tWe are pleased, in this respect, that a new step has been taken with the admission of three new Members: the Cape Verde Islands, Sao Tome and Principe, and Mozambique.\n22.\tWe for our part were prepared to support also the applications of the two Viet Nams, as well as that of the Republic of South Korea, countries with which we have friendly diplomatic relations and which we should have liked to see join the Organization. We regret that the turn taken by the Security Council deliberations did not allow such a step to be taken this year.\n23.\tIt is because France attaches the greatest importance to this principle of universality that it believes that any measure aimed at suspending or excluding any of our Members would bring into our Organization an element of mistrust and pressure that would be totally alien to the spirit of dialog that should prevail here.\n24.\tIt is by remaining what it is a privileged and universal forum for consultation and dialog that our Organization will be in the best position to translate the ideals of the Charter into reality.\n25.\tIn this attempt to advance towards a better world political and economic order, I shall first of all point out two factors which are sound reasons for having confidence in the future. The first has to do with the successful development of regional groups; the second, with detente in Europe.\n26.\tWorld consultation which should prevail in no way precludes, but rather presupposes, the grouping of co-operation efforts along regional lines. These groups of States will be a factor in conciliation and increased international co-operation provided they turn their backs on any tendency to form opposing blocs and follow the rule of openness and dialog. This, as you know, is the byword and raison d'etre of the nine members of the European Community.\n27.\tI think that as I said last year the task under-taken by six countries of Western Europe following the last world war is exemplary in many respects.\n28.\tThe work begun by those six countries is now being carried forward by the nine. An unequivocal vote by the British people recently confirmed this irreversible commitment to building Europe. This task is being actively pursued with a determination that is both ambitious and pragmatic. Out of this spirit grew last year's decision by the Heads of Government a decision that has now been fully implemented to meet periodically in order to maintain the co-ordination and momentum vital to the internal process of construction as well as to the attitudes and actions of Europe in the international community of nations.\n29.\tThis Europe, contrary to certain assertions, is in no way self-centered or preoccupied with its own future. It has been its intention from the beginning to make its contribution to the world scene as an independent source of decision and initiative, and also as a factor of equilibrium and imagination in a world of interdependence and mutual opening up.\n30.\tThat was the main thrust of the statement by the nine European Heads of State and Government at their meeting on 17 July this year at Brussels.\n31.\tThe current President of the nine countries \u2014Mr. Rumor, our Italian colleague reported on the progress that has already been made [2357th meeting]. I myself shall just mention the important contribution of the ACP-EEC Convention at Lome, which, starting early this year, has opened the way for new forms of co-operation.\n32.\tSecondly, to stress its political importance, I shall mention the European-Arab dialog that has now been started between the Community and all the countries of the League of Arab States. New ties of solidarity, adapted to the needs of our time, have to be woven between two groups of people, heir to two of the civilizations that shared the ancient world and that history has made enemy and ally in turn.\n33.\tThe Europe of the Community, Mr. President and I know I do not have to convince one of its prime movers of this is a voice speaking for many, making itself heard in favor of greater international co-operation. Thus, Europe is dedicating itself to the service of peace and democracy, while respecting the interests and freedoms of others. The positions that it has taken with regard to the Middle East, Cyprus and Portugal are proof of this.\n34.\tThe strengthening of detente in Europe is another mayor positive factor which should help us to concentrate on the real problems which people will have to face at the end of the twentieth century. France, which provided the initial impetus 10 years ago, took an active part in the work of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, in close collaboration with its Community partners; it helped to see to it that the Final Act of the Conference signed at Helsinki on 1 August not only endorsed the commitment of the participants to exclude all recourse to force but also laid the foundations for the development of entente and co-operation among the signatory States. Of course there remains the task of translating into reality these very specific declarations of intent regarding increased exchanges of people and ideas, thereby giving positive content to detente. It is because France believes in the sincerity of the desire of all its partners for detente that it intends to apply along with them the letter and the spirit of the decisions made at Helsinki. In any case, the curtain has already come down on an era that has ended the era of the cold war. An objective has been jointly set; that objective is entente and cooperation. This result is not insignificant and constitutes a useful precedent for the entire world.\n35.\tLet us be glad in this respect that in other regions of the globe some progress has been made along the path of conciliation and the settling of conflicts.\n36.\tI should like to mention the Middle East first. I hardly need restate the three principles on which, in our view, a lasting peace settlement must necessarily be founded: withdrawal from the territories occupied by Israel in June 1967; recognition of the right of the Palestinians to a homeland; the right of all the States of the region to live in peace within secure, recognized and guaranteed frontiers.\n37.\tFrance believes that for these three principles to be implemented it is indispensable for the spirit of dialog to prevail over the spirit of confrontation. That is why we welcomed and consider a positive step the disengagement agreement signed in Geneva on 4 September by the representatives of Egypt and Israel. That agreement is to be commended and is encouraging proof of the commitment of the parties concerned to the process of negotiation.\n38.\tThe detente that has thus been brought about, as President El-Sadat of Egypt has noted, and as Mr. Henry Kissinger of the United States underscored a few days ago from this rostrum [.2355th meeting], should now make it possible to embark on an overall settlement which, by attacking the basic problems, is the only possible way of averting the risk of other major crises and establishing a lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors. Without prejudice to what may be done on other fronts, a global approach is called for. My Government has always advocated this; similarly, when there arises the question of over-all guarantees to strengthen peace in the region, France, and I believe Europe, will be ready to take an active part in them.\n39.\tI should not like to leave the subject of the Middle East without mentioning the current ordeals Lebanon is undergoing. My Government and the European Community wish to stress the vital importance of maintaining the independence, unity and integrity of that friendly country, which is an essential factor for equilibrium in the region. I am convinced that all the groups of the Lebanese community, as well as the parties concerned, aware of the seriousness of the situation, will do everything they can to help the Government in its efforts to maintain public order and to strengthen national unity.\n40.\tIn Asia, peace has finally returned to Viet Nam. But the length of the conflict, the damage inflicted and the suffering caused make it even more urgent and necessary here than elsewhere for genuine cooperation to be established. France, which since 1954 has had official relations with the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam, has begun relations with the new authorities of the Republic of South Viet Nam and remains ready to take an active part in the reconstruction of the country. We hope to have with the Vietnamese people relations based on mutual esteem and trust.\n41.\tAs far as Cambodia is concerned, the French Government, as the Assembly is aware, proposed establishing diplomatic relations with the Cambodian Government on 12 April of this year. Our intentions with regard to that country remain unchanged.\n42.\tIn reviewing the various reasons for hope it would be a serious omission if one did not include a few words on the positive developments on a continent of the future\u2014Latin America, whose political, economic and intellectual influence is being increasingly felt in world affairs. The topic is too vast for me to cover. I shall just point out that France attaches great importance to increasing its co-operation with all the countries of Latin America. In this respect I shall mention my delegation's satisfaction with the resumption of our relations with Peru,\n43.\tAfrica is another continent of the future, one to which France and Europe are linked by ties the strength of which is without a doubt one of the main reasons for our confidence in the future. My country has guided many friendly countries to independence and has maintained with them particularly close relations based on co-operation. France wishes to respect the decision of all Africans freely to determine their own destiny and to assume responsibility for their future under conditions of their own choosing.\n44.\tQuite recently France consulted the people of the Comoros regarding their future. The great majority favored independence, and, without waiting for completion of the constitutional process, decided through their deputies to take over the management of their own affairs. The French Government took note of this and announced that it was prepared to begin talks immediately regarding the transfer of responsibilities. We still hope there can be agreement among Comorians permitting establishment of a framework within which this new State will begin its future. In this case, as in others, France is true to its continuing policy of respect for the right to self-determination.\n45.\tI should not like to fail to welcome the resumption of diplomatic relations between my country and Guinea.\n46.\tUnfortunately there are still some clouds in this picture of the international situation. In Cyprus, in Korea and in southern Africa the international community should spare no efforts to prevent tensions from degenerating into conflicts.\n47.\tThe question of Cyprus, involving States with which my country has traditionally enjoyed friendly relations and a region that is very close to us, remains one of our foremost concerns. We are obliged to note that the situation resulting from the events of the summer of 1974, with the continuing threat it poses to peace and the suffering it inflicts on the people of the island, not only has not changed but has actually deteriorated.\n48.\tYet at that time we did unanimously adopt a text defining the framework and principles for a settlement and giving the main outline of a solution, which should be one of reconciliation. Indeed, as everyone is aware, nothing can be done without the agreement of the two communities. Accordingly we have steadily given our encouragement, unilaterally or with other members of the European Community, to the inter-community talks begun last spring, with the unflagging assistance of our Secretary-General. At the same time we called for a solution to the most painful problem, that of refugees, which affects nearly one third of the people of the island. We are not unaware of the difficulties involved, but we should stress here its extreme urgency.\n49.\tI should therefore like to make another pressing appeal for genuine negotiations to begin without further delay, accompanied by urgent measures which the onset of winter makes necessary from a humanitarian standpoint. Such negotiations should be based on well-defined proposals for an over-all settlement that would provide solutions for all the political and territorial problems confronting Cyprus. Such a settlement should be based on right and justice \\\"right\\\" meaning the independence of Cyprus and the integrity of Cyprus, and \\\"justice\\\" meaning the respective size of the two communities. It is this double condition that will finally enable the Cypriot communities to live in peace. It is not for us to tell them how they should organize their relations. But, as the President of the French Republic said recently in Salonika, France is firmly convinced that nothing lasting can be built on force, nor can right result from faits accomplis.\n50.\tOf the tensions that may still exist on the vast continent of Asia, I shall mention only the problem of Korea, because of its repercussions upon the United Nations.\n51.\tIt is disturbing that more than 20 years after the cessation of hostilities a situation should still exist in Korea which, were it to worsen, could have consequences dangerous to world peace. The Korean people feel its effects daily, and the international community views this persistent anomaly as an almost anachronistic danger, so we very much hope that the United Nations will at this session be able to find a solution to the question of its commitment in that country, taking into account the need to set up arrangements to preserve the Armistice Agreement. But it will also be necessary for the parties directly concerned, respecting the spirit of the joint communique of 4 July 1972,' to substitute dialog and a spirit of compromise for confrontation and intransigence, In this context France noted with interest the constructive proposal made by the United States Secretary of State.\n52.\tI should like now to return for a moment to the African continent, where tension still persists, tension to which we should devote particular attention.\n53.\tLast year, from this rostrum, I spoke on behalf of France and welcomed Portugal's effort to put an end to the futile fighting and the anachronistic situation in the Territories under its sovereignty. We note that in spite of its own difficulties the Portuguese Government has faithfully fulfilled its commitments, However, our satisfaction is tinged with concern over the civil war raging in Angola, a country which seemed destined for prosperity. For its part, my Government hopes that the fighting will cease and that this country will very shortly be able to achieve independence in restored harmony.\n54.\tBut it is particularly southern Africa that remains a major cause for concern.\n55.\tOf course, in the past year we have been able to note signs which might seem to indicate a change in orientation. We believe in particular that the Government of South Africa can and should play a role conducive to the establishment in Rhodesia, within a reasonable period of time, of a Government based on majority rule.\n56.\tConcerning Namibia, the South African Government has made statements which, although partially encouraging, remain ambiguous. We shall continually stress the importance we attach to the Namibian people being able to express quickly and freely their views on the political future and constitutional structure of the Territory.\n57.\tIn this reference to the problems of Africa, the French Government cannot forget the distressing problem of apartheid, a doctrine contrary to human rights and one which deeply disturbs our conscience. France's categorical condemnation of discriminatory measures based on race recently prompted the President of the French Republic to define the strict limits of our policy on arms sales to South Africa.\n58.\tSouth Africa must respond to the appeal of the international community; it must realize that little time remains for it to satisfy by concrete action the legitimate aspirations expressed both inside and outside that country.\n59.\tIn all these areas, it goes without saying that France will be unflinching in its efforts to ensure that conciliation and consultation prevail.\n60.\tThe settlement of conflicts, the easing of tension and the encouragement of dialog are daily imperatives which the international community can no longer avoid. But we must go further: we must band together to take up the challenges threatening the very existence of mankind.\n61.\tIt is those long-term problems that I should like to mention briefly in conclusion.\n62.\tIn the nuclear age, the first problem is quite obviously the maintenance and strengthening of peace.\n63.\tCan we put an end to the chronic state of insecurity from which mankind has suffered from the beginning of its history and which, since the emergence of weapons of mass destruction, threatens its survival? If the international community believes, as France does, that this ideal, although distant, is indeed attainable and that in any case for the human race there is no longer any alternative to peace, then we should get down to work.\n64.\tOn the long road ahead, disarmament genuine, universal and controlled disarmament is and remains more necessary than ever.\n65.\tFrance, for its part, has supported the idea of a world conference now under consideration by our Organization. That plan, if it were assured of the support of all the military Powers, in particular the five nuclear Powers, would be able to get us out of the ruL in which we have become bogged down.\n66.\tI should now like to state the view of the French Government with regard to the principal treaties on nuclear arms. The discriminatory nature, in its view, of some of the clauses in those treaties has prevented my country from acceding to them. However, France, as it has stated, intends to act as though it were a signatory. France is fully aware of the responsibilities attaching to the status of a nuclear Power which is our status and believes with the majority of nations that the proliferation of nuclear weapons should be avoided. My Government has already made known its intention to take part in this work. I can confirm this today and state our wish to participate in every genuine effort liable to bring about real and controlled reduction, and relieve mankind of the burden and threat of the arms race.\n67.\tA world which, thanks to genuine disarmament and the adoption of peaceful means of settling disputes, would finally be freed from those haunting fears would be able to devote its efforts to developing its resources, its production methods and its way of life.\n68.\tFor 30 years we have been living with the obsession of a nuclear nightmare; but is not mankind also in danger of perishing from lack of oxygen or water, packed as we are together on a planet which has become too small for us? Such prospects no longer belong just to the realm of science fiction, because we are entering the age of finite resources and we must realize the present inability of our world community to deal with those fundamental problems. Surely it is time for us to put our heads together and take joint action to remedy this situation.\n69.\tThe excesses and lack of foresight of industrial civilization have other more subtle aspects just as potentially tragic. We are jeopardizing with reckless arrogance the balances established by nature for millions of years. That is just one more worldwide problem that should be considered by the United Nations.\n70.\tThe development of the productive forces of mankind should be placed at the service of all men. We agree on the need for reorganization in order to put an end to intolerable inequalities. Hundreds of millions of people in the world are threatened by hunger; the majority of mankind live in a state of destitution unworthy of human beings. The continued expansion of the world economy is therefore indispensable. Nevertheless, we must not allow ourselves to be swept away by the mystique of production and consumption, nor must we forget our ultimate mission: the spiritual and intellectual development of man. Let us not become the agents and ultimately the slaves of a voracious economy. We must above all tackle the major problem of growth in its two aspects: the means of ensuring balanced expansion and the goals at which the arduous labor of man must be aimed.\n71.\tThe topics for study which I have just suggested are directed to a fundamental concern that is basically the justification of any genuine policy respect for and development of the human personality. This concern has continually guided our Organization, which has achieved much in the field of human rights. But the battle for recognition of and respect for fundamental rights is far from won. We must fight it with determination until victory is ours.\n72.\tIn times of change and crisis one can always distinguish two main trends: towards movement and towards immobility.\n73.\tBecause it is France's tradition, its mission, and because France itself deeply feels the need for change, it is ready to put its resources, its imagination and its generosity to work for the emergence of a more just, more peaceful and more united world.\n74.\tOur Organization and all its Members can count on the active contribution of my country in this vital task of striving for world solidarity.\n"

        "file_text": "05.\t  It is a pleasant custom that, in speaking for the first time at the annual sessions of the General Assembly, one congratulates the newly-elected President. How much greater the pleasure when the President who has just been elected is the Prime Minister of a small country like my own, a fellow-member of the Council of Ministers of the European Community, and a friend. We who have known the President for many years now in the Community, know the unique qualities which he brings to the presidency; we commend him warmly to this wider Assembly; and we are confident that at the end of this session the General Assembly will congratulate itself on the good sense it has shown in selecting him to preside over its work.\n206.\tI should also like to express thanks and appreciation to the Foreign Minister of Algeria, his predecessor, who had the difficult and onerous task of presiding not only over the twenty-ninth session but also over the seventh special session, which under his guidance achieved a remarkable consensus. May ] welcome our three new Members the Republic of Cape Verde, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the People's Republic of Mozambique\twhose presence here is evidence of the commitment of the new Portugal to rapid decolonization.\n207.\tEach year at the start of the regular session we have an opportunity to indicate in general terms the principles which guide our approach to the issues on the agenda and the attitudes we propose to adopt. This year, however, seems to require something more. For this is the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and for Ireland it is also the twentieth anniversary of our admission to membership in the United Nations.\n208.\tSince it was founded in 1945 the United Nations has grown and changed expanding from the group of countries which had been victorious in the Second World War to become now virtually universal in its membership. In the first decade its membership was less than one third of what it has since become. It was seen at that time as an instrument which its Member States could use in maintaining peace in the world. But now it has also become an almost universal forum.\n209.\tWe have not, I think, quite adjusted to this fact in the way we talk about the United Nations. The truth is that, if this Organization is often unable to deal with intractable world problems or if it is ineffective in doing so, it is not so much because defects in its Charter make it unsuitable as an instrument, but precisely because as a mirror of our world of nation- States it reflects all too faithfully the whole range of their disagreements and antagonisms.\n210.\tIn general, however, the United Nations has served us well, both as an instrument and as an international forum over a period of 30 years. In that period, thanks in large part to the United Nations, there has been no world war; many serious local conflicts have been settled, or at least contained, and we have seen the major task of decolonization carried through for the most part peacefully. Throughout that period too, the United Nations and its agencies have continued their patient work in the economic, social and technical fields which, though apparently unspectacular, is of immense importance.\n211.\tWe have, of course, to recognize the fact that there are issues of the deepest concern to world public opinion with which this Organization has been unable to cope and others to which it cannot even address itself.\n212.\tThe major limitation on the power of the Organ-ization to act effectively in certain matters is the fact that the Charter is firmly based on the legal principle ot the sovereignty of Member States.\n213.\tThe procedures and structures explicitly provided for in the Charter were designed primarily to govern relations, and to deal with conflicts, at the inter-State level. But today the world is also deeply concerned about other issues which cannot be dealt with while keeping rigidly to the level of inter-State relations.\n214.\tThese issues are of two kinds: first, there are human rights issues in the broadest sense of the term \u2014I mean issues of individual freedom, of non-discrimination, of tolerance for minority rights, and of respect for the right of peoples to self-determination. These are matters which are all too often claimed to lie exclusively within the domestic jurisdiction of one State or another; in a sense then they fall below the level of the nation-State.\n215.\tBut world public opinion has by now developed to an extent where its concern and its sense of solidarity on such issues no longer ceases automatically at national frontiers. The world is, for example, deeply concerned at the problem of apartheid in southern Africa, and at its potentially dangerous consequences, Rightly, it cannot accept that this is a purely internal matter for the Government concerned. It is also understandably impatient at the idea that it is logical or consistent to be deeply concerned at this particular form of tyranny and discrimination without feeling similar concern at other examples of disregard or contempt for human rights within the boundaries of other nation-States.\n216.\tSecondly, there are the kind of issues which transcend the capacity of the nation-State. These issues are simply too large and too extensive to be coped with at the level of the individual sovereign State acting either on its own or in direct dealings with its near neighbors. In this category I would include such major current questions as disarmament in all its aspects, the world economic order, protection of the environment, the law of the sea and world food and population problems. These are issues where the fate of each depends to a greater or lesser extent on the actions of every other, and where the common survival requires acceptance of interdependence and common action, to a degree that would be impossible if each nation-State were to act in isolation.\n217.\tIn face of such issues some below the level of the nation-State, and some beyond it there are naturally difficulties for a world Organization which is based, as it must be at present, on the legal concepts of sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs.\n218.\tIt would, I am afraid, be premature at this point to expect a radical change in the structures which were established by the Charter on the basis of the sovereign nation-State and the principle of nonintervention. We are at a point in history where we realize that some older concepts may have to be modified, but we are not yet able to devise new principles that will be appropriate to an interdependent world, while still securing to our peoples those rights that we have hitherto sought to safeguard through the principle of national sovereignty.\n219.\tHow should we act during this transition between the old world order of absolute national sovereignty and the emergence of a new world order appropriate to interdependence? We must, while respecting the rights of others, be willing in our own actions and policies to allow ourselves increasingly to be guided in our work by the spirit as well as the letter of the Charter. This means that goodwill and good sense will be necessary on all sides during this interim period to make the present inadequate structures work effectively and remain relevant in a changing world.\n220.\tOur Organization has had its successes in this respect. Thus, on the first kind of issue 1 mentioned, that of human rights and self-determination, there has been the process of decolonization, now almost completed, for the most part by peaceful means, and as a result of moral pressures.\n221.\tWe have not, however, succeeded in making much progress in respect of individual human rights within nation-States. We have not yet reached a stage where there could be agreement between all States Members of the United Nations to grant to their peoples the right which some of us in Western Europe have given to our peoples to appeal to an international instance against any abuse of power by our own Governments. It should be a source of shame to all of us in this Organization that a body such as Amnesty International, widely respected, should have to report that in the territories of 100 Members of this Organization breaches of human rights occur and that one Member State, Chile, is currently refusing admission to a United Nations human rights study group, the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Situation of Human Rights in Chile.\n222.\tThe United Nations has had some successes too with regard to those issues which transcend the capacity of the individual nation-States, although to date it has no more than felt its way towards dealing with such problems as disarmament, the law of the sea, the protection of the environment, and, most recently, and with some real success, the world economic order,\n223.\tWhile we await the slow development of a new world order in which abuses of national sovereignty, domestic or external, will be restrained by the existence of a superior world-wide jurisdiction, there is naturally an increasing tendency for States with common histories and common interests to form regional organizations of greater or lesser coherence. Is this tendency good or bad? I think it is neither good nor bad in itself everything depends upon whether such groups of States in their actions at the international level are simply larger projections of the limited self-interests of individual sovereign States which these can no longer realize in isolation, or whether these larger groupings too are animated by the principles to which I have referred by a genuine concern for human rights and freedom within their own boundaries, and a genuine recognition of an even higher level of interdependence between all States that goes beyond the level of the regional group in question. In the worst case these regional groups could become conflicting power blocs; in the best case they could prove to be the building blocks of a new international order which, frankly, could be difficult to found upon 150 or more separate units, each pursuing individualistic policies.\n224.\tSince 1 January 1973 my country has been a member of one such regional grouping which has a particular coherence the European Community. This involves a commitment at this stage to consult, and where possible to align, its policies with its partners, and in the long run a commitment to an ever closer inter-relationship within a European union,\n225.\tIreland does not see its commitment to the European Community as competing with our membership in the United Nations. We feel, rather, that in both cases our participation is animated by the same principles, those of which I have spoken. With our partners we share a common attitude on individual freedoms and human rights and we seek to give effect to this attitude within our own countries; all of us, of course, accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights, established by the wider grouping of the Council of Europe. Externally, in our relations with the rest of the world we. like our partners, are fully aware of the need far interdependence. As a group we played an important part in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. We have also sought to establish new kinds of relationships with other groups of countries outside Europe, through, for example, the Lome Convention, which as President of the Council of Ministers I signed on behalf of the Community seven months ago, and through the Euro-Arab dialog. Beyond that, we recognize the need to see interdependence established on a global scale and, with our partners, in a statement issued by the nine Heads of Government in July, we gave strong support to the United Nations as the world body where this could be given effect.\n226.\tIt is perhaps worth adding (hat in my own country a serious consideration in relation to our participation in the European Economic Community has been its possible impact upon our contribution to the work of the United Nations, within which, in the 17 years before we joined the European Community, we endeavored to be constructive members. During the referendum campaign which preceded our entry to the Community, those of us who advocated membership were frequently asked searching questions on this point, thus demonstrating the extent to which attachment to the basic principles of the United Nations and to its role in the world exists at the popular level in my country. The answer we gave to those who posed us those questions was that participation in the European Economic Community is entirely compatible, not merely with membership in the United Nations that is self-evident but also with the pursuit of the kind of policies lo which we had committed ourselves during our years as United Nations Members before joining the Community. Moreover, membership in the Community will enable and has enabled us\u2014to join with others in promoting within the Community a full and wholehearted acceptance of the need to rebuild the world economic order on more equitable lines, wiping out the ill-effects of the past colonial order, from which my country itself suffered in the past.\n227.\tSo far 1 have tried to outline the bawd ideas which guide us in our approach to the agenda of this session in the twentieth year of our membership in the United Nations. The agenda before us at this session is a long one. It contains 125 items some of them disputes at the inter-State level, others issues of human rights or larger economic or political issues \nof the kind to which I have referred. During the next three months the 141 Member States will be called on to take a position by speaking and voting on each of these issues.\n228.\tPerhaps we do not always realize just what a novel development this is. Since the foundation of the League of Nations, and more particularly over the 30 years since the United Nations was established, we have had to grow accustomed to the idea that each of us Member States, large or small, remote or deeply involved, is called on each year in the General Assembly to take a stand and to commit itself in detail on almost every world issue, and to do so in terms of a Charter which serves as a code of principles of international conduct.\n229.\tThis is in many ways a development of great importance. Indeed, it may not be too much to say that the principal success of the United Nations over 30 years has been, not so much how it dealt with any particular problem, but the more basic fact that its mere existence and the existence of its Charter have promoted, and secured increasing acceptance for, the idea that there is a code of right and wrong and not merely of expediency in international affairs. It is true, of course, that not all of us adhere as well as we might to the principles we proclaim in the Charter. But what is remarkable is that, even when we do not, we are at pains to try to justify our behavior in its terms.\n230.\tBut this new situation can also present problems. Our procedure here has always been such that the positions of Member States must be given expression through the votes they cast on detailed draft resolutions, often presented by those most deeply involved in a particular conflict or question. At times a decision on a complex resolution must be taken quickly in a national capital, and sometimes the choice is limited to \\\"Yes\\\", \\\"No\\\" or \\\"Abstain\\\", because there may be no opportunity to vote separately on particular parts of the text.\n231.\tIn this situation, at times one of limited choice, made in haste, on complex issues, it is not always easy for a Member State such as my own which firmly supports the United Nations and has a strong commit-ment to certain international principles, to be sure that the views it holds so firmly will be given adequate expression in every vote it is called upon to cast. What we can do is to try to act on each of these resolutions on the basis of our best interpretation of the applicability of the principles of the Charter to the issues raised.\n232.\tI should like to turn now to say something more specific on a number of the main issues on the agenda. Two major questions before us clearly transcend the boundaries of the nation-State: the need to reform the world economic order and the threat of nuclear proliferation.\n233.\tSo far as the first of these is concerned I can be brief, as this session immediately follows the seventh special session which ended in a consensus resolution on development and international economic co-operation [resolution 3362 (S-V/I)]. The work at that special session, despite pessimistic forecasts by some commentators, was constructive and positive.\n234.\tBecause of the work done at the Paris preparatory conference in April, and because of the progress made since that conference in discussions among the developed countries, the developing countries accepted that the industrialized world was serious about tackling the problems which had been identified so bluntly at the sixth special session.\n235.\tOn 13 October the resumed preparatory meeting will again convene in Paris. The resolution passed by the seventh special session will provide much of the underlying agenda of the four main commissions that are likely to emerge from the international conference to be prepared in Paris next month for this resolution covered most of the issues, other than energy, that come within the terms of reference of that proposed conference.\n236.\tPromises have been made, promises have been accepted and promises must now be implemented. If the developed world, in its relations with developing countries is to keep the faith expressed in the resolution of the seventh special session, then it must be prepared to negotiate towards real concessions and, where necessary, to modify the less-than-iron law of the market. We are convinced that the European Community is prepared, in a continuing and evolving way, to do just that.\n237.\tOne consequence of these developments now taking place in relation to the world economic order may well be that the existing structure of the United Nations and its specialized agencies may need to be reconsidered, so that it may play a more effective role in the new economic order now evolving. My delegation looks forward to results of the study now under way that will more effectively deploy the Organization's resources, both in the Secretariat and the specialized agencies, for the benefit of the third world, and we shall participate fully in this work.\n238.\tA second major issue with consequences that transcend national boundaries is that of nuclear proliferation. The world today is immensely vulnerable to the threat of nuclear war. On the one side there is the vast armory of nuclear weapons built up by the super-Powers. At another level, we are told that almost 500 nuclear-power reactors already operational or currently planned in 26 countries will by 1980 be producing annually as a by-product more than 40,000 pounds of plutonium which, extracted from spent fuel rods, could provide enough weapons-grade fissionable material for more than 2,000 Hiroshima-size bombs each year. Nuclear facilities have been provided to countries which have not even signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], and nuclear resources furnished with a view to helping at least one developing country to add to its energy resources have been turned, in defiance of safeguards, to explosive purposes. The list of countries with nuclear capability which either have set off nuclear explosions or are within measurable distance of being able to do so is lengthening each year. The time has come to tackle this problem if we are serious about avoiding nuclear war. In 1958 my country took the initiative in proposing in this Assembly a draft resolution on the issue of non-proliferation. The adoption of this resolution in 1961 was seen as a step on the way to the non-proliferation Treaty signed in 1968. That Treaty was a milestone, but urgent further action is now required if its fundamental purpose is not to be jeopardized.\n239. We need a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Such a treaty should be explicit and effective in its terms. The aim, in my view, should be to put an end to test explosions whether over or under the ground. But the problem of peaceful nuclear explosions requires further study. The question is whether in fact such explosions confer any benefits not obtainable by other means, whether they carry serious dangers to mankind and whether they can be distinguished from nuclear-weapon-test explosions. Pending action in the light of the report of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Nuclear Explosions for Peaceful Purposes [AI10/68 and Coir.I and Add.l], the establishment of which we welcome, there should be an agreed moratorium on all non-military nuclear explosive tests by all Powers.\n. 240. I should like to see a comprehensive test-ban treaty provide, first, that all those countries which are in a position to export nuclear materials and technology should form a suppliers' club and agree to transfer fissionable know-how only to non-nuclear- weapon States which are prepared to meet accepted approved IAEA safeguards on all peaceful nuclear programs and are willing to return all spent fuel to the supplier country for reprocessing; secondly, the IAEA itself should in this connexion adopt much tighter standards of protection and control in the production, transfer and use of nuclear materials and technology; and, thirdly, to the extent that if, after the moratorium and the study of the question of peaceful explosions, such explosions were permitted on an agreed basis, there must be provision for adequate inspection.\n241.\tWe welcome the work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament on the question of a comprehensive test ban, as well as the fact that the Soviet Union has taken an initiative in proposing a comprehensive test-ban treaty. This latter proposal should be carefully studied during this session with a view to seeing whether it could provide a basis for a treaty that would incorporate the elements to which I have just referred.\n242.\tThe super-Powers in particular have their responsibilities. They must face them. Only they, working together, can halt and reverse the vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons; this is closely connected with halting the horizontal spread. If they continue their dangerous nuclear arms race, they are in a weak moral position to ask the near-nuclear countries to refrain from developing nuclear weapons.\n243.\tThere is a danger a grave danger, I fear that this issue will not be taken seriously. The reaction or, rather, the lack of reaction throughout the world, including the developing world, to recent events in connexion with nuclear materials in certain developing countries, is not a good augury for the future. No considerations of prestige and no desire to strengthen a country's military position against that of another Member of this Organization should be permitted to stand in the way of a tight control over the appalling nuclear capabilities which represent an increasingly widespread threat to peace.\n244.\tAt a level below that of inter-State relations is the question of human rights. In the past our concept of these rights has perhaps been too narrow. We have not taken sufficient account, for example, of the right to life the most fundamental of all. This right to life involves the right to food, the right not to be faced with starvation and famine. Famine on the scale on which it exists in some parts of the world today is one of the most terrible scourges affecting, not merely those in this generation who are in dire starvation, but also their descendants for generations to come, as my country knows from its own history.\n245.\tThere are, however, other human rights which are violated in a widespread way in the modern world perhaps even increasingly violated. Among these is the right to be free from torture. In the continent from which I come it was widely believed in the early part of this century that our civilization had brought us to a point where torture had ceased to be thinkable as a policy measure by European States. The history of the past 40 years has seen this illusion shattered not once but many times, not by one country but by many. The world today has become tolerant of torture in a way that was certainly not true two generations back. We must reverse the drift towards tolerance of this most evil weapon of public policy. It must be outlawed; no excuse must be made for it; and no excuse must be made for any State which indulges in it, whatever part of the world it may be in.\n246.\tI warmly endorse the proposal of the United States Secretary of State [2355th meeting] that the United Nations appoint a group of experts to undertake an authoritative study of the nature and extent of torture. I am convinced that world opinion can be mobilized to outlaw its use by any State that indulges in it for any reason. The adoption of a draft declaration on torture by the Fifth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders [AS 10260, para. /5] is a most promising step, and I trust that it will receive the favorable attention of the General Assembly.\n247.\tThere are many less dramatic but none the less deplorable breaches of human rights to which this Assembly should give its attention and to which the Governments represented here should commit themselves to seek a remedy. Because the nation-States represented in this Assembly do not necessarily coincide with cultural entities, there exist in many countries minority problems which are often quite severe in their effects on those involved. We need some kind of code to protect the rights of minorities, to set out what these rights should be and to establish a standard against which a State can measure itself and be measured by its peers.\n248.\tWomen are certainly not a minority, but in virtually every country in the world women, for historical or cultural reasons, have less rights than men. Much is being done to remedy these grievances and the United Nations has endeavored to accelerate progress in this field by nominating 1975 as International Women's Year. The effect of this is already evident in many Member countries of this Organization where the publicity given to this issue in the present year is inducing Governments to take belated action to set right the many injustices imposed on women by custom and by law. A balance-sheet of this progress needs to be drawn up and presented to the Members of this Organization lest, when the year is over, the pressure towards reform be relaxed or the efforts to set right these injustices be reduced.\n249.\tIn conclusion, I wish to turn for a few moments to a problem that acutely concerns my Government the tragic situation in Northern Ireland. There, two sections of a small community live in an escalating cycle of mutual fear and violence that is destroying the hope of a normal life for them and for their children. Within the last six years there have been 1,300 killings and over 15,000 injuries to people, caused by almost 5,000 explosions and nearly 25,000 shooting incidents.\n250.\tMy Government has sought to promote a peaceful solution and to reduce tension by every means at its disposal. We have expressly proclaimed . our rejection of violence in any form. We have accepted the right of a majority within Northern Ireland to determine freely the character of the relationship of Northern Ireland with our State, and we stated our willingness to have an agreement to this effect registered with the United Nations. We have arrested and imprisoned members of organizations engaged in violence in Northern Ireland, many of them people from that area who crossed into our territory. We have taken the necessary legal steps to enable us to bring to justice anyone in our territory against whom evidence is produced that he has committed a murder in Northern Ireland; and we have initiated legislation, shortly to be passed by our Parliament, to extend this unique revision to all other crimes of violence.\n251.\tWe have, moreover, sought to work in friendship with the leaders of both sections of the community in Northern Ireland, and have co-operated with the United Kingdom Government in a joint policy which would bring internal self-government there on a power-sharing basis as between the two sections of the community, and would bring close links between north and south.\n252.\tAll these efforts have yet to yield fruit, for the small groups of violent men on either side in Northern Ireland have immense power to destroy political solutions and to inhibit co-operation between moderate leaders of the two sections of the community. Endless patience is needed in seeking a solution that will resolve fears and appease hatreds. But in spite of this violence from unrepresentative groups, we believe that elected political leaders of the two sections of the community can yet reach an agreement that will provide a solution to the problem of the self-government of this area on a basis fair to both sections. Moreover, we believe that agreement on this issue, if reached, would provide a basis for a joint approach to the restoration of order and the elimination of the nightmare of violence political violence, sectarian violence and criminal violence which has plagued this area for the past six years.\n253.\tOur Government pledges itself to work towards this end. We are willing to meet at any time with the United Kingdom Government, or the elected leaders of the two sections of the community in Northern Ireland, to discuss how we can contribute to a settlement of this crisis in Northern Ireland. In any such discussions we shall not be found wanting in generosity or in willingness to make sacrifices in the common cause of peace. We all of us share in the responsibility for what has happened in Northern Ireland, which is the unhappy consequence of the unhappy history of our island. So intimately linked are the two parts of the island, which share so many common institutions churches, sporting organizations, the trade union movement, the banking system and so closely interwoven are the security problems of the two areas along their 362-mile land frontier, that any solution must, if it is to work, be one in which we play a full and generous part.\n254.\tWe can never be indifferent to what happens in Northern Ireland, where fellow Irishmen, members of the same churches and trade unions, supporters of the same sporting teams, inheritors of the same largely unhappy history, Protestants and Catholics alike, are being killed and maimed, and their property destroyed by a mindless terrorism.\n255.\tWe ask the sympathy of the world's peoples for the tragedy of Northern Ireland. We ask for their understanding of the way in which in Northern Ireland, as in some other parts of the world such as Cyprus, the unbearable burden of an unhappy history, too heavy to be easily shrugged off even by men of goodwill, condemns decent people to a life of fear and violence. We ask for their patience while the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland, under terrible pressures from extremists, including often threats of violence, try to find a basis upon which to build a new system of government in the province, in conjunction with the United Kingdom Government and my own Government.\n256.\tThe rock upon which we are trying to build, and are encouraging the people of Northern Ireland to build, is that of a total rejection of violence as a force in politics. Upon this principle, which lies at the foundation of the Charter of the United Nations, a solution can, given patience and time, be found to bring the people of Northern Ireland out of the nightmare in which they live and into a peaceful and democratic society within which the right to life, to freedom, and to a fair share of the community's resources is guaranteed.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "91.\tThe thirtieth session of the General Assembly is taking place when the curtain has just come down on important events which make our era stand out, and which are a constant reminder that what mankind needs the most is freedom and justice.\n92.\tThe 30-year heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people and the sacrifices made by the Cambodian people testify to the fact that force, no matter how powerful or fierce, cannot bend the will of a people determined fully to enjoy its prerogatives.\n93.\tThe Government and the people of Niger, through me, warmly welcome the recent victory of those courageous peoples over foreign oppression. May their example be an inspiration to the freedom fighters of the world, committed to the struggle to liberate their lands and their peoples from colonialism and international imperialism. Much hard sacrifice will be\nrequired for years to come but nothing will stop them from achieving their noble objective.\n94.\tThe devotion of the people of the world to freedom was also shown in the struggle of the African people against Portuguese domination. The victory of that struggle may be seen in the defeat of Portuguese colonialism and the independence of certain territories. Last year Guinea-Bissau became independent; this year Cape Verde, Mozambique, and Sao Tome and Principe became independent. That independence was crowned this year at our current session by their unanimous welcome into our Organization.\n95.\tI am pleased to extend the sincere congratulations of the people of Niger to those countries. Throughout their struggle we have always stood by them in their suffering and their sacrifices. Accordingly we are justly proud of their victory. We welcome the membership of those States in our Organization as much as we deplore the absence of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam. Dare we hope that the United States will reconsider its position on that problem in the near future?\n96.\tAnother combat, which has also been a combat for liberation, has been the efforts of the countries of the third world to establish a more just and equitable new economic order.\n97.\tThat is a great victory for the third world, but it is no less a victory for the developed countries. It justifies optimism regarding the future because the trail has only just now been blazed towards genuine detente, which we view as an indivisible whole. However, the industrialized countries must not rest content with making promises, they must do their utmost to see to it that those promises are carried out. The countries of the third world must become better organized and they must stand together increasingly, for they are primarily responsible for the well being of their people. I am pleased to announce here that Niger is prepared to work for genuine co-operation with all countries of the world, and in particular with the countries of the third world, convinced, as we are, that as long as the peoples of the world have diverging aspirations, co-operation will inevitably remain an area in which the strong endeavor to bring pressure to bear on the weak. Countries of the third world must then unite even in poverty, for as we have seen unity and poverty can also be a force to which the world at large must pay heed if it is to survive.\n98.\tWe wish now to pay a just tribute to the leaders of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, who took the initiative in proposing two special sessions of the General Assembly on the problems of development. With their faith and determination they have as worthy representatives of the third world convinced the world that there is an overriding need to reform the old economic order established and maintained by imperialism. The entire third world is grateful to them.\n99.\tNotwithstanding these many achievements that I have just mentioned, there are a number of trouble spots in Africa where decolonization is not moving ahead as it should. I am referring to Angola, southern Africa, the so-called French coast of Somalia and the so-called Spanish Sahara.\n100.\tOn the subject of Angola, much has been said about the plight of the Angolan people. For more than 14 years they waged effectively a relentless struggle against Portuguese colonialism, but now, on the threshold of their independence, they are killing each other. To my delegation what is happening in Angola is much more than a fratricidal struggle for power between the Movimento Popular de Libertagiao de Angola[MPLA], the Frente Nacional para a Liberta^o de Angola [FNLA] and the Uniao Nacional para a Independencia Tola I de Angola [UN IT A]. No sooner does a bright tomorrow seem about to dawn for this country, already ravaged by a colonial war and several centuries of harsh occupation, than from the outside springs up the problem of what the political color of Angola will be tomorrow. Some States have already gone to great lengths to foment and maintain disorder in the country. It was with some concern that we learnt of the unlimited arms supply policies being pursued by certain Powers towards some of the national liberation movements, and more recently we heard of the intrusion of South Africa's armed forces in part of the Angolan territory. Judging from what has been going on, we must say that there has been flagrant interference, and regardless of where the interference comes from we would say there must be an end to hegemony, an end to imperialism, an end to pressure of any kind, from whatever source. I would beg the leaders of the three liberation movements to realize that by their negative attitude they are running the risk of losing everything they have won, and of imperilling to some extent the future of their land and thus the complete liberation of Africa.\n101.\tThe fact that there are still many Africans who are deprived of their right to self-determination and independence, and moreover victims of the discriminatory system of apartheid and racism is a source of serious concern to us. In southern Africa the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa are still deprived of their fundamental rights and are victims of practices which our Organization has quite rightly called crimes against mankind. It is high time that the entire international community put an end to the continued bluster of Vorster and Smith. We cannot accept that a handful of adventurers, with the connivance of certain Powers which wish to safeguard their petty interests, continue to be allowed to keep millions of human beings in a state of abject subjugation. That is why my country supports the struggle of those peoples, under the leadership of the national liberation movements, and advocates the complete implementation of the Dar es Salaam Declaration on Southern Africa adopted by the Council of Ministers of the OAU at its ninth extraordinary session last April.\n102.\tIn South Africa in particular, the plight of the black population cannot be a matter of indifference to my country. We will not go along with any compromise or dialog with the minority racist regime there\n103.\tNiger makes a solemn appeal to the major Powers to reconsider their stand regarding the South African regime. Our appeal is addressed especially to the three permanent members of the Security Council which in a period of less than 12 months, on two separate occasions and standing together, have vetoed sanctions against a State which, as the whole world realizes, has violated the Charter of our Organization. Regardless of the methods used to give extra time to that regime, which is at bay because of the collapse of the Portuguese colonial edifice, the victory of the forces of liberation is inevitable and the vice it is caught in is growing ever tighter.\n104.\tMy delegation welcomes the fact that the international situation is marked by detente at the present time, but that detente is precarious and limited because a number of thorny problems remain to be solved by the international community as a whole if another period of cold war in international relations is to be avoided. First of all, my delegation believes that, to safeguard the atmosphere of peaceful coexistence at present prevailing in international relations, special attention must be given to the question of disarmament. My country is convinced that the question of disarmament is not a matter which should be dealt with solely by those who can unleash the apocalypse.\n105.\tThe process of disarmament cannot be successful unless all States participate, for in the event of a conflict no State, great or small, will be spared. This is a particularly serious problem because, according to the statistics, more than $300,000 million are being spent each year on the arms race. At the risk of repeating what other delegations have already said, I would say that, if that amount of money were used to fight poverty in the world, the lives of millions of dispossessed men, women and children who are in the grip of sickness and hunger could be spared.\n106.\tThe policy of deterrence the prime cause of the unbridled arms race is the surest way of giving the countries of the third world their own nuclear arsenals. We believe that, in order to avoid that danger and to prevent that waste of resources, there must be general and complete disarmament, which would more successfully prevent a possible confrontation that could only spell the doom of all mankind. That is why we firmly uphold the principle of holding a special session on disarmament which would be modeled on those devoted to raw materials and development. The resources which would be saved by disarmament should be devoted to the development of the least advanced countries.\n107.\tTurning to the Middle East, my delegation reaffirms its complete support for the struggle of Egypt and the other Arab States to recover their occupied territories and for the just cause of the Palestinian people. We are firmly convinced that a just and lasting settlement in that area of the world can be brought about only if the Palestinians are allowed fully to assert their national rights, in particular the right to return to their homeland and the right to self-determination as the black people are ignored and slighted return to their homeland and the right of self-determination.Any settlements which does not take account of that factor will be doomed to failure. Israel must display goodwill and not continue to deny the fact of the existence of Palestine, which, moreover, was recognized last year nearly everyone in the General Assembly. The OAU and the third world in general \nin the name of some theory of racial superiority South African regime must understand that it cannot for ever defy world public opinion. It must realize that it must eventually co-operate with the United Nations, first of all by returning the Territory of Namibia.\nthat factor will be doomed to failure. Israel must display goodwill and not continue to deny the fact of the existence of Palestine which, moreover, was recognized last year by nearly everyone in the Genera^ Assembly. The OAU and the third world in general have expressed their willingness for a just settlement to the dispute, thereby demonstrating political maturity and a realistic approach to problems threatening international peace and security. That is why Israel must make full use of the opportunity offered it. We have been much impressed by everything that Egypt has done to bring about peace. My country supports the actions of the Egyptian leaders, for we are convinced that they are by no means prejudicing the rights of the Palestinian people or the principle of the complete recovery of the occupied territories.\n108.\tTurning to the question of Cyprus, my delegation pays a tribute to our Secretary-General, who has made it possible for the two Cypriot communities to establish a frank and fruitful dialog. We earnestly hope that that dialog will be pursued under the auspices of our Organization and that the integrity and independence of Cyprus will be respected. Those conditions are a sine qua non for a return to peace on the island which, with our own country, share an aspiration for non-alignment.\n109.\tWith regard to the Asian continent, after the victory of the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples over international imperialism there is only one cloud on the horizon: the question of Korea. On that question my country has always advocated a balanced policy, which is indispensable for a peaceful settlement in the area. That is why we have maintained diplomatic relations with the two Koreas. Niger has always given its support to the dialog which began in 1972 between the two parties with a view to the peaceful reunification of the country. It is a matter for regret that no progress has been accomplished since that time in efforts to bring about national reconciliation, which is a fundamental stage to be reached before reunification. The Korean problem is essentially one for the Koreans to settle themselves and it is our earnest desire that it should be settled by peaceful means, without any form of interference.\n110.\tAt the beginning of this statement I said that the deepest aspirations of the peoples of the world were basically freedom and justice. For the countries of the third world in general and for Niger in particular it goes without saying that justice must be given specific form in economic and social development, by concrete actions based on the desire to build a better world and not by pompous and ineffective actions.\n111.\tMy country is one of the 25 poorest countries of the world. That is why for us more than anyone else economic development is a fundamental objective having the greatest priority. That is our essential concern, and the task to which my Government, under the direction of the Supreme Military Council, is devoting itself has no aim other than the well-being of the people of Niger. The terrible drought which we suffered for six consecutive years and which disrupted our already fragile economy has, understandably enough, forced us to take that path. Could we have done otherwise? A great deal has already been said about this long and terrible calamity, the harshest test which these young Sahelian States have had to face since their accession to national sovereignty and the effects of which continue to be felt. Hence, I shall confine myself here to mentioning the lessons we have learned from that tragedy and the efforts we have undertaken to meet any future events of this kind.\n112.\tAfter six years of severe trial, we have come to understand, among other things, the limits of and above all the constraints attached only too often, alas, to international assistance, assistance which, despite everything, was indispensable to Niger in the present state of affairs.\n113.\tBut what we have learned in particular and this has become our deep conviction today is that it is absolutely necessary to rely on ourselves before reaching out for assistance. We firmly believe now that no assistance from abroad, however generous, can basically replace our own efforts.\n114.\tOn the strength of that experience and with the unshakable determination to help our people rise above poverty, my Government and the Supreme Military Council have set as their objective the achievement of a vast Program of reconstruction encompassing all sectors of activity of our national life. As an example I shall refer only to the reconstitution of our livestock, the establishment of grain reserves and, finally, the \\\"Green Sahelian\\\" operation designed to stop the encroachment of the desert by means of a policy of reforestation carried out by the young people of our country, who have volunteered their services. We should like to take this opportunity to welcome the spontaneous participation of many young friendly countries.\n115.\tIt goes without saying that the size of the task ahead requires first of all the mobilization of all the material and human resources of the country. The Supreme Military Council is well aware of that and has organized our young people in such a way as to make them conscious of our national realities so that they can participate effectively in our struggle for development.\n116.\tSimilarly, my Government did not wait for International Women's Year to lay the bases for the participation of women in the task of construction that we have undertaken with such determination. Lieutenant Colonel Seyni Kountche, President of the Supreme Military Council and Head of State, recently confirmed that when he said:\n\\\"For us, the emancipation of the women of Niger means first of all their active and complete training, training which is itself a factor of progress, because that gives the women of Niger the possibility of playing an economic and social role that is more vigorous and freer.\\\"\n117.\tI have just referred to the immense task undertaken by my Government and also to our people's determination to devote all their efforts to it. Alas, however, we have learned to understand that all our efforts will be in vain until a new economic order based on justice and equity has been established.\n118.\tNiger, a land-locked country, more than 1,000 kilometres from the sea, with an area of more than 1 million square kilometers, is among those countries most adversely affected by present conditions. That is why we appeal once again to all the wealthy countries and to the most-favored third-world countries to support our efforts to rise above our present situation. When we say \\\"support our efforts\\\" we mean, for example, helping us to use our land to the best advantage, to improve our agricultural production, to diversify our crops, to exploit our natural\nresources. Niger, which has great possibilities in those spheres, attaches much importance to that aspect of co-operation.\n119.\tIn that respect, we are pleased at the successful outcome of the Brussels negotiations and the signature at Lome of a Convention recognizing a new type of relations between the developed countries and the countries of the third world. We have no hard and fast ideas about the type of relations that should exist between developed and developing countries, but we do feel that this is a step forward in the search for a solution to the problems of the developing countries.\n120.\tAs was said quite recently by Lieutenant Colonel Seyni Kountche, President of the Supreme Military Council and Head of State:\n\\\"New Niger believes in co-operation this Niger which has just emerged from a nightmare of six years of relentless disaster that has enabled us to gauge so well the effectiveness and realities of international solidarity\\\".\n121.\tAt this time when the United Nations is celebrating its thirtieth anniversary, my Government wishes solemnly to reaffirm all its faith and confidence in the Organization. In our view, the United Nations is the principal instrument of international co-operation. The seventh special session, to which I have already referred, was a precise illustration of this interdependence of our countries and peoples, which have constantly been seeking the most adequate solutions to the problems facing the entire world.\n122.\tWhether it is a matter of the establishment of peace and security or the establishment of a new international economic order, we note that in the final analysis all these problems are related. That is why we sincerely believe that in this constant search for just solutions to the problems besetting our world today a task to which the Member States are devoting themselves everyone, large and small, has a great responsibility. For its part, Niger will spare no effort to defend and encourage respect for the Charter and the rights of States. We intend to work to ensure that international relations are based on the independence and equality of States.\n123.\tBut, as must be recognized, the Charter of the United Nations, which is the corner-stone of our Organization, requires some revision now, after 30 years. It must be brought into line with today's realities. That is why we fully supported the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session [resolution 3349 (XXIX)], creating the Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter of the United Nations instructed to present a report on this question.\n124.\tMay the prosperity of our world be shared by all nations, the better to safeguard peace and security.\n125.\tNow, as I conclude my statement, I wish to extend to the President, on behalf of my delegation, our sincere congratulations on his election to preside over the thirtieth session. We believe that his distinguished qualities, which we have had occasion to admire elsewhere, guarantee the success of our session.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "1.\t Mr. President, may I express to you my sincere congratulations on your unanimous election as President of this session of the General Assembly. Your qualities of statesmanship and your dedication to the cause of peace and international understanding are already known to the developing countries. Your approach to the problems of Africa and Europe will provide wise guidance to the deliberations of this Assembly. I wish to assure you of the fullest co-operation of the delegation of Mauritius in the discharge of your responsibility.\n2.\tI should also like to express to your predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, our deepest appreciation for his valuable contribution to the twenty-ninth session and the recently concluded seventh special session of the General Assembly.\n3.\tMay I also pay my tribute to the Secretary-General, whose dedication in the service of this Organization continues to deserve our respect and admiration.\n4.\tIt is with genuine satisfaction that my Government notes that this august body is steadily approaching universality of membership and, as an African, I am particularly pleased to welcome the three newly independent States of the Republic of Cape Verde, the People's Republic of Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe to membership in the United Nations.\n5.\tWe note with great satisfaction that this session of the General Assembly meets at a time when there is no armed conflict among States, not only because we reject the resort to force in solving international disputes, but also because peace has come as a reaffirmation and a success of the will of peoples to be masters of their own fate and to live as independent and sovereign nations.\t\n6.\tWe take this opportunity, on behalf of the people and Government of Mauritius, to pay our warm tribute to the heroism and high spirit of sacrifice of the peoples of Cambodia, Viet Nam and Laos. We take pride in their victory, which is also the victory of all of us who have constantly supported their just struggle. We call upon the international community and in particular upon the United States, which has special responsibilities in this respect, to co-operate in the reconstruction of these countries ravaged by war.\n7.\tThe signature of the interim agreement between Israel and Egypt is a positive step towards a lasting settlement in the Middle East. We hope that this will provide the basis for an equitable and durable peace.\n8.\tThe events in Cyprus are a matter of great concern to us. We continue to support that nation's independence, territorial integrity, sovereignty, and non- alignment. We express the hope that the continuation of the talks between representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities will lead to an honourable settlement of all the issues involved.\n9.\tAs an African country, Mauritius is particularly concerned with the situation in southern Africa. While < demanding that the oppressive South African minority regime implement the resolutions of the United Nations on Namibia and strictly respect the latter's unity and territorial integrity, we pledge our continued support for the legitimate struggle of the Namibian people for freedom and interdependence.\n10.\tWe condemn all attempts by the white minority regime of Rhodesia to prevent an equitable solution of the Rhodesian problem in conformity with the aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe to achieve their country's liberation. We shall continue in our efforts to assure a negotiated peaceful evolution to bring about an early change in Southern Rhodesia.\n11.\tAll former Portuguese Territories in Africa, with the distressing exception of Angola, have achieved independence in an orderly and peaceful process. It is our hope, therefore that, before this Assembly adjourns, the violence and bloodshed in Angola will be halted, and that peace and order will have been restored and independence achieved in unity.\n12.\tIn regard to the problems of North and South Korea which continue to preoccupy the United Nations, my delegation is of the view that the United Nations should spare no effort to bring about a reunification of the two States in a manner which takes into account the dignity and prestige of the peoples of both parties Pending that reunification, the proposals put forward by various Member States should deserve our serious consideration.\n13.\tMauritius welcomes the results of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe as an encouraging contribution to the peace and security of the world, My delegation considers that the real value of this Conference will consist in an effective, strict and full implementation of all the norms and principles of interstate relations enshrined in the Final Act.\n14.\tWe welcome the efforts of the great Powers to secure better prospects for peace. The policy of detente has created conditions which will minimize \\\"the danger of nuclear confrontation. But in order to make detente a lasting and irreversible process it should be extended to all geographical areas, should favor an effective democratization of international relations and should, of necessity, include disarmament measures. It is with regret that we note, not only the lack of progress on disarmament, but actually the lack of perspective and the failure of this Organization to create a negotiating machinery able to promote disarmament. If one admits that the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament is not a United Nations body, then the paradox of a world Organization established for peace and security without a negotiating mechanism in the field of disarmament in evident. While agreeing with the Secretary- General that the structure and procedure of the United Nations, as well as the relation and distribution of functions among different central and regional bodies in the field of disarmament, should be studied and more clearly defined, we call upon him to submit for our consideration concrete proposals and recommendations. The revitalization of the United Nations in this field seems to be a matter of priority.\n15.\tCertain States concerned with security in their respective areas have been advocating the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in their respective areas. It is the duty of the nuclear Powers to give those States solemn assurances that they will refrain from the use of nuclear weapons in those areas. As a member of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], Mauritius is committed, together with the other African States, to the complete ban of any type of nuclear weapons from the African continent and especially from the Indian Ocean.\n16.\tIndeed, Mauritius firmly supports the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. We welcome the consultations under way for summoning, as a first step, a conference of littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean with a view to implementing that Declaration through concerted efforts directed towards the elimination of great Power and foreign and imperialist military rivalry and bases from the Indian Ocean, as well as from the littoral and hinterland States. We invite the great Powers and* the major maritime users of the Indian Ocean to refrain from all actions incompatible with the objectives of the Declaration. We also invite them to avoid further escalation of their military presence in the area.\n17. One cannot envisage a lasting peace as long as under-development exists and as long as the world is divided between rich and poor. The eradication of under-development and the more rapid economic and social progress of the countries that are lagging behind are a primordial requirement for the development of the whole of mankind. In this connexion, the Lome Convention, of which, Mr. President, you are one of the main architects and which was signed between the European Economic Community and 46 developing nations of the African, Caribbean and Pacific areas points to a more concrete and realistic approach to the social and economic problems of the developing countries.\n18.\tThe final document of the seventh special session of this Assembly [resolution 3362 (S-VII)] also provides useful guidelines for a solution of the problems confronting us. The third-world countries have already\n** demonstrated their willingness to seek agreement through negotiations and it is our conviction that, as time passes, the difference in our viewpoints will gradually diminish as we begin to implement the points of agreement. This evolution in the relationship between developed and developing countries should provide a solid basis for the co-operative undertakings put forth at the seventh special session.\n19.\tThe United Nations is the center where the nations of the world can meet and harmonize their efforts to attain their objectives and where each and every nation must find a place in this large family. The universality of this Organization must at no time be challenged or eroded.\n20.\tThe United Nations is entering the fourth decade of its existence, and during that period it has played a significant part in the promotion of peace, co-operation and understanding among nations. It is our duty to strengthen it by preserving its universal character so as to take full advantage of its vast possibilities.\n21.\tI should like to conclude by reaffirming the complete faith and belief of the Government and people of Mauritius in the lofty principles on which this Organization was founded. It is the only instrument which can ensure the future of mankind, provided our faith in it remains unshaken.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\n152.\t At the beginning of this new session of the Assembly, it is with a certain satisfaction that we look back on the year which has elapsed since the twenty-ninth session. We see, in effect, that there have been positive developments towards the solution of important problems which were of serious concern to us last year. We are also aware that the complexity of the questions we have to resolve on the international level compel us more than ever to persevere in our efforts to create a more just, more stable, more prosperous and more united world. We have reached a phase in the development of international relations where an increasing interdependence among nations requires of us greater mutual understanding, closer collaboration and a spirit of understanding. We can there-fore feel pleased that at this important stage of our work we have elected to guide us the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, Mr. Gaston Thorn. The distinguished attributes of our President are well known to us. Representing a country which is politically active on the international scene, Mr. Gaston Thorn has for years played an important and effective role in many international meetings, to which he has contributed by his perspicacity, wisdom and judgment. His enlightened guidance will make it possible for the thirtieth session to find sound and satisfactory solutions to the problems before us.\n153.\tI should like to say on this occasion that we shall remember the important debates of the preceding session as closely linked to the brilliant personality of the Foreign Minister of Algeria. The twenty-ninth session had to deal with extremely important international problems calling for speedy decisions. The energy and discernment of Mr. Bouteflika enabled him to control the thorny debates. I must convey to him the warm appreciation of my Government, as well as my own thanks, addressed to a colleague representing a country which is closely linked with my own.\n154.\tI must also pay a tribute to the untiring efforts of our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in the exercise of his difficult functions, to make the voice of the United Nations better heard in the various areas of international life. We have found in him a strong support for our Organization. His great personal qualities, his tact, his perspicacity and his devotion to the cause of our Organization enable him effectively to discharge the very difficult task we have entrusted to him. I should like to express to him our appreciation and our deep gratitude.\n155.\tDuring this session we have had the very great pleasure of welcoming to our Organization three new States: Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and Mozambique. At the time that these new States, which have won their independence, are taking their place in the community of nations, I should like to express my earnest conviction that they will make a valuable contribution to our activities.\n156.\tWe are pleased at the accession to independence of the Comoros and Papua New Guinea. We greet those peoples who have come to join the international community. Their admission to membership in the United Nations will constitute another important stage on the road to universality.\n157.\tDuring the year which has just ended, developments have taken place which could have very favorable consequences for the maintenance and strengthening of peace and the establishment of closer and more constructive co-operation among all countries of the world. The conclusion of the work of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the confirmation of the achievements of that Conference by the meeting of European Heads of Government in Helsinki constitutes an event of considerable historical importance in that it reflects the sincerely expressed will of all European countries to adhere in their relations to standards of conduct dictated by the special conditions of detente. Those standards of conduct, which have been defined in the Final Act of Helsinki, have not, it is true, a legal, binding character. The Final Act constitutes, rather, a commitment of a political and moral nature, which in our view is equally important and which in the present political circumstances should have its own force of persuasion and duty. I should like to note that this is a difficult commitment since it is a global one, which covers the various facets of international relations. The Turkish Government wishes to express here the hope and the conviction that all of the participating countries, conscious of the importance of that document and of the fact that it will acquire its true value and effectiveness through respect by all of the principles laid down in the Final Act, will make it their duty to abide by it, thus ensuring the strengthening of detente in Europe.\n158.\tIn the view of my Government, the consequences and implications of that Conference, and the signing of the Final Act at Helsinki, cannot be confined to Europe. From the very beginning of the Conference my country has insistently stressed, and in full agreement with the wishes of most non-European Mediterranean countries, that it is not possible to isolate certain political and economic problems of Europe from those of the Mediterranean region as a whole. My country had also from the beginning maintained the view that detente is indivisible, and that it cannot exist in isolation on one continent if it is not maintained on the others. The Final Act of the Conference having been signed, I think that it is necessary to draw attention to the fact that its meaning and, in a general sense, its scope go beyond the confines of the European continent. The presence at Helsinki of the Secretary- General symbolized, indeed, the harmony existing between the principles laid down by the Conference and the goals pursued by the United Nations.\n159.\tIt will therefore appear natural that Turkey, which occupies a geopolitical position at the crossroads of two continents, underscores the world implications of detente in Europe. My country, owing to this very special geopolitical position, is compelled, under the political conditions of detente, to play a difficult and important role. I can state that Turkey is fully aware of the duties incumbent upon it because of this special position as concerns the maintenance and strengthening of detente. All of Turkey's efforts in its foreign policy are directed towards that purpose. On the other hand, it has felt that one of its primary obligations was to consolidate detente in its own region, and it is with that goal in mind that it pursues an active policy of friendly co-operation with all its neighbors in Western Europe. With its neighbors of the East Iran, Pakistan and the Arab countries of the Middle East it has friendly and close relations based on common traditions, on historical and cultural links. On the other hand, it firmly supports, in the international arena, any initiatives aimed at enhancing the political and economic ties among States in different regions of the world, aware that in the present circumstances they have become closely interdependent.\n160.\tThere can be no doubt that political detente must have the support of appropriate measures in the area of security, having as a goal the gradual reduction of the dangers of military conflagration. It is on this basis that my Government participates in the negotiations on the mutual reduction of armed forces and weapons in Europe. The Turkish Government will support, within the more general framework of world disarmament, any measure that will be a real step towards the final goal of complete disarmament under effective control. My Government is of the view that the achievement of general disarmament is possible, that it can proceed by stages, provided that the balance of forces is maintained and that adequate measures of control are accepted and applied at each stage. This kind of realistic approach will make it possible, in our view, for nations to effectively commit themselves to a gradual reduction of military expenditures, thus freeing vast financial resources which will be devoted to the economic development of developing countries.\n161.\tMay I be allowed, on this occasion, to say that we consider the initiative of the Soviet Union concerning the conclusion of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests to be an idea that deserves very close attention. In our view, the achievement of that goal, to which humanity has been aspiring for so many years, could become an important stage on the road to complete and general disarmament under effective control. It is in that spirit that we welcome with interest the initiative of the Soviet Union.\n162.\tThe very special conditions of the world in which we live require that closer collaboration, based on a new conception of the rights and duties in the area of international economic relations, be established today between the industrial and the developing countries. The developments of recent years have made even clearer the interdependence of our nations in the political field as well as in that of economic relations. The principles which ought to govern a new order in international economic relations should be clearly defined so as to ensure rapid economic development in the poor countries, followed by a gradual reduction of the alarming gap which separates them from the industrial countries. The solution of that' problem, in the view of the Turkish Government, is a political necessity as much as a moral duty.\n163.\tTurkey, a developing country, has joined in every initiative taken in that direction over the past few years.\n164.\tAt the seventh special session, I had occasion to explain the views of my country with regard to the present state and future prospects of international economic relations. A new spirit emerged at the special session in favor of dealing with this crucial problem from a new angle, within the framework of the United Nations and with the active participation of all countries. The desired goal is to establish a sound and just economic order, to narrow the economic gap between the developed and developing countries and to increase the well-being of peoples. I should like to take this opportunity to emphasize that Turkey shares the views of the developing countries on this problem and considers that the decisions of the special session are an important step towards achieving international co-operation at a high level. We hope that the same spirit of conciliation and mutual understanding will prevail when these resolutions are implemented.\n165.\tI should like to state once again that we shall persevere in our efforts so that rich and poor nations may agree, in their common interest, on the general guidelines of a constructive solution on a world scale.\n166.\tThe proclamation of 1975 as International Women's Year is, without doubt, an important event in the context of the efforts made by our Organization to deal with the problems of our day. It is indeed true that we are as yet unable to state that women, in spite of the economic and social measures taken to date, enjoy the same rights and opportunities as men. Turkey earnestly believes that measures should urgently be taken and applied in order to secure a rapid improvement in the rights of women throughout the world. We believe that the World Conference of the International Women's Year, held at Mexico City from 19 June to 2 July, is a real step forward in that direction.\n167.\tBecause of its importance I should also like to say a few words about the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which held its third session at Geneva in the spring of this year. Continuing the work commenced in Caracas, the negotiations of the Geneva Conference gave rise to a very thorough debate and our countries expressed a number of views on the many and complex questions which the next session of the Conference will have to settle. It would be useful in that connexion to single out some outstanding principles which should illuminate our debates in the next phase, if we want to achieve valid solutions, and if we want the new law of the sea to be based on solid foundations. We must take into account the fact that the geography of our globe was not drawn with a T-square on a regular and geometrical plane, and that in the various regions of our globe it takes the most baffling shapes. Those differences are intertwined with the diversities of the geopolitical environment and historical traditions. The problem which arises is mainly, therefore, to define the concepts which will make it possible to adapt and to adjust the important concepts of the new law of the sea which we are now creating to the diversity of geographical factors. A theoretical, geometrical approach to the complex problems entailed by this diversity would not be realistic, and would avoid the problem. Rather than solve the new problems of the law of the sea, such an attitude would give rise to new disputes and new problems.\n168.\tImportant political events have taken place in South-East Asia during the course of this year. My Government welcomed with satisfaction the termination of the Indo-Chinese conflict which inflicted so much suffering on the peoples of that region. We express the hope and the conviction that in a new political environment all of the States of the SouthEast Asian continent, which have common problems of economic development, will establish and consolidate relations of active co-operation in that important region, aimed at maintaining the peace and stability needed for the progress of their peoples.\n169.\tAt the twenty-ninth session of the Assembly we welcomed with emotion the historic decision taken by Portugal to grant independence to its colonies. That decision made it possible for us to achieve an important stage in the struggle for the emancipation of peoples under foreign domination, which has been waged over the past 30 years. If the accession to independence has not yet taken place in every case as we would have wished, this is due, we believe, to the difficulties and to the problems which unavoidably arise in the gestation period of new States.\n170.\tThe liberation of the former Portuguese colonies renders even more precarious, more untenable and more paradoxical the colonialist and racist policy of\n\\\"the leaders of South Africa and Rhodesia. Representing a country which is opposed to all forms of racist and colonialist domination and which continues strongly .to support the liberation movements which struggle for the independence of their countries, I should like to declare that my Government feels it will not be possible to delay further, by half-measures, the historic march of peoples towards their freedom from colonialist domination, and that final solutions are imperative.\n171.\tThe Turkish Government is following with close attention the developments in the Middle East crisis. Our attitude regarding the Middle East conflict remains unchanged; it is based on the unshakable conviction that the acquisition of territories by force cannot be accepted or tolerated. The national rights of the Palestinian people must be recognized.\n172.\tMy country was among those which at the last session of the General Assembly pressed for, and saw recognized, the right of the representatives of the Palestinian people to make their voices heard in this Assembly. We consider that a final solution of the Middle East conflict should be based on the withdrawal of foreign troops from Arab territories occupied by force, and recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to found a national State. My Government welcomes with satisfaction any progress achieved towards that final goal.\n173.\tI should like to refer briefly to the question of Cyprus. That question was the subject of an item for debate last year in the General Assembly, which adopted resolution 3212 (XXIX) recommending that the Turkish and Greek communities on the island should continue negotiations with a view to reaching a solution. Later, the Secretary-General was to undertake a new mission of good offices. Within the framework of that procedure, representatives of both communities met on four occasions, and although so far they have not reached an agreement on all the elements of a solution, they have been able, none the less, to reach some agreement on some fundamental aspects of the problem, and at the same time to settle some humanitarian questions affecting both communities. In that context I should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts to bring closer together the positions of the two parties, and the wisdom, patience and diligence with which he has fulfilled his difficult and delicate mission.\n174.\tMany speakers who preceded me have emphasized the need to continue the inter-communal discussions. I fully share their views and am convinced that the procedure at present being followed is the only one that can lead to a settlement of the conflict.\n175.\tOn the substance of the problem, the Turkish Government considers that any solution should be based on the following principles and considerations.\n176.\tFirst, the two communities are now negotiating on an equal footing on the basis of resolutions of the United Nations. Any attempt to damage that equality, any maneuver  aimed at sowing distrust, could only make continuation of the negotiations impossible.\n177.\tSecondly, the last phase of the Cyprus conflict originated in a military coup from the outside, aimed at ending the independence of the island. Any future solution should be based on respect for the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Cyprus. The State of Cyprus should be able to follow a policy of non-alignment, which would best respond to the interests of the two communities and contribute to peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n178.\tThirdly, the constitution of the island should provide for the establishment of a bi-zonal federation, with modalities and arrangements taking into account the economic situation of the island and the structures and needs of the two communities, as well as the need to ensure co-operation based on security and mutual trust.\n179.\tFourthly, the two communities should participate in the federal government on an equal footing. Federal institutions should be given the means necessary to safeguard respect for the constitution and the political and economic equality of both communities.\n180.\tAs soon as a solution which reflects the principles I have just stated has been found, Turkey will withdraw the military forces it was obliged to send to Cyprus in accordance with its contractual obligations to deal with the imminent danger to the independence of the island and the survival of the Turkish community. To the extent that the security of its forces permits, it has already considerably reduced its troops on the island. The Assembly may rest assured that Turkey will be guided, in its policy concerning the Cyprus problem, only by the earnest desire to contribute to a just and well-balanced solution and to the protection of peace in our region, in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter.\n\n"

        "file_text": "66.\t  Mr. President, it gives me pleasure to extend the warmest congratulations, in the name of the delegation of the Libyan Arab Republic, on your election as President of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. It also gives me pleasure in particular to see a representative of a small State take over this important position. This proves the fact that all States, small or large, have the right to play an important role in running the affairs of the international community and that the representatives of the small nations can assume positions of leadership in the world. We are certain that your ability, objectivity and wise leadership will contribute to and guarantee the success of the thirtieth session.\n67.\tI should like also to seize this opportunity to express my deepest appreciation and admiration to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, for the great and rare ability that he demonstrated in conducting the work of the twenty-ninth session and the seventh special session. The role Mr. Bouteflika played came up to our expectations and emphasized Algeria's role in the third world.\n68.\tI should also like to express my appreciation to the Secretary-General for the great efforts he has made in the cause of humanity and peace and in consolidating the role of the United Nations at a time when its burdens are increasing and it must tace tne difficulties and conspiracies of which it is a target. The United Nations has become a target ot threats and manipulations by those States which threaten to cut off their assistance unless it remains an exclusive arena of their influence and an instrument serving\ntheir ambitions. We stand by the Secretary-General in his effort to preserve the independence and effectiveness of this Organization and we hope that the rote will be strengthened on the occasion of its thirtieth anniversary.\n69.\tPerhaps it is a fortunate coincidence that J am making my speech on the anniversary of the war of 6 October 1973, a war where the Arab soldiers in Sinai and the Golan Heights have written everlasting chapters of heroism in the struggle against the Zionist aggressors. While I salute the valiant soldiers stationed on the front, I and all of us long for the day when all the occupied territories will be liberated.\n70.\tToday also marks a glorious Moslem religious occasion, Eid Alfitr, and may I take this opportunity to extend, from this rostrum, congratulations to the Moslem delegations taking part in this session and to the whole Moslem nation all over the world.\n71.\tThe United Nations is now approaching its fourth decade in an atmosphere of mixed anxiety and hope for the future. Despite the continuity of the Organization and its development amid difficulties, obstacles, conspiracies and the fatal crises which have hung over it for 30 years, and despite the Organization's struggle to preserve a minimum of effectiveness and independence, it has not fulfilled all our hopes.\n72.\tColonialism, exploitation and oppression have not disappeared from our earth. Poverty, hunger and illiteracy still prevail for the majority of the human race. The cries of those oppressed, who have been tortured and evicted from their homes, continue to curse the colonialists, the racists, the exploiters, the Fascists and the warmongers. For an example of these unjust conditions we can look at the banners here of the two racist regimes in South Africa and Palestine, both of which demonstrate contempt for the lofty principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Those two regimes will remain a symbol of hatred and animosity passed from one generation to another until our lands are liberated from racism, zionism, apartheid and colonialism.\n73 Much has been said by politicians, leaders, experts and the prophets of our time about the era of the cold war being over and the fact that humanity should now welcome with relief the disappearance of the age of confrontation and the coming of the new age of negotiation and dialog. We, for our part, welcomed this trend and held high hopes of understanding among the major Powers. We claimed those who danced to the peace hymn-m Washington or New York, Paris or Geneva, London or Helsinki.\n74. But is it not the right of the exploited, whose very existence and daily subsistence are threatened to ask whether this understanding is really for the benefit of all, for the protection of all, for the security of all? Or is this a wedding party for the interests of the powerful only, which alone are benefiting from Z flatus quo \\ that is, those who are living comfort and affluence, who only want to remain at the top of the pyramid, who are keeping the great majority at the base for ever?\n75 We ask these questions because experience and history teach us that progress cannot be achieved for humanity as a whole without the attainment of peace and that there is no peace unless justice prevails. The talk about lasting peace and comprehensive progress will remain repetitive speeches without the elimination of exploitation, colonialism, oppression and the great differences in the distribution of wealth.\n76.\tCan we really believe that the forces supporting racism, consolidating minority regimes, conspiring against democracies and spreading corruption and bribery through their intelligence apparatus and corporations want progress, peace and justice in the world? Can we believe the force which supports oppression and arms aggression, and offers the most sophisticated and fatal arms to the Zionist regime to perpetuate its occupation of Palestine and maintain its domination of other Arab territories, spreading havoc and terrorism in the most sensitive areas of the world? A regime that destroys schools and hospitals, burns children, women and the elderly with napalm and turns the tents of refugees and the huts of farmers into ashes how can we believe such a force? How can we believe that force genuinely desires prosperity, freedom and progress for humanity?\n77.\tWe call upon the American people to realize the consequences of the practices of their governing establishment. We sincerely hope that the American people, while celebrating their bicentennial, will stop and consider, so that they may see the ugly reflection of United States policy in the mirror of history.\n78.\tWe find it necessary to talk about justice and peace because it is our belief that mankind as a whole faces challenges that threaten us all. It is essential, therefore, that we stand together in solidarity and seek understanding and accurate scientific planning so as to avoid a disaster and salvage humanity from destruction by such things as pollution, the population explosion, shortage of resources and nuclear dangers. The required solidarity should be based on justice and equality, and should be in the interest of all. Otherwise the world of tomorrow will be a savage world controlled by the law of the jungle, where the struggle for survival by homo sapiens will reach the highest degree of savagery and barbarism. The fate of the small in such a world can be very well perceived. We, the small, do not want to be the underdogs in the world of tomorrow. We should like to see and believe that the world of tomorrow whose foundations are at present envisaged will be a world for everyone. It is therefore within our right to say now to the big Powers that it is in our interests and their own that we should not be left with the impression that the struggle between the deprived majority and the rich minority is inevitable. None the less, if the conflict remained we would have nothing to lose but our bondage, poverty, distress and misery.\n79.\tIt gives me great pleasure to refer to a positive aspect of our present session, the admission of some sister nations to the United Nations. In this respect I welcome the membership of the People's Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. Their membership represents a culmination of their struggle for freedom and independence. Their membership is a consolidation of the group of non-aligned and third-world countries in the United Nations. Z extend to them on this occasion the brotherhood, friendship and support of the Libyan people and Government.\n80. Yet, as we welcome the new sister nations and approach the fifteenth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples contained in resolution 1514 (XV)\nwe are distressed that there are still peoples which are not yet able to exercise their right to self-determination. It distresses us also that the white minority regime in South Africa stubbornly maintains its unjust control, that the white minority racist regime in Zimbabwe is still perpetrating injustice against the African majority, that Namibia is still under Fascist and racist occupation, that the Western Sahara is still under the yoke of Spanish colonialism, that part of Somalia is still under French colonialism, and that the Zionist and racist regime continues arrogantly to occupy the Arab territories in Palestine and adjacent areas.\n81.\tWe call upon the United Nations to take effective measures to liquidate colonialism and its traces, for this is a crucial prerequisite for bringing about international peace and justice and to building the better world for tomorrow to which we all aspire.\n82.\tI should also like, on this occasion, to extend my congratulations to the friendly people of Portugal on their progressive revolution and on their victory against fascism, and I congratulate the Portuguese Government for its policies intended to speed the liberation of its colonies, progressing towards solidarity with non-aligned and third-world countries.\n83.\tMy delegation is also happy to see the legitimate Government of Cambodia returning to occupy its seat in the United Nations. Notwithstanding the reactionary setbacks in many areas of the world, we hail the victories achieved by the militant peoples of Indo-China over imperialist aggression after a relentless and bitter struggle.\n84.\tI should also like to point with satisfaction to the easing of the boycott illegally imposed upon the friendly people of Cuba, which marks another defeat of aggressive forces.\n85.\tI must express regret that other peoples have not yet been able to join the international community. We deplore in particular the exercise of the veto by the United States against the admission of the two Viet Nams to the United Nations.\n86.\tThe people and the Government of the Libyan Arab Republic are following with great interest the recent developments in Cyprus and we should like here to reiterate our previously expressed position on the preservation of the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of the island and its non-aligned policy, with the preservation of the legitimate rights of both the Greek and the Turkish communities.\n87.\tThough I have already pointed out that the crucial issues in our world are progress and peace, I wish to stress that these cannot be achieved without the realization of freedom and justice. There is no progress without freedom; there is no peace without justice. Though I have already talked about peace and progress in the world, I should like to emphasize that in our part of the world, which is the cradle of civilization, the realization of peace and progress should be based on the following.\n88.\tFirst, it should be based on the eradication of Zionist, racist and colonialist aggression, the liquidation of the artificial Zionist entity, and the establishment of a democratic, secular state in the territory of Palestine which includes all the original populations, be they Moslems, Christians or Jews. Despite all schemes of the past and present, and all imposed\nsolutions of the present and future, the Jews of the area have no alternative but to accept living as an indivisible part of its people, as citizens with equal rights and duties in our Arab land, as they were in the past.\n89.\tThe Arabs and Jews have coexisted in harmony throughout history, but with the emergence of Zionism as an arrogant racial movement, alien to our area, and as a consequence of certain conditions in Europe, that harmony was destroyed.\n90.\tWe shall not hesitate at any time to tell the followers of Judaism, wherever they are, to come and work towards an equal understanding. But they should give up the misleading teachings of Zionism, so that we shall be able to coexist as we had in the past. We say to them: you have no future but to come to an understanding and accept coexistence. You are being misled and used by Zionism and the forces of imperialism and colonialism. Those who are placing thousands of millions of dollars at your disposal, providing you with the most sophisticated and destructive arms, are actually leading you towards disaster. They are plunging you into an abyss, for the Arab nation will never be defeated or crushed. You will be the losers if you have chosen to go with the logic of Zionism to the end, and the end of Zionism is inevitable.\n91.\tSecondly, the realization of peace and progress must be based on the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Arab nation to self-determination, freedom and unity, together with the right to raise the standards of its peoples, and the recognition of the\nmovement of Arab unity as a legitimate national movement, providing a positive factor in the struggle against backwardness, imperialism and colonialism. Any resistance to this movement, whether from outside or inside, is a sterile attempt to change the logical course of history.\n92.\tThe freedom and unity of our nation are essential to allow it to overcome its problems, to realize social and economic progress, to defend its existence, to increase its contribution to the heritage of mankind, to participate effectively in the reconstruction of a new world, and finally to be able to bring prosperity, progress and security to the world community.\n93.\tThirdly, Arab-African co-operation, solidarity and interdependence must be consolidated. Of the Arab population 80 per cent is in Africa, and 70 per cent of Arab land is on the African continent. We are therefore organically part of Africa, where our cultural, religious and blood relations are ancient and strong. Our common interests in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism reinforce those relations, thereby providing joint action to overcome our backwardness, and thus leading to a realization of the progress and prosperity of our peoples.\n94.\tArab-African solidarity is a basic element in the policy of the Libyan revolution, gaining strength and effectiveness every day. Despite conspiracies and maneuvers, the Arab-African bloc, in its progress towards becoming one of the essential forces in the future, can be proud of its present solidarity and work towards the progress of humanity in Africa and the world.\n95.\tAllow me to deviate a little from my prepared text and to refer to some recent events. The President of Uganda, Idi Amin Dada, the current Chairman of the OAU, spoke from this rostrum recently [2370th meeting], and his statement was an enrichment of the discussions and deliberations of the present session of our Assembly. He expressed in the best possible way the views of the OAU. What we really regret is the response from the American mass media and from responsible American authorities outside this Hall to what he said from this rostrum. There was a reaction we did not expect, a reaction which is in conflict with the principles of diplomatic courtesy and dialog with regard to those States on whose behalf President Amin was speaking when addressing this Assembly. On this occasion, on behalf of my delegation, I should like to raise certain points.\n96.\tFirst of all, there was the response directed at the Chairman of the African group in a statement made by the representative of the United States, Mr. Moynihan, at a labor meeting in San Francisco in which he denounced the Chairman in every way and denounced the continent from which he comes and which he represents. What occurred confirms the deep relationship between the American governing establishment and Zionism, and particularly the sensitivity of the American authorities as regards anything that might affect the Zionist racist entity from near or far; and shows that the defense of that Zionist entity is put before the defense of the American people itself.\n97.\tWe saw, when the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Kissinger, spoke of withdrawing financial assistance from the United Nations when we first spoke of the expulsion of the Zionist entity from this Organization, that the American press and Congressmen competed to support the Zionist entity and on many occasions not through conviction but through fear of Zionist influence on American political life. If 1 may be permitted, we should like to recall for the record what was printed in The New York Times on 8 August 1975. These are extracts from what was said by some of the Congressmen:\n\\\"Another Democratic Senator said he would talk about the Israel lobby, but only on background, 'because they can deliver votes and they control a\nlot of campaign contributions that's why I can't go on the record, or I'd be dead.\n\\\" It is the strongest lobby, the went on, adding: 'It doesn't dilute its strength by lobbying on other issues. A lot of members resent it, but they don t feel they can do anything about it. That lobby wants to do Congress's thinking on Israel. They don not want any independent judgments.'\n\\\"Last spring the Israel lobby rounded up those 76 Senators to sign the petition backing Israel, another member of Congress recalled,  adding a lot of guys said they were afraid not to sign it, even though they didn't want to. Some of them told me it was the last time they would sign such a petition. But if another one comes I'll bet they H be jus as scared of the lobby and sign up again. But aon i quote me by name.' \\\"* That is what The New York Times said and those were Congressmen who were speaking. The statements\nmade by Mr. Moynihan and Mr, Kissinger have confirmed this, and we wish to confirm it here today.\n98.\tSecondly, we are rather surprised that the representatives of the United States should talk about democracy in the world a country which, through its companies, corporations and agents has overcome and annihilated dozens of democracies throughout the world.\n99.\tWhat does Mr. Moynihan want? That we should give here the list of the martyr democracies which have been victims of American intervention? Should we mention here the thousands of victims, the thousands of democrats and progressives throughout the world who, through the United States and its machinery, have been suppressed and made victims? What can we say regarding the balance-sheet of this State, the balance-sheet of the last 30 years, the last 20 years, the last 10 years or the last 5 years? The list is very long and we do not wish to waste the time of the United Nations. But when Africans, people of the third world, are blamed and it is said we are working against democracy, we can only hope that those who live in glass houses will not throw stones.\n100.\tAs the last example, I should like to remind the United States delegation that a few days ago the United States Administration welcomed Giorgio Almirante, the head of the Italian Fascist Party, which had only 7 or 8 per cent of the votes in Italy, at a time when the United States is not giving visas to many representatives of various democracies and political groups which enjoy great support from their people in Europe itself. I should like just to remind you of that without taking up a lot of the time of this meeting.\n101.\tThirdly, some time ago some of the responsible American authorities said that they were going to use strong language vis-a-vis the third world, on the principle that this was the only language we could understand. Then the attack started in the mass media, by\n. the responsible United States authorities and at various levels all this since Kissinger's threat that he would leave the United Nations \\\"an empty shell\\\". The American mass media has explained some of the positions taken by developing States in the United Nations concerning the question of Puerto Rico in the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples or the Palestinian question as a result of the firm stand of and the language used by the United States as regards the third world.\n102.\tHere I must say that it is dangerous to believe that the ruling establishment in the United States, together with its partner, the Zionist regime, will bring about the desired results and that the third world will return to a condition of obedience and allegiance if it is tackled with firmness.\n103.\tIt would be wrong to let the United States impose its will on the world or to think that the policy of detente and the misunderstandings and disputes in the socialist bloc and third world will help it to retain its dominant position. We must be very cautious and not remain silent in the face of this new aggressive language.\n104.\tFourthly, it is indeed very unfortunate and regrettable that those who support this policy are the intellectual elite of American universities. And here I include Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Moynihan. We are fully convinced that the people of the United States will know the truth one day and will understand the very nature of Zionism and its conspiracies. If the intellectual elite to which I am referring were to talk about the problems of the third world and the Zionist occupation objectively and sincerely, and if it were to enable the American people to understand and see both sides of the various questions and issues involved, we believe that the American giant would rid itself of this evil spirit, and we hope that this will happen very soon.\n105.\tHere I must say to my brethren in the third world in the Arab homeland, in Africa, in Latin America and elsewhere that, if they are expecting prosperity and welfare from Washington, they will have to wait a very long time.\n106.\tThe delegation of the Libyan Arab Republic has already, in the General Assembly and elsewhere, raised a matter of great significance, namely the presence of mines planted in our country by the warring Powers during the Second World War. Those mines were left there after the war, causing death and physical disability to a great portion of the population. Those mines remain buried and undetonated in a vast area of our land 30 years after the end of the war. They have also caused great damage to farms, land and livestock; they have impeded economic development by raising the cost of projects such as road and port construction and oil exploration.\n107.\tIt is therefore pertinent here to note that the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries recently held at Lima expressed its concern on this issue. It condemned hostile actions and military aggressions in third-world countries; it condemned colonial Powers for neglecting to remove objects remaining from the war, such as mines and explosives; it deplored the failure of the colonial and warring Powers to remove those objects or to make available information as to their location; it requested those States to remove the remaining objects of war and to bear responsibility for their removal and the damages resulting therefrom. [A/10217 and Corr.l, annex I, resolution IV.\\\n108.\tThe Libyan Arab Republic formally requests consideration of this matter at the United Nations in order to determine the liability of the States which planted those mines in our country for the purposes of a war to which we were not even a party. In particular, the United Nations should request that the remaining mines be removed; that we be given assistance in the removal of the mines and that we be provided with all the necessary facilities; that we be provided with complete maps indicating the locations of those mines; that our people be compensated for all material and moral damage incurred.\n109.\tThe Libyan Arab Republic will submit a draft resolution concerning this issue during the consideration of the item relating to the United Nations Environment Program in the Second Committee.\n110.\tNot only does the planting of these mines and their continued existence constitute a war crime; it\nalso contributes greatly to the pollution of our environment. I wish also to expose other types of corruption as significant as that already mentioned, practices aimed at the degradation of our ethics and morale. I am referring to the practices of certain developed States aimed at interfering in the internal affairs of other States through their corporations and intelligence machinery and their repeated efforts at moral corruption, through bribery, persuasion and blackmail, in order to reap economic and political benefits.\n111.\tThese issues have been raised in the news media of certain capitalistic States as part of a campaign to slander the developing countries and to cast doubt on their ability to bear their international responsibility in order to prevent those countries from controlling their own natural resources. In the light of these circumstances it is the position of my delegation that we should face the challenges and expose the conspiracy, rejecting those immoral practices aimed at the undermining of our ethics and at impeding our development and progress.\n112.\tThe world is fully aware of the extent of the crimes committed by certain countries though their agencies and corporations. Those crimes include the staging of coups d'etat and the crushing of democratic systems. They also include assassinations, bribery and blackmail. The records of the United States Congressional Committees provide documented evidence condemning those corporations which have admitted their role in financing coups d'etat, the assassinations of leaders of certain countries and their financing of reactionary elements collaborating with imperialism.\n113.\tThe situation requires deterrent measures on an international level. The General Assembly should request the Secretary-General at this session to prepare a report on this matter and to submit it to the Assembly at its next session.\n114.\tWhile I am speaking of the practices of certain States and their corporations, it is appropriate to refer to the offensive campaign against third-world countries and their role within the international Organization. This campaign has aimed at spreading doubt about the effectiveness of the United Nations and at branding the conduct of third-world countries in the General Assembly as irresponsible. Such campaigns have been followed by threats to cut off assistance to the United Nations and its organs, thus converting it into an empty shell with no value. The Libyan Arab Republic will submit a draft resolution on transnational corporations which I have been instructed to read to the Assembly and which my delegation will be submitting to the competent authorities and to the Committee in which the matter will be taken up. The following is the text of the draft resolution on transnational corporations and the illegal and immoral acts practiced by some of those corporations.\n115.\tThe Libyan Arab Republic supports the revision of the Charter to take account of the radical changes that have taken place in the world over the last 30 years. The present Charter and the structure of the United Nations system have become inadequate in view of the great and far-reaching developments in the world. Any\nrestructuring of the international community should, in our view, seek to achieve the following goals: first, to uphold the principle of democracy on an international scale and to affirm the principle of equality among States; secondly, to abolish the privileges enjoyed by the big Powers, particularly the veto and permanent membership of the Security Council, bearing in mind that this privilege has been repeatedly misused by certain States; thirdly, to guarantee a fair distribution of resources and to prevent economic exploitation and international monopolies; and fourthly, to introduce more effective controls over disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear tests and the destruction of all supplies of destructive weapons, as measures leading to international peace and security.\n116.\tFinally, I would like to express our mounting concern over the attacks to which human rights have been subjected in the world. Despite the great material achievements in recent generations, which have enabled man to reach the bottom of the seas and the planets, humanity is still facing oppression and racial discrimination based on color, race or religion. Certain groups of people in many parts of the world are still subjected to injustice and tyranny. Oppression and physical and psychological torture are still practiced against prisoners of war and prisoners in general. Protection of human rights should be the cornerstone in rebuilding the international structure, an objective which we all should endeavor to realize.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": " Mr. President, may my first words express the satisfaction with which the delegation of Brazil received the news of your election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. Luxembourg has a long history of peaceful coexistence and international co-operation which, along with your personal qualities, augurs well for a particularly productive session.\n38.\tIt is also a pleasure for me to voice the recognition of the delegation of Brazil for the dedication and efficiency with which the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, the eminent Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, guided the work of the twenty-ninth session and the seventh special session just concluded.\n39.\tThe tradition that the delegation of Brazil opens the general debate offers me the very particular satisfaction of being able to extend the first welcome to the delegations of three new Members of this Organization. These are Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and Mozambique. Brazil is especially linked to these nations by the ties of a past that is common in many respects and that we now wish to see projected towards a future of co-operation and understanding. I am certain that the presence of the three Members in this Organization will .be reflected in benefits for the international community.\n40.\tIn greeting the new Portuguese-speaking nations that have joined the Organization, I wish to express the fraternal understanding with which Brazil follows the unfolding process of decolonization in Angola. Brazil feels linked to the future new African State by ties of history and blood that underscore the community of interests resulting from a spirit of brotherliness forged over the Atlantic. We extend our wish that those who so vigorously promoted the liberation of Angola may overcome the difficulties of the present moment in order to give the new nation the political stability that will definitively ensure its territorial integrity and its independence, free from foreign interference of any kind.\n41.\tOur Organization is about to conclude the third decade of its existence. For individuals, as well as for institutions, 30 years of life has a more than merely chronological significance, in the sense that that space of time usually covers fundamental changes in social life and coincides with the very rhythm by which generations succeed one another and history is renewed. The United Nations is undergoing a dynamic and critical revision which could, we all hope, renew it and prepare it for the difficult tasks of the coming years. That impulse for renewal is not generated spontaneously. It springs from all of us who compose the Organization and who are, in fact, its essence.\n42.\tThat is a fact frequently overlooked in evaluating the performance of the Organization during these 30 years. Thus it is that the frustrations felt by the international community are systematically attributed to the United Nations as an Organization, when, in the majority of cases, they result from the very limitations inherent in the current international order. Our Organization, however flexible its constitutional structure may be, does not operate within a closed system but in an ambiance of constant interaction with the international macro-structure.\n43.\tThus, the skepticism which for some time has surrounded the activity of the United Nations often constitutes a kind of shifting of blame by which States attempt to absolve themselves from responsibility for the failures that, in the final analysis, rest primarily upon them. As far as Brazil is concerned, we prefer to avoid straying into a state of general pessimism, in the same way that we frankly avoid the illusions of an equally unrealistic international optimism. Above all, we lean towards a sober vision of the limitations and the possibilities of the United Nations, a vision that would lead us to achieving the objectives of its Charter with a maximum of efficiency.\n44.\tWe do not deny reality and we recognize that the United Nations has been unable to achieve the lofty objectives entrusted to it in such fundamental areas as the maintenance of international peace and security and the creation of a more equitable international economic order.\n45.\tIt was customary initially to attribute the limitations of the United Nations in respect of maintaining peace and security to the trauma of the cold war, which paralyzed the will of the Organization in those frequent cases in which a conflict of interests occurred between the super-Powers. Currently, the tendency is to blame detente, a policy which would dispense with the intervention of the United Nations and permit a direct and bilateral understanding between the two principal centers of world power. In any event, both trends reflect the same reluctance, rooted in centuries of power politics, to accept the workings of a system such as that of the United Nations, which aims at the adoption of horizontal guidelines based on the principle of the sovereign equality of States, in favor of a vertical system funded upon subordination. The so-called crisis of the United Nations, as far as the implementation of its loftiest objective is concerned, is based on that fact. It does not originate, either in part or even primarily, in the structural faults of the Organization, but rather in the decision, inspired by considerations of power, not to resort to such means as it places within the reach of States.\n46.\tThe long history of disarmament negotiations is a striking example of what I have just said. Article 11, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations expressly mentions \\\"the principles governing disarmament and the regulation of armaments as constituting the special responsibility of the General Assembly and of the Security Council, as does Article 26. Nevertheless, for some years now disarmament negotiations have been experiencing a growing bilateralization that limits all initiatives in the matter to the two super-Powers, as if the security of those Powers exists above or at the margin of the international community, or as if the developing nations did not have their own security interests, which are qualitatively different from the security interests of the great Powers or even of the developed nations.\n47.\tThe examples that may be extracted from an analysis of the conduct of the United Nations in the economic area are no less eloquent. In that sphere, we must recognize that the Charter was less precise in formulating the objectives and principles for international co-operation. But those were different times. During the past 30 years great progress has been made in the universal awareness of the real significance of economic co-operation. The United Nations rendered significant service in this respect, having served as the principal forum for the dialog between the major groups, the developed and the developing nations. Notwithstanding the multiplication of specific forums for dealing with economic matters within the Organization, there has always existed, particularly on the part of the Governments of the more developed nations, an unshakable objection to considering as guidelines recommendations designed to orient international co-operation in a way that would foster the balanced development of the community of nations.\n48.\tSuch thoughts do not relieve us of the responsibility to rethink these mechanisms and reorder the activities of the Organization. On the contrary, they should stimulate our efforts in that regard.\n49.\tBrazil has given all its support to the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter of the United Nations. But we understand that the updating of the United Nations must include, along with a revision of the Charter, the adoption of measures that might be put into force independently of amendments to the basic document of the Organization. In fact, this concerns two means leading to the same end, both of which must be undertaken.\n50.\tThe revision of the Charter, as is natural in constitutional reforms, gives rise to unfounded enthusiasms and unjustified fears. We should moderate the former and dissipate the latter through an objective effort to identify those Articles that really should be amended. Above all, we should avoid overambitious plans for an ideal revision, which the Charter does not need, in favor of a pragmatic reform that transforms it in the light of what the experience of 30 years has taught us. We should bring together the results of different efforts dispersed among various organs, such as the Ad Hoc Committee on the Charter, the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations and the Group of Experts on the Structure of the United Nations System. Finally, we should not overlook the possibility of reforms that do not require a revision of the Charter. If these premises are observed, I believe that a revision is politically feasible, as is evident from the progress already achieved with the approval of amendments to Articles 23,27 and 61 of the Charter, which came into force in 1965.\n51.\tDuring the seventh special session [2327th meeting], I had the opportunity to express the position of Brazil concerning the present state and future perspectives of international economic relations. Whereas a reasonably efficient structure of guidelines prevails in economic relations among industrialized nations, a virtual laissez-faire prevails in the relations between developed and developing nations. The main reason for this lack of symmetry was the fact that, until recently, recessions originated at the center of the world economic system, that is, in the industrialized nations, and propagated themselves in the direction of the periphery, that is, towards the developing nations.\n52.\tFrom this perspective, it was determined that the crises could be overcome by anti-cyclical regulations in the national sphere in the more developed nations, complemented by trade and monetary accords among them. Similarly, according to this reasoning, an objective solidarity of interests existed between the center and the periphery. The latter, being the first to feel the repercussions of a crisis, would benefit from a renewed expansion of interchange among the industrialized nations.\n53.\tThe current crisis in the world economic system differs considerably from that model. This time, the periphery, instead of passively suffering the effects of the crisis, has also engendered pressures of a recessionary nature. The destabilizing potential of the current international division of labor and the risks inherent in the current structure of North-South economic relations were cruelly felt. Today it is no longer possible not to recognize the need to extend to the relations between industrialized and developing nations the structure of guidelines until now limited to the industrialized sector of the world.\n54.\tIt was in the light of these observations that the delegation of Brazil proposed, during the seventh special session, the negotiation of a general agreement on trade between developed and developing nations, in order to provide a politico-juridical matrix for specific negotiations. Such a general accord would not be a substitute for general agreements in force, nor would it attempt to replace existing forums and mechanisms. But it certainly would be an attempt to bridge the gaps left by these and correct the distortions resulting form a vision centered on the developed nations.\n55.\tOn that occasion we stated that we believed the time had come to proceed from declarations of principles and maximalist claims to a negotiation of specific guidelines to govern the economic relations between developed and developing nations.\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjold Library\n56.\tWe do not ignore the important role that resolutions adopted in the General Assembly and other forums of the United Nations have played and continue to play in the formation of a universal awareness of the problem of development. In this respect, what is declaratory or re-vindicatory is not irrelevant. We find, then, that many of the ideas presented so far have already matured, especially in the heat of debates and antagonisms. We believe that the time has come to undertake negotiating efforts that will lead to concrete and comprehensive results. We wish to build on what has already been achieved by the alert warnings of the past. We believe that it is time to proceed beyond warnings and appeals, just as we believe that is is too late for palliative or miniaturized solutions.\n57.\tA general agreement of the type we propose would be the antithesis of all that. It would be structured for the purpose of operational efficiency and would attack the problems of international trade in a direct manner and at the very core. For the developing nations, it is a matter of recognizing their right of access to the markets of developed nations for their export products not only their raw materials, but also, and in a growing manner, for their manufactured goods. It is also a matter of recognizing their right of access to the markets of assets which are indispensable to the development process, be they material or cultural. For the developed nations, it is a matter of recognizing, reciprocally, their right to guarantees of supplies of raw materials under equitable conditions of price and as a counterpart to concessions offered to the developing nations.\n58.\tThe negotiation of such a general agreement should not interrupt the understandings arrived at within the scope of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which so far have attended primarily to the needs of the industrialized nations. On the other hand, it would not prejudge the negotiation of specific mechanisms aimed at preserving the purchasing power of the export earnings of nations producing specific raw materials. All these efforts would be complementary if certain general guidelines were accepted by the parties as being capable of governing international co-operation.\n59.\tThe admittedly brief period available to the seventh special session to carry out its mandate did not permit an in-depth examination of the proposal then made by Brazil. Nevertheless, I am certain that it will be possible to reflect on its terms during the session that is now beginning. The fact is that we have today, for the first time in the history of international economic negotiations, a real opportunity to begin the task of constructing a new world economic order. For the first time the developed nations and the developing nations are in a position to achieve concrete results, since the negotiating conditions are less unequal than before.\n60.\tWe have before us a long general debate and a complex agenda that will demand our best efforts during the coming three months. At the end of that period, we shall have made progress on several questions, advanced slowly on others and perhaps achieved nothing on some. The decision-making process in multilateral diplomacy is slow by its very nature and constantly challenges the subtlety and patience of those who practice it. Nevertheless, there is no more effective alternative for the consideration of the problems that are constantly increasing today and that are of interest to a large number of States.\n61.\tWe must not succumb to the quantitative temptation of measuring the achievements of the United Nations by using the arithmetic applied to decisions implemented, problems resolved and objectives achieved. Its influence is more subtle and diffused. The Organization should also be assessed on the basis of the trends it impresses upon, and the directions it sets for, the international community. Also, it acts principally through ideas, which historically have constituted a more efficient agent of political change than other forces, such as power, to which homage is so frequently paid.\n\n"

        "file_text": " Mr. President, it is a great pleasure for me to express on behalf of the Dominican Government and delegation, and on my own behalf, our most heartfelt approval of the wise choice made by the General Assembly in selecting you for the post of President of the thirtieth regular session, a choice which guarantees the success of our deliberations here.\n23.\tAt the same time, I wish to express our gratitude to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, for his brilliant and effective performance in guiding the twenty-ninth regular session and the seventh special session.\n24.\tWith great satisfaction, I would also like to extend a warm welcome to the delegations of the Republics of Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and Mozambique on their admission to membership in this Organization.\n25.\tI would like to begin by recalling the words I used, speaking on behalf of all participating delegations, at the final meeting of the Conference of Plenipotentiaries for the Revision of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, held at San Jose, Costa Rica, last July, when I said: \\\"Peace is the foundation of international order and the most effective instrument for human progress\\\".\n26 The question of peace is, indeed, central! to the life and development of our peoples, and the maintenance and strengthening of peace is the basis and very purpose of international society.\n27.\tWe are convinced that, in order to maintain peace, the most urgent problem the contemporary world must solve is that of providing access to modern civilization for those countries which have thus far remained on its periphery, thereby eliminating the inequalities between the peoples of developed and of under-developed countries.\n28.\tIt is therefore becoming increasingly necessary and urgent for both powerful and weak countries alike to collaborate in the establishment of a new international economic order that will provide the framework for more just and equitable international co-operation and coexistence. As long as just international economic relations are not guaranteed, it will be impossible to guarantee peace.\n29.\tThe philosophy which should govern the policies of all our peoples is that we must not divide the earth, but rather share it.\n30.\tOf course, this is a difficult and demanding task. Nevertheless, we continue to take the optimistic view that, of necessity, the day must come and indeed there are already signs that it has come when the developed countries will accept with goodwill and political willingness the legitimate and urgent aspirations of the small countries.\n31.\tThis necessary collaboration among peoples was eloquently expressed by His Holiness Pope Paul VI in his famous encyclical Poptilortun Progressio, in which he clearly stated that the duty of brotherhood, which takes the form of a duty of solidarity, social justice and universal charity, is the concern especially of the better-off nations, and that on it depends the future of the civilization of the world.\n32.\tBeset by this vital dilemma, what can a small country like the Dominican Republic do to promote peace, and what has it done thus far? First and foremost, the Dominican Republic will continue to conduct its international relations on the basis of its unqualified adherence to the fundamental principles of international law and the agreements which it has signed. It is convinced that only through respect for law and compliance with basic principles, such as non-intervention, the legal equality of States, the inviolability of international treaties and the self-determination of peoples, can peaceful coexistence among States be achieved.\n33.\tLikewise, the Dominican Republic will pursue its efforts for the establishment and development of regional peace-keeping machinery, within the United Nations framework and representing the common interests and goals of its Members.\n34.\tIt is the unswerving position of my country, therefore, to defend and strengthen the inter-American system and its institutional expression, the Organization of American States, in order to provide it with the structure necessary to meet the requirements and realities of our era and to transform it into an effective instrument for finding solutions to the urgent problems of our region.\n35.\tWe gave further proof of the firmness of our position recently, this past July, at the Conference of Plenipotentiaries for the Revision of the Inter- American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance at San Jose, Costa Rica, which adopted a protocol containing revisions to that Treaty, which is the chief agreement guaranteeing the collective peace and security of our continent.\n36.\tLikewise, as a contribution to the strengthening of our regional system and out of a concern for greater harmony among the American States, our country also supported the resolution, adopted by the Sixteenth Meeting of Consultation of American Ministers for Foreign Affairs, which allows each State to conduct its relations with the Republic of Cuba in whatever manner it deems fit in the light of its national interests.\n37.\tWith the same commitment, the Dominican Republic will continue to act with its traditional respect and support for the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, thus promoting at the same time its two basic goals of peace and development through international co-operation.\n38.\tIn accordance with this criterion, the Government of the Dominican Republic has always supported the decisions of this Organization which has almost attained universality in every instance where its intervention was necessary to maintain peace and in every program and activity undertaken for the advancement of our peoples.\n39.\tWe have given our support to the entire United Nations family and its specialized agencies. We hope that political and ideological confrontation and sectarianism will be banished from the latter, for they prevent the specialized agencies from efficiently performing the essential functions for which they were created. There is a suitable forum within the United Nations for every type of problem. The division of labor within the system is effective and adequate and should therefore be respected. If it is not, we will only be contributing to the disruption and weakening of the United Nations.\n40.\tAnother significant contribution to peace made by the Dominican Republic and which it continues to make, is the respectful and amicable manner in which it conducts its relations of friendship and co-operation with other countries from its nearest neighbor to those States situated far from its shores but with whom it is united by special interests.\n41.\tIn these relations a special place is occupied by the countries of Latin America and the United States of America, with which the Dominican Republic has long-standing geographical, historical, cultural, economic and political ties. Such ties unite us in the present, have united us in the past, and give us a common destiny in the future.\n42.\tWe therefore urge the resumption of the discussions which were to be held between the Foreign Ministers of Latin America and the Secretary of State of the United States at Buenos Aires several months ago as part of the so-called \\\"new dialog\\\". Such discussions are one way of strengthening and giving new direction to relations between Latin America and the United States.\n43.\tHowever, the best way for the Dominican Republic to promote peace is to join the countries of the third world in the demands they make of the developed countries and in their pursuit of the just international economic order of which I spoke earlier.\n44.\tWe do not seek to provoke a useless confrontation between weak and powerful countries with these demands, nor are we begging for international charity. What we are seeking is a world in which men everywhere can lead their lives with human dignity.\n45.\tOur unity with other third-world countries with respect to these demands is based on the idea of justice. If we can achieve justice, we will have achieved peace.\n46.\tMy country, which is making enormous efforts to improve its lot, is aware that we ourselves have the major responsibility for our own development. However, we believe that the social and economic progress of peoples is the responsibility of the entire international community.\n47.\tWe believe that every country has the right and the duty to strive for its own development; but doubtless such efforts can bear fruit only if there is concerted and effective international co-operation.\n48.\tWe already have a Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] to which we have given our complete support.\n49.\tWe already have a program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-VJ)].\n50.\tAnd we now have the results of the seventh special session of the General Assembly, which came to a close just a few days ago. We have co-operated in all these praiseworthy and necessary efforts but we shall not be satisfied until the Dominican farmer  to whom my Government is devoting all its attention and resources can exercise his right to the land and his right to enjoy the fruits of his labor. We will not be satisfied, therefore, as long as he does not receive a fair price for his products in the markets of the developed countries and as long as he must pay high prices for fertilizers, tractors and ploughs manufactured, undoubtedly, by fellow workers in more prosperous countries who quite likely set their tables with food grown on the land of our peoples.\n51.\tThat is one aspect of the interdependence of which we speak so often today, but it is not the kind of interdependence we seek. We want interdependence with justice, for without justice interdependence is dangerous and explosive.\n52.\tThat is why the well-conceived programs of social and agrarian reform of our country have received the vigorous, militant and unswerving support of our armed forces. They are aware that only a profound process of social improvement can ensure that peace which is essential to development.\n53.\tWe in the Dominican Republic certainly do not aspire to imitate the pattern of consumption or the standard of living of other countries. But, we will struggle so that our people live on an increasing scale of well-being and progress.\n54.\tThe Government of the Dominican Republic believes that only thus, when a human being is the object and beneficiary of peace and development, can a more meaningful contribution be made to the survival and improvement of mankind.\n55.\tFor all these reasons, my Government has been unrelenting in its pursuit of national progress in freedom. Our greatest concern, therefore, is not to come here before the United Nations to make new statements or to reiterate appeals which have been made so many times before. Our major concern is for all of us to return to our countries with a message for our peoples that the Governments represented here are committed to taking the necessary measures to improve constantly the lives of our peoples.\n56.\tPromises, declarations, resolutions and documents are no longer believed in by our peoples. If we do not take decisive action now, if we do not work together immediately, we will usher in only doubt and indifference, rather than progress and peace.\n57.\tWe have carefully studied the agenda of this session and we promise our full co-operation and attention to the consideration of the important questions to be discussed here, particularly the question of the Middle East, where we would like to see a just and lasting peace restored. However, we shall not refer to the questions of disarmament, the uses of outer space or nuclear-free zones, because we come before the United Nations mainly to urge all countries, whether strong or weak, big or small, rich or poor, to join in a crusade to improve the lot of the working man, of the common man living on this planet which belongs to us all and which we must all protect.\n58.\tFor these reasons we would not wish to conclude this statement without mentioning the review and appraisal of the progress achieved through the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], which began five years ago. During that period, the developing countries have had to contend with numerous measures in the economic and financial spheres which have affected adversely their efforts to develop their economies. Our countries have also had to bear the negative effects of the monetary crisis, for which no blame can be laid on the developing world, which has borne all the consequences of imported inflation, the tightening of concessionary aid, the high cost of credit in the money markets and, above all, the economic recession. The recession is precisely one of the obstacles to a greater and more rapid liberalization of international trade in behalf of the third world.\n59.\tOwing to the sudden rise in oil prices, the worsening of the international economic crisis has been felt even more acutely by countries like my own, which relies on imports for the whole of its hydrocarbon requirements. The attempts of the international community thus far to compensate for our greater outlay of currency reserves for oil purchases, either in the form of agreements on raw materials or through an increased flow of concessionary aid, are still inadequate to counteract the negative effects. Our economic prospects, which were only recently damaged by violent fluctuations in the complicated sugar market, remain a constant source of concern.\n60.\tIt is therefore necessary, on this occasion, in this international forum, to emphasize the urgent need for measures, if not on a world-wide level at least in our case, on a regional level, and especially in existing relations between the United States and the countries of Latin America, that would help to maintain fair prices for raw materials and ensure their access to United States markets. We therefore appeal to the spirit of inter-American co-operation for the granting of special regional treatment in the economic and financial relations within our continent. We make this appeal in this world forum because, despite the interdependence of international relations, the regional approach in the political and economic fields should be the rule for coexistence among countries in the same geographical area. This complete identity of aims is underlined by reference to the significant levels of economic activity in Latin America. Estimates show that the population of Latin America in 1974 was 291 million, and its gross national product was $US 174,632 million. In addition, as a result of economic growth, Latin America's exports in 1973 amounted to approximately $US 25,000 million, and its imports to $US 24,000 million. In 1972 Latin America's exports to the United States amounted to $US 5,700 million, and its imports to $US 6,600 million. These statistics reflect the importance to Latin America of its trade with other countries and regions of the world.\n61.\tDuring this period of rapid change, we have seen the United States adopt a system of generalized preferences embodied in the New Foreign Trade Act of 1974. Despite the many favorable provisions that could encourage exports from Latin America to the United States, this law nevertheless contains a number of restrictions and limitations which stand in the way of that goal. It is through the application of such preferences that fairer treatment should be ensured for raw materials from Latin America while awaiting the conclusion of the multilateral agreements which, both within and outside the region, appear to be the logical protection for third-world countries, which are chiefly exporters of raw materials and intermediate goods.\n62.\tThis Latin American situation of instability and sudden reversals in the sphere of inter-American co-operation is in marked contrast with the Lome Convention concluded between the European Economic Community and 46 countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. This provides that most products exported by the latter States shall be admitted into the Community duty-free, without tariff restrictions of any kind, and without requirements of reciprocity. That Convention also establishes facilities for promoting trade and technical and financial co-operation. Even more important, the Convention establishes a fund to compensate in part for the depletion of_cur- rency reserves caused by fluctuating prices of the chief export commodities of the 46 countries, such as ground-nuts, cocoa, coffee, cotton, palm products, skins and hides, wood products, bananas, tea, sisal and iron products. Sugar is dealt with in a separate protocol.\n63.\tWith such an approach, which has outstanding features in terms of international co-operation between highly industrialized and developing countries, despite its imperfections, some of which even have a restrictive effect for other countries in the area, we believe that the possibilities and conditions exist to enable us to conclude similar agreements in our relations with the United States of America, modeled on this one but adapted to suit our own requirements and realities. It has been evident for some time now that we need a regional approach which meets the requirements of stability and security, and which guarantees the development of our Latin American economies. Any step which the United States might take in this direction would certainly contribute significantly to the strengthening of integration among the countries of the Americas. This opens the way for a more fruitful era of coexistence among our peoples on this continent.\n64.\tWe know full well that the question of international economic relations is a matter of general interest to industrialized and developing countries alike. One could venture to say, therefore, that the United States cannot have one policy for Latin America in this sphere, and another for the rest of the world, thus abandoning the global approach it has been following in international economic relations.\n65.\tWe understand that the problem is a global one requiring global solutions and policies. Nevertheless, this problem is particularly critical to the relations of the United States with Latin America. The United States could therefore work out specific arrangements for Latin America, within its over-all policy and not conflicting with it, that would take into account the geographical, historical, political and economic ties which unite our countries.\n66.\tWe feel bound to point out that, in addition to the regional measures we have mentioned, the oil- exporting countries should take other measures at the world level to lower the price of the oil and oil products sold to the developing countries. At the same time interest-free loans with particularly flexible periods of grace and appropriate repayment schedules might be provided from funds placed at the disposal of international financial institutions. The latter facilities might be limited exclusively to making up the difference between current oil prices and those prevailing \u2022at the end of 1973.\n67.\tThus, through co-operation among industrialized nations, wealthy oil-exporting countries and the devel-oping countries themselves, relief could be provided, within a framework of peaceful coexistence, for millions of human beings whom Mr. Robert McNa- mara, President of the World Bank, recently described as the \\\"under-privileged\\\" who have become the\nprincipal victims of the current economic disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "38.\t Mr. President, permit me, at the outset, to express to you the satisfaction of my delegation at seeing you preside over this session of the General Assembly. We are particularly confident that your wide experience and wisdom will immeasurably contribute towards making the thirtieth session of the General Assembly as constructive and rewarding as it is an historical landmark in the life of this Organization.\n39.\tTo your immediate predecessor, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, I need only articulate our profound appreciation for the efficient and skillful manner in which he guided the deliberations of the twenty-ninth and the seventh special sessions.\n40.\tI am also glad to have this opportunity to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-General for his dedication and tireless efforts for the continuous realization of the aims and purposes of the United Nations.\n41.\tOn behalf of the Government of Ethiopia and its delegation, it is also my great pleasure to extend a warm welcome to the States that have been admitted to United Nations membership this year: namely, Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe. By their valiant struggle, the peoples of these nations have once again demonstrated that the tide of freedom and liberty will certainly not ebb until it has engulfed the last remnants of alien rule and oppression in different guises. As we congratulate their representatives for their achievements in widening the areas of freedom and liberty, we look forward to welcoming to this ever-growing family of nations Angola and Papua New Guinea in the course of the present session.\n42.\tMeeting, as we are, at the end of the third decade of the United Nations, it seems to us a worth-while exercise to take stock of the achievements and shortcomings of our Organization. We consider such an exercise useful, for it will help us at once to renew our faith in the continuing viability of the Organization and, learning from past mistakes, to address ourselves to charting a better path towards making it an instrument that is more effective and responsive to the needs of mankind in the last quarter of the twentieth century.\n43.\tChange, change on all fronts, has been the most distinguishing feature of our time. Particularly the last 30 years, the period coinciding with the life of the United Nations, has seen an acceleration of the pace of change. In this process the United Nations has played and will continue to play a role.\n44.\tIn assessing the Organization's performance in the last 30 years, the central question one should ask today is whether it could have played a more effective role than it has in bringing about some of these changes. Looking to the future, the same question could be asked. What effective role can the United Nations play as an agent of change in the last quarter of this century?\n45.\tThe United Nations was created after a period that had seen the consolidation of nation-States in Europe and after two tragic and devastating wars produced by the clash of their interests. After the dismal failure of the League of Nations, the founders of the United Nations thought that, by investing the Security Council with the right to use force on behalf of the international community, they could curb the power of nation-States, thereby hoping to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. By establishing objectives and principles towards which the international community should move, and by providing a framework for international co-operation in the economic and social fields, they also believed they\ncould promote conditions that would provide for a more secure and peaceful world.\n46. The creation of the United Nations was thus predicated on two concepts: first, the belief that\ndeveloped into hostilities in the post-war years. That a global conflagration has been avoided is in no small measure due to the role the United Nations has played '\\\".Providing a forum for tempering disputes or other-through a system of collective security not only would wise Providing avenues of diplomacy which the big aggression be discouraged but, in the event of actual Powers used in order to contain such situations. Even breaches of the peace, the international community ^here local conflicts have suddenly erupted in the\ncould restore peace by punishing the aggressor; secondly, the conviction that man can shape his destiny by making conscious efforts to eliminate the causes of war and by actively promoting conditions which could nurture peace.\n47.\tHow far the United Nations has lived up to these high hopes may be a matter of controversy. What should be remembered, however, is that the United Nations represents one of the first efforts of mankind in organizing the international community by providing for the collective use of force to maintain international peace and security. This concept of collective security has an antecedent in the development of government in our individual societies. Is it not true that Governments in our individual countries are endowed with the capacity to use force on behalf of our respective peoples against those who may disturb peace or infringe the rights of their fellow citizens?\n48.\tThe development of government in our individual countries has, however, taken the better part of human existence on this planet, and its evolution has been a continuing process. For, even today, none of us can say that we have found the exact formula that would provide the answers to all our pressing needs. If that is true for individual societies then, considering the nascent stage of the evolution of a central international authority, we should appreciate the road we will have to travel before we can hope to establish a system that can begin to respond in any significant measure to our collective security requirements, let alone to provide each and every solution that may be called for.\n49.\tJudged against this background, there is no question that, as a collective security arrangement, the United Nations has not lived up to what its founders hoped for. The system, built on big-Power unanimity, has been rendered inoperative precisely because there was no agreement among the big Powers on the major problems of peace and security that confronted the world in the post-war years. The vision of continued co-operation among the big Powers the co-operation born of the exigencies of war was not only short-lived, but was supplanted by constant tensions and undercurrents of hostility, at times reaching the explosion-point.\n50.\tBecause of this general ineffectiveness of the collective security arrangements, the United Nations has not been able to eliminate hostilities in the postwar years. Indeed, localized conflicts which have claimed several hundreds of thousands of lives and caused havoc and untold destruction have occurred all too frequently, and have made thoughtful people wonder whether the United Nations, as an experiment in regulating human conflicts, has not been a conspicuous failure.\n.However, despite the frequent outbreaks of hostilities, in some of which one or two of the big Powers might have been in some guise involved, direct confrontations between the big Powers have not\nMiddle East, the Congo, Cyprus and elsewhere, at times straining the ingenuity and the resources of the United Nations, the Organization has provided a mechanism for insulating such situations from big-Power intervention or evolving acceptable compromises for their containment and eventual solution.\n52.\tIn its role as an active agent of change, and in' harmonizing international co-operation in particular, the United Nations has, on balance, fared better. Especially in the field of social and economic cooperation, the United Nations has been an indispensable instrument for innovation and collective action.\n53.\tThe greatest contribution the United Nations has made in the post-war years, a contribution to which no price tag of any amount can be attached, is the role that it has provided as a forum for the harmonization of the often divergent and sometimes conflicting views and national policies of its Members. Because of such interaction of views, concepts which only recently were anathema to some overnight became conventional wisdom. As a result, we have today a large measure of agreement upon which we can hope to build new structures of co-operation which could meet some of our needs.\n54.\tMuch as we have achieved in building a system of useful international co-operation, it should be clear that we could have done much better if there had been a deeper perception of our interdependence and an awareness of the need for closer and far-reaching co-operation.\n55.\tAs we begin the fourth decade of the United Nations, it should be clear that never before has there been a greater need for co-operative endeavors on all fronts. And as we recognize this need, we should also remain ever more aware of the interdependent nature of the problems affecting all of us, and thereby requiring from all of us parallel and convergent actions.\n56.\tThe United Nations experience of international co-operation has also taught us a profound lesson. That lesson is that, as we have come to recognize the value of international co-operation, we have at the same time developed a greater understanding of the forces that are shaping our future. Because of this knowledge, more than at any other time in the history of our civilization we have developed the capacity to influence and mould our future.\n57.\tIn the remaining quarter of the century, the greatest challenge that awaits the United Nations system of international co-operation is the task of shaping our future in a manner that would best meet the collective needs of mankind. In this undertaking, nothing could be more pressing than the challenge of creating an international economic and social order which would at once further human welfare everywhere and also provide an environment conducive to the promotion of peace,\n58.\tThe task of building a propitious environment for peace would also require that, not only the spiraling arms race be ended, but that the world as a whole should begin the actual reduction of armaments.\n59.\tIn what follows I should like to make some observations on the three priority tasks which require prompt and concerted international action in the remaining years of the century. These are: disarmament, decolonization and the creation of a new international economic order.\n60.\tAs we all know, one of the early items to be included in the agenda was the question of disarmament. Only now it is no longer a single item: it has been multiplied manyfold to cover the many aspects of the problem which have steadily grown in complexity.\n61.\tThe longer the problem of disarmament has remained unresolved, the more intricate it has rendered the task of reaching agreed solutions. Meanwhile, not only are the armaments industries of the major military Powers devouring vital resources which could be diverted to more constructive purposes, but the very survival of mankind remains in serious danger.\n62.\tMoreover, the longer we fail to tackle the disarmament problem seriously, the more difficult becomes the problem of the reduction of arms. At the rate qualitative improvements in armaments are taking place, it is conceivable that we may, sooner rather than later, reach a point where verification of agreements on disarmament measures will have become well-nigh impossible. When we speak thus of the arms race, we have to take into account the constant qualitative changes. So far the agreements on collateral measures of disarmament that have been reached are of the nature of arms control, in some instances limiting the number of some strategic weapons. None of these agreements, however, can really be said to have arrested the feverish race to acquire better and more effective weapons against anything that a potential adversary may have. The search is, in effect, for the ultimate weapon which would provide a foolproof guarantee for one's security. Although that is an illusion, there is no question that this search is the motivating force propelling the arms race today.\n63.\tThe Ethiopian delegation joins all progressive forces in demanding that the qualitative arms race be arrested before we reach a point where, even if the will to disarm might one day be forthcoming, the technical difficulty of verification might pose an insurmountable problem.\n64.\tThe international community, especially the super-Powers, should move from arms control to actual reduction of armaments in significant measures. At this thirtieth anniversary session of the General Assembly, we must therefore make the strongest appeal to the Powers concerned to show significant progress towards halting and reversing the vicious race in which they have engaged. In the wake of political detente and general co-operation, we think it is opportune to take bold steps towards genuine disarmament. And this dire need is best summed up in the words of the Secretary-General, when he said:\n' lI believe that it is vitally necessary, in the interest of the welfare of humanity, and indeed of its survival, that in this thirtieth anniversary year the General Assembly itself should consider a basic review of\nthe role of the United Nations in disarmament.\\\"\nMy delegation fully endorses that remark.\n65.\tAnother important area in which this Organization has outstanding business pertains to colonialism and racism, particularly in southern Africa.\n66.\tViewing the situation in southern Africa, we note with great satisfaction that, with the accession to independence of three former Portuguese colonies, the struggle for liberation is now being waged on the frontiers of the last bastion of oppression. None the less, we find the situation in Angola rather saddening, It is the sincere hope of my delegation that the three liberation movements will set aside their differences and establish a government of national unity which will enable Angola to accede to independence on 11 November 1975.\n67.\tAs regards Zimbabwe, it has now become apparent that the illegal regime of Ian Smith continues to frustrate all efforts aimed at securing a peaceful solution to the problem it has created. One need only observe in this context that, by their persistent refusal to make even the slightest concessions, Mr. Smith and his collaborators have made the negotiations at Victoria Falls not worth the effort. By their intransigence and obduracy they have, in effect, slammed the door on a peaceful solution. It is now up to the international community to take all necessary measures if racial confrontation is to be avoided.\n68.\tThe regime in South Africa also persists in its defiance of all United Nations decisions and continues to pursue its obnoxious racial policies. As a consequence, the United Nations embarked upon a course of sanctions, but so far with no apparent effect upon that bastion of racism. What is becoming increasingly perplexing today is the fact that South Africa has not only rendered all our efforts ineffective, but is successfully implementing its policy of turning the bantustans into buffer zones of cheap labour and an outer perimeter for defense.\n69.\tNor are the sinister activities of the South African regime limited to its own territorial confines. Under the guise of detente and the offer of dialog, South Africa is endeavouring to extend and establish the system of bantustans in the international Territory of Namibia. My Government strongly condemns these sinister designs.\n70.\tWe call upon the international community to intensify its economic, political and military isolation of the racist regime of South Africa until human dignity and justice are restored to the long-suffering peoples in that region.\n71.\tWhen considering the problem of decolonization, the question of the independence of the French Territory of the Affars and Issas, or, as it is often called, Djibouti, occupies the particular attention of my Government. As this is essentially a colonial problem, the Ethiopian Government believes that its solution can be found only by the free expression of the wishes of the people of the Territory without pressure or interference from any quarter.\n72.\tIt is obvious that global peace and security remain the main preoccupation of the United Nations. Our Organization is a visible and living symbol of\nhumanity's dedication to the noble pursuit of the twin objectives of peace and security. It is also obvious that enduring peace in an interdependent world must be constructed on the solid foundation of a just economic and social environment conducive to the development and prosperity of human society as a whole. The commitment of the international community to the creation of such an environment is enshrined in Chapter IX of the Charter of the United Nations.\n73.\tTo this end, serious efforts continue to be made by the United Nations and the specialized agencies. Many lofty pronouncements have often been made in this Chamber in support of this objective. However the economic and social conditions of the majority of people in the developing countries is more desperate today than at any other time in recent history.\n74.\tThe process of economic development is arduous and requires total commitment. Not only are the difficulties enormous, but they are also multidimensional. I shall now mention only a few.\n75.\tNatural calamities such as drought and flood play havoc with the lives of peoples everywhere with increasing frequency and intensity. In the least developed countries, such as Ethiopia, the grave consequences in terms of human suffering, loss of life and economic setbacks are too well-known to require any detailed recital here.\n76.\tIn addition to natural calamities, we are also exposed to an unprecedented combination of unfavorable economic circumstances originating beyond our national boundaries.\n77.\tFalling prices for our exportable raw materials and rapidly increasing prices for the manufactured goods we import reflect the deteriorating situation of our terms of trade and meager balance of payments. The prohibitive cost of agricultural inputs in the last three years has contributed in large measure to the stagnation of our agricultural sector. For lack of alternatives, we are forced to import expensive technology which, in most instances, does not fully meet our needs. While aid from the developed countries is going down quantitatively as a percentage of their gross national product, debt servicing is claiming an increasing share of our foreign currency earnings.\n78.\tThe failure of the Second United Nations Development Decade and the International Development Strategy {resolution 2626 (XXV)] to achieve their objectives is fairly obvious and needs no further elaboration. We believe that developed countries and developing countries with surplus funds could do more to ease the difficulties of the poorer developing countries. The criteria determining such assistance will, we hope, increasingly be non-political and need-oriented in outlook.\n79.\tAt the international level, the division of labor on the basis of comparative advantage is now a universally recognized principle. That the mix of exportable products must change over time as each country's stage of development changes is also true historically. But the existing system of international economic\noping countries tend to continue to produce and export raw materials while manufacturing activity is monopolized by the developed countries. This state of affairs which ascribes a particular mode of production to a given group of States and which does not allow for international mobility, is nothing less than a caste system practiced on a global scale.\n80.\tThe old international economic order which flourished after the last war and is still in existence cannot be expected to do something it was not intended to do. Its main purpose was to service the needs of the industrialized countries. Looking at the prosperity of those nations today, one cannot but admit that the old economic order has performed its task well. But it remains understandably unresponsive to the requirements of socio-economic development of the third world.\n81.\tIt was this recognition which led the developing countries to take the initiative in convening the sixth special session of the General Assembly last year. At that session the General Assembly adopted a Declaration and a Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order to revise fundamentally the economic relationship between the developed and the developing countries.\n82.\tMy delegation notes with satisfaction the results of the seventh special session held last month and the spirit of co-operation and compromise which characterized the negotiations at that session. We are hopeful that the process of accommodation and the momentum gained during the last special session will continue. If carried out in good faith, we have no doubt that the decisions of the seventh special session [resolution 3362 (S-VII)] would have a favorable impact on the development efforts of the developing countries and lay a solid foundation of international goodwill.\n83.\tThe requirements of the new international economic order could only be handled efficiently by a restructured United Nations system. For this reason, the need for the convening of a conference of plenipotentiaries, as was decided by the seventh special session, is both obvious and urgent. My delegation will actively participate in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System.\n84.\tThe encouraging developments in world affairs this year are, in our view, of equal importance towards building a just world order: the continuation of the process of detente in major Power relations; in SouthEast Asia, the termination of the most protracted war in recent history; the preservation of the truce in Cyprus, pending a lasting solution; the signing of an interim agreement on Sinai between the parties directly concerned, and the successful conclusion of the seventh special session of the General Assembly  these are but some of the salient features of the present healthy trend. My delegation welcomes all these developments.\n85. We are encouraged by the process of detente which characterizes relations among the major Powers. The contribution of that process to the reduction of the tension in the world cannot be underestimated. It is imperative, therefore, that it be continued and further pursued in scope and depth.  \n86.\tAs I have said, it is also encouraging to note the termination in South-East Asia of the most protracted war in recent history. As I extend our sincere congratulations to the valiant people of Viet Nam, I must state that, as a matter of principle, my Government subscribes to the universality of our Organization on the basis of the provisions of the Charter. Irrespective of geographic location, the question of membership in the United Nations, in our view, should not be qualified by any other extraneous considerations.\n87.\tAny effort exerted with regard to Cyprus during this session or through the good offices of the Secretary-General should concentrate essentially on the preservation of the national unity and territorial integrity of that island. It must at the same time ensure a harmonious and co-operative life for all sectors of the communities.\n88.\tIn the Middle East, the momentum generated by the recently signed interim agreement between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the State of Israel must be sustained with a view to ensuring the legitimate rights and lasting interests of all the peoples in the region. I only wish to express here my Government's appreciation to all concerned for their statesmanship in achieving the \\\"recent agreement, which we hope will be a signal beginning towards a final settlement of the Middle East problem.\n89.\tThe rapid rate at which contemporary man's level of consciousness is rising vis-a-vis his total environment gives us the hope that we are on the threshold of a new era of a truly interdependent human family. At the same time, the worsening socioeconomic conditions, the deteriorating quality of life and the feeling of helplessness which are the dominant mood in the developing countries give us cause for serious concern. That there can be no harmony between rising consciousness and increasing deprivation is, in our view, a well-established fact.\n90.\tOn the horizon of history we can visualize the age of Aquarius and the Four Horsemen of the Apoc-' alypse standing side by side. The decision or indecision of each nation assembled here will determine what our choices will be. The heritage of man and the fate of future generations depend on the choices we make now. Let us choose wisely and unselfishly.\n\n\n"
