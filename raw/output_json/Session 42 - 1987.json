        "file_text": "\ufeffAt this forty-second session of the General Assembly, it is fortunate that the United Nations has honoured you. Sir, by electing you President. Your election, which comes at a time when the United Nations is reviewing its past, taking stock of its present and pondering its future, is for my delegation and myself a most pleasant opportunity to congratulate you most warmly. We are all the more pleased in that the Assembly has, through you, singled our and honoured the German Democratic Republic, your beautiful and great country, with which Gabon has long maintained the closest links. We are convinced that under your leadership, and thanks to your commitment, lucidity and selflessness, our work will be brought to a happy conclusion. In this respect ray delegation assures you of its full co-operation. We should like to pay a tribute also to Ambassador Choudhury, your predecessor, whose actions throughout the forty-first session of the General Assembly and whose outstanding qualities encouraged the hope and convinced us that there is always in the spirit of man the resources needed to strive for the best : and the most just for all.\nThe excellent report of the Secretary-General is a proof of his determination and courage in tackling the problems with which it deals. We assure him that in all his undertakings and in the comprehensive reforms that he is proposing, we are and shall continue to be at his side, combining our will and our strength with his.\nFinally, I greet the representatives of Member States, with whom we share the efforts and responsibilities of this session so that together we can contribute positively to the strengthening of the principles enshrined m the Charter.\nThe celebration two years ago of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations gave my country an opportunity to express the hope that the Organization would do everything possible to achieve the purposes and principles set out when it was established to meet the hopes that each of its Members placed in it. These include the maintenance of world peace and security and the promotion of international co-operation towards the complementarity of our economies.\nPeace and development are not just two major questions of concern to the world today, but the very heart of the problems facing our Organization. In general, the United Nations has certainly made praiseworthy efforts to instil in the economic relations among States a striving for peace and an ideal of justice, which are the necessary conditions of the establishment of a new international economic order. However, its clear shortcomings must be put on the debit side of its actions. We note in particular that it is far from having completely achieved its goals and from playing its full role, certain big countries showing a lack of goodwill in this respect.\nIn today's world the arms race, acts of aggression and regional conflicts are a constant source of concern for developing countries which are striving to protect their independence, sovereignty and security and working actively to develop their economies and strengthen international co-operation. Nevertheless, the talks that have been going on at the highest level over the last few months between the United States and the Soviet Union with a view to concluding an agreement on nuclear disarmament offer a glimmer of hope. Gabon cannot but encourage such initiatives.\nIt is now a fact that certain States, directly or indirectly, are cultivating egocentrism, thus weakening the multilateral development of international relations. The loss of enthusiasm for multilateralism, caused essentially by States preoccupied with their own interests, relegates to the background the ideals which were supported unanimously in 1945. This is a subject of profound concern for my country, for this attitude seems likely to make more acute the major problems of the time, particularly those of peace and security, justice and dignity among peoples and nations, international co-operation and the progress of mankind.\nRegarding the questions on the agenda for this session, I stress the unchanging position of my Government on the problems of security and the arms race. Gabon is deeply devoted to the fundamental principles and ideals o\u00b1 the Charter and has always advocated the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. It remains convinced that security cannot be maintained in a climate characterized by the use of force, military interventions, acts of aggression or the occupation of territories by foreign forces.\nSecurity and disarmament are closely linked. Consequently, international security cannot be strengthened by increasing armament. Only the creation of a climate of mutual trust in relations among States can lead to the solution of security problems.\nMoreover, over the last year there seems to have been no sign of feasible solutions to the various problems facing the United Nations; some of which, such as that of the situation in South Africa, have, rather, grown worse. The United Nations has branded apartheid, a crime against humanity, for the racial oppression of the South African people, the illegal occupation of Namibia and the constant acts of intimidation and aggression against the front-line States could hardly be more accurately described. Having long flouted the many appeals of the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Organization of African Unity, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries that it put an end to the hateful practice of apartheid. South Africa arrogantly defies the universal consensus and is perfecting its system of racial oppression.\nIn flagrant and deliberate violation of the Charter and the elementary norms of international law governing the behaviour of States, the South African Government continues its acts of armed aggression against neighbouring States, with the avowed intention of destabilizing them.\nThe imposition of the state of emergency has further complicated the already complex South African question. Unfortunately, strategic interests and the possible loss of the vast profits which the allies are making under the reign of apartheid seem to prevail over the many pertinent appeals to the Security Council finally to exert its authority.\nThe international community should seize true opportunity offered by the present session of the General Assembly to demand that Pretoria put an end to repression, bantustanization, the banishment, harassment of black leaders fighting for their independence, and the extermination of freedom fighters, and begin as soon as possible a constructive dialogue with the oppressed black population, in order that it may at last freely exercise its rights.\nApartheid cannot be reformed. No attempt to reform that hateful system should be encouraged. It must be eradicated and destroyed. It is the entire South African population that must decide the fate of its country, without distinction on the ground of race, colour, sex or belief, on a basis of full equality.\nFor its part, the Territory made the responsibility of the United Nations, Namibia, last year commemorated the twentieth anniversary of its illegal occupation by the country of apartheid.\nDuring this time, the Pretoria regime has developed in the Territory colonialism, apartheid and aggression, all practices rejected by the international community as seriously threatening world peace and security. At the same time, foreign economic activities and interests stubbornly obstruct the road to the exercise of full and genuine independence by the valiant Namibian people, under the enlightened leadership of its sole representative, the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). These same foreign interests are accelerating the systematic plundering of the natural wealth of the territory in flagrant violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\nFor my delegation, only the relevant decisions of our Organization can be considered as valid measures likely to guarantee the independence of the Namibian people. Consequently, full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which defines a coherent plan for the immediate independence of Namibia, is still the only framework likely to promote the decolonization process in Namibian territory. Gabon considers with interest, and supports, all attempts on the part of the parties concerned for the independence of Namibia to accelerate this process and considers the fallacious linkage of the granting of independence to Namibia with the withdrawal of Cuban troops based in Angola to be a subterfuge.\nI should like to reaffirm strongly my country's support for SWAPO in its implacable struggle for the liberation of Namibia. These are in no way mere statements of intention. Gabon has long since gone beyond this stage and is now undertaking concrete measures, of which I will only mention the granting of diplomatic status to SWAPO, the issuance of special postage stamps the profits from which will go to SWAPO, and the granting of stipends to Namibian students.\nTo sum up, it is a direct responsibility on the part of the United Nations to guarantee the Namibian people the exercise of the right to self-determination and to ensure the independence of Namibia through free elections. The United Nations cannot abdicate its responsibility to put an end to the constant acts of aggression perpetrated by South Africa in the region.\nLikewise guided by the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations, like those of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), my country is following with great concern the development of the conflicts, particularly in Chad and Western Sahara, that are tearing fraternal peoples apart.\nThe question of Chad has always been viewed in its two aspects: the intra-Chadian problem on the one hand, and the border conflict between Chad and Libya on the other.\nAs regards the first area, everyone here will remember the contribution made by my country and its Head, Al Hadj Omar Bongo, in the reconciliation of all the sons of this fraternal country. It is comforting that the leaders of the various components of the opposition are actively trying to work out the unification process.\nAs regards the border conflict between Chad and Libya, the General Assembly will recall that on 6 April 1983 the Security Council referred the matter to the OAU for consideration within the framework for appropriate OAU machinery. One of these mechanisms is precisely the Ad Hoc Committee set up in 1977 by the fourteenth summit meeting of the OAU and chaired since then by Gabon.\nThat is why, in application of the resolution adopted at the twenty-third summit meeting of the OAU, and taking into consideration the worsening of the military situation in the area. President Bongo had, first, made an appeal to the two parties in the conflict, and then undertook efforts to convene the Committee in Lusaka, with the agreement of President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, current Chairman of the OAU. It is my privilege to confirm to the Assembly, as many eminent delegations have done before me, that the Ad Hoc Committee did indeed meet in the capital of Zambia on 23 and 24 October, under the chairmanship of El Hadj Omar Bongo, with the presence of President Kaunda and with the effective participation of the Heads of State of the following Member States:\nPresident Diouf of Senegal and President Chissano of Mozambique; and of other Member States, namely Algeria, Cameroon and Nigeria, who were represented at the ministerial level.\nFor the first time the Ad Hoc Committee had the participation of both parties in the conflict, Chad represented by its Head of State, President Hissene Habre, and Libya by the head of the People's Bureau of External Relations. After expressing their pleasure with the Chadian and Libyan decisions to respond positively to the appeal of the current President or the OAU that they lay down their arms and co-operate frankly and loyally with the Committee, the Committee called upon both parties, first, to make available to it all relevant documentation to support their arguments, by 30 October 1 87 at the latest; secondly, to maintain and consolidate the cease-fire at all levels; thirdly, to refrain from any action that would make the conflict an international one.\nMoreover, the following timetable was drawn up; from 30 November to 30 December 1987, a meeting of juridical and cartographic experts at Libreville; on 7 January 1988, a meeting of ministers in Libreville; in the first two weeks of January 198 8, a meeting of Heads of State at Dakar.\nRespect for this timetable and strict observance of the Lusaka decision by the parties to the conflict should lead to further progress in their effort undertaken since 1977 both at the OAU level and at the United Nations level, to achieve a peaceful settlement of this dispute. Despite alarming reports received lately  we believe that the two parties in conflict will not dare to continue to turn a deaf ear to the various appeals made, or remain deaf to wisdom and reason. That same striving for peace among nations through dialogue has always been advocated by Gabon with regard to the question of Western Sahara.\nMy country is still convinced that only the organization of a referendum on free democratic and honest self-determination can lead to a final settlement of this conflict. We therefore welcome the recent initiative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who visited Morocco and Algeria to study on the spot the practical conditions for organizing such a referendum.\nI shall not conclude my statement on the political situation on the African continent without mentioning the question, still topical, of the Comorian island of Mayotte. My Government reaffirms its solidarity with the Comorian people and condemns and rejects all new forms of consultation that might be organized on the Comorian territory of Mayotte and reiterates its desire to continue to pursue the efforts already under way to return the Comorian island of Mayotte to its motherland as soon as possible.\nMy Government's position as regards the Middle East is clear. We m Gabon are persuaded that the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories, occupied since 1967 is the sine qua non condition for achieving a just and lasting solution. We believe that the Palestinians, like all other people in the world, must claim the full exercise of their legitimate rights, including that of existing within secure and internationally recognized borders. We are convinced that the Palestine Liberation Organization as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, must play an essential role in the efforts made to find a solution to this problem, efforts in which all interested parties should participate. The situation in Lebanon causes us concern, because of, among other things, the excellent relations between our two countries. We urge all the parties concerned to put an end to that fratricidal struggle and to devote themselves to the difficult but noble task of rebuilding the country.\nAs regards the conflict between Iran and Iraq, Gabon in particular and the international community in general have several times expressed their extreme concern over that endless and bloody confrontation. It is absolutely essential that there be a cease-fire and that the two sides accept and fully apply all the relevant Security Council resolutions. In order to speed up the opening of negotiations, Gabon encourages and supports the international initiatives - above all, of course, the action taken by the Secretary-General, who, under Security Council resolution 598 (1987) , adopted unanimously on 20 July, went to Baghdad and Tehran to work out a platform for negotiations.\nIn Afghanistan foreign intervention has fomented the war for nearly eight years. Far from being ended, the fighting is spreading. The only way out is through the search for a political solution guaranteeing both the withdrawal of foreign forces and the free determination of their future by the Afghan people.\nAs for the painful situation in Kampuchea, Gabon reaffirms its condemnation of the occupation of that country by foreign forces. It deplores the sacrifices inflicted on the innocent civilian population and recalls the urgent need to find a peaceful solution based, here too, on the withdrawal of foreign forces and the national reconciliation of all the sons of that friendly country.\nThe division of the Korean people, a long-running drama, having gone on for 40 years, continues. Gabon, which is pleased to count both Koreas among its best friends, continues to support a negotiated solution aimed at the peaceful reunification of those two parts of the same country.\nLatin America is another area of our world where tension is increasing daily. My country believes that only the implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence, good neighbourliness, the non-use of force, respect for territorial integrity and non-interference advocated by the Charter of our Organization can contribute to halting the worsening of the climate in that region. Therefore, we renew our support for the Contadora group and welcome the complementary contributions of the Lima Group, which provide propitious frameworks for renewing the chances of a better understanding between all peace-loving people.\nThe pitfalls of our era require from us nothing less than respect for the ideals on which the United Nations was built. The Organization can be strong only through our strength? it can be rational only through our reason; it can be efficient only through the means we can offer it.\nHaving created the United Nations for a better world, we must know that ultimately the world will only be the result of what we collectively intend to make of it. That applies both to political and to economic problems, on which I shall now put forward my country's position.\nIt must be recognized that the world economy, as we see it today, is naturally a result of policies advocated, followed or applied in the past. They have led us into a cycle marked by negative changes, all of which were seen during the course of 1986. They are characterized by a new collapse in production and in the international trade system, as well as by an increase in protectionism. All those negative factors, together with world monetary disorder and the imbalance in capital markets, clearly have an unfavourable impact on the economies of developing countries.\nOur countries, whose economies are essentially based on the commodities trade, have overall been seriously affected in recent years by the prolonged weakening in the prices of those products. The oil-producing countries in particular, including Gabon, face a grave economic crisis as a result of the fall both in the price of oil and in the exchange rate of the dollar. In American dollars the annual average price was 30 per cent lower in 1981 that it had been in 1980 - about 20 per cent in real terms. In other words, Africa's share of world commodity exports fell, for most commodities, particularly in the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s.\nGabon believes that the machinery of the Integrated Programme for Commodities, and its accompanying Common Fund, should have the full support of all trading partners. Stabilization of commodity markets requires appropriate regulation at the international level. It should be noted that trade flows have been such that the exports of developing countries fell from 33.6 per cent in 1980 to 24.6 per cent in 1986. In the same period their imports fell from 28.7 to 25.2 per cent.\nAn additional cause of concern is the effect on the international market in commodities from developing countries of the proliferation of substitute products from developed countries. In the light of what I have said, which is by no means exhaustive, my country endorses the fundamental conclusion of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in his report for the past year that.\u00b7 \\\"In the present situation the improvement in the world financial and trade environment is the key that should make it possible for the developing countries to begin to realize their development potential.\\\" We feel that that is a realistic evaluation, for any effort made at the national level by our country is doomed to failure if it is not supported by a real change in international economic structures. It is in this context - a reduction in international trade and an increase in protectionism in all its forms, the floating of the main reference currencies, a fall in public aid and a hardening of the terms of private loans - that we note with a feeling of anguish and impotence the disturbing increase in Africa's foreign debt.\nIn fact, by the end of 19t85 Africa's total debt amounted to $162 billion, more than $19 billion of which is swallowed up each year by debt servicing. Various solutions have been advocated, among them the rescheduling of debts. I take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the representative of Canada and, through him, to his great and generous country, which in a magnanimous action has just wiped out the debts of seven African countries, including Gabon, in a total amount of $250 million.\nIt is in order to find a solution to this grave problem that the African countries decided, in the Organization of African Unity, to hold a conference on Africa's foreign debt. On several occasions, under the terms of the relevant resolutions and declarations of that organization, our countries have solemnly undertaken to honour their debts. Africa's creditors should therefore feel protected from the confrontation which they seem to fear, and should not regard this conference as the framework for defining a strategy aimed at refusal to pay.\nBeyond this question of the external debt of the developing countries there is another question, which is linked to it: the absence of international liquidity facing our countries, which reduces and hinders our development possibilities. Hence, the five-Member group of experts established in July 1\u042384 by the late Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi - at that time the Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries - recommended in its report a greater allocation of resources and the implementation of a process of reform of the international monetary and financial systems.\nFinally, if development is to be integral, we cannot hide its social aspect, because it is precisely that aspect which most directly affects the people - who, as the President of the Republic of Gabon constantly repeats, are at the start and the end of any action for development.\nWe note with interest the inclusion in the agenda of this session of items relating to the fate of the disabled and the elimination of all forms of discrimination based on sex, as well as items relating to actions to be taken to ensure the protection of women. My Government stresses how important these problems are.\nThe distortions created by a period of relative economic growth and by the social changes it engendered have made my Government aware of the need to establish appropriate compensatory mechanisms to ensure, among other things - in the framework of its social action policy - the social reintegration and rehabilitation of the physically and mentally disabled. Moreover, women, like men, have access to education, vocational training, employment, and government - which now includes five women. We view our policy of social assistance, in the context of national solidarity, and our policy of improving the status of women as being in full accordance with the relevant provisions of tried resolutions of the Organization in this field.\nThat, in substance, is the message which, on behalf of my country, Gabon, I have the pleasure to address to the General Assembly on this solemn occasion. May the words it contains find in Members countries the favourable response which it deserves as a contribution to the dawning of a new era of peace, justice and harmony in the world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nAllow me at the outset to offer you, Sir, the sincerest congratulations of the delegation of the State of Bahrain on your assumption of the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. I should like to assure you of the full co-operation of my delegation in discharging the duties of your high office.\nI take this opportunity also to express my thanks and appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, for the competence and prudence he displayed in guiding the proceedings of the forty-first session and for the great efforts he exerted towards its success.\nI should also like to express deep appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his relentless efforts to enhance both the role of the Organization and its efficiency in fulfilling its international responsibilities for the well-being of the world community and in the interests of freedom and global peace.\nThis year the United Nations General Assembly is meeting as the spectre of war looms large over different parts of the world and as political, social and economic problems worsen by the day. Faced with such conditions, our only consolation could well be our faith in man's ability to adjust to reality and in his insistence on contending with difficulties in the hope of overcoming his troubles and solving his problems. It was in response to this will on the part of man that the United Nations came into being, to seek solutions for such problems and to meet the challenges in order to save the world from the scourge of war and the perils of chronic economic crises. \nToday's world is shackled to the bonds of tension and threats of war. Troubled international relations have become a characteristic of our times and a dangerous phenomenon threatening the future of coming generations. Although the Charter of the United Nations proclaims the fundamental and main objective of the Organization to be the prevention of future wars and specifies that international relations should be based on co-operation, interdependence and mutual respect, as well as on the principles of good-neighbourliness, aggression and hegemonism continue to be dominating trends in the contemporary world, thus further complicating matters year after year.\nWith peace and development being the main preoccupations of this world, one cannot but feel frustrated at seeing, after many years, the same major international problems still being inscribed on the agenda of this Organization, with no concrete progress being made towards their resolution, even though the majority of the international community recognizes the danger they constitute to the stability and security of mankind. Thus, if this year, as in previous years, we are meeting to consider our common political and economic issues driven by hope and brought together by a resolute determination to solve our problems in order to establish international relations based on justice and equity# then our deliberations and points of view must rise to the level of our responsibility, in accordance with our commitments under the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\nA cause for optimism and satisfaction on our part is the marked improvement in the relations of the two super-Powers. This no doubt creates a better international climate for promoting confidence and building bridges between East and West, in particular as regards the elimination of medium-range missiles and their nuclear warheads. This should pave the way towards finding solutions to the major international problems which threaten peace and security reducing military tensions and easing the political crises in various parts of the globe. \nThe fortieth anniversary of the United Nations provided an excellent opportunity to discuss the achievements of the world Organization since its inception in 1945, its success in solving certain important political problems and its enormous efforts in the various areas of economic, social and cultural co-operation, thus affirming its natural role as an international forum for dialogue and consultation among States and for the peaceful settlement of their disputes. The United Nations system and specialized international organizations also played a prominent role in the fields of decolonisation, human rights, development, the status of women, health, education, mother and child care, the problems of refugees, the environment and population, in addition to the many other areas of economic, social and cultural co-operation, too numerous to recall here.\nProfound political and economic changes have taken place since the inception of the United Nations. In the 1960s, the decolonisation process resulted in an increasing number of newly-independent States joining the membership of the Organization, thereby causing a change in its composition and the balance of power within it. Thus, the United Nations shifted from a system controlled of a limited number of States to a more democratic one in which the Movement of Non-Aligned -countries played a distinctive and prominent role. The 1973 also, brought forth changes, in the political and economic fields. Deliberations on the establishment of a new international economic order acquired political and economic dimensions never before experienced by the United Nations, especially after the emergence of interdependence as a reality and its positive effects in the area of multilateral co-operation, which we have been experiencing and living with every day. \nSome may hold the conviction that in its present state, the United Nations does not fulfil the role entrusted to it by the Charter, particularly in the realm of the maintenance of international peace and security. However, objectivity dictates that no judgement, whether in favour of or against the Organization, should be made until there has been a less abstract and more precise examination based on an evaluation of the conditions under which the Organization was created and the nature and limits of the authority and powers accorded to it, in the light of the political events and the circumstances of international relations then prevailing. It is difficult to deny that even when the United Nations has been unable to achieve decisive results in solving some important problems, because of the circumstances of international conflict, it nevertheless has succeeded in reducing tensions and crystallizing world public opinion through collective diplomacy, which, in view of the intertwining of international relations, is the only method capable of settling disputes by peaceful means.\nWe live in a fast-developing world. Technological advances proceed at such a pace that it is hard to keep up with them. Thus, despite relentless attempts on the part of the United Nations to modernize and develop methods that respond to international changes, it has not always been able to keep abreast of the multitude of new technologies. There exists a gap between the rate at which the world is developing and the ability of the United Nations and its institutions to keep pace with certain scientific developments. We therefore believe that concerted efforts within the framework of the international Organization to explore urgently the best ways to adapt to today's world have become a pressing necessity. The United Nations is here to stay. We must support it and help it evolve into what we meant it to be; a mechanism that can keep step with technological and scientific progress, as well as an instrument for economic development and for the maintenance of peace, security and stability in the world.\nWe speak of the lofty purposes and noble principles enunciated in the United Nations Charter as being the basis of conduct by States and of the peaceful settlement of disputes between them, in conformity with the principles of international law, while in several regions of the world international security continues to be threatened. The Arabian Gulf region, in particular, has for the past seven years been suffering from the scourge of a senseless war whose dangers have increased as its scope has widened and whose flames have been fanned to such an extent that the war is almost out of control and is becoming difficult to contain. For seven years the entire Gulf region has been living in a state of tension and disquiet as a result of the continuation of this war, which has seriously jeopardized the region's security and changed its peaceful and tranquil life into a life of strain and turmoil - first because of the threats to international maritime routes and then because of the attacks on commercial vessels, the laying of marine mines, and the various dangers of destruction to which the people of the region are exposed.\nThus, there has arisen a constant danger to freedom of international navigation. As a result, many nations now maintain a heavy military presence in the region, which could cause grave developments. In addition, Iran's shelling with rockets of residential areas south of Kuwait and the abuse of religious rites of pilgrimage in the Holy City of Mecca by Iranian pilgrims have led to an escalation of tensions, which could further complicate the war and widen its scope. The Co-operation Council of the Arab States of the Gulf has warned of the consequences of such a destructive war and expressed its willingness to undertake any peaceful endeavour aimed at ending the war. Time is precious. We feel that we have entered the countdown stage, and the search for a just and speedy solution to this bloody war between Iran and Iraq has therefore now become even more compelling.\nWe repeat today what we have already frequently stated: The lessons of history and experience teach us that this war does not serve the interest of either party to the conflict or of any of the other States of the region. Hence, we regard Security Council resolution 598 (1987) - which specified that the bases for \u00b7 a comprehensive settlement of the conflict between the two sides were a cease-fire and withdrawal to international borders - as a most important endeavour emanating from the conscience of the international community, an expression of its increased concern over this dangerous war.\nIn that context, we applaud the positive response of brotherly Iraq to the regional and international appeals and initiatives, in which it expressed its willingness to implement Security Council resolutions 582 (1986) and 598 (1987). We also once again address a sincere appeal to Iran to comply with the international will and to the endeavours of the Secretary-General by implementing, in its entirety and as an indivisible whole. Security Council resolution 598 (198 7) calling for an end to the war. We are hopeful that the Security Council will maintain its unanimity with respect to the implementation of that resolution without delay, and impose on the non-complying party the sanctions called for in the Charter, in order to put an end once and for all to this tragic conflict.\nThe question of Palestine has two basic dimensions: the land and the people. Both are still prey to the avaricious designs of Israel and world Zionism, within the framework of an international colonialist conspiracy aimed at Palestine, the land and the people - a conspiracy which, since 1948, Israel has used to wage successive wars of aggression against the Palestinian territories and the territories of other neighbouring Arab States.\nThe great tragedy forced on the Palestinian people is that of a people deprived of its homeland, driven out of its homes and forced to live dispersed in exile, in conditions of injustice, suppression, persecution and expulsion, constantly subjected to attempts to obliterate its Palestinian personality and identity, desecrate its Holy Places, confiscate its property, plunder its natural, resources and deprive it of all means for a decent life. And all this is done while Israel continues illegally to establish settlements in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. \nDespite the many resolutions adopted by the Security Council in this respect, including resolutions 242 (1967) and 330 (1973) - which stressed the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by the use of armed force and clearly demanded the withdrawal of the invading forces from the occupied Arab territories and a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict by peaceful means under the auspices of the United Nations - Israel has not complied with the international will and has continued its aggression by occupying more and more Arab territories. \nThe same arrogance, insolence and total disregard for resolutions has been apparent in the treatment that Israel has accorded those adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and other international organizations which have recognized the legitimate and inalienable right of the Palestinian people to return, and their rights to exercise self-determination and establish their own State on their soil and homeland, like all other peoples of the world.\nJust as Israel has rejected the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly on the question of Palestine, so too has it ignored the many United Nations resolutions condemning its aggression against Lebanon. It has refused to comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular resolutions 501 (1982) and 508 (1982), calling for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese territories invaded in 1982. Israel continues to this very moment to occupy areas along the entire length of the southern border of Lebanon, spreading destruction there and practising against its innocent population the roost abhorrent kinds of injustice and torture. \nWhat I have just said I\u00b7 not intended to open the files on the question of Palestine, which is well-documented in the records of the United Nations and with which most members are familiar. Rather, it is meant to draw attention to the gravity of the present situation in the Middle East as a result of the aggressive and expansionist policies still pursued by Israel regardless of the resolutions of the international Organization in this respect. However, if the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly are insufficient to deter Israel, it becomes the responsibility of the entire international community to take a clear and unequivocal stand against such total disregard of, and shameless indifference to, the Organization, its Charter and its resolutions. \nDesirous of preserving the peace and security of the region, the Arab States declared, in the Fez Plan of 1982, their acceptance of the peaceful settlement of the Arab\u2014Israeli dispute under the aegis of the United Nations and in accordance with its relevant resolutions. Such a constructive step by the Arab States received no positive response from Israel, which even refrained from proposing any international formula for ending the state of war, thus renouncing all international customs and laws. In the face of such an arrogant Israeli attitude,, we believe there can be no alternative but to support the decision of the General Assembly in resolution 38/58 C of 13 December 1983, which calls for convening the peace conference on the Middle East, under the auspices and supervision of the United Nations with the participation, on an equal footing, of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The confidence and respect which the United Nations commands make it the only international forum capable of finding a comprehensive and just solution to the problem.\nOur principled position on the Afghanistan question has already been clarified at previous sessions. It is based on our adherence to the principles embodied in the Charter, which prohibit the threat or use of force in international relations and renounce all forms of intervention, armed or otherwise, by any State in the internal affairs of another. We believe that the only way to settle this question peacefully is through the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and respect for the right of the Afghan people to choose freely, without any foreign pressure or interference, the political, social and economic system to which they aspire.\nThe minority regime in South Africa continues to apply its abhorrent system of apartheid and to practise all kinds of suppression and persecution against the black majority, which constitutes a crime against humanity and a gross violation of fundamental human rights. Its continued illegal occupation of Namibia is an outrageous challenge to the resolutions of both the Security Council and the General Assembly. In addition, its repeated attacks against its neighbours/ in open aggression against the sovereignty of States Members of this Organization, is convincing evidence of the disregard that regime holds for all principles and international conventions, demanding a firm stand by the entire international community against such challenges and inhuman practices.\nThe so-called reforms which have recently been adopted by the Government o\u00a3 South Africa, claiming that they would cause detente in racial relations, have not resulted in any improvement in the political situation of the black majority in South Africa nor in their living conditions. Thus the measures adopted by the Pretoria regime in past years have proved a failure in effecting any real reforms with regard to equality of rights between the black majority and the white minority. Moreover, the policy of apartheid still forms the core of the political thought of the Pretoria regime. We believe there will be no way out of this abnormal and inhuman situation until the black majority attain their political rights in full. As regards Namibia, the State of Bahrain is still convinced that the only basis for an internationally acceptable solution to the question is specified in the United Nations plan, as embodied in Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978).\nDespite the rapid spread of technology, the successive scientific advances in various fields and the notable increase in agricultural productivity, the gap between the developed and developing countries la still widening, while underdevelopment and poverty are daily on the rise in the developing world. The deep economic depression which hit the world in the inid-197\u00fc8 and the early 1980s had negative effects on the economic and social conditions in the developing countries. The situation further worsened when the economic recovery which the developed countries had been witnessing in recent years failed to cause a parallel recovery in the economies of the developing countries.\nThis deterioration in the world economic situation necessitates a radical solution to the problems of recession and depression, which had serious adverse effects on the economic and social development plans in the developing countries and increased the wide gap between the standards of living in the countries of the North and the South. The economic situation in the least-developed countries has acquired tragic dimensions, owing .to the fragility of their economies and their dependence on foreign aid, which make them extremely vulnerable to any unfavourable changes in the world economy. We believe that the policies and measures arrived at during the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) , with a view to addressing the problems facing the world economy, merit all our attention since they undoubtedly could, if implemented, contribute to the revitalization of development, economic growth and international trade.\t.\t.\nThe dangers facing the international monetary system as a result of the foreign debt burden of the developing countries, amounting to $1 trillion, is another problem which, owing to the current crisis and receding economic growth rates, is an ever-worsening one.\nThe debt problems, between the North and the South can, in our view, be contained through the integration of the developing countries into the international trade system and strengthening its financial and economic ties. It is to be hoped that the competent organs of the United Nations, such as UNCTAD, will play, with the co-operation of such specialized agencies as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, an active and positive role in improving the international economic situation and assisting the developing countries, in order to create a better world, where prosperity and well-being are prevalent.\nNeither the substantial scientific and technological accomplishments nor the tremendous advances in the field of communication and transportation have, regrettably, helped in achieving the desired understanding among States. Mankind has never been confronted with a greater danger than the one it now faces. Not only does the global arms race today threaten the future of mankind with destruction, but it can also lead to its extinction. The enormous stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the major Powers are capable of erasing all traces of life on this planet in a few seconds, and therein lies the importance of the United Nations and its role as an instrument for finding the most appropriate formula for co-operation and coexistence among the countries of the world, on the basis of mutual trust and security.\nAs we approach the threshold of the twenty-first century, let us not lose sight of the fact that all peoples of the world are inhabitants of one planet, and that our future and common fate depend on the extent of our co-operation in finding a way out of our insecure present to a more radiant and optimistic tomorrow.\nThanks to the humane purposes and noble principles of our Organization, there are gathered under its umbrella today all the peoples of the world, irrespective of their differing political, economic and social systems. My delegation hopes, therefore, that the present session will adopt the appropriate decisions necessary to confront those global problems which, if not met with organized collective action, can have disastrous consequences for mankind. We also hope that the United Nations efforts to maintain peace, realize justice and provide security for the nations of this world will meet with success and that Member States will exert their utmost efforts to ensure that all human resources are utilized for the benefit of mankind and not wasted on the arms race or the manufacture of weapons of destruction\u00b7\nOnce again I reiterate that my country, Bahrain, stands ready to co-operate fully with the other Member States in order to achieve for our peoples those goals of freedom, well-being and progress to which we all aspire; to promote international efforts aimed at establishing a just, comprehensive and durable peace, in accordance with the lofty objectives and principles of the Charter; to strengthen international co-operation in the economic, social and cultural fields j and to build a better, more secure world wherein prosperity, progress and development prevail. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPermit me at the outset to extend to you, Sir, on behalf of the delegation of Thailand and on my own behalf, the warmest congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are confident that your recognized qualities and experience will ensure that the Assembly's proceedings will be conducted with smooth efficiency, wisdom and fairness, and that we will achieve a successful conclusion.\nI should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the outgoing President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly, who is a distinguished son of Bangladesh and Asia, for his invaluable contribution to the work of the Organization during the past year. In a world beset by a host of political and economic problems a nation's cohesiveness and resilience are of the utmost importance. The success of Thailand since the Second World War is a good example. In one way, the Thai experience is unique. We the Thai people have been\nblessed with the Thai monarchy. This institution is at present personified by His Majesty King Bhuraibol Adulyadej, the ninth King of the House of Chakri. He has been and continues to be the central, unifying element of the Thai nationhood. He is the moral inspiration for our Government and people. He is the soul of our nation.\nIn the next nine months two events of the greatest significance to the Thai nation will be celebrated. The first, in December, will be the sixtieth anniversary of His Majesty's birth, which, to the Thai people, marks one of the most important milestones in a person's lifetime. Then, next July, he will become the longest-reigning monarch in Thai history. The celebrations of those two events will provide the Thai people with opportunities to display their boundless respect, profound gratitude and immeasurable affection for their beloved monarch.\nAs a working monarch in the national mainstream, our King has always been in close touch with the people. He has tirelessly and selflessly devoted himself to the progress and welfare of the people, especially those in rural areas. In these efforts he has always been assisted by Her Majesty the Queen and other members of the Royal Family.\nThe Thai King believes that all his subjects have a right to share in the benefits of the nation's progress and prosperity. He has pioneered rural development projects designed to help the people fulfil their basic needs and achieve self-sufficiency. These projects have brought an increased measure of prosperity to the rural poor. Many of the projects have been funded from his own personal resources. He has also led in the search for a humane way to help the hill tribes abandon opium cultivation. He has initiated crop substitution and integrated development schemes. These have been carried out by my Government. As a consequence, the output of opium has been reduced significantly over the years.\nThe international drug problem is of great concern to my country. For this reason we participated actively in the International Conference on Drug Abuse and illicit Trafficking at Vienna in June this year. The meeting, under the inspired presidency of the Prime Minister of Malaysia, was able to create a programme of action by Governments to cope with this global problem.\nThe royal oath taken by Thai monarchs includes the vow to render aid and comfort to all in need. During the past 12 years Thailand, under the reign of King Bhumibol, has been recognized for its compassion to fellow human beings uprooted by war and oppression. Thailand has offered temporary shelter to nearly one million refugees. These are the Kampucheans, Laotians and Vietnamese who have fled into Thailand since 1975, and especially since the invasion of Kampuchea in 1978. Over 350,000 still remain. \nA major cause of this plight of such magnitude has been the aggression and occupation of Kampuchea by Vietnamese armed forces. This problem poses the major obstacle to peace and stability in the region. It is not only a threat to the security of Thailand and South-East Asia, but also an economic drain on Viet Nam1 s own resources and a waste of the assistance given to Viet Nam by its friends and allies. In addition it imposes a humanitarian burden on its neighbours and on the international community. Vietnamese deeds in Kampuchea violate the United Nations Charter and international law. For this reason, year after year the General Assembly has condemned Viet Nam's actions and demanded the total withdrawal of its forces from Kampuchea. The General Assembly has endorsed the Kampuchean people's right to self-determination and to choose its own Government without foreign interference. Over two thirds of the United Nations membership have also remained firm in their call for a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict in Kampuchea. The future Kampuchea should be neutral and non-aligned and should pose no threat to any country.\nThe countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) will continue to work for such a settlement. Their latest effort was on 16 August 1987, when they endorsed the proposal that the Kampuchean factions engage in a dialogue with the Vietnamese at a gathering. This gathering is envisaged as an initial step towards the political settlement of the Kampuchean problem.\nRecent developments have indicated an increasing convergence towards a desire to bring about an end to the conflict in Kampuchea. We call on the leaders of Viet Nam to turn this desire into reality. Let them withdraw their forces from Kampuchea, as they have said they would, but let them do it now and not in 1990, as proclaimed.\nWe agree that national reconciliation at an appropriate time is a prerequisite for a political solution. One personage who is vital to the Kampuchean drama is His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk. We believe that under his tutelage and leadership the Kampuchean people can heal their wounds and band together to bring about a rebirth of the Kampuchean nation.\nThailand wishes to record its deep appreciation of the United Nations Secretary-General's devoted and tireless efforts to restore peace in Kampuchea. Ws urge him and the international community to intensify their efforts towards this end. In particular, Thailand calls on the major Powers, which wield great influence, to become even more conscious of this problem, which affects not only the Kampucheans but others as well. It is encouraging to observe that some of them have begun to discuss among themselves the way to resolve this question, as evidenced in the continuing series of dialogues between such major Powers as the United States, the Soviet Union and China. On several occasions Thailand has raised this matter with many international leaders and requested them to assist. It is iniquitous that this tragedy of untold suffering has been allowed to be prolonged. Actions leading to a just and lasting solution should and must be taken without undue delay. Everybody must lend a hand.\nOnly after Kampuchea has regained its sovereignty and independence will that part of South-East Asia be able to turn swords into ploughshares. Only then will the countries of the area be able to reconstruct their shattered economies. Then, and only then, will their peoples be able to enjoy the benefits of peace that are taken for granted elsewhere. Then, too, will the rest of us in South-East Asia be able to realize our full potential as a part of the rapidly developing Pacific Basin. Together we can give meaning to Pacific dynamism, which can impart great benefit not only to this region but also to the world at large.\nThe aspiration to achieve peace and prosperity through common efforts and co-operation finds good expression in the endeavours of ASEAN. This year has already witnessed the twentieth anniversary of the founding of ASEAN. The birth of ASEAN was indeed a major turning point in the history of South-East Asia, based as it is on shared interests and values, as well as pragmatism and tolerance. The concept o\u00a3 free association has thus made its mark in a region where colonialism ran rampant not so long ago. ASEAN co-operation has indeed stimulated regional growth and prosperity over much of the past two decades. ASEAN is scheduled to hold a few months from now its third summit meeting to chart the course of its peaceful and constructive co-operation for the next decade.\nIn this regard, Thailand is pleased to learn of the agreement in principle between the Soviet Union and the United States on the elimination of intermediate and short-range missiles and of the forthcoming summit meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev. We hope that after this important beginning further efforts will be made to reduce the strategic missile arsenals by 50 per cent. Effective measures are also necessary in the fields of chemical and conventional weapons. In Africa, the Namibian people and the black majority in South Africa have been victims of unilateral oppression for generations. Thailand once again joins in the call for the eradication of the apartheid system and for the immediate implementation of the United Nations Plan for Namibia.\nThe problems of the Middle East continue to be on the agenda of the world Organization. Thailand supports United Nations efforts to restore peace in the region on the basis of security for all States, withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories, self-determination for the Palestinian people, the territorial Integrity of Lebanon, cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq and withdrawal of forces to the International boundary. In the latter context, Thailand takes note of Security Council resolution 598 (1978), which was adopted unanimously, and hopes that it will be fully Implemented.\nThe situation in Afghanistan was caused by the single-minded pursuit of unilateral goals on the part of one of the world's most powerful nations. The problem can be resolved only on the basis of the relevant General Assembly resolutions, which demand the total withdrawal of foreign forces, and exercise by the Afghan people of their right to self-determination.\nThe position of Thailand on these issues has been firm and consistent. Our position is based on the United Nations Charter and international law, and is in harmony with a majority of the Member States. The Secretary-General, too, enjoyed Thailand's confidence and support in his patient efforts to find peaceful solutions to these problems. My country is always willing to assist in these efforts, anytime, anywhere. Not all the urgent problems are of a political nature. Many of them are economic. The International economic system has created a web of interdependence. No nation stands alone. For this reason, Thailand is fully committed to an open and liberal world trade system. \nHowever some countries, particularly the more affluent, have adopted trade policies and measures which obstruct open and free international trade. Besides hindering the North-South dialogue, they also work against the interest of all nations. Developing countries with open economies, like Thailand, have already had to cope with the problems of low agricultural and commodity prices. These problems are compounded by protectionism against the export of products in which we enjoy inherent comparative advantages. Without the expansion of exports, we cannot sustain our economic growth. This would have major repercussions on our national development and on the well-being of our people. We therefore call on all countries concerned to show a sincere desire to co-operate. For only through such co-operation can we succeed in remedying the present international economic disorder.\nThe most pressing problem of all time confronting any Government is the well-being of its people. Here, in the case of Thailand, the inspiration from our King has always been very important to my Government. As stated earlier. His Majesty has pioneered a great number of projects for the rural poor. Following his initiatives, my Government has allotted a major part of the national budget to development programmes for rural areas throughout the Kingdom.\nDespite the economic difficulties facing developing countries in the world ' today, Thailand continues to obtain substantial economic growth. Our rate of growth is estimated to be close to 6 per cent in real terms this year. This is due partly to the Government's success in providing incentives and in stimulating the economy. It is also due to the close co-ordination between the public sector and our private sector. We expect our economy to continue growing, which will in turn bring better health care, better food, better shelter and a better standard of living for our people. It is clear that, for Thailand, the role of the monarchy has proved to be indispensable. The monarchy is a moral force that binds all elements in the Thai nation. It is a force that works for the greatest good of the Thai people. As we in Thailand celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the birth of our King, we also see it as an opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the cause of international peace, security and harmony. He are resolved to reaffirm our steadfast support for the United Nations. This is what the Ring himself stated in his royal address at the opening ceremony of the secretariat building of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, in Bangkok, on 24 October 1975: \\\"The United Nations has set for itself the high ideals of maintaining international peace and security based on the principles of equality and friendly relations among all nations, and it has, in actual practice, always tried its utmost to co-ordinate and promote the efforts of large and small countries all over the world to create mutual understanding and co-operation in order to solve the various problems in economic, social, human rights and other fields.\\\" \nThe United Nations has indeed played a tremendously active role in bringing Member States together to solve international problems and crises. It must continue to champion the cause of international peace and security as well as the well-being of all the peoples of the world.\nThe gathering of so many Heads of State and Heads of Government at the General Assembly each year testifies to the importance the world attaches to this Organization. But we hope that the fruits of the deliberations and discussions on these occasions will not leave only empty echoes of good intentions.\nLet us turn these good intentions into positive action, action which brings just solutions to our problems, action which brings real and beneficial changes to our world.\nIf we do these things, then we will know that we have done our very best to create a better world for mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset of my presentation to the General Assembly at its forty-second session, I should like to convey our most respectful greetings to the President, Mr. Peter Florin, representative of the German Democratic Republic, and to express our best wishes for the successful conclusion of our work under his presidency, and the hope that from this session there will emerge important resolutions that would effectively ensure international peace and security.\nWe also extend out greetings to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whom we ask to accept our appreciation for his tireless dedication to the United Nations goals of peace and development. This Organization is fortunate to have him, not only as its most eminent official, but also as a citizen of the world committed to achieving peace and development for all.\nThe Republic of Paraguay comes once again to this forum with the sincere intention of supporting every initiative that could assure mankind of a day of peace and full development. It does so in the firm belief that each State Member of this Organization, as a servant of international law, is convinced of the importance of the existence of the United Nations and of its role of protagonist in bringing about a time of peace and security for all.\nIn these circumstances, and considering the role the United Nations should Play in the world, we fail to understand the attitudes of many countries - whether they be super-Powers, permanent members of the Security Council or Members of this Organization - attitudes that undermine, that sap their support and reduce the level of their active participation, thus weakening the Organization's ability to intervene in critical situations. This problem, already one of long standing - the Problem of the lack of a leading role for the United Nations in world conflicts - is totally, the unwarranted. On the contrary, it demands of every country an effective attitude that could redound to the greater, the universal prestige of our Organization and the effective application of our entire legal and moral power for bringing about just solutions to conflicts that, at this very moment, beset humanity.\nWhen we review those critical events that have taken place since 1945, we are obliged to say that, because of the aforementioned weakening of the role of the United Nations as a leader, every country should see to it that the decisions taken by the General Assembly, which are adopted to prevent or solve conflicts, are brought into line with true justice and contain positive formulas - pragmatic and fair formulas - capable of resolving crises by peaceful means and achieving effective peace through negotiation. Unilateral, partial decisions, or those that do not embody the immutable principles of international justice, do the United Nations system no good. By contrast, the adoption of decisions on the basis of different criteria - criteria based on world harmony and strict respect for the Charter - could promote a more effective way for our Organization to become involved.\nThe Government of Paraguay wishes to pay a special tribute to all bodies within the United Nations system, but in particular to the United Nations Development Programme, whose activities are related to the progressive accomplishment of all the vital projects that are being implemented in our country. This type of United Nations assistance is not only effective for developing countries like Paraguay, but also serves the ceaseless quest for a better standard of life and progress for all nations.\nThe Republic of Paraguay is continuing to make strides in peace and democracy. It has been doing so steadily since 1954, assuring justice and freedom for all our people. The nation is effectively governed by the rule of law, and thus enables its citizens to develop further and perfect our democratic institutions, guaranteeing a political life based on the widest possible participation and a multi-party system.\nThe Government of the Constitutional President of the Republic of Paraguay, General of the Army Alfredo Stroessner, is based on popular consent, freely expressed in fair elections. It has the popular and democratic support of the Colorado Party, a political organization which, on 11 September 1987, commemorated a hundred years of constitutional life in Paraguay.\nThroughout its rich history, Paraguay has struggled and made sacrifices to defend the immutable principles of international law. We seek to ensure constant respect for the individual identity and the independence of all States and, in strict reciprocity in our international conduct, we have called on other States faithfully to observe the same principles, never, in any circumstances or in any way whatsoever, accepting interference by other States in the domestic affairs of Paraguay - affairs which are of concern to, and have to be dealt with, only by Paraguayans.\nWe wish to bring to the attention of the General Assembly the spirit of integration that has guided the regional policy of the Republic of Paraguay, a policy based on peace and co-operation with our neighbours. This has made possible the construction of the hydro-electric projects at Itaipu, under conditions of equality of rights and duties, with the Federative Republic of Brazil - projects that are already generating the electricity needed for the development of a vast region. The same applies to the Yacyreta project involving ourselves and Argentina. This project is in an advanced stage of construction. Both demonstrate the serious determination of the Government of Paraguay to make progress. These, added to the facilities provided by our Atlantic neighbours, such as the ports of Paranagua in Brazil, Nueva Palmira in Uruguay, Antofagasta in Chile and Matarani in Peru constitute favourable indicators of our relations with neighbouring sister nations. Our trade with Bolivia is expanding through the Transdhaco route, in harmony with the spirit of that same policy.\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization deserves our fullest support. We know of the Secretary-General's unalterable determination to find a solution to international problems. This report schematically summarize! all the achievements in that difficult field, as well as the frustrations faced as the result of a wide range of intervening factors that are beyond the control of the highest-ranking official of the United Nations.\nWe highlight the work done by the Secretary-General and subscribe to his central, vital concepts, which lead the Organization towards fulfilment of the purposes laid down by the founders of the United Nations, in a changing world beset - by adverse factors, so that peace may be made a tangible reality and fellowship among nations may foster progress and efforts to achieve international justice.\nWe cannot fail to mention the sources of possible world conflicts that are of concern to the Republic of Paraguay and to all mankind - for example, the conflict in the Persian Gulf, which has reached such dangerous proportions that it could a any moment lead to a more widespread war, with incalculable consequences. We believe we speak for men and women throughout the world when we ask the United Nations to make every possible effort to put an end to that hotbed, which has its origin in the war between Iran and Iraq, compounded by a number of factors that imperil world peace. We call upon the States involved in that conflict to accept the decisions of the United Nations.\nThe regrettable escalation of events in Latin America confronts us with evidence of another source of conflicts whose outcome is unpredictable. In this area of the world, there is intervention by two super-Powers with broad interests in the region. The countries of the region that make up the Contadora Group and the Support Group have been working, with our encouragement, to bring about peace. It is essential that peace be achieved and that all the countries of the region refrain from adopting partisan positions. This applies particularly to those that are acting in the service of a super-Power, whether directly or indirectly. We condemn such action on the basis of the principle of non-intervention.\nThe conflict in the Near East does not seem to be of concern to the world at the moment, possibly because the region has for so long suffered the absence of the peace that is essential for nations, peoples and States. The Republic of Paraguay has proclaimed in all forums, the need to ensure implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in the search for effective solutions to the problems in this high-risk area of conflict. We believe that the Palestinian people have the right to a homeland, just as the State of Israel has the right to live in peace within its boundaries.\nThe Government of the Republic of Paraguay has condemned, in this forum, the intervention of a super-power in Afghanistan, in a clear-cut demonstration of that Power's lack of regard for international justice and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. We take this opportunity to reiterate, on a universal basis, that the application of this principle, which is central to our Charter and to human rights, is the sole guarantee of peace and harmony among nations at differing economic and social levels.\nWe are also concerned by Viet Nam's intervention in Cambodia. That intervention, which is dangerous from all points of view, generates the intervention in that country by a super-Power on the one hand and by another country, also a permanent member of the Security Council, on the other.\nThe Republic of Korea has always worked for the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas. Unfortunately, its efforts have not been crowned with success, for reasons that cannot be attributed to that country, a defender of freedom. The Republic of Korea, a law-abiding country that respects the international desire for coexistence, has a legitimate desire to become a Member State of our Organization. We support that legitimate desire of the Republic of Korea, which is in keeping with the principle of universality of the United Nations and with an effective international order, and believe that the possibility of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also being admitted should be kept open.\nThe problem of the Malvinas Islands has had a number of consequences, which once again, demonstrate that disputes should be resolved by effective, pragmatic negotiations. The Republic of Paraguay calls upon the two countries involved - Argentina and the United Kingdom - with both of which we have ties of friendship, to adopt this procedure so as to find an amicable, felicitous solution to the dispute over sovereignty, In this spirit, we advocate negotiations between the parties.\nWe cannot help but voice our concern when we turn to the subject of disarmament, a vital issue in the times in which we live. The arms race and the business of purchasing and selling conventional and nuclear arms themselves engender pressure and hostility and pave the way for armed conflict. Disarmament is a necessity for all States, and that necessity becomes even greater when we realize that many less developed countries that are in desperate straits because f the deterioration of the international economy are spending millions of dollars cm arms of various kinds. We live in peace and we believe in peace. In that spirit we call upon all States to end the arms race, which is a shameful affront considering the sad fact that thousands upon thousands of children are dying because of starvation and malnutrition.\nThe Republic of Paraguay, which won independence on 14 May 1811, values the work on decolonisation being done by the United Nations. We applaud this work since we support the principle of the self-determination of peoples as long as application of that principle is not linked with interests alien to the legitimate interests of the peoples meant to win independence.\nOn the basis of that position, we believe that the people of Namibia are entitled to independence. Further the Republic of Paraguay supports in all forums the principle of territorial integrity and the full sovereignty of peoples. We should like, on the basis of non-intervention in internal affairs, to see the withdrawal of foreign troops from the countries of Africa.\nThere is one scourge that horrifies all people the world over but none the less continues to undermine the moral and legal order of our world. We refer to terrorism, which afflicts various individual countries as well as the international community. The time has come to ask ourselves what has been done to cope with this irrational, inhuman monstrosity to ensure that it ceases to take innocent lives. Terrorism cannot be legitimised in any circumstances. Countries that encourage terrorism based on the fact that there may exist underlying causes that trigger so irrational a reaction must, even if some of those causes exist, change their views in keeping with the dignity that must govern the system of relationships within the international community.\nWe cannot tolerate terrorism because it is unjustifiable that certain territories should serve as training-camps for terrorists and still less that such territories should be used as sanctuaries for terrorists. The time has come to state categorically that the United Nations has two options: it can persuade all countries to condemn this irrational and inhuman conduct and to work together to eliminate the hotbeds of terrorism. Otherwise, our Organization will lack credibility in these matters and will be irrevocably forced to admit its inability to wipe out a practice that is a crime against mankind. But this is not to say that the United Nations should not continue to consider, with zeal and diligence, the elimination of the probable causes of this universal scourge. Those causes, however, can never explain the criminal violation of the right to life of its innocent victims.\nThe Republic of Paraguay supports the policy of the United Nations to end all forms of discrimination against women. It has been many years since the law enshrining the civil and political rights of Paraguayan women was promulgated in recognition of an established fact and of the active part women had played in our national life. In a spirit of fairness we must also recognize that the North-South dialogue has so far produced no results whatsoever. The rich industrialized countries continue to set Incredibly low prices for the raw materials produced and exported by the developing world. This ignoble policy is the root cause of many of the problems of the developing world. The deterioration in the terms of trade leads b the regrettable fact that many countries are unable to pay their debts and are not in a position to reach the stage of full development they require in order for their people to attain a life of dignity.\nAlthough the Republic of Paraguay is not in the same position as other fraternal countries with regard to external debt, we express our solidarity with all those countries that are facing such a situation. This issue requires not only financial and economic solutions, which are of prime importance but also political solutions, because no country can resign itself to zero progress when there are collective needs to be met in order to forestall situations that may endanger not only the peace but the freedom of peoples in the developing countries.\nOur Organization must identify itself fully with the legitimate requests formulated by countries in the unfortunate position of being unable to repay their debts. The rich industrialized countries must take a stand, not out of selfish and restrictive motives but in a common desire to consolidate peace and democracy through justice in the international economic arena.\nAll attempts and programmes formulated to resolve this disturbing problem of the burden of external debt in the world must inevitably be based on the recognition of the exporting countries' inalienable right to receive really fair prices for their raw materials exported to international markets.\nIn the face of the painful developments in economic relations between the industrialized North and the developing South, the real needs of developing countries have given rise to certain aspirations. We refer to economic and technical co-operation between developing countries. The United Nations, in all its forums, including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), must use its prestige to back up this effort which is being promoted throughout the world, for the most part through specialized organizations on the regional level.\nWe must, finally, come to the conclusion that raising the standard of living of the developing peoples is a moral duty on the part of our Organization and of those countries that already enjoy high standards of life and enjoy fully the many benefits that are unattainable in the developing countries. In this context what is required is a carefully implemented effort to achieve a better economic position for the raw-material-producing countries or for those countries that are just beginning industrial development.\nThe Government of Paraguay is fully aware that there is an acute financial crisis at the United Nations. The developed countries, for reasons the developing countries cannot fully comprehend, have curtailed their contributions to our Organization, thus decreasing the total amount of moneys available. This financial crisis has an effective political dimension, since, in the short term, our Organization will have to make cuts throughout its system, cuts that will adversely affect programmes currently being implemented throughout the developing world.\nThis will obviously have an adverse effect on the scope of the activities of our Organization and work to its detriment.\nWe are fully aware, moreover, of economic stagnation and recession. We understand the scope of those problems, which are causing serious difficulties to the super-Powers in the commercial sphere and affecting the balance of payments. Nevertheless, the times in which we live compel the United Nations to depend on the contributions it needs for it to do its work throughout the world, contributions that must come from those industrialized countries fortunate enough to enjoy wealth and development.\nThe problem of Lebanon merits a special place in my statement. It can be considered to be included in the aforementioned serious conflict in the Middle East, However, in view of the conditions now prevailing, conditions which, if they were to persist, could spawn new and tragic developments, we feel that we must give it special consideration.\nThe principles of the self-determination of peoples and the territorial integrity of States have been set aside in Lebanon by the reign of irrational violence and have been replaced by political intransigence and the polarization of the conflicting parties. Paraguay holds unswervingly to the need for a peaceful settlement of disputes. It joins the concert of countries demanding this in order to ensure the existence and integrity of Lebanon on the basis of legal equality and peaceful coexistence among its citizens, to whatever ethnic group they belong.\nAs for the question of Cyprus, the Republic of Paraguay is hopeful that that problem, which is long standing in the United Nations, can find a just and balanced solution through negotiations, avoiding violent confrontation and any violation of international law. We hope that United Nations intervention may lead to just solutions that take into consideration the rights of the countries concerned in the conflict.\nIf all practical instruments to reach a happy conclusion in the current situation are not brought into play, the problem of Cyprus could well become yet another of the unending crises in today's world, which is truly and wholly interdependent. Armed conflict in one part of the world is not limited to that region but can have unpredictable repercussions and ramifications throughout the rest of the world.\nThe developing world has immense prospects in the new Law of the Sea. The Republic of Paraguay, as a developing landlocked country, firmly believes that that instrument, which has been given the world to redress irritating and dangerous injustices, represents a new step forward by mankind in its painstaking quest for a better distribution of the world's wealth amongst nations. On the basis of that belief, Paraguay has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and will support that process, which redounds to the prestige of the Organization and which may, in the future, be a source of truly lasting satisfaction. The Republic of Paraguay has co-operated and will continue to co-operate with our Organization's Commission on Human Rights. In the course of that co-operation it welcomed the visit of an independent advisor in 1986, who travelled throughout our country and became fully aware of the actual situation in Paraguay. That same person, in pursuance of his work, which Paraguay continues to welcome, will visit our country again before the end of 1987.\nThis is a demonstration of Paraguay's co-operation with the United Nations, which is dedicated to the promotion of human rights. Our Government responds immediately to all inquiries received from United Nations organs dealing with human rights, on the understanding that with the co-operation of Member countries these organs will intensify their work to the benefit of our Organization.\nWe warmly support the loyal co-operation of the United Nations with the Organization of American States and the Latin American Economic System. We value such co-operation and we see it as having a positive and realistic significance in the interdependent world we live in - a world whose problems always requite global solutions. These assertions are valid in the political sphere, but their validity is even more apparent in the economic field.\nMy Government enthusiastically supports the proposal put forward in this universal forum by the Republic of Brazil for the declaration and establishment of a zone of peace and co-operation in the South Atlantic. This valuable initiative for world peace and for free and progressive interplay in the South American continent deserves the attention of all international organizations which must work out specific programmes for this vital area of the world, in the arduous tasks of achieving peace with justice, equal opportunity and economic growth for everyone without exception.\nWe can state with absolute certainty that men and women the world over look to the United Nations and its task with faith and confidence. They are at the very core of the efforts we make here on behalf of peace and progress for mankind; and they place their trust in our Organization and in the spirit of those who convene here to represent their Governments in order to foster the ideals and commitments of the founders and ensure for all the inhabitants of the globe the blessings of peace and the establishment of justice in international relations.\nWe bear witness to our sharing this noble spirit and to our commitment that e shall work United in order to achieve these objectives and ideals, without which life would have no meaning, and to ensure a future free of storm clouds obscuring mankind's vision.\nWe must freely shoulder our responsibility to bequeath to our children and our children's children the happy world future generations will expect - a world without discrimination without error, without injustice that engenders exasperation and dejection; and a creative atmosphere with joy, peace and moral fulfilment.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, I have the honour to convey to you and this Assembly greetings from my august sovereign, His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, and his best wishes for the success of the forty-second session of the General Assembly.\nOn behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, I have great pleasure in congratulating you on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. This is as much a tribute to the German Democratic Republic's commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations as it is to Your Excellency's well-known personal attributes and diplomatic skill. My delegation is convinced that under your able stewardship the Assembly will achieve the desired results. I wish also to extend congratulations to Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed on his appointment as Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs.\nI should like to express my delegation's deep appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, who guided the General Assembly at its forty-first session with such distinction and wisdom. May I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his ceaseless endeavours for the cause of international peace and co-operation as for his laudable efforts to make the United Nations system more efficient and effective.\nThe United Nations has for some time been a helpless witness to the growing dangers and deterioration in the international situation. The spiralling arms race r in both the nuclear and the conventional fields, the ever-widening socio-economic disparities between nations and peoples, and the increasing areas or incidents of tension, intervention and conflicts present a disturbing scenario for the world as it staggers towards the twenty-first century. Clearly, this state of affairs cannot for long continue unchecked or unchallenged without inviting the most devastating consequences.\nIt is against such a backdrop that we welcome the recent turn of events in the relations between the super-Powers. We are particularly encouraged by the agreement in principle to eliminate intermediate and short-range missiles worldwide. While such an accord in itself represents a significant achievement in the process of disarmament, we believe it could help in building mutual confidence between the super-Powers and pave the way for other, even more significant initiatives and accords. Committed as Nepal has always been to the goal of general and complete disarmament, it is only natural for us to hope that the present momentum will be maintained and that no opportunity to halt, or reverse, the arms race in other areas will be allowed to pass. \nWhile we attach the utmost urgency to nuclear disarmament because of the unlimited capacity of nuclear weapons to inflict destruction, we feel that we cannot, like Nelson, turn a blind eye and ignore the galloping conventional arms race. Such weapons consume 80 per cent of global military expenditure and have been used in over 150 conflicts in more than 70 countries since the end of the Second World War.\nOnly a fortnight ago, the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development was convened here at the United Nations. Apart from examining the close relationship between these two urgent challenges of our times, the Conference was useful in highlighting the grave dangers posed by the unprecedented arms race not only on international security but also on the stability and welfare of peoples and nations.\nNepal looks forward with much anticipation to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, slated for next year. We hope that the special session will also consider new initiatives and concepts that serve to advance the cause of disarmament, including the creation of zones of peace and other confidence-building and conflict-limiting measures.\nIn this context I wish to recall that, as early as 1975, His Majesty King Birendra proposed that Nepal be declared a zone of peace - a proposal which, I am pleased to state, has secured the valuable support of 85 States Members of the United Nations, for which I express our profound gratitude. We believe its realization would not only fully vindicate the rationale of the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development but, no less important, make a tangible contribution to consolidating peace in what is a strategic part of the world. Conceivably, it could even act as a model for stabilizing peace in other geopolitically sensitive areas of the globe.\nAn overview of the world political situation provides scant room for comfort. Thus, while the age-old predilection of the strong to impose their will on the weak continues unabated, the spectre of foreign intervention seems to have acquired subtler, and more dangerous, dimensions. If a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is manifest in surveying the West Asian politico-military landscape, it is difficult to view with calm and serenity the escalation of tension in the Persian Gulf region. As we continue to remain concerned at the ongoing conflict between two of our non-aligned friends, Iran and Iraq, we have reasons to hope that the recent decision of the Security Council and the efforts of the Secretary-General will help eventually to restore peace to a region torn apart by seven long years of fratricidal conflict. Concerned at developments in Central America over the past several years, Nepal has supported the efforts of the Contadora Group for the restoration of peace.\nNepal warmly welcomed the recent peace agreement signed by five Central American Presidents in Guatemala City, and we reaffirm our belief that durable peace in Central America can be established only when all States with links to or interests in the area scrupulously honour and uphold the principle of non-interference. Closer home, Nepal also welcomed the agreement between our two South Asian neighbours and friends, India and Sri Lanka, and we hope that this will not only end ethnic violence but also help in strengthening the unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka.\nMeanwhile, the depressingly familiar problems of West Asia, Afghanistan and Kampuchea are sombre reminders of how very little the world has changed in the more than four decades since the establishment of this world body, which was created, among other things, to protect the weak and uplift the poor among nations. In West Asia, prospects for a lasting peace are as bleak as ever, notwithstanding flickering hopes that a number of unyielding attitudes of the past that inhibited a comprehensive peace settlement might be shed. Peace, in our view, will continue to elude West Asia as long as the Palestinians are denied a homeland of their own in the region. There cannot be a stable peace if Israel does not withdraw from territories occupied since the Arab-Israeli conflict of 1967. Neither will peace be restored to that region as long as the right of Israel to exist within secure and well-defined boundaries is denied.\nThe plight of Lebanon continues to be a matter of deep concern, especially that part of a sovereign State should be treated as falling within the defence perimeter of a stronger neighbour. Nepal totally rejects any doctrine or code of international ethics that is based on the absurd premise that the security of some States is more precious than that of others. Nepal is proud to participate in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon peace-keeping operations and stands ready to back any move that restores to Lebanon full sovereignty over its entire territory. We are concerned about the unsatisfactory financial situation of UNIFIL and the united Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus and emphasize the responsibility of all Member States in that respect. Nepal repeats its appeal for a peaceful settlement of the problem of Cyprus and renews its firm support for the island's territorial sovereignty, integrity, independence and non-aligned character\nThe situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea are viewed with deep anxiety by Nepal. Though the past year has witnessed some new developments in the domestic situation in both of these beleaguered countries, there has been no basic shift in the prolonged presence of foreign troops. Nepal appreciates the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General and his special representative in securing a negotiated settlement - particularly in Afghanistan - where differences over the time-frame for such withdrawal have been narrowed, but not yet bridged. Nepal reiterates its resolute support for relevant General Assembly resolutions on Afghanistan and Kampuchea, including such essentials as, inter alia, withdrawal of all foreign forces and the right of the respective peoples to determine their political future without any outside interference.\nNepal believes that the potentially explosive situation in Korea needs to be defused without delay. To achieve that, it welcomes any moves for greater contact and co-operation between the two Koreas. It also believes that the peaceful reunification of Korea can best be achieved by the Korean people themselves, free from any foreign interference.\nNo review of the international situation can be objective or complete if it does not note the shameful state of affairs that exists in South Africa, where a regime of racist bigots has refined a system of ruthless exploitation against its own majority. Backed by military might, and with support from some quarters, Pretoria hurtles recklessly down the apartheid path, although there are now clear indications of doubts emerging within white South Africa itself regarding the usefulness of blindly adhering to that evil system.\nNepal is honoured to serve on the Special Committee against Apartheid and reiterates its deep conviction that the application of comprehensive and mandatory economic sanctions remains the best - and perhaps the last - means of bringing about a peaceful transition to a multiracial representative society in South Africa. Nepal was pleased to make a modest contribution to the Solidarity Fund for Southern Africa set up by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the Harare Summit to provide emergency assistance to front-line and other African States to enable them to withstand the effects of retaliatory sanctions by racist Pretoria.\nNepal is steadfast in its belief that any further delay in the granting of immediate and full independence to Namibia by South Africa is fraught with very grave danger to international peace and security. We applaud the heroic struggle of the Namibian people for independence under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization and reiterate our appeal to the international community to accelerate all efforts for the early implementation of the relevant Security Council and other United Nations resolutions on the granting of independence to Namibia.\nNepal was pleased to participate in the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking held in Vienna last June and stands fully committed to making its modest contribution to the eradication of that social scourge. I wish to state that Nepal acceded to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, as amended by the 1972 Protocol, at the Vienna Conference. Nepal has also been actively involved in tackling this social problem at the regional level by co-operating with its South Asian neighbours.\nAnother scourge of relatively recent origin is terrorism, to the elimination of which Nepal is equally committed along with its six other partners in the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) . I am pleased to inform you that SAARC experts have prepared a draft convention, which is to be considered by its standing committee in Kathmandu next month.\nI am also greatly pleased that SAARC has made further progress since I spoke here last year. At present it not only has a full-fledged secretariat, based in Kathmandu, but considerable headway has been made in developing it into an effective instrument for promoting regional co-operation for a full one-fifth of the world's population. Apart from that it is Nepal's belief that the success of SAARC can further galvanize the concept of South-South co-operation which is being promoted by, among others, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, of which Nepal is a founding member. For these reasons we in Nepal are making the necessary preparations to ensure that the next SAARC summit, to be held in Kathmandu in a few weeks, will, like the two preceding summits, achieve substantial results.\nThe international economic situation is a depressing one, with the developing\nworld facing a crisis of unprecedented dimensions. This has been characterized, inter alia, by falling commodity prices, high interest rates, protectionism and a downswing of the world economy. Owing to a combination of low global growth and the increasing complexities and uncertainties of the world economy, the urgently-needed support for the development of the developing countries has failed to materialize. What has materialized instead is the grim picture of declining commodity prices, stagnating official development assistance, and the crushing burden of the external debt of developing countries. This has exacerbated political tensions. It threatens to rip open the very fabric of society of many developing countries and constitutes a threat to international peace and security. Long-term development of developing countries thus continues to be at the mercy of the inequities of a world economic system that has clearly ceased adequately to serve the objectives of global economic and social progress.\nWhile the economic situation of the developing countries as a whole is sombre enough, that in the least developed countries merits the special concern of the international community. It is with this reality in view that my delegation attaches great importance to the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) which concluded its session in Geneva last month. Early this year, in Kathmandu, Nepal co-hosted, along with UNCTAD, a high-level meeting of governmental experts from 28 countries and representatives of four international organizations to discuss the problems of the least-developed countries in preparation for UNCTAD VII. \nMy delegation shares the view of the United Nations Secretary-General that UNCTAD-VII represented an advance in the revitalization of development, growth and international trade. We believe that the political will demonstrated by all groups in reaching consensus on the final act augurs well both for the outlook for multilateral co-operation as well as for a continuing dialogue on development. In particular, my delegation is pleased that due emphasis was given to such elements as the need for sustainable non-inflationary growth in developing countries, the responsibilities of the developed countries, a new thrust to the evolution of a growth-oriented debt strategy, the potential for renewed inter-governmental co-operation in commodities and, most of all, in the reaffirmation of the urgency of more strenuous endeavours to support the development of the least developed countries. While my delegation also welcomes the acknowledgement of the complementarity between UNCTAD and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in their efforts to promote global trade, combat protectionism and reinforce the world trading system, we sincerely hope that the expectations of the least developed countries raised by UNCTAD-VII will not meet the same fate as the unfulfilled commitments made to them under the New Substantial Programme of Action for the 1980s chalked out at the Paris Conference in 1981. Nepal also believes that due priority must be given to effective implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, adopted unanimously at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly, in 1986.\nThe speedy implementation of the New Substantial Programme of Action has special significance for Nepal which, under the wise leadership of His Majesty King Birendra, is today making all-out efforts to meet the basic needs of the people for food, shelter, clothing, primary health care, and education and security, by the end of this century. Such international assistance would be especially welcome to augment Nepal's water-resources development and the forestation efforts. Besides helping Nepal to alleviate the problem of chronic shortage of fuel, the prevention of environmental degradation of the Himalayan foothills would have a most positive impact on millions of people whose lives are greatly shaped by the rivers flowing from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal,\nRecognizing, as Nepal does, the close interdependence of the environment and economic and social development, it most warmly welcomes the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. A significant outcome of the forty-first session of the General Assembly was the adoption of many important administrative and financial reforms designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations. We have been ' greatly encouraged by the achievements thus far and believe that the process of reforms and renewal must be carried further. However, Nepal continues to believe that unilateral withholding of dues will have grave implications not only for that process but also for the future of the United Nations and multilateralism.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Nepal's unwavering commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations. I take this opportunity to underline Nepal's continuing support of the Non-Aligned Movement, which we maintain is as meaningful today as it was when it was founded more than a quarter century ago.\nI wish also to thank members of the Asian Group of the United Nations for their valuable and unanimous endorsement of Nepal's candidature for non-permanent membership in the Security Council for 1988-1989. Nepal gives its assurance that, if indeed so elected by this Assembly, it will discharge the weighty responsibilities incumbent upon such membership in a manner commensurate with the trust reposed in it. In any case, Nepal, as always, stands ready to co-operate in any endeavour that will further the lofty aims and objectives of the United Nations, convinced that it truly represents, and remains, mankind's best hope for a peaceful, prosperous and humane world.\n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, Sit, first of all to join previous speakers in conveying to you my delegation's warmest congratulations on the occasion of your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. We have particular pleasure in seeing you preside over our work since you are discharging your task so gracefully. You are once again giving proof of your eminent qualities as a diplomat. As a member of the General Committee, Cameroon can assure you of its full support in the accomplishment of your task.\nMy delegation wishes also to salute your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Choudhury, who directed the work of the General Assembly at its forty-first session with skill, firmness and courage.\nLastly, my delegation wishes to express to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar its gratitude not only for his constant efforts to improve the functioning of our Organization and to enable it to attain its objectives, but also for his dynamic contribution to the achievement and maintenance of peace in the world.\nFor a country such as Cameroon, born of the work of the United Nations, it is gratifying to note that after the more than 40 years of its existence and in spite of the countless difficulties that assail it, our Organization is still the ideal context for joint discussion between nations, large and small, rich or poor, in the political, economic, social, cultural and legal fields. In this period of increased uncertainty, this Organization is proving to be even more useful as a place for harmonizing the views of States that are in favour of establishing international relations on the basis of justice and equity. We are here to express once again Cameroon's firm commitment to the goals, purposes, principles and objectives of the Charter, which the founding fathers of the Organization established as positive norms of conduct on the part of nations.\nHere we should like to express our very strong concern with regard to everything that runs counter to those norms: the unbridled arms race, particularly in regard to nuclear weapons; the striking economic inequalities and injustices; the persistence, indeed the aggravation, of many areas of tension; the spirit of selfishness, power and domination; the rivalry of hegemony, interests and ideologies that characterize contemporary international relations. Rarely in time of peace has the world known such uncertainty.\nThere is uncertainty in particular in regard to the current economic situation and its social repercussions, which ate gradually undermining the resilience of the life of States, particularly the developing States, to the point of jeopardizing the progress patiently achieved in the search for well-being, international co-operation and peaceful coexistence.\nToday, the world is confronted by an economic crisis the most pernicious effects of which are striking the countries of the third world, particularly in Africa. This crisis has attained unprecedented proportions. Indeed, the combination of persistent protectionism and foreign trade imbalances, the slow-down in world economic activity and growth, the high level of unemployment and underemployment, the abrupt drop in the price of raw materials, the marked deterioration in the terms of trade, monetary and financial disorder, the crushing weight of external debt, are striking evidence of this crisis. \nThe long-term outlook gives no sign of definite improvement despite the hopes aroused by the attempts at economic recovery. While it is true that sustained efforts are necessary to reverse these negative trends, first of all at the national level, some types of measures require concerted action, taking into account both the solidarity among States and the special situation of the developing countries. The situation of the African countries is of the utmost concern and it is no exaggeration to say that the African continent is still the real victim of the crisis.\nAware of these difficulties, our Organization held a special session here last year to take measures to restructure the economic bases of the continent in the context of the Lagos Plan of Action and the Priority Programme of Action for the Economic Recovery of Africa.\nCameroon, which has always held that the development of Africa is first and foremost the responsibility of the African countries themselves, supports every effort to promote and strengthen regional co-operation.\nOn the national level, the Government of Cameroon has always sought to promote a sound, vigorous economy that could ensure not only growth but also harmonious development for all. Thus, in order to meet the crisis, our Government has taken measures to rationalize both structures and management. In order to have their full effect as soon as possible, these measures must be supported by a more favourable international environment.\nIn this respect there is reason to welcome the measures announced by the Seven at the Venice Summit, but it is to be hoped that those measures, which are also in line with the concerns of the United Nations, will be put into practice as soon as possible. We wish in particular to welcome the recent initiative by Canada to cancel the entire public debt of certain African countries south of the Sahara and its intention to extend this action to other countries at the next Commonwealth meeting. It is our hope that this example of solidarity may be followed by others.\nAt its seventh session, held at Geneva in July 1987, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development produced encouraging results, particularly in regard to debt, resources for development, commodities, international trade and the least developed countries. We hope that there will be fruitful discussion this session on the Secretary-General's progress report, looking towards next year's assessment of the commitments undertaken by African countries and by the developed countries in the context of the economic recovery of Africa. In view of its disastrous impact on the well-being of our peoples, the critical economic situation in Africa ought to be the only object of our concern. But, unfortunately, that is not the case, because other hotbeds of tension are igniting, growing and persisting in our continent. I am thinking of Western Sahara, Chad and, above all, southern Africa. For some time, we have seen possibilities for the peaceful settlement of the situation in Western Sahara. In that connection, we welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General to bring about the implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions. In our view, solution of the problem of Western Sahara requires the holding of a referendum on self-determination for the Sahraoui people, under United Nations auspices. \nAs concerns Chad, a neighbour of Cameroon, we have noted substantial progress since the forty-first session. The process of national reconciliation has been completed. The legitimate Government has restored the country's independence and unity. The question of the Aouzou Strip, now before the Organization of African Unity (OAU), remains outstanding. Cameroon unreservedly supports OAU efforts to reach a negotiated settlement of the conflict between Chad and Libya. My country welcomes the belligerents' acceptance of a cease-fire.\nThe OAU Ad Hoc Committee, of which Cameroon is a member, whose task is to enable the two belligerents to settle their dispute through negotiations, met last September at Lusaka at the level of Heads of State or Government. Cameroon supports without reservation the committee's recommendations, which called upon the belligerents, inter alia, to make available to it by 30 October 19t\u00ed7 at the latest all relevant documentation in support of their contentions, and to continue and strengthen the cease-fire at all levels by refraining from any action that could exacerbate the situation on the ground, including the over flight of air-space, land incursions, troop concentrations, the recruitment of foreign troops, and so forth. Cameroon urges both parties to co-operate sincerely with the OAU ad hoc committee in the speedy achievement of a lasting settlement of their dispute.\nIn southern Africa the tragedy continues. The racist regime of Pretoria, in defiance of international opinion, persists in bolstering the heinous system of apartheid. Among the manifestations of that arrogant policy of violence are arrests, massacres and the indefinite extension of the state of emergency. The travesty of elections held last May, in which only the white minority participated, clearly belies the alleged desire of the proponents of apartheid to bring about real constitutional reform in South Africa.\nBeyond its borders, racist South Africa challenges the international community and this Organization by continuing its illegal occupation of Namibia and by carrying out direct and indirect aggression against the independent countries of the region. Given that climate, one must salute the courage and clear-sightedness of the liberal white patriots who are working inside South Africa itself towards the advent of a multi-racial democratic society.\nIn the light of the deteriorating situation in Namibia and the intransigence of the Pretoria regime, we support the recommendations of the recent ministerial meeting of the United Nations Council for Namibia, which, inter alia, called upon the Secretary-General to hold consultations with the members of the Security Council, in particular its permanent members, with a view to their making a firm commitment to the unconditional and prompt implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), adopted nearly a decade ago. It goes without saying that we reiterate our support for the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the sole, authentic representative of the Namibian people.\nThere is no doubt that the situation in southern Africa poses a grave threat to international peace and security; it must be dealt with accordingly. The permanent members of the Security Council bear a special responsibility and have a vital role to play in bringing Pretoria to its senses. Those countries are committed champions of human rights and freedoms, and we hope they will shoulder their responsibilities in this case of flagrant violation of those rights and freedoms. They must ensure the success of comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions as a means of exerting pressure upon the racist regime of Pretoria. It is highly important to stress that the hatred, frustration and despair born of the situation in southern Africa could ultimately prevent national reconstruction in South Africa and the other States of the region, and will greatly reduce the chances of success for a policy of reconciliation and good-neighbourliness.\nFor our part, we firmly believe that someday South Africa will be forced to renounce its policy of violence at home and aggression abroad and will take the path charted for it by history and by the international community, the path of working towards a free, democratic and multi-racial society at home and, abroad, accepting Namibia's accession to independence and territorial integrity under the leadership of SWAPO and developing relations of co-operation and good-neighbourliness with the other countries of the region.\nOutside Africa, there are other hotbeds of tension and political and military conflicts. I am thinking of the Iran-Iraq war, and the situations in the Middle East, Latin America, Asia and other areas. In connection with those situations we support all efforts at achieving a peaceful settlement based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant United Nations resolutions.\nThe economic crisis and the hotbeds of tension I have just outlined provoke us to thought, and mobilize our energies and our resources. They also serve as a pretext for the feverish arms race. My delegation views this with extreme concern. We deplore the fact that the present trend is for the world to place its intelligence and the vast potentialities of science and technology not at the service of economic and social development, but rather at the service of the terrifying stockpiling of means of destruction which, fat from guaranteeing the future of mankind, expose it to annihilation. My country would like to appeal once again to the international community to reduce armaments and hotbeds of tension. Cameroon welcomes the agreement in principle reached between the United States and the Soviet Union to eliminate intermediate-range missiles. It should be recognized that this agreement is in line with the search for peace and security in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. It is to be hopes that more far-reaching measures will be adopted at the forthcoming meetings between the two countries. Cameroon will also welcome any other initiative which the two countries might take to increase world security and stability.\nIt is of the greatest urgency actively to promote disarmament in the interest of development. Our concern must continue to be the search for genuine peace and security so that the human, technological and financial resources now being devoted to armaments may be channelled towards economic development. The fact that a few weeks ago the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development was held here is eloquent testimony to that concern. However, it is regrettable that on the whole that Conference failed to achieve the hoped-for results.\nThe Conference did not sufficiently explore the concept of security in all its economic aspects. Need we recall that the true bases of security today are to be found in economic justice and equity? The essential concern of the developing countries remains development. The importance of security has already been demonstrated, but there can be no security without development. In today's world our security is threatened also by hunger, poverty, disease and illiteracy.\nHowever, in spite of the very meagre results achieved, the Conference rightly reaffirmed the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament. In addition, it officially recognized for the first time at the international level the close connection between disarmament and development. Most important, it very clearly demonstrated the international community's very acute awareness of and its political commitment to the survival of mankind. That primary objective must form the core of all our future debates on disarmament and development. We venture to hope that the next special session of the Assembly on disarmament will be able to examine all these ideas in greater depth.\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, setting aside rhetoric and relying on the enormous advances of science and technology, the international community must undertake a daring programme to promote disarmament, extinguish hotbeds of tension and revitalize the economic recovery of the developing countries. We must mobilize to restore balance and equity in trade, the financial field, currency, technology, industry, transport and communications.\nReforms currently being undertaken within the Organization must be directed along that path. In the final analysis, such reforms must reinforce the democratisation of international relations so that all countries may actively participate in the conduct of world affairs, on which our common destiny depends.\nThe international community has many advantages. It must become aware of the fact that the adverse effects of inadequate development do not end with the disinherited of mankind, but are continually spreading. For its part, Cameroon cherishes the hope that, with a new awareness, the peoples of the United Nations will choose survival and take the necessary practical steps, both on the political and on the economic and social levels, to ensure it.\nMay this present session begin to blaze the trail to that goal. \n"

His unanimous election to his high office clearly reflects the esteem in which he is held by the Members of our Organization. We assure him of our fullest co-operation and support, as we wish him every success in his important assignment.\nI take the opportunity also to thank his predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, for the able manner in which he conducted the affairs of the forty-first session. We extend special thanks to our Secretary-General for his efficient management of the Secretariat and for his faithful and unrelenting efforts to fulfil the mandates entrusted to him by the Assembly. In particular we commend him both for his efforts to ensure implementation of the administrative reforms required of the Organization and for his latest report, which will be guiding our work during this session of the Assembly.\nMultilateral coo-operation for the betterment of the human condition is the principal corner-stone upon which this Organization was founded over 40 years ago. In an increasingly interdependent world, nation-States must expand and pursue opportunities to advance their common and mutual interests. Such co-operation implies not only a sense of shared responsibility, but also the need for a collective response to common problems.\nThe world society which we attempt to fashion through this Organization requires the pooling of efforts where resources of individual States are inadequate, the co-ordination of policies where unilateral measures may negate one another, and the provision of a framework for decisive action where uncertainty may inhibit concrete progress. Unfortunately, seething as it is with conflicts and hostilities, our world today falls far short of this perceived ideal of a wholesome environment in which global resources are devoted largely to socio-economic development.\nWhether it be due to the bankrupt policy of apartheid in South Africa, the frustrating denial of self-determination to the people of Namibia or the persistent crises in the Middle East, the Gulf region, Asia and Central America or elsewhere, the deep hatred created by such conflicts continues to impede the will to collective responsibility and collaborative effort in their resolution. \nIt should therefore be no surprise that many of the issues before this Assembly have remained perennial agenda items, with hardly any solution in sight. In this context, the racist South African regime's persistence in the pursuit of the policy of apartheid has posed one of the most serious challenges to this Organization's declared aim: \\\"to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small\\\". There can be no doubt that apartheid also contravenes the objective of the United Nations to build a world society free from all forms of segregation and discrimination.\nThat is why my Government has consistently rejected South Africa's apartheid policy and calls upon those that give support and encouragement to the racist regime not only to consider the serious consequences of their action but also to reconsider their position on the adoption of sanctions against South Africa.\nRegardless of what is said about the merits or demerits of sanctions, the fact is that the inadequacy of the sanctions imposed thus far has apparently had the effect of rendering the racist regime all the more ruthless and intransigent in its oppression of the black majority of the population. Consequently, my Government remains convinced that the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions as provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter constitutes the last viable peaceful means of ending this ugly and explosive situation in South Africa, a situation which continues to destabilize the entire region and constitute a threat to world peace and security. My delegation takes this view not unmindful of the importance of negotiations and dialogue, but because of the long-standing refusal of the South African Government itself to meet and to negotiations with the leaders of the liberation movements.\nAs regards the related question of Namibia, Liberia cannot accept the continued defiance of the authority of the United Nations, and considers South Africa's recalcitrance to be a grave challenge to the credibility of this Organization. It is most regrettable, in this connection, that three decades after the commencement of the decolonisation process in Africa Namibia should still be languishing under the yoke of colonialism. Our frustration is further heightened by attempts on the part of the racist regime and its collaborators to insist on linking the proposed withdrawal of Cuban internationalist forces from Angola to the question of Namibia's independence.\nMy delegation therefore calls for the unconditional and complete withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia so that that Territory can at last gain its full independence, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people, and take its rightful place in this Organization and elsewhere. We submit in this connection that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the most viable basis for the attainment of this objective. There are other regional conflicts which are also the subject of continuing dialogue and negotiation within the international community. That is as it should be, since we are enjoined by the Charter to pursue the settlement of disputes by peaceful means.\nAccordingly we must commend the Secretary-General for his ongoing efforts to restore peace and stability in the Persian Gulf. The war between Iraq and Iran, which has lasted for nearly a decade, has taken a very heavy toll on human life and property, disrupted freedom of trade and navigation in the region and even escalated to the point where chemical weapons have been used against civilian targets, including women and children. We must once again urge all concerned to comply with the provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), which calls for the cessation of hostilities and the opening of negotiations between the two parties.\nIn the Middle East the question of the right of the Palestinians to a homeland and the right of Israel to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries continues to be disputed by the parties. Those rights must of course be recognized and upheld through peaceful means. In this connection an international conference on the Middle East could prove useful, provided that it facilitated the evolution of a solution acceptable to all concerned.\nWhile taking note of recent political developments in South Korea we wish also to encourage the resumption of dialogue at ministerial level towards the reunification of South and North Korea. Furthermore, my Government believes that membership in the United Nations of North and South Korea should broaden the scope for a peaceful reunification of that divided country.\nIt is a fundamental right of peoples to determine their own form of government and to choose whatever political, economic and social systems they may wish, free from outside interference or constraints of any kind equally, sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence are all inviolable attributes of nations. In this connection the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from both Kampuchea and Afghanistan should be accelerated to enable those countries to exercise fully their freedom.\nBy the same token we consider the establishment and maintenance of peace in Central America to be the prime responsibility of the Governments in that region. We therefore welcome the recent Guatemala Agreement as a useful foundation for genuine peace and stability in Central America and call on the international community to lend its fullest support to that Agreement.\nOn a similar note, my Government also invites the international community to lend its support to current initiatives of the Organization of African unity towards the peaceful resolution of the conflict between Libya and Chad,\nMost of the conflicts and hostilities ate fuelled by an arras race that is consuming a disproportionate share of the world's scarce resources. Because the international community can ill afford to continue on such a course, we welcome the historic international Conference held recently on the relationship between disarmament and development. That Conference could be viewed as a first step not just towards a safer world but also towards a more judicious utilization of the earth's resources. Having said that, my delegation believes that any appreciable level of disarmament should be buttressed by workable guarantees for States, through effective arrangements for the maintenance of international peace and security in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\nIn this connection my Government notes with satisfaction the recent agreement in principle concluded between the Governments of the United States and the Soviet Union to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons. We urge those nations to continue their negotiations to a successful conclusion. In addition to the issues of war and peace which we have highlighted here there are also a number of serious problems plaguing the global economy, problems that continue to defy and frustrate traditional solutions. In practically every forum of the world today such issues as those concerning the need for monetary and fiscal reform, the increasing volume and cost of third-world debt, the declining level of real official development assistance, the drastic fall in third-world commodity prices, spiralling inflation, the deteriorating terms of trade, the increasing protectionist tendencies of industrialized countries, are all finding their way to the very top of the agenda. These and similar problems have been generally identified with, if not considered as, the direct root causes of unemployment, sustained poverty and overall negative growth in most third-world countries.\nHowever, what is truly noteworthy, as we know, is that these problems have arisen and persisted not because the world lacks the raw materials or the technological capacity to produce enough for its growing population, which has now reached five billion and is increasing by the second, but largely because our States have as yet not been able to agree on a fairer and more rational system of managing the world's economy.\nAs some speakers before me have pointed out, the old alignments and configurations of the international economy will no longer suffice. For instance, no concept of development can be accepted today which continues to condemn the majority of the world's population to starvation, malnutrition, substandard living in conditions of despair. \nThe widening gap between rich and poor countries has often been traced to the industrial revolution and to slavery and colonialism, in which the development of industry in the Western world was said to have been facilitated in great measure by massive infusions of resources, both human and material, from what is now referred to as the third world. That, parenthetically, raises a most interesting question about the unrelenting pressures now being exerted on third-world countries to repay their debts; is there not another debt that we are forgetting, that may not have been fully repaid, or even considered?\nThe point, however, is not that industrialization did not increase the wealth of Europe and North America, or that slavery and colonial exploitation did not retard the development of the third world; the point is simply that this situation, which has remained essentially unchanged notwithstanding the great wave of decolonisation that has seen the creation of nearly 100 new independent States over the last 40 years, is no longer a tenable or acceptable proposition.\nThe traditional, almost stereotypical, division of labour which relegated third-world countries to the status of primary producers must now give way to a new arrangement that should not only enable developing countries to engage in the manufacturing of finished and semi-finished products but also require the developed economies to consume more of those products. We commend and completely agree with those, among them the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany, who have called here for the age-old one-sided relationship between developed and developing countries to be restructured.\nAs regards the role of the United Nations and its specialized agencies in economic development we must, of course, commend them for their untiring efforts in research and information, in policy analysis and practical action and in technical assistance, where they have contributed to the development activities of third\u2014world countries. Only last year the United Nations convened a special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. Since then, many African countries have undertaken strong measures to fulfil their commitments under the economic recovery and development Programme adopted at that session. For example, in its own economic recovery programme, Liberia, under the leadership of President Samuel Kanyon Doe, has embarked upon a number of measures to improve the management of the public sector, to restore to its proper place the key role of private initiative and enterprise in economic growth and development and to design strategies foe integrated rural development, with emphasis on agriculture and food self-sufficiency, through a green revolution programme.\nBut, as was recognized by the special session, the international community was expected to complement the resources and self-help efforts of third world countries for their economic recovery. Unfortunately, most donor countries have so far done very little to demonstrate, much less fulfil, their commitment to the Programme, this, my country and Government find most regrettable and disappointing.\nIndeed, our world today is over-burdened with political and territorial disputes and with serious economic and social crises, all of which threaten the very foundations of peace, security and development on our planet. In the circumstances, there can be no social responsibility more important or task more weighty than that of the search for efficient and lasting solutions to these problems. And in this onerous task our most urgent need is for strong leadership and a new vision, tempered by a greater sense of collective moral responsibility and a complete change of attitude based on a rededication to international solidarity.\nIndeed, this global village which is our common heritage will be neither a better place in which to live nor a worthy legacy to bequeath to posterity unless we can urgently return to the fundamental values of love and charity and the proposition that each one is his brother's keeper. International relations can no longer be based solely on a delicate balancing of conflicting interests, or on the unremitting and fierce competition of nations to achieve material objectives and superiority at all cost. These relations must now be founded firmly on the universally accepted principles of justice and fair play   tolerance, protection of the weak and freedom from domination by the strong. Of course, these are not new values or concepts in the United Nations.\nOver the years this Organization has emerged as the authentic voice of humanity's collective conscience. There is now, however, a dire need to strengthen our moral capacity and reinforce our political will to enable the United Nations to tackle more effectively its many complex problems, to which, in some cases, normal political approaches may not be applicable or even feasible.\nIt cannot be denied that there is a moral and ethical dimension to the struggle against ignorance, disease and poverty, against such social ills as drug abuse, prostitution, slavery, child labour and torture/ and that there is such a dimension to programmes such as those which provide for the immunization of children, better housing and Medicare for the people, a greater role for women In development, food security for all and the protection of the environment. The same humanitarian spirit as recently mobilized and co-ordinated international assistance to Ethiopia, Sudan and Mexico, among others, should now be cultivated and fully extended to other areas of need in the world.\nIn this connection, and referring again to the Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, ray delegation submits that there might be an even more poignant relationship to be considered, namely, that between disarmament and disease. Let us take the real case of the current AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) epidemic. Very soon the global effect of that deadly epidemic could reach proportions comparable only to the devastation that could result from a nuclear explosion, which knows no national boundaries. There is no doubt that much more could be done to intensify the search for a vaccine and/or a cure for the AIDS epidemic if a relatively small portion of the billions of dollars now spent on arms could be placed at the disposal of the scientific and medical community for this purpose.\nTwo other areas of concern that the United Nations could take as a moral imperative are the problem of third world debt and the combined questions of the liberation of South Africa and independence for Namibia, to which we referred earlier. For reasons already recounted here, the problem of debt truly poses a moral challenge to the developed world and to institutions for international development assistance. Nothing short of a substantial, if not total, conversion into grants of the debts owed them by third world countries may be required to enable many of these countries to survive even marginally while their serious structural problems and the inequities of the international marketplace are redressed. My delegation firmly believes that the United Nations could play a vital role in sensitising the creditor nations and institutions to the need for urgent relief action.\nAs for man's inhumanity to man, wherever found and whether it assumes the form of genocide, slavery, colonial exploitation or the displacement of peoples, it has always been morally indefensible. In this connection, the continuing existence of apartheid in South Africa constitutes an affront to the collective conscience of mankind. Regular reports and accounts of the brutal excesses of the apartheid regime contain disturbing overtones of torture camps in recent history. The world must surely act now to end apartheid. For its part, Liberia reaffirms its determination to carry on the struggle until the last vestiges of colonialism and all other forms of exploitation are removed from southern Africa and every other part of the world where such human rights abuses are found.\nIt is our fervent hope that the United Nations will continue to be not only a forum in which to engage in dialogue on global matters, but also a forum in which to galvanize our collective political will and moral courage to secure the long-term interest of mankind. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe should like you, Sir, to convey our greetings to comrade Peter Florin on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. We wish him every success in the discharge of his lofty and responsible functions.\nThe forty-second session of the General Assembly is taking place at a crucial turning-point. It is called upon to make use of all its authority in order to consolidate the positive changes in world affairs, overcome confrontational stereotypes and put into practice the new political thinking in international relations.\nThere has emerged in international affairs a certain encouraging movement towards the realization of the aspirations of the peoples of the world for the preservation of peace and the strengthening of security. These hopes have not been brought about by unfounded optimism or by wishful thinking. There has appeared on the political horizon a real prospect for achieving agreements on the most pressing problem of reducing nuclear arms and improving the international atmosphere as a whole.\nWhat exactly do we have in mind? Above all, what we have in mind is the agreement in principle between the USSR and the United States to conclude a treaty on the complete elimination of two classes of nuclear missiles: shorter-range and medium-range. For the first time in history the idea of nuclear disarmament is close to fruition. Should this very first - and hence especially difficult - step be accomplished, international relations would be placed on an entirely new footing. Such agreement would have not only a major political and military significance, but would also change the whole situation psychologically. After all, up to now there has been only a process of building up nuclear arsenals.\nSecondly, Reykjavik and the Soviet-United States talks in Washington have shown that, given political will, it is possible, in principle, to cut back substantially the strategic offensive arms of the two biggest nuclear Powers, provided that the Treaty on anti-ballistic missiles (ABM) is strictly complied with. Given a mutual desire, agreement on a 50-per-cent reduction in their strategic offensive arms could become a reality as early as the first half of 1988.\nOur optimism is bolstered by the progress made at the Geneva talks in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament, where the representatives of the countries are on the verge of concluding a convention on banning chemical weapons and destroying stockpiles of such weapons. Favourable conditions for such a change of course have been created as a result of the deliberate choice made by States in favour of restraint and self-imposed limitations. \nThe sphere of the sensible, responsible and rational organization of  international affairs is expanding, albeit timidly, before our very eyes\\\". That is the conclusion reached by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in his article \\\"The reality and the guarantees of a secure world\\\", which has been perceived by world public opinion as a doctrine of a world free from nuclear weapons and violence.\nThe article, which was timed to coincide with the opening of the session of the United Nations General Assembly, contains some anxious thoughts on what could be done, and how, by the community of nations to make peace a political reality even before the end of this century. It emphasizes that natural processes are spontaneously creating a situation where our complex and diverse world is becoming increasingly interrelated and interdependent, and this world is increasingly in need of machinery to enable us to discuss together - in a responsible fashion and at a representative level - and deal together with its common problems; and it is the United Nations that was intended to constitute such machinery. \nThe Ukrainian SSR has always supported, and continues to support, the idea of enhancing the role of the United Nations as an irreplaceable instrument of peace and harmonization of the efforts of States, as well as the idea of strengthening the political, legal and moral status of the United Nations and making its activities more democratic. Our commitment to this Organization was reaffirmed once again with the utmost clarity during the recent visit to the Ukrainian SSR by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Perez de Cuellar.\nToday, international relations cannot be built if the interests of all States are not taken into account. The balance of interests should be observed, for it alone produces sensible policies. To that end, we must therefore learn to harness our national interests to purposes common to all mankind. All this is felt especially keenly here at the United Nations.\nIn the kaleidoscope of problems posed by our times, one task stands out: to ensure the survival of mankind and save it from nuclear self-annihilation. The arms race, produced by the wrong-headed strategy of nuclear deterrence and containment, is crippling the life of civilization on Earth; it consumes annually nearly $1 trillion - funds so badly needed to ease the plight of hundreds of millions of people suffering from poverty, hunger and disease.\nIs it possible that, at the end of the twentieth century, we will allow the clangour of the anvils that are forging the weapons to drown out the voice of reason and warning? Is it really possible that we are incapable of combining the capabilities and the will of States and peoples in order to rid mankind of the prospect of total destruction?\nFor the sake of the survival of mankind, for the sake of its salvation and development, for the sake of the life of present and succeeding generations, it is imperative that all the strength, authority and influence of the United Nations be devoted to the cause of creating a nuclear-free and non-violent world.\nOutside the movement towards a nuclear-free and non-violent world - and this is our profound conviction - there is not and cannot be any path to the progress of mankind. This conclusion underlies the new political thinking, which we believe is meeting with the understanding of all sensible men and women. The looming danger of the destruction of civilization makes it imperative, indeed vital, for diverse social and political forces to unite and create a coalition of political realism, reason and good will.\nThe new political thinking and the foreign policy that goes with it, which is based on an objective analysis of the world of today, presuppose a sober and judicious view of the diversity of forces that make up world politics, and emanate from the awareness of the responsibility for the survival of mankind. They are oriented towards the development and building of trust among nations, towards the actual implementation of the principle of the peaceful coexistence of States as the supreme universal norm in relations between nations. An important step in that direction would be the adoption by the forty-second session of the General Assembly of a declaration on the renunciation of the threat or use of force in international relations.\nIt was the criterion of common human values that guided the socialist States, including the Ukrainian SSR, when they proposed in the United Nations the initiative to establish a comprehensive system of international peace and security. The co-sponsors of the proposal proceeded from the principle of the indivisibility of international security, which cannot but be global and equal for all and which must encompass the military, political, economic, environmental and humanitarian spheres. Such a security system would lead to the building of a nuclear-free world, where the threat or the use of force would be ruled out and relations among nations would be built in a spirit of mutual respect, friendship and co-operation. The ongoing broad exchange of views in the United Nations on these matters confirms the fact that the socialist countries' initiative is aimed at surmounting confrontational approaches and establishing civilized norms of relations and an atmosphere of mutual understanding and trust in the practice of international affairs.\nThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR is in favour of continuing and developing constructive international dialogue, for the purpose or jointly searching for ways and means of shaping a comprehensive system of international peace and security and adopting concrete measures to provide material, political, legal, moral and psychological safeguards for a world free from the nuclear threat. What the socialist countries are proposing to the world community is not a short-term concept but a long-term, rational programme that invites everyone to strive for peaceful and mutually beneficial international relations. The Ukrainian SSR expresses the hope that the United Nations will make a substantial contribution to the establishment of a comprehensive system of international peace and security, in strict compliance with the Organization's purposes and principles and on the basis of its Charter, and will act as that system's effective and authoritative guarantor.\nThus, the concept of security, as we see it, is both a new political and philosophic vision of the age which mankind has entered and a programme of concrete actions to ensure practical movement towards a nuclear-free and non\u2014violent world and - from the historical standpoint - towards a demilitarised world. Arms limitation and disarmament undoubtedly form a foundation for the edifice of general security. On 15 January 1986 the Soviet Union proposed a programme to rid the world of nuclear weapons. This document contains clear-cut stages stretching to the year 2000 - a world without means of mass destruction,- a peaceful outer space, the restriction of the military potentials of States to the limits of reasonable sufficiency. Its significance lies in the fact that it marks the beginning of the process of merging new political thinking with practice.\nWe proceed from the belief that it is impossible to resolve completely the questions of nuclear disarmament within the sole framework of relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America, Here, the United Nations - which, I must say, plays a unique role in the movement towards a nuclear-weapon-free world - can and should make an important contribution\u00b7 The Ukrainian SSR would like to see the most made of the Organization's potential for that purpose, putting to use all existing negotiating mechanisms, including such an important body as the Security Council\u00b7\nThe question of banning nuclear tests occupies a special place in the whole range of nuclear disarmament problems\u00b7 The critical need to resolve that question is explained by the fact that the reduction of nuclear arsenals cannot in itself, without the banning of nuclear--weapon tests, solve the problem, since it leaves open the possibility of modernizing the remaining part of such weapons - that is of developing ever-more-sophisticated and deadly nuclear weapons. Hence, a nuclear-test ban is a concrete step towards the genuine elimination of nuclear arms.\nThe document entitled \\\"Basic Provisions of a Treaty on the General and Complete Prohibition of Nuclear Tests\\\", submitted by the socialist countries at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, provides good opportunities for constructive talks on this subject- The delegation of the Ukrainian USSR believes that dealing with this question in practical terms as soon as possible would be in keeping with the will of the overwhelming majority of States. We hail the agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States to start before 1 December full-scale negotiations on the limitation and, ultimately, the total cessation of nuclear tests.\nThe agreement signed between the Soviet Union and the United States on the establishment of nuclear-risk-reduction centres deserves our approval. The Ukrainian SSR supports the Secretary-General's proposal for the establishment of a multilateral centre to reduce the threat of war. In our view, a direct communication line linking United Nations Headquarters with the capitals of the permanent members of the Security Council and the place where the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement is located could serve the same purpose. \nThe socialist States propose a peaceful alternative to counter irrational bids for nuclear supremacy. The Ukrainian SSR calls upon all countries to take an active part in implementing the programme to establish an international regime for the safe development of nuclear energy production, which provides for a whole series of material, scientific and technological measures, supplemented by international legal norms and agreements. The programme could prevent people from making errors and from incurring incidents fraught with dire consequences for their life and health .\nThe prevention of an arms race in outer space is yet another concern for all mankind. Preparations for \\\"Star Wars\\\" should not be allowed to become irreversible and to create insurmountable obstacles to disarmament. We are convinced that the strategic defence initiative programme is disastrous. This is recognized by many people, including people in the United States. The strategic defence initiative is an exclusively militaristic programme designed to gain military superiority and undermine strategic stability in the world.\nIn this key area the lack of realistic policies is particularly severe. Concrete actions are needed\u00b7 First, the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems, which is the corner-stone of strategic stability, should be strictly complied with.\nIt is time for the talks on concluding an agreement or agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space to begin at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The objective of the talks could be agreements on such problems as the prohibition of weapons systems of the space-to-space and space-to-Earth type, the non-development of new anti-satellite weapons and the elimination of existing weapons of this type, and guarantees of the immunity of man-made Earth satellites. It is also necessary to concentrate efforts on solving as soon as possible another urgent problem - ridding the world of chemical weapons. I have already said that promising progress has been made at the talks within the framework of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. The proposals put forward there recently by various States clear the way to agreement. The proposal to proceed on the basis of the need to make legally binding the principle of mandatory challenge inspections without the right of denial is a concrete contribution to the success of the talks.\nWe reiterate our support for the initiatives taken by the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania to establish zones free from chemical weapons in Central Europe and the Balkans.\nThe movement towards genuine security through disarmament presupposes, in addition to the elimination of the weapons of mass destruction, urgent agreed on reductions in conventional arms and armed forces. The socialist countries have repeatedly stated their readiness to go as far as other countries are prepared to go on this question. As will be recalled, to confirm their readiness they made specific proposals in June 1986 on a substantial reduction of armed forces and armaments in Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals, subject to far-reaching verification.\nThe co-ordination and implementation of exhaustive measures for international control over disarmament and permitted military activities, including verification at foreign military bases, and the adoption by all nuclear Powers of defensive military doctrines would make it possible radically to consolidate confidence among States.\nThe Ukrainian SSR supports the initiative of the Polish People's Republic for a reduction of armaments and a strengthening of trust in central Europe, known as the Jaruzelski plan. I emphasize our conviction that the release of financial resources and intellectual potential for the purposes of social and economic development, including that of developing countries, should form an integral part of all disarmament measures. We believe that every step on the way to arms reduction should not only increase the security of nations but also provide more resources for raising the standards of living of the peoples. Our position was clearly reflected in the memorandum \\\"Disarmament for development\\\" submitted by the socialist countries at the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development.\nThe edifice of peace cannot be solid if any part of it is not covered by the security system. That is why the Ukrainian SSR is firmly in favour of settling conflict situations and eliminating regional focuses of tension.\nParticularly prominent among them is the Middle East conflict, one of the oldest and most explosive hotbeds of international tension. The development of the situation in the Middle East has made abundantly clear the failure of reliance on military force, confrontation or separate deals. Genuine settlement is possible only through the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied since 1967, the exercise by the people of Palestine of their inalienable right to self-determination and to the establishment of their own independent State, and a guarantee of the right of all countries in the region to secure existence and development. The convening, under United Nations auspices, of a plenipotentiary international Middle East conference, with the participation, on an equal footing, of all the parties concerned, including the PLO as the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and the permanent members of the Security Council, would be a reasonable and correct way to bring about a just peace in the region. A broad international consensus has emerged in favour of convening such a conference. The position of the present Israeli Government is the only stumbling-block.\nIt is at the negotiating table that political solutions to the issues between Iran and Iraq and an end to the fratricidal war between them should be sought.\nThe build-up by the United States and some other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries of a massive naval presence in the relatively confined area in which the war is raging is fraught with unpredictable grave consequences.\nThe Ukrainian SSR supports implementing Security Council resolution 598 (1987) in full, maintaining and consolidating on that basis the unity of action of its permanent members. We attach particular significance to political efforts within the United Nations framework to switch the Iran-Iraq conflict onto the track of a peaceful solution. We believe that the Secretary-General can play a big part in finding a just settlement acceptable to both sides. \nThe interests of universal security, like the vital interests of the Cypriot people, urgently require collective international efforts to remedy the crisis situation in Cyprus. The proper way to resolve this problem, as we see it, would be to call, within the United Nations framework, a representative international conference which would be in a position to work out essential components of an agreement such as the demilitarisation of the island and the establishment of a system of effective international guarantees of the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. We support the good offices mission of the Secretary-General and the active role of our Organization in this matter. \nThe Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic shares the anxiety of the world community about the explosive situation in Central America, We strongly demand that an end be put to the United States Administration's interference in the affairs of Nicaragua, and declare our firm solidarity with the just struggle of the Nicaraguan people. It is possible to attain mutually acceptable solutions in that region, as is conclusively borne out by the agreements reached by the Central American States concerning ways of securing lasting peace in the region. \nIt would be in the interests of international peace and security to settle promptly the conflict in southern Africa, which continues to be a dangerous hotbed of tension. The apartheid regime in South Africa is stepping up its repression of the country's indigenous population, pursuing its strategic course of destabilizing the front-line States, bringing military and political pressure to bear upon them, and is continuing its occupation of Namibia. It is not merely changes by way of so-called reforms but rather a complete and definitive elimination of apartheid that is the indispensable condition for achieving peace and security in the region. The Ukrainian SSR strongly supports the call by African States for the introduction of all-embracing mandatory sanctions against the racist regime of South Africa, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\nA good basis for normalizing the situation in South-East Asia is the realistic proposal by Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea for the establishment of a zone of lasting peace, stability and co-operation in the region. The national reconciliation policy launched by the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea would facilitate the early and real attainment of those goals.\nThe Ukrainian SSR associates itself with the course advocated by the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, namely the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea and the reunification of the country on a democratic basis, without outside interference. We fully support the proposal by the People's Democratic Republic of Korea to turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free zone.\nWe have dwelt on just a few hotbeds of tension. Their elimination and the prevention of new crises and conflicts at the regional and global levels is part and parcel of efforts to shape a comprehensive system of international peace and security. An important part of that, concept relates to the economic aspects. Changes in the world economy and in international economic relations, like changes in the political sphere, are characterized by their growing interrelationship.\nThis is where the interdependence of States is likely to manifest itself most conspicuously, yet# given the existing international economic order, the consequences of that interrelationship affect various countries in a hideously lopsided way, grossly infringing the elementary notions of equality, justice and honesty. Some reap billion-dollar profits while others are slipping further into the abyss of economic and financial collapse. All this is fraught with the most serious political implications.\nThe existence in international economic relations of such potentially explosive elements as non-equivalent exchanges, the bondage of debt and other forms of neo-colonialist plundering of the developing nations involves a real danger of upheavals that could jeopardize universal peace\u00b7\nWe believe that an important contribution to the ensuring of international security could be made by measures designed to bring under control the process of economic interdependence of States, measures that would ensure predictability and stability in inter-State relations and ultimately ensure the safe and mutually beneficial character of world economic exchanges. To fulfil that task, all countries of the world, big and small, industrialized and developing, irrespective of their social systems and levels of development, should unite their efforts and work together.\nThe co-operation of States in the environmental and humanitarian spheres is an integral part of the process a moulding a comprehensive system of security. It is inadmissible to extend ideological differences to international relations or to use the problem of human rights and social development for the purposes of fomenting confrontation, just as it is inadmissible to apply double standards.\n.We call on all States Members of the United Nations to be guided in their policies by the primacy of common human values and international law, to resolve disputes through negotiation/ and to rid themselves of the burden of confrontation and suspicion.\nThe Ukrainian SSR intends to co-operative actively with other States in ensuring world peace and security, in a spirit of good will and in the awareness of the joint responsibility for the future of human civilization. That position is fully in conformity with the historic purposes and principles of the foreign policy of the Soviet State, whose seventieth anniversary will be celebrated on 7 November this year.\nIn our minds, in our hearts, the socialist Revolution of 1917 is a matter of supreme national pride for the Soviet people. The Revolution gave rise to unprecedented enthusiasm and a creative vigour on the part of the broad masses of people and became the finest hour for the victorious people who had done away, once and for all, with the exploitation of man by man. Scores of years have gone by since unemployment was eliminated in our land. We have no oppression of ethnic minorities, no poverty, no illiteracy. The working people live in confidence that they are protected by society; they live in confidence about their future.\nThe Great October Revolution continues even today in our deeds. In the Ukrainian SSR, as throughout the Soviet Union, a splendid process of perestroika is under way in all fields of life, for the purpose of accelerating the economic and social development of our socialist society.\nIt is highly symbolic that the first legislative act of the Soviet State was the Decree of Peace. Our new political thinking as applied to foreign policy and our conduct in the international arena are linked integrally with Lenin's behest about a democratic and just world. As the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine, Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, stressed: \\\"In carrying out that behest, our party and the Soviet State do everything they can to preserve and strengthen peace and to improve the complex and often explosive international situation.\\\"\nThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR is convinced that the participants in this forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly will raise their voices in favour of such a way of acting and that the General Assembly itself will become a place and a school for co-operation and collaboration on the part of States in devising a concept of security for all, security in keeping with the realities of the nuclear and space age.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic would like at the outset to congratulate Ambassador Peter Florin on his outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the present session. In choosing him for that post the international community has paid a tribute both to his excellent qualities as a diplomat and to the tireless efforts of his country, the German Democratic Republic, for peace and disarmament in Europe and throughout the world. My delegation is convinced that under his wise and able guidance the work of this session will be successful.\nThe Lao delegation wishes also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his tireless and innovative efforts to strengthen regional and international peace and security and to promote and revitalize international economic co-operation for development.\nThis session is of great significance for us since it coincides with the seventieth anniversary of the great October revolution, which opened a new era in the history of mankind, an era which has created conditions conducive to the national liberation struggle, enabling many peoples to free themselves from colonialism, to attain independence and sovereignty and to become full-fledged members of the community of nations.\nThe international climate and environment in which this session is taking place, if not better than at the last session, are none the less characterized by the optimism aroused by the agreement in principle reached recently by the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union and the Secretary of State of the United States of America on the total elimination of those countries' medium-range and short-range nuclear missiles. The conclusion of such a bilateral agreement would be a very important initial measure of arms reduction and nuclear disarmament. The enthusiasm with which all mankind has welcomed this positive event is all the more understandable since the unbridled arms race - in particular, the nuclear-arms race - not only damages its well-being but also jeopardizes its very survival. \u2116at is a fact that can be a secret to no one.\nThe Lao Government reiterates its condemnation of any military doctrine seeking security not through disarmament but through military and strategic superiority and nuclear deterrence. Such doctrines ignore the realities of the present-day world, which has become increasingly interdependent and in which, in this nuclear and space age, security can only be global and equal for all countries and peoples, irrespective of their size, their social and economic system and their level of development. It is therefore vital that the international community contribute actively to the development and establishment of a general system of international peace and security encompassing the political, military, economic, humanitarian and ecological fields.\nThe Lao Government is pleased at the positive results achieved by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which was held here less than a month ago. The arms race must come to an end on earth and everything possible must be done to prevent its spread to outer space if we want considerable resources to be released and then reallocated to the economic and social development of all peoples, in particular the peoples of the developing countries.\nThe Lao People's Democratic Republic wishes in that context to reaffirm its support for all the peace and disarmament initiatives put forward to date by the socialist countries, among them the general programme of security for disarmament adopted last January by the Soviet Union with a view to ridding the world of nuclear weapons and all types of weapons of mass destruction by the year 2000. Many peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America still confront the disastrous consequences of tension and conflict caused by the interventionist and aggressive policies of imperialism, colonialism, racism, apartheid and Zionism.\nIn southern Africa, the racist regime of Pretoria pursues with impunity its policy of oppression and repression of the black majority population, as well as its acts of aggression against the front-line countries. It is perpetuating its illegal occupation of Namibia and committing barbaric acts of repression against the Namibian people. The Lao Government reaffirms its unswerving support for the struggle of the South African people, under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa, for the recovery of their basic human rights and for that of the Namibian people, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization, its sole authentic representative, in its heroic struggle for self-determination and national independence. \nIt condemns the policy of so-called constructive engagement and that of linkage, which would bind the independence of Namibia to an unrelated issue; the withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist troops from Angola. Namibia cannot attain its independence outside the context of the conditions set out in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The Lao Government reiterates its firm support for the front-line States in their persistent struggle to safeguard their independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nIn the Middle East, the situation remains tense. Settlement of the Middle East crisis, at the heart of which is the question of Palestine, cannot be achieved without the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem. It is regrettable that Washington and Tel Aviv still oppose the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of the Soviet Union, the United States and all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The Lao People's Democratic Republic will always unswervingly support the Palestinian people which, under the resolute guidance of the FLO, its sole and authentic representative, is waging a heroic struggle against the Zionist aggressor and occupier for the recovery and exercise of its inalienable rights, including the right to establish its own state in Palestine.\nIn connection with the Iran-Iraq conflict, the Lao Government welcomes the adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) , inviting those two countries to put an immediate end to their devastating hostilities and to begin negotiations with a view to finding a solution that is just and acceptable to the  two parties. The international community has for some days now been witnessing an aggravation of the situation in the Persian Gulf. The tragic incident that occurred last week is a sad reminder of the incident in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964.\nThe peoples of Central America have long aspired to live in peace and harmony, in friendship and mutual co-operation.\nAs regards Nicaragua, tranquillity can be restored only if the Government of the United States of America puts an end to all acts of aggression and destabilization, and ceases opposing the peace process promoted by the Contadora Group and supported by the Lima Group and made explicit in the peace plan adopted by the Heads of State of the five countries of Central America last August in Guatemala.\nPanama, whose people has fought unceasingly to preserve its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, is also a victim of interference in its internal affairs by the imperialist powers. We continue to support its struggle and the struggles of the other peoples of the region for self-determination, independence and genuine democracy in their respective countries.\nThe region of south-west Asia has not yet experienced genuine peace. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan remains the victim of an undeclared war waged by the aggressive circles of imperialism and regional and international reactionary forces. We support the Geneva process of indirect negotiations and firmly support the programme of national reconciliation which the Afghan Government adopted at the beginning of this year. If implemented in good faith by all the parties concerned, that programme would make a decisive contribution to a political, comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the situation surrounding that country. \nThe international community is still witnessing the tension that prevails in the region of the Indian Ocean due to the intensification of activities at the Diego-Garcia air and naval base and the strengthening of the imperialist military presence there. It is highly desirable that the international conference on the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, delayed once again because of the hostile attitude of certain countries, be convened no later than 1990. The situation in Asia and the Pacific also is one of increased tension because of the neo-globalist policy pursued by an imperialist super-Power, which has resulted in the concentration of troops and nuclear arsenals in South Korea and certain other countries of the region. In addition to posing a threat to the peace and security of the peoples of the region, the situation of course jeopardizes their legitimate aspirations to co-operation and well-being.\nThe Lao Government associates itself with the efforts of the international community to transform the Asia-Pacific region into a nuclear weapon-free zone. In this context, it reaffirms its support for the proposals made by Comrade Mikhail Gorbachev, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, at Vladivostok in July 1986, for the recent proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for progressive disarmament in the two parts of Korea, and also for the Rarotonga Declaration.\nThe peoples of South-East Asia, like those of other parts of the world, have long fervently aspired to a happy and prosperous existence free of conflicts and tension. But unfortunately the aggressive forces of imperialism and international and regional reaction have done all in their power to prevent realization of those noble aspirations. It is a secret to no one that Laos, Viet Nam and Kampuchea have worked sincerely for peace, stability and co-operation in South-East Asia and to make the area a nuclear weapon-free zone. They therefore reaffirm all the constructive and realistic proposals they have thus far put forward toward that \nThe situation surrounding my country has not yet been one of genuine peace# in spite of the efforts that the Lao Government has made to achieve that end. The two rounds of negotiations held in past months in Vientiane and Bangkok to resolve the question of the sovereignty of the three Lao villages - an issue which the United Nations Security Council considered in 1984 - did not provide any final solutions. Worse still, last August other border incidents occurred in the same region and for the same reasons, thus making the situation at the Lao-Thai border even more tense. The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic expresses its deep concern at this situation and, with a view to the restoration of good-neighbourly relations as soon as possible, appeals to the Government of Thailand to show its goodwill by deciding as soon as possible to resume negotiations with the Lao side, as we have proposed.\nThe Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea has firmly pursued its noble cause of national renewal and rehabilitation. The successes that it has won in this long-standing endeavour have been significant. Hence, taking the foregoing into account and moved by a spirit of exemplary generosity, the Phnom Penh Government recently made a public declaration on its policy of national reconciliation, in which all Kampucheans - with the exception of Pol Pot and his close collaborators - without any discrimination whatsoever based on ethnic or social origin, political opinion or religious belief, are invited to Unite for the building of a progressive, egalitarian and just society in an independent, peaceful and non-aligned Kampuchea, enjoying friendly relations with all countries, in particular its neighbours.\nIn this spirit, the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea have agreed to carry out in the very near future another partial withdrawal of Vietnamese volunteer troops from Kampuchea, an operation which representatives of a certain number of Governments, eminent personalities and the mass media will be invited to attend as observers. This policy, which is in line with the general trends of our day and the needs of all Kampucheans who want to see their homeland prosper, deserves the active support of the international community.\nIt is regrettable that certain countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) persist in supporting the so-called Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea with its eight-point proposal, knowing full well that that is an unnatural alliance. Internal contradictions, conflicts of interest and squabbles, which are a constant feature of that heterogeneous Coalition, have meant that the latter is at present devoid of leadership. Therefore that Government is nothing but a fiction kept alive by certain countries and circles to serve their own interests by bringing about a return to power in Kampuchea of the genocidal Pol Pot clique. It is time for the leaders of those countries and circles to agree to face the facts and respect, first and foremost, the agreement signed in Ho Chi Minh City in July 1987 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, representing the ASEAN countries, and his Vietnamese counterpart, representing the countries of Indo-China.\nPeace and security are meaningful for a people only if accompanied by tangible guarantees of well-being; hence the capital importance that the international community attaches to the economic aspect of security. It must be noted with regret that in this respect the gap between the rich and the poor countries has only widened, and this is due solely to the fact that the developed market economy countries are still refusing to renounce their selfish interests. Has the time not come for them to rethink their short-sighted policy and join in the efforts of the international community to find an effective remedy to the present world economic crisis, from whose harsh impact they, too, suffer? \nIn this spirit we recognize that the reasonably positive results of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) held last July in Geneva, should temper our pessimism. We are pleased with the harmonious development of relations between our country and essential United Nations agencies entrusted with international co-operation for development. In this regard we pay tribute to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)# whose role as a catalyst made possible the success of the Second Round-Table Conference# held under its sponsorship in April of last year.\nMy country pays tribute to the fervour and dedication with which the United Nations is endeavouring to accomplish its noble task of maintaining and strengthening international peace and security and guaranteeing to all peoples on earth a future of well-being, freedom, justice, equality and prosperity  All those ideals are doomed to failure if we do not participate resolutely and sincerely in the crusade against the socio-economic, political and other ills afflicting the majority of the world's population. Those ills are: poverty; hunger; disease; illiteracy; imperialist; colonialist and Zionist aggression; apartheid; economic plundering; and so on\u00b7 The elimination of those military and non-military threats to the security of peoples is imperative if we are to fashion progressively a world free of violence and nuclear weapons\u00b7 New ways of thinking and political reflection - in a word, a new vision of the world - should also be adopted by all the States of the world.\nIt is in that spirit that the Lao Government undertakes to join in the international community's efforts to create conditions conducive to the building of such a world. The Lao delegation hopes that this guiding principle will be given the attention it deserves at this session.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffYour election, Sir, to the high post of President: the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly gives me the pleasant occasion to extend to you my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes of full success in the accomplishment of the mission entrusted to you.\nI feel especially honoured to present from the rostrum of this high forum the considerations and proposals of the President of Romania, Nicolae Ceau\u00e7escu, on the main issues of international life and on the ways to solve them, in accordance with the interests and aspirations for peace, independence and progress of the Romanian people, and indeed of all peoples of the world.\nAnalysis of the evolution of international life reveals a picture which is utterly disquieting. The world situation continues to be particularly serious and complex. The arms race has assumed disturbing proportions. Nuclear tests aimed at the steady development of weapons of mass destruction are still going on. This has harmful effects on the natural environment and, in fact, on life on earth. At the same time, far from diminishing, the conflicts  crises and hotbeds of tension in various regions of our planet have even worsened, thus generating new threats to the peace and security of mankind.\nThe policy of force, of threat of force and gross interference in the Internal of other States continues unabated. These manifestations are incompatible with the principles and norms of international law, morality and ethics. Furthermore, the world economic crisis has become more serious and more profound, affecting all States. Its adverse effects are being felt primarily by developing countries, whose situation is already tragic.\nIn the view of Romania, and President Nicolae Ceausescu, the sole, compelling alternative at present is to reverse the dangerous course of events and bar the road which leads to a nuclear catastrophe. A new world war is inconceivable, for it would mean the practical annihilation of life on our planet. Hence the need to renounce, once and for all, the wrong and outdated conception upheld by some nuclear-weapon States that nuclear weapons strengthen security and contribute to the maintenance of peace.\nRomania considers that the fundamental problem of our era is to halt the arms race and pass on resolutely to disarmament, in particular nuclear disarmament, to defend the supreme right of peoples and individuals alike to peace, life, and a free and dignified existence.\nIn its overall international activities Romania devotes all its efforts to a permanent dialogue and wider and more diversified contacts with all States, irrespective of their social system. Firmly underlying all its relations are the principles of full equality of rights, respect for national independence and sovereignty, the non-use of force or the threat of force, non-interference in the internal affairs and mutual benefit.\nIn view of the unprecedented scope attained by the arms race, in particular the nuclear-arms race, and the need for determined measures in the field of disarmament, we deem it necessary for the Assembly to give these issues top priority at the present session. We believe that all States must intensify their endeavours and actions in order to achieve this objective.\nRomania and President Nicolae Ceausescu propose that the General Assembly launch an appeal to the Soviet Union and the United States, since their positions are very close, to conclude without delay, as of this year, an agreement on the elimination of all medium- and shorter-range missiles from Europe and the whole world.\nAt the same time, the General Assembly should call upon the countries that have nuclear weapons on their territory to renounce them and refrain from raising obstacles of any kind to the achievement of an agreement. Furthermore, all countries in Europe and elsewhere in the world should be called upon to act resolutely in order to achieve such an agreement this year. We welcome the recent Soviet-American understanding in principle in this respect and express our hope that the accord will be signed at the summit meeting to take place in the autumn of this year.\nTaking into account that nuclear tests are stepping up the arms race while having damaging effects on the environment, the General Assembly should address an appeal, primarily to the United States and the Soviet Union, but also to the other nuclear-weapon States, to halt nuclear testing and any other activities designed to develop and improve nuclear weaponry. Similarly, all the States of the world should be called upon to undertake to use nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes, for the benefit of humanity at large.\nWhile according priority attention to matters relating to nuclear disarmament, Romania holds the view that resolute and tangible measures are also needed to reduce conventional armaments, troops and military expenditures, which this year topped $1,000 billion for the world as a whole.\nConsistent with its proposals in recent years in this field, Romania proceeded to a unilateral reduction of its weapons, troops and military expenditures by 5 per cent, following a national referendum in which practically all the people took part. In this way, the Romanian people asserted its will and determination to act unflinchingly in favour of disarmament and peace. In our view, the adoption of unilateral disarmament measures by States would constitute a practical way of passing from words to deeds and making real progress towards general disarmament. In the same spirit of a new approach to disarmament problems which requires that all possible avenues be explored, Romania considers it necessary for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Warsaw Treaty countries to start as soon as possible negotiations on conventional disarmament, with the participation of other countries of the European continent.\nBearing in mind the increased role that the United Nations should assume, Romania proposes that the General Assembly take action to prepare and finalize a complex programme of nuclear and general disarmament, to be submitted for adoption at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, scheduled to be held in 1988. The programme should lay down measures for the phased elimination of all nuclear weapons and the substantial reduction of conventional weapons, troops and military expenditures, as well as for the prohibition of the production of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. We believe that this programme should specify the need for the various problems and issues relating to nuclear and conventional disarmament to be resolved independently, without some being conditional upon others.\nFollowing the same line of thought, Romania believes that the preparation and adoption by the United Nations of an international document setting forth the principles that should govern negotiations among States on freezing and reducing military expenditures would have a stimulating effect on the efforts of the world community in the field of disarmament. It is of special importance to halt any measures designed to militarise outer space, which should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes in the interest of all mankind. As the great number of satellite launchings have harmful effects on the natural environment of life on Earth, we propose that the General Assembly address an appeal to all countries launching satellites to limit such launchings.\nLikewise, we propose that the General Assembly call upon all States of the world to start early negotiations to regulate the use of outer space for peaceful purposes only, and to establish a rational system for its use as an asset of all mankind.\nThe interests of international peace and security make it increasingly necessary to set up nuclear- and chemical-weapon-free zones, for developing good neighbourliness, mutual understanding and co-operation. It is in this spirit that Romania takes consistent action towards turning the Balkans into a zone of good neighbourliness, peace and co-operation, free of nuclear and chemical weapons, foreign troops and military bases. In this respect, it is of special significance to recall the recent proposals advanced jointly by Romania and Greece to convene in Bucharest a high-level meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Balkan countries.\nEqually, Romania upholds the setting up of nuclear- and chemical-weapon-free zones in northern and central Europe, as well as on other continents. We consider it necessary for the United Nations to encourage initiatives designed to establish such zones, including nuclear-weapon-free cities and towns on various continents. Such moves are likely to strengthen confidence and security at the regional and world levels.\nAgainst the background of the ever-closer interdependence that characterizes today's world, and bearing in mind the evolution of international events, Romania proposes that the United Nations address a general appeal to all States in conflict to bring their military operations to an end. It should also call upon all States to proceed to the settlement of all pending issues and disputes between them by peaceful means, through negotiations. The General Assembly should call for the cessation of any form of military operations during negotiations, from their beginning.\nThe Security Council, or a United Nations special body, should be empowered \u042c monitor the implementation of obligations assumed as to the cessation of military activities throughout the negotiations and to ensure the solution of the issues through negotiations.\nAs regards the situation in the Middle East, the stand and the actions taken by Romania and its President are consistently aimed at ensuring a global, just and durable peace, based on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, on recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to set up a Palestinian State, and on a guarantee of the independence and sovereignty of all States in the region. We consider that a realistic way of bringing peace to the Middle East is to convene an international conference on the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations, to be attended by all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Israel and the permanent members of the Security Council. We believe that such a historic chance for the much tried region of the Middle East finally to find its tranquillity and peace should not be missed.\nWith regard to the Iran-Iraq conflict, Romania welcomed the Security Council resolution which favours the cessation of the war without delay and a political settlement, by means of negotiations, of all the issues between the two countries. We also support the action of the Secretary-General in this matter. We stand firmly for the renunciation of all acts conducive to an extension of the conflict. It is imperative to withdraw all foreign military ships from the Gulf, to step up efforts towards the cessation of the Iran-Iraq war and to ensure free navigation in that region, as well as in all other oceans and seas of the world.\nSimilarly, Romania supports any actions and initiatives favouring peaceful solutions to the conflict situations in Central America as, indeed, in other regions of the world. In this context, we believe it necessary for the General Assembly to work out the mandate for finalizing the initiative which Romania took at preceding sessions on resort to a United Nations commission of good offices, mediation or conciliation for the peaceful settlement of disputes. We also think it necessary to start the elaboration of an international document on the development and strengthening of good-neighbourly relations between States and to devise methods conducive to the strengthening of the United Nations role and capacity to work for the maintenance of international peace and security.\nConsistent with its policy, Romania firmly upholds the peoples' national liberation struggle, and lends its active support to the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in its fight for Namibia's independence. We strongly condemn the racist, apartheid policy of South Africa and that country's hostile acts against neighbouring independent and sovereign States. We favour the taking of tangible and effective actions against the Pretoria racist minority regime.\nWe reaffirm our solidarity with, and active support for, the position and initiatives taken by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and its political and diplomatic efforts and actions aimed at bringing about the peaceful, democratic and independent unification of Korea.\nIn the present conditions of the world economy, which is beset by continued crisis phenomena both in the economic and the monetary-financial fields, the economic situation of developing countries has worsened considerably, while the economic, technical and scientific gaps separating them from developed countries have continued to widen. We have recently witnessed a proliferation of protectionist and discriminator barriers to international trade, in particular to the exports of manufactured products from developing countries, coupled with a decline in the prices of their export commodities. However, the most serious problem faced by developing countries is the burden incurred by their foreign debts, the value of which has now reached the colossal figure of 1,000 billion dollars.\nTherefore, President Nicolae Ceausescu considers that the General Assembly should adopt an appeal to be addressed to all creditor developed countries and to all banks and international financial institutions to the effect that they should establish a moratorium of at least five years on all credits given to developing countries by the economically developed countries and by banking institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.\nThe appeal should include a demand that a ceiling of not more than 5 per cent be fixed for rates of interest on existing credits. It should also ask that the principle be established that rates of interest on future credits should not exceed 4 to 5 per cent; that banks, in their turn, should pay interest of up to 5 per cent on their respective deposits; and that commercial credits should be repaid in compliance with such norms and understandings as are agreed between the parties. \nAt the same time, the General Assembly should make an appeal to all States to renounce any protectionist and discriminatory measures, any artificial barriers and any restrictions and quotas in the field of international trade, and to apply firmly the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on the granting of most-favoured-nation treatment.\nThe situation of the world economy calls for a resumption of the dialogue between developing countries and industrialized countries. In this respect Romania has proposed that an international conference be convened within the United Nations, to be attended, with equal rights, by both developed and developing countries. Such a conference should have the purpose of seeking mutually acceptable solutions to the economic problems, including that of foreign debts, in order to eliminate underdevelopment and establish the new international economic order.\nTo increase the United Nations role and contribution to the political and economic settlement of the foreign-debt problem, on a global basis, it appears necessary to set up, within the framework of the United Nations, a special body on the foreign-debt problem which should discuss and make proposals on concrete and effective steps to be taken in this field. The proceedings of the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development made it strikingly clear that, while at the world level there exist numerous unsolved economic and social problems of a most serious nature, the arms race absorbs huge resources every year, thus becoming an increasingly heavy burden on all peoples.\nThe message which the President of Romania sent to the Conference contains a set of proposals designed to freeze military budgets at the 1987 level and to reduce them in the initial phase by 5 per cent. The resources thus saved would be used both to meet internal socio-economic needs and to increase the contributions to the United Nations technical assistance programmes.\nNow, at the confluence of our century and the third millennium, science and technology have become a decisive factor of progress. But in this area of human endeavour also, yawning gaps have been created between economically developed countries and developing countries. Here too it appears both necessary and urgent to agree, within the United Nations framework, on the proper methods to be used so that all countries, primarily developing countries, may benefit from the major gains of human genius - hence the need to convene a second United Nations conference on science and technology for development.\nThe complex and particularly serious situation of international life in the political, military, economic and social spheres requires the democratisation of International relations and respect for the sovereign right of all States, irrespective of their size, their economic or military strength and their socio-political system, to participate, on the basis of full equality and mutual respect, in the solution of all problems of concern to mankind. In that light, we stand for the strengthening of the role of the United Nations and the other international organizations, so that their activities may be focused on the settlement of the cardinal issues of today's world.\nLife and its realities call for strict observance of the principles and norms of international law in relations between States and for the establishment of a comprehensive system of peace and security in the interest of all peoples.\nWe hold the view that there is a need to improve and simplify the machinery of the United Nations Secretariat. We are also convinced that the Organization's temporary financial difficulties should not result in a decline in its essential political and economic activities or in alterations of the democratic structures of the United Nations. \nThe point of view of Romania, of President Nicolae Ceausescu, on the main issues of present international life gives expression to the constructive vocation of the Romanian people for peace and large-scale international co-operation. At the same time, it constitutes an ardent call on all States, peoples and realistic forces to join efforts in order to remove the danger of war, once and for all, to exclude force from international life and to establish a new world, a world of peace, understanding and co-operation.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe fact that the Grenada delegation is speaking on the last day of the general debate in no way diminishes my delegation's pleasure at seeing you, Sir, preside over the business of the forty-second session of the General Assembly, with confidence and competence. My delegation joins in the many eloquent expressions of praise and gratitude to your distinguished predecessor for his outstanding conduct of the forty-first session. \nThe Grenada delegation also shares in the many warm tributes paid to the Secretary-General, for his untiring efforts and great diplomatic skills in the pursuit of peace. My delegation greets, salutes and congratulates the newly appointed Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs, Ambassador Reed, who is amiable and knowledgeable.\nWhen the curtain fell on the forty-first session many resolutions had been passed, and many situations had been resolved, for which that body could justly be proud. However, as the curtain rose on the forty-second session, certain perennial global issues impinging upon international peace and security remain unresolved. \u012b shall refer to some of them presently.\nThe word \\\"peace\\\" echoes, re-echoes and reverberates throughout the length and breadth of this Hall, with a frequency that is almost deafening. And this is how it should be. For what the world needs most at this time is peace. If peace is allowed to elude mankind indefinitely, the threat of nuclear war, which hangs over the universe like the sword of Damocles, will continue to contribute to the possibility of man's becoming an endangered species. \nPeace in the global context is not just the absence of war. Rather, it is a state arrived at when certain geopolitical, social, moral, economic and physical forces are in balance, under the impetus of a catalyst called \\\"justice\\\". Attainment of this state of equilibrium is more easily said than done, for the following reason.\nUnlike the natural sciences - mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and so forth - for which there exist appropriate equations and formulas for the solution of problems, in the social sciences, where peace, justice, security, morality and other global issues lie, there are no comparable equations and formulas. Resort is therefore made to reason, understanding, conscience, morality, past experience, compromise, good will, and so forth, in the resolution of those knotty global issues which impinge upon international peace and security. And therein lies the dilemma.\nIn the practice of the art of diplomacy to resolve geopolitical issues, there are certain ingredients - association, compromise, confrontation, exclusion - which must be applied in delicate balance for the resolution of those dangerous situations which impinge upon international peace and security. How, when, where, why these ingredients are brought into play becomes the art and challenge of diplomacy.\nSome of the pressing global issues referred to during the general debate are also of grave concern to my delegation. The Iran-Iraq war, which began as a series of border conflicts in 1980, has now escalated into a full-blown conflagration on land, sea and air, despite the efforts of the Security Council and the Secretary-General to mediate the dispute. Of humanitarian concern are the attacks on civilian targets; the resort to chemical warfare, contrary to the Geneva Protocol of 1925; the treatment of prisoners of war; and the interference with the right of free navigation, trade and commerce in international waters. The present situation in the Persian Gulf is fraught with dangerous implications and consequences. It should not be allowed to degenerate further.\nThe pernicious and odious racial policies of South Africa - apartheid \u2014 have been of major concern to the international community for at least 35 years. Apartheid is systematized and institutionalised racism, which has no place in civilized society, for it is cruel and inhuman. The Security Council has labelled it a crime against humanity. The Prime Minister of Grenada, the Right Honourable Herbert A. Blaize, when addressing the fortieth session of the General Assembly referred to apartheid as \\\"injustice institutionalised\\\". He stated:\n\\\"There must, therefore, be urgent, united action to rid South Africa of the scourge of apartheid and minority rule, and to bring independence to Namibia\\\". (A/40/PV.35, p. 48-50)\nGrenada's Minister of External Affairs, in his statement to the forty-first session of the General Assembly, emphasized that\n\\\"Grenada will to the extent possible, and consistent with its own policies, support any move or action by the international community designed to bring about the dismantling of apartheid and the achievement of majority rule in South Africa\\\". (A/41/PV.32, p. 8)\nA Grenadines patriot, T. Albert Marryshow, of beloved and revered memory, the centennial of whose birth we are celebrating this year, wrote in 1917 in a series entitled \\\"Cycles of Civilization\\\" - a veritable literary treasure in the Grenada archives - that the civilized world would have to come to grips with the racist policies of South Africa in the future. I want to emphasize that that was 1917, long before there were many independent African States, long before the United Nations came into being. Marryshow concentrated much of his historical, ferocious, but justifiable attack on General Jan Smuts, one of the early architects of the emerging apartheid practice. There was a man of prophetic vision speaking out alone in the colonies in 1917 against what was then considered to be a normal and benign situation. Today the situation in South Africa is the most abnormal and most malignant on the face of the earth - tyranny of the minority, terrorization of the majority.\nThe external-debt problem, with its adverse economic consequences, especially in the developing countries, is a perfect example of how international peace and security can be threatened by a situation which can have dire social, political and economic consequences. Debt repayment and debt servicing, pose a hardship foe, and place a stranglehold on, the economy of many developing countries, akin to a millstone around their necks. While the repayment of debt is a legal and moral responsibility of the debtor, debt relief should be a humane and moral consideration of some of the creditors, who in the context of the present global situation may be practising simple justice by putting back into the good earth a little of what has been taken out. History is replete with examples of how exploitation and injustice could have contributed to the debt problem.\nTo the least developed countries, whose social and humanitarian programmes are held in abeyance because of debt repayment and debt servicing, the cynicism mingled with humour of a socio-economist can be applied - namely, that the inherent vice in some economic systems is the unequal sharing of blessings, while the inherent virtue in others is the equal sharing of miseries. In the final analysis, if the external-debt problem is allowed to erode further, the economies of both developed and developing countries stand to suffer.\nAs one of the smallest island developing States Members of the United Nations, Grenada has a special interest in the question of island developing countries.\nAlmost three years ago, on 18 December 1984, resolution 39/121, entitled \\\"Specific measures in favour of island developing countries\\\" was adopted by the General Assembly. That resolution reiterated the call for specific action in favour of island developing countries contained in five previous resolutions. Additionally, three resolutions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) called on the international community to recognize the special characteristics and handicaps of island developing countries, and to provide appropriate support to them in their development efforts.\nUnfortunately, nothing has been achieved except that in its resolution 41/163 of 5 December 1986 the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to prepare a comprehensive report, which would include specific recommendations to ensure that the Assembly at its forty-third session would be able to review the situation and act accordingly, in the interest of island developing countries. Grenada's delegation anticipates with high expectation positive results at the forty-third session.\nWith respect to the special needs of island developing countries, my delegation is reminded of the saying of the great Chinese sage and philosopher, Confucius: give a man a fish, and you satisfy his needs for a day; teach a man to fish, and you satisfy his needs for many a day.\nIn Central America, the recent peace initiative undertaken by five Presidents, which resulted in the Guatemala Agreement of 7 August, is a credit to their vision, judgement and spirit of goodwill. The ray of hope, the crack in the door, which the Agreement introduces should be seized upon. After examination, study and modification, where necessary, that historic document can form the basis for peace in the region. The settling of disputes by resort to force and violence is anachronistic and dangerous. All that is right or reasonable pleads for sister republics to make peace within States and among nations.\nIn the Middle East, the Arab-Israeli dispute, which has been festering for some time, is now approaching a chronic state which could complicate the general Middle East situation. The doctrine of the right to self-determination is valid and indisputable. The right of Israel to exist as a State - a fait accompli for nearly 40 years - within safe and secure borders is well established. The existence of Israel is a fact of life which should not be challenged. Similarly, the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland within secure and recognized boundaries is a principle that has validity. The claim of the Palestinian people to a homeland in the land of their ancestors is a matter of history and simple justice. Their claim should not be thwarted as long as there is recognition of the principle of sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence.\nIt is believed that through the universal language of music, through the universal medium of sports, the world stands the best hope of attaining the universal goal of brotherhood. With this in mind, it is the hope of the Grenada delegation that the games of the XXIVth Olympiad, which will take place at Seoul, Korea, from 17 September to 2 October 1988, and the preparations for the Games will introduce a healing process so that the Korean problem can be resolved in the best interest of the Korean people. In the meantime the reality is that there are two Koreas, North Korea and South Korea, separated by a demilitarised zone under the supervision of United Nations forces. This interim arrangement will, it is hoped, yield to negotiation and dialogue, to the end that the Korean people may soon take their place in the international community.\nIn Cyprus, Afghanistan, Kampuchea, the Falklands (Malvinas) and other areas of conflict it is the hope and prayer of my delegation that wisdom, understanding and justice will prevail, to the end that peace may eventually be assured.\nAn area of global interest and common concern is the illicit trafficking in drugs and psychotropic substances, which, like the plague, is spreading over the face of the earth and gnawing at the very fabric of society. Concomitant with the craze for those dangerous substances is the proportionate increase in the level of violence, which is fast creating a seamy subculture in some societies. It is generally believed that drugs and international terrorism have a direct relationship. This twin menace is growing bolder every day and wreaking havoc on innocent and unsuspecting people. It should be interdicted at the source.\nAnother area of global concern is the rapid spread of acquired immune\u2014deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which like a scourge is approaching pandemic proportions. In this regard the prestigious United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) should continue to focus on the aetiology, prognosis and therapy for this health hazard, which has dangerous social consequences. The step recently taken by the President of the United States of America and the General Secretary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in agreeing in principle on the elimination of medium-range missiles from their nuclear arsenals is indeed heartening and inspires hope. It is the hope of mankind that, just as a journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step, so the first step has been taken down the long, difficult and tortuous road towards total and complete nuclear disarmament.\nFinally, listening and speaking in this fraternal forum of the United Nations, where confrontational and adversarial issues very often arise, my delegation is chastened by the divine admonition first have peace in your hearts, and then you will able to give peace to others.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure and true joy that you. Sir, have assumed the presidency of our annual Assembly session. By your unanimous election you have been asked to perform functions in which your ability and undeniable qualities as a statesman and diplomat will, I am convinced, be a great asset in the proper and successful conduct of our deliberations. We congratulate you and are happy to see you, the representative of a country with which Benin shares the same aspirations to progress, peace and social justice, assume the presidency of this session of the General Assembly of our unique and irreplaceable Organization.\nYou have taken over from your predecessor, our eminent colleague from Bangladesh, Mr. Rasheed Choudnury, to whom I express the appreciation of my delegation and country for the authority, skill and competence of which he gave such brilliant proof in guiding the forty-first session of the General Assembly.\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, through his devotion and very lofty vision of international public service, also merits my delegation's encouragement and admiration. The challenges that await Him are still immense, the crises of the international society are still many and dangerous to world peace and stability, for the establishment of which Benin reaffirms our full solidarity and support.\nI am not performing a ritual or carrying out an official duty, speaking after so many brilliant and talented representatives, when I say that the picture of the world, the state of the international society, the unrest on our beautiful planet, inspire and compel us to speak and voice our proposals clearly and with conviction.\nIn subscribing to the principles of our Organization's Charter, all nations, great and small, rich and poor, agree that in complete equality and full sovereignty we should work together, despite our differences and our cultural and ideological sensitivities, in this challenging endeavour to establish peace throughout the world and harmony among nations. This endeavour, despite its noble nature and the statements that magnify it, is still starkly incomplete and very precarious. It is for us to emphasize the deficiencies and point out the limits and our daily failures, so that we may all in this forum go beyond the beauty and rhetoric of our statements from this rostrum and find practical ways to establish understanding, peace and development.\nToday, thanks to man's genius, the talent of our thinkers and the astonishing progress of science and technology, some great Powers have succeeded in accumulating terrible instruments of our own collective destruction. By dominating the atom and the laser and through the power of computers, two super-Powers, and others increasing in number and ambition, are zealously vying with each other to acquire and upgrade laboratories to gain what they believe to be the attributes of military superiority or perfect deterrence. Let us look for a moment at the stunning figures and facts of that armament, or rather over-armament. We see vaulting ambition and at the same time enormous financial resources being mobilized for war and, consequently, the ruin of civilizations and the certain death of hundreds of millions of men and women on this earth, if mad powers were one day to press the buttons and controls of a nuclear war.\nThese are the first terrifying sentences of a very penetrating work entitled Nuclear Battlefields; \\\"Every minute of every day, at thousands of locations around the world - f com the plains of North Dakota and Montana, from the Ukraine and Siberia, from southern France and central China, to beneath the Arctic Icepack, to the Sea of Okhotsk, to the Yellow Sea - nuclear missiles sit ready to be launched. In Western Europe nuclear aircraft sit cocked on alert. On and under the high seas, nuclear-armed ships and submarines patrol, waiting for their day to go into battle. The weapons could reach their targets thousands of miles away quicker than it takes roost people to get to work in the morning.\\\" \nThus, in all the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France and China - to list but a few - possess between them approximately 4 9,000 and 59,000 nuclear warheads.\nNo reason of State, no ideological or imperial ambition, could justify this rush towards the abyss and the annihilation of what many generations of creators and builders have constructed to ensure the progress and happiness of mankind.\nMost fortunately certain encouraging signs have appeared. Painstaking and complex negotiations seemed to have led to some agreements. However limited and modest, those results should be encouraged and welcomed. When the Soviet Union and the United States recently reached agreement on intermediate.\u2014range nuclear missiles, my country - and, I am sure, many other nations too - applauded with a sense of relief this beginning of the end of our common anguish. These efforts must be continued and amplified on the basis of mutual, courageous concessions, so that those that have a virtual monopoly of nuclear terror on our seas, on out continents and in space may finally give us grounds for hope. They have that duty and that responsibility to history and the world. \nA special Conference of our Organization, held from 24 August to 11 September 1987, established that there was a logical link and an almost mathematical relationship between disarmament and development. Thus, it takes only a few statistics to prove that if a small fraction of the expenditure on military and research development - the millions of dollars, intellectual energy, technological creativity devoted to the production of arms - were used to finance the development of the poorest and most deprived, many of the hapless and least developed of our earth would receive additional, invaluable, precious resources with which to feed, care for and educate their citizens.\nThus, in 1985 one of the super-Powers had a military budget of $305 billion. Compared to that the total national budget of several countries of the third world taken together, with their paltry figures, is Lilliputian.\nIt is towards that re-channelling of military expenditure to peaceful purposes that our Organization, surmounting the poor excuses of national selfishness, should immediately urge certain Powers to commit themselves seriously to the greater good of future generations.\nIn this finite, truly interdependent, world, despite our diversities, differences and divergence, and despite hegemonistic rivalries, peace cannot and must not remain elusive. Development depends on it; health and the balance of our economies would gain additional resources and renewed vigour from it.\nThus we see in the third world the weakness of their economies, the scarcity of resources and the worsening destitution, which carry the threat of social explosions. Today the debt, with its unbearable burden and destabilizing effects, haunts the days and the work of our Governments. As our great comrade-in-arms President Mathieu Kerekou asked at the recent Francophone Summit in Quebec, can we at the same time suffer the crushing debt-servicing and see our export earnings whittled away so scandalously, thanks to the cynical games of the stock-markets and the wealthy Powers? President Kerekou went on to say:\t\\\"Indeed, how can we understand and interpret objectively the figures of the underdeveloped countries debt, which in 1970 was $76 billion and in 1986 greatly exceeded $1,000 billion?\n\\\"How can we understand and interpret objectively the net transfer of capital from third-world countries to the developed countries of more than $30 billion at the end of 1986 compared to $11 billion in 1984?\n\\\"How can we understand and blithely accept that the export earnings of the developing countries, based essentially on commodity prices, are constantly falling because of the law of the stock markets of the rich countries?\\\"\nWe are not inviting the rich of the world to the spectacle of our tears and lamentations so that because of their pity or compassion we may live on their largesse or their heartfelt generosity. We are simply asking that disorder and injustice give way to the establishment of a new order that respects our dignity and recognizes our demands as just.\nThe force and passion of our appeal simply reflect the tragic backwardness of our economies, which is the result of so many centuries of foreign exploitation and domination. We know how to manage our enterprises by correcting what needs to be corrected, rectifying the mistakes that have been made and, in particular, making the sacrifices required by certain structural adjustment programmes. But, the economies of the industrialized and developed North cannot get fat on our weakness and impoverishment without imperilling their own stability. \nWhile the special session of the General Assembly held from 27 May to 1 June 1986, were able to outline the problems and take a hard look at the magnitude of the crisis and Africa's development needs - to confine myself to the agonizing turmoil of our great continent - it is for the masters of international finance and the captains of industry of the countries of the North to help us to resolve them and emerge from the backwaters of poverty and underdevelopment where we can no longer agree to suffer and languish. It is intolerable that abundance should exist side by side with the atrocious hunger, poverty and disease so characteristic of entire regions of the third world. \nMankind is facing here one of the greatest challenges in its history of struggle, battles and crises. It has the capacity to meet this challenge to put an end to certain scandalous inequalities and injustices that are unacceptable in the light of the very richness of our planet and the infinite capacity of the creative genius of mankind.\nWhile the malfunctions of the world economic machine are one of the gravest causes of disquiet in our time, the world is beset by grave anomalies and dangerous anachronisms of other kinds, which all cry out for attention. To what extent is a political doctrine derived from the principles of our Charter consonant with the phenomena of oppression which we observe in the contemporary international society? How great is the gap of distortion, indeed sometimes the gulf, between what we preach and proclaim in every solemn statement and the acts that flout and trample underfoot the rights and dignity of peoples and individuals?\nIn our continent in particular, but also elsewhere in the world, there are living large-scale examples which attest to the way in which these practices and this conduct lag behind the fervour and the cogency of our pledges of non-interference and respect for the rights, sovereignty and independence of peoples and nations.\nLet us look, for example, at the apartheid of the Pretoria regime. The conscience of the world as a whole has condemned this with unequalled force and no country or Government is so bold as to seek to justify or legitimise it. None the less, state racism in the purest tradition of fascism continues in the south of our continent to terrorize and slaughter and to deny the black majority its most elementary democratic and national rights. However, those who by their influence and their Immense means of bringing pressure to bear might use comprehensive mandatory sanctions, as permitted by the Charter, to bring the anachronistic champions of colonialism as it was in its days of glory to see reason and accept reality hold back and put forward ever more sophisticated arguments to support their culpable abdication of responsibility. And/ nevertheless, that same Pretoria regime/ with the support of its powerful accomplices, refuses to decolonise Namibia because the internationalist Cuban combatants - invited by independent, sovereign, Angola - would then be close to its territory. Furthermore, this group of racist usurpers practising State terrorism cherishes the open and naked ambition of destabilizing the neighbouring front-line States by means of legions of mercenaries, bombing attacks, air raids and the murder of the patriots of the African National Congress and the South West Africa People's Organization.\nIn Mozambique, hated by Pretoria for its capacity for sacrifice and its patriotic courage, \\\"the bandits\\\" are engaging in butchery, rape and terror in a mounting wave of cruelty, all this redounding to the greater profit and welfare of apartheid.\nFor more than 25 years Nelson Mandela, who has gone down in history as a living legend of his race, has been held hostage. For a number of months, in which South Africa's hideous face has been increasingly revealed, hundreds of black women and children have been persecuted, imprisoned, tortured and massacred by the shameful South African regime. At this session our Assembly - and not by rote or reflex - should advocate without compromise or qualification the implementation of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the Pretoria regime, which has already chosen to inflict the greatest and most humiliating sanctions on our black brothers, depriving them of their freedom and dignity as human beings, causing many premature deaths and destroying many innocent lives.\nIn Western Sahara, can we not reconcile policy with the recognized right? Why do not Morocco and the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, through direct negotiations, bring an end to hostilities so as to create the necessary conditions for a straightforward referendum on self-determination for the Sahraoui people?\nAs for the Palestinian people, do they not have the right to an independent homeland? The Palestine Liberation Organization, with the blood of its heroes and the sacrifices of its fighters, has won a unique place in the illustrious records of history.\nBenin hopes that the international conference on the Middle East will meet in the best possible circumstances, and that in a Middle East reconciled and restored to peace the Palestinian people may recover its full national rights, in 3ustice and dignity, protected from all hegemonistic designs and the illegal territorial occupation maintained and practised by the State of Israel.\nIn Afghanistan and Kampuchea, meddling and intervention by foreign Powers should cease so that through negotiations and concerted action, led and guided by this Organization, the peoples may re-establish peace and the refugees return to their homes and their lands.\nReal advances are being made through diplomatic negotiation, which needs to be encouraged and supported on both these fronts so as to eliminate from our agenda in the near future these two problems which are so divisive and destructive of international harmony and understanding.\nIn Korea, the cold-war spirit being perpetuated by military manoeuvres and a very short-sighted anti-communist campaign must be eradicated so that, through negotiation and other peaceful channels, the divided Korean people may be restored to its former unity and grandeur.\nTurning now to the crises and war in Central America, Benin cannot accept that the contras should be enabled to use death and terror, financed quite officially from abroad, to destabilize a sovereign country. Today, the peoples and States of the region are working together to codify and regulate their fraternal relations on the basis of good-neighbourliness and reciprocal non-interference in internal affairs. All the countries of the hemisphere, in particular the most powerful and highly developed among them, should support those efforts and co-operate in this quest for regional peace and stability.\nAnd in the case of the war in the Gulf, where so many lives are being shattered, and physical facilities and wealth blindly destroyed, will reason and tolerance finally prevail?\nIn this very place, the most powerful among us, at first military accomplices or arms suppliers and now, in addition, principal actors, are striving jointly to bring peace once again to that precious part of the third world, today so torn and devastated. My country hopes their efforts will succeed, so that this ultimately absurd tragedy of violence and hate may not escalate and extend but may finally be resolved through an armistice and peace talks.\nGiven the scale of the crises I have just mentioned and the violence involved, it would be tempting to give way to despair or to be deeply sceptical about the history of the world and its future, to believe that it is condemned to a fatalistic cycle of war and peace. But on earth there are inexhaustible stores of generosity, a capacity for vision and inventiveness, and even for dreaming, which should teach us to have hope, beyond the \\\"sound and the fury\\\" of our century. The main task in our Organization should be to identify lines of conduct, adapt them to new problems and realities and to put them into effect methodically and courageously as we organize our relationships on the basis of equality and co-operation among nations. \nIn this quest for balances of international peace and understanding we, as Africans, have certain privileges confers on us by centuries of history, bondage, enslavement and oppression, endured with so much dignity and a spirit of national resistance. We are particularly well equipped, therefore, to cultivate tolerance and dialogue, while remaining jealous of our independence. We are also ready to accept differences and very vigilant regarding justice in international relations, despite the fragility - the temporary fragility - of our economies. That justice must prevail in all sectors and in all the major institutions that we have set up. Thus, in the Food and Agriculture Organization, Africa, united and in solidarity, is seeking, through the talent and competence of its candidate, our compatriot Moise Mensah, to take a leading role. Benin and the increasing number of very different States which have supported this candidacy, hope to be able to count, in a few weeks time, in Rome, on the votes of others that have not yet lent us their support.\nDespite the ebb and flow of the tides of war and the mounting resurgence of certain fanaticisms, we should work for times to come and plan for the future with faith and imagination.\nThese thoughts are our modest contribution to this general debate and we invite representatives to give them their consideration. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, I take great pleasure in joining those speakers who have already congratulated you upon your election to the high office of President of this venerable world body. I am fully confident that, under your able guidance, our difficult deliberations in the weeks ahead will beat much good fruit. You may rest assured of the full coo-operation of my delegation.\nI should also like to thank your predecessor, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, for his excellent work in conducting our affairs during the forty-first session of the General Assembly,\nEach session of the United Nations General Assembly is convened, as it were, by a summons to all Member nations, exhorting them: \\\"Come, let us reason together,\\\" and in this regard, the words of the Saint Lucian Nobel Prize winner. Sir Arthur Lewis, are instructive;\n\\\"We must continue to make the problems of each the official concern of all, that they may be resolved by discussion and mutual concession.\\\"\nIn the conduct of our international affairs. Saint Lucia has always been, and will always be, guided by its deep concern for the attainment of universal peace, respect for human rights and economic development and, in reflecting on the four decades that separate us from the end of the Second World War and the creation of the United Nations, we ate saddened by the realization that the insanity of the last world conflict has never really receded from international affairs during these last 42 years.\nThe world which emerged after the Second World War has been one divided into blocks by two competing super-Powers. Their over-riding objectives of promoting and protecting their competing ideologies have led to global suspicions, tension and hostility, and have dragged nations small, young and tender, like Saint Lucia, into regional conflicts completely detrimental to the interests of these small States. Since 1945, the nations of the world have killed over 40 million of their people in local wars. Today, from Central America to North Africa, from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf to Kampuchea, local wars are raging with the consequential destruction of human life, prosperity and the environment, and from north\u2014east Asia to Central Europe, brothers find themselves hemmed in by hostile creeds, glaring at each other across ideological frontiers. The horrors of international local wars are made worse as brother battles brother from South America to southern Africa, from East Africa to South Asia.\nWhile we have been able to avoid a Third World War, it is small comfort that a contributory factor has been the spectre of mutually assured destruction from the nuclear weapons stockpiled by the super-Powers. And although there is general agreement that a second Noah' s ark will not emerge from a nuclear deluge, neither will there be a second genesis in another Garden of Eden. The threat of a thermonuclear Armageddon remains an ever constant reality. The arms race is, however, unflagging, and expenditure on arms has continued to soar, diverting into its vortex millions of dollars that could have liberated the world from underdevelopment, hunger and disease.\nBut in recent times there have been some small signs that a semblance of sanity is creeping back into the judgement of men; some not unpropitious events which give cause for the hope that we may be approaching a new tide in the affairs of men.\nThe announcement early in the life of this session of the General Assembly that the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed in principle to dismantle an entire class of nuclear weapons - the intermediate-range missiles - is one such welcome sign. It is the earnest hope of Saint Lucia, and I am certain of the international community, that the proposed intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty will be but the first step in a journey which we hope will end, not in the total elimination of mankind, but with the total elimination of nuclear weapons.\nAs the super-Powers inch towards nuclear agreements, so too are there small signs of hope in those countries that have been the quintessential examples of the East-West ideological divisions that have separated us since the last world war.\nThe recent high-level contact between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany was most significant. My delegation hopes that this historic visit is but a foretaste of the quality of co-operation and understanding yet to come.\nIn the Koreas, we feel that many recent activities augur well for the future. Saint Lucia would welcome the peaceful reunification of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the basis of agreements worked out by the Korean people themselves. We are therefore supportive of all topical proposals aimed at a renewed dialogue between the Korean people on reunification and, in the interim, we believe that full membership of the United Nations for the two Koreas would not hinder the efforts of unity towards this end. We believe that the coming 1988 Olympics presents an opportunity .for dialogue and co-operation that should not be missed.\nOur region of the world has not escaped the effects of the ideological wars and rivalry of the super-Powers. Saint Lucia has for some time now been quite concerned with the situation in Central America and its implications for the peace and security of the entire region. We have always held the position that the countries of the region have the right to live in peace and to decide their own future, free from outside interference or intervention. We have also consistently maintained the view that the problems of the region are rooted in deep-seated local social and economic deprivation, and are therefore not amenable to armed or military solutions. \nWe have therefore always supported the efforts of the Contadora Group and, more recently, the Support Group to end the conflict in Central America. We welcomed the Cancun Declaration on Peace in Central America and the Document of Objectives, which set the foundation for the inauguration of negotiations with a view to ensuring harmonious coexistence in Central America. Saint Lucia expresses its full support for the peace plan signed by the five Central American Presidents and welcomes the creation of a role for both the United Nations and the Organization of American States in the implementation of the plan. We call upon all States to pledge their full co-operation to assist in its realization. Let those who dared to draw their swords, be now courageous enough, not only to sheathe them, but to take a bold leap of faith for peace. Let all men of goodwill remember that what the poor of the region desire is not guns, but simply a better and more fulfilling way of life, and let them lend their support to the cause of peace.\nIn the Caribbean, the Haitian people have cast off the yoke of oppression and are on the way to establishing a democratic system of government. We therefore look forward, not to the mere holding of elections in November this year, but to elections that will be free and fair and free from fear. We are confident, however, that the people of Haiti, whose forefathers were the first people to establish a free nation in the Caribbean, can and will find the wherewithal to continue on the road to liberation. But we must never forget that democracy is best created and sustained by economic progress. We therefore call upon all those who are in a position to do so to assist the Haitian people in this time of need.\nAmidst those signs of hope are areas in dire need of redress. And where peace should have been on the throne, it still remains on the scaffold. In Central America, Guatemala still threatens the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of our sister Caribbean Community partner, Belize, with its persistent claim to its territory. Guatemala's uncompromising attitude on this matter has been a source of much distress to Saint Lucia. We hope that the Guatemalan President, His Excellency Mr. Vincio Cerezo Arevalo, who has shown such leadership and diplomatic skill in dealing with other Central American problems, will be magnanimous in addressing the matter.\nIn the South Atlantic, there has been too little movement towards solving the Falkland/Malvinas problem. The restoration of democracy in Argentina has presented an excellent opportunity for renewed dialogue between two countries that, for almost two centuries, have enjoyed a great degree of friendship. We urge both sides, in the spirit of compromise, to seize this opportunity.\nThe question of Cyprus has been on the agenda of this body for much, much too long. Saint Lucia continues to maintain its full support for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. We believe that the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the high-level agreements of 10 February 1977 and 19 May 1979 form the basis for a just and lasting settlement of the question. Accordingly, we welcome the proposal made by the President of Cyprus for the total demilitarisation of the State, and the unconditional withdrawal of all troops and settlers of occupation. We urge the Secretary-General to continue to use his good offices with a view to facilitating a speedy settlement.\nIn South Africa, the intolerable situation continues to aggravate the international community as the apartheid regime stubbornly maintains its abhorrent system of racial oppression at home and its stranglehold on Namibia in defiance of international law. Has not the dehumanisation and brutalisation of the oppressed peoples of South Africa been affronting the world long enough? Must South Africa continue to flout every attempt by the United Nations and the Commonwealth to end its racial insanity and to restore dignity, peace and freedom to that land?\nHave we not realized that until the evil of apartheid is totally eradicated all of us, no matter who we are or where we are, will be accomplices in the vilest system of degradation ever visited upon man by man himself?\nSome of the front-line States of southern Africa have known no peace since their independence for having provided support for the just struggles of the oppressed people of South Africa. They, too, require an opportunity for peaceful development. We wish to assure them that, despite our size, they can count on us for whatever assistance we can render in the cause of freedom.\nThe apartheid regime mocks the world even more by perpetuating its intransigence over Namibia in that it continues to use dilatory tactics to frustrate the legitimate right of the Namibian people to self-determination, Saint Lucia strongly condemns the apartheid regime for the imposition of the so-called interim government in Namibia on 17 June 1985, in defiance of the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. Saint Lucia reiterates its recognition of the national liberation movement, the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), as the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people, and its support for the inalienable right of the Namibian people to self-determination, freedom and independence, with full territorial integrity. \nIn northern Africa, the tragedy of famine in the Sahel, aggravated by war, continues to haunt us. In the Persian Gulf the war between Iran and Iraq drags on, destroying more and more lives and threatening to erupt into a wider conflagration as other nations dispatch their armadas into the Gulf. The admirable co-operation of all members of the Security Council in adopting resolution 598 (1987), on 20 July last, is to be applauded, but, in the absence of compliance; we urge the members of the Council to find the necessary political will to bring the full weight of the Charter to bear on the warring parties. If Member States of the United Nations will not respect the decisions of the Security Council, then we are in fact eroding not only the authority of the Council but also the integrity of the Organization itself. This leads us to examine one more cause for concern today: the role of the United Nations itself. Some credit must be given to the United Nations for general world peace over the last 40-odd years; at the very least, the Organization has served as a palliative, bringing the moral authority of the rest of the world to bear on warring parties# and thereby helping to preclude the general widening of bilateral or regional conflicts.\nHowever, we cannot escape the fact that the United Nations has had extremely limited success in preventing, and resolving, local conflicts since the Second World War. We cannot deny that most combatants have circumvented the conflict resolution mechanisms of this Organization before going to war. And, in more recent times, as the super-Powers have jostled for supremacy, as some nations have tried to stamp their point of view on others, there has been a retreat from multilateralism. As a result, the United Nations itself suffers, as nations respond only lethargically to its basic financial needs.\nSaint Lucia's aspiration for universal peace is inextricably linked to a vibrant and increasingly strengthened United Nations. We continue to hold the view that the United Nations is the last, best hope for mankind. Its diminution is linked to the failure of nation States to recognize the vital role it has played in maintaining world peace in the past 40 years. It is not coincidental that there has been an almost inverse relationship between military expenditure as a percentage of world gross national product and the influence of the Organization. As that influence reached a nadir about 1980, we saw an acceleration of military expenditure to about 5 per cent per year in real terms. It now nears $1 trillion per year - well above that of the immediate post-war period, when the United Nations was at its most influential. \nSaint Lucia believes that without a strong United Nations, we cannot continue to hold the line that prevents local conflicts from becoming global, let alone resolve the local conflicts themselves. We must not therefore, through lack of financial support, hold the Organization to ransom for some narrow national goal with which we perceive it to be out of consonance. If the prospects for universal peace are to improve we must reintroduce the necessary political will into the halls of the Security Council and the General Assembly. We can improve on the United Nations, but we cannot do without it.\nSaint Lucia takes its commitment to regional and international organizations very seriously. Over the years, in the Caribbean, we have lent our full support to the process of greater functional co-operation and integration. In the eastern Caribbean in particular, we have helped forge the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), which includes among other things a single central bank for our several countries. As the unswerving dedication of its member States has blossomed into great strength for the Organization in a few short years, we have decided to accept the challenge of the logic of its success and to take the ultimate step into a full political union of all our willing member States. The implications and logistics of this proposed political union are now being studied.\nIf we can pool our resources - our markets, our capital, our defences, our people - if we can reduce the costs of our administrations, in which we have seven Governors-General, seven Prime Ministers and 60 Ministers, for a total population of about 500,000, we shall be better able to deliver a higher quality of life for our people and play a more effective role in international affairs\u00b7 We have already received pledges of support from our colleagues in the wider Caribbean community, and we are sure that, as the wisdom of our endeavour unfolds, we shall be able to count on the support of our neighbours in Latin America, and our friends in the rest of the world.\t\nWhen the Charter of the United Nations was framed, little thought was given to the conception of small States such as Saint Lucia. But countries like ours have special problems which need to be addressed quite seriously by this body. Consequently, the slow progress of initiatives in favour of island developing countries after over a decade of discussions and resolutions in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the General Assembly and elsewhere, remains a matter of great concern to Saint Lucia. The myriad special problems of those countries, including vulnerability to natural disasters such as that which struck the eastern Caribbean only last month, continue to pose major hindrances to the development process.\nWe therefore regret that the comprehensive review of the progress made in - assisting those countries, as mandated by General Assembly resolution 39/212 of 18 December 1984, did not take place last year. My delegation is consequently preparing some new initiatives which will facilitate the General Assembly's action on this question next year.\nThe economic plight of the developing countries continues to be most unsatisfactory, while global output grew by 3 per cent last year, the developing countries lost $94 billion as a result of constantly deteriorating terms of trade, and national income fell by as much as 10 per cent in some developing countries. This rather undesirable state of affairs is further compounded by a seriously diminishing interest in private sector investment in the developing world, and a general weakening of official financial flows. Non-concessional bilateral credits to the developing countries have also decreased, as have credit flows from the International Monetary Fund. In fact, repayments to the Fund from the developing countries last year exceeded new credits by almost $3 billion. All o\u00a3 this, added to the burdensome debt of the developing world and the increasing protectionism in the developed market economies, is the right formula for disaster.\nThe sluggish growth of the global economy already reflects the drag of the developing countries' economies} redressing these imbalances is therefore paramount. Each day the global village grows smaller and smaller, as all of us grow more dependent on each other. Upon being told that man would soon embark on a search for intelligent life in space, an old lady responded that it would be nothing more than a search for new enemies. \\\"After all\\\", she said, \\\"if we cannot get along with the man across the street, how can we expect to get along with the people up there?\\\"\nIn our intercourse with the various peoples of the world, there is only one conclusion that can be reached. We are all essentially one and indivisible, in reason, in form, in movement, in needs and. in ideals. Every man cherishes his liberty. No man enjoys being dominated by another. Every man wants to live in peace, to enjoy the good things of life and to see the world rid of ignorance, of poverty and of disease.\nFor our children, and for theirs, we yearn for nothing less, and to these ends, the intellectual treasures of the Earth can and should first be harnessed.\nThere is yet time to begin. When will we begin?\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the Malawi delegation I should like to join those who have spoken before me in congratulating you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. The wealth of experience and knowledge of international affairs as well as the diplomatic skills and patience which you bring with you to this lofty seat are well known. We are certain, therefore, that under your guidance the General Assembly will achieve positive results. In wishing you success in carrying out your duties and responsibilities, I assure you of my delegation's full co-operation at all times.\nMy delegation equally wishes to express appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Choudhury, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, for the remarkable way in which he presided over the forty-first session. Under his stewardship, many important and historic decisions were made by the General Assembly.\nWe wish also to express our great pleasure at the good work undertaken by the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, during the past 12 months, particularly that of mediation between parties in conflict.\nThe Malawi delegation wishes to congratulate Mr. Joseph Reed on his appointment to the post of Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs.\nWhile the situation as regards international peace and security continues to cause much concern, we have been encouraged by some positive developments in the past few months. We welcomed the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which was sponsored by the United Nations and held here in August and September. We welcomed the adoption by consensus of the final document of the Conference. We believe that the document has provided a basis on which to build further towards the achievement of disarmament and therefore the promotion of development around the world. Malawi has also been encouraged by indications of progress at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, particularly with regard to the question of chemical weapons.\nMy delegation joins others in welcoming the announcement that the two super-Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, have reached an agreement in principle on an accord on the elimination of intermediate nuclear forces. We note that this will be the first such accord ever and therefore represents a major step forward in the field of nuclear-weapons disarmament.\nMy delegation wishes to congratulate the two sides on this historic development. In so doing, it is our hope that the accord, which we understand could be signed soon, will give a much needed impetus to efforts also to attain disarmament in conventional weapons. For, in the end, international peace and security will best be assured only by complete and comprehensive disarmament.\nThe elimination of or reduction in arms production and arms stockpiling cannot by themselves guarantee international security. For international security depends as much on the conscious promotion of peace as it does on the absence of the tools of war. There is, therefore, an equally urgent need to find ways to bring to an end the areas of conflict and tension that exist in the various regions of the world. In all of these we can clearly see that the main causes are either the denial to peoples of their right to self-determination or the deliberate disregard by some States of the sovereignty and integrity of other States.\nIn the early months of this year, our interest was aroused by sudden developments that seemed to promise positive movement towards breakthroughs on the respective questions of Afghanistan and Kampuchea. Sadly, however, neither the much-heralded reforms and other initiatives announced by the authorities in Kabul in January, nor the flurry of diplomatic activity in Viet Nam a few weeks later would appear to have led to any changes. If anything significant came out of these developments it was perhaps a reaffirmation of what has been repeatedly stated in this Assembly; that only the withdrawal of foreign forces will facilitate a meaningful solution to the two respective questions. The peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea must be left to resolve their political differences and determine their political future by themselves.\nAnother area of concern in the Far East is the Korean peninsula. My Government remains convinced that the political future of that area can best be determined by the Korean people themselves, through genuine dialogue and negotiations between the Governments of North Korea and South Korea. That is why Malawi supports the recent call by South Korea for talks, without pre-condition, at a higher political level than has been the case in the past. It is our hope that all sides will give the call by South Korea serious consideration.\nIn discussing a region which seems beset by seemingly intractable problems, it is a welcome change to be able to applaud something truly and significantly positive. We refer here to the accord signed in July by the Governments of India and Sri Lanka in order to bring about an end to the conflict in northern Sri Lanka which had threatened permanently to divide the Sri Lankan people while at the same time promoting tension between the neighbouring States of Sri Lanka and India. In this regard, we salute the two leaders. President Jayewardene of Sri Lanka and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, for their singular act of courage and faith. We see the accord as a concrete example of how States can co-operate to promote international peace and security.\nAs we review the situation in the region of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf, we find cause for grave concern in both the apparent widening of the conflict and the threat inherent therein to international peace and security. We have noted with interest the adoption on 20 July 1987 by the Security Council of  resolution 598 (1987), which appears to us to be a reasonable basis for finding a lasting solution to the conflict in the Gulf.\nWith regard to the Middle East, we in Malawi have been encouraged by the growing support for a proposal which was made to the General Assembly last year for the convening of an international peace conference, sponsored by the United Nations, to be attended by all parties directly concerned in the conflict. War has not been able to end the conflict between the Arab States and Israel, because war cannot address the crucial issue, the right of all the peoples of the region to self-determination within recognized and secure borders. We have stated before that only through dialogue among all parties to the conflict can the framework for a lasting solution that meets the needs and aspirations of all concerned be found. We believe that the time is now right for such dialogue, and we believe it is right and proper that the United Nations should have a central role in facilitating such dialogue. We support the proposal for an international conference on the Middle East, \nMy delegation notes with encouragement the return to peace in the Mediterranean region following the sudden heightening of tension there in early 1986. However, while we delight in this, we regret that peace and national conciliation in Cyprus continues to elude the people of that island State, We support the efforts of the Secretary-General aimed at keeping open the channels of communication between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. We regret, however, that those efforts have so far not met with success. We therefore appeal to all those concerned in this matter to co-operate with the Secretary-General and accept the need to resume the intercommunal talks as a way towards finding a formula for the lasting solution the foreign invasion of 1974 was unable to provide.\nMalawi welcomes the peace plan recently proposed by the leaders of the Central American region with a view to bringing about an end to the various conflicts and tensions in that region. We should like to register our support for their bold initiatives, and we wish them success in this endeavour.\nOn our own continent of Africa too, tension and conflict, particularly in the southern African region, continue to pose a threat to international peace and security. There are three main causes of that situation: first, the continued denial to the people of Namibia of their right to independence and self-determination\u00b7, secondly, the attempts by some external forces to impose upon certain countries of the region the types of ideology and forms of government preferred by those forces, in complete disregard of the choices of the citizens of those countries; and thirdly, the problem of apartheid, a political system which the African people and the entire world have unequivocally and unanimously condemned and rejected.\nWith regard to Namibia, we reiterate what we have said before: that the independence of Namibia is long overdue. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) met all the legitimate concerns of all the parties to the political dispute over Namibia, and all the parties accepted, and still accept, that resolution as the basis for the granting of independence. We can therefore see no justification for the continuing delay in its implementation. Indeed, the delay is contributing to the growing toll in lives and to the hardships imposed upon the people in that Territory.\nThe Malawi delegation has stated many times in the past that force and violence are not, and cannot be, the way to resolve political problems or any other differences. Force can at best provide only temporary solutions. We remain convinced that only through contact and dialogue can lasting solutions be found. That is why the Malawi Government welcomed the recent courageous initiative by some political leaders in South Africa in starting a dialogue with the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC), particularly in Senegal recently. We are convinced that this development can only be for the good of all South Africans, black and white, and we hope it will lead to more and more contacts and wider dialogue including not only the white liberals, on the one hand, and the ANC, on the other, but eventually also other white leaders - even Government leaders \u2014 and other representatives of the black majority, such as the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC).\nWe have followed with interest the initiatives and programmes undertaken by the United Nations during the past year in the area of social development. Among these, perhaps the major one was the United Nations-sponsored International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, held in Vienna in May. The threat drug abuse poses to our future generations and the social problems it presents, particularly for developing countries, have been analysed. It has also been known for some time that combating the production and abuse of and illicit trafficking in drugs requires wide co-operation and concerted action by the world's Governments. Yet it somehow appeared that, except at the professional level, co-operation was never going to be achieved. While the political leaders of some countries saw the need for the problems of drug production, trafficking and abuse to be addressed at the political level, many others did not yet recognize the magnitude and urgency of the problem.\nAt a time when greater attention was suddenly being given to these issues and more countries were beginning to realize the need for co-operation, the convening of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking was most timely. We believe it provided an excellent opportunity to bring about a greater understanding of the problem. It provided an opportunity also for those who had already acquired considerable experience in dealing with the problem to share that experience with those who are new to the problem, and for all countries to come up with a strategy for international co-operation. \nMalawi was represented at the Vienna International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking by a three-member delegation. We believe the Conference was a success, and we hope the decisions and plans of action adopted in Vienna will be faithfully implemented. We certainly hope too that a review conference will be held at the appropriate time to examine how successful - or unsuccessful - we have been in achieving the goals enunciated at the Vienna Conference.\nIt is Malawi's hope that, in the light of experience gained with regard to drug abuse, consideration will be given to a similar initiative concerning what is clearly emerging as the single most widespread problem with dire implications for the future. We refer here to the killer epidemic of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). \nWe are pleased to note that the World Health organization (WHO) has already begun to devote its attention to the AIDS problem. We hope that from the lesson learned with regard to that drug problem it will be considered that the early convening of an international conference devoted to the question of AIDS would be most beneficial.\nMeanwhile we would also like to express our appreciation for the decision by the United Nations to give special attention to the population problems in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this context we welcome the Strategy for United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) assistance to Sub-Saharan Africa, which was adopted by the United Nations Development Programme (\u00dcNDP) Governing Council at its thirty-fourth session last June. We are of the view that the Programme of Action envisaged in the Strategy will contribute greatly to the efforts of the Governments in the region as they seek to attain an equitable balance between the social and economic development needs of their national populations, on the one hand, and the resources available to their Governments to meet those needs, on the other.\nHowever, this plan cannot be realized without the UNFPA itself having sufficient financial resources to carry out its programmes. We sincerely hope that Member states will join hands in assuring the UNFPA's financial health and that those who are in a position to do so will consider the possibility of making additional voluntary contributions.\nIn the area of economic co-operation between the rich North and the poor South there appears to be issues which require urgent attention if the serious poverty of the South is to be halted. These issues are, first, greater access for products from the developing South to the markets of the industrialized North; secondly, higher and more lucrative prices for the goods exported from the South in relation to products manufactured and exported by the North; thirdly, a halt in the reverse flow of funds from the developing to the developed countries caused basically by, fourthly, the repayment of debt to lenders in the North. Naturally we see these matters as being interrelated.\nDespite the assurances of the industrialized countries to the contrary, we have seen an increase in recent years in both tariff and non-tariff barriers against the exports of developing countries. At the same time, there has been a steady decline in the prices of commodities - most of which are primary goods - from the South while those of manufactures from the North have continued to rise. This is a question of terms of trade. And faced with declining export earnings and soaring import bills, developing countries have been forced to borrow ever more at high interest rates from the same countries of the North in order to sustain their economies. Now, many developing countries nave frightfully large fractions of their national incomes committed to debt repayment. Herein lies the problem - a source of international dissension.\nWe are glad that at the meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) agreement was reached on the need for greater economic assistance to the least-developed countries. The undertaking by the developed countries to encourage lending institutions in their areas to consider being more flexible in order to ease the debt burden of developing countries is also appreciated. However, it is my delegation's hope that greater practical efforts will be made towards helping the export commodities from the poor South to be more lucrative. In this way the debt problem begins to be alleviated. Naturally the developing South would have to follow sensible and workable economic policies, which appears to be what they are doing now.\nIn this regard it is also important for my delegation to acknowledge the crucial role played by all the United Nations agencies, in particular the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) , in our development efforts, in addition to that played by other bilateral and multilateral donors  Economic Community under the Lom\u00e9 Convention and also the World Bank, in addition we are pleased with the important assistance offered to Malawi by the African Development Bank (ADB). In our opinion the ADB is a very good institution through which the developed countries could increasingly channel funds for the continent's economic development; I am therefore making an appeal to them.\nFinally I should like to say that, in spite of all that has been said about the uncompleted work, unfulfilled promises and unresolved problems by the United Nations, many a speaker appears by implication and directly to support the continued existence of the Organization. Yes, we need the Organization.\nFor its part Malawi will continue to give the United Nations its fullest support and will always be ready to make its contribution towards ensuring the Organization's continued existence. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffO Lord, with Thy holy name I begin and from Thee I seek guidance and support. My life and death, my petition, prayer and praise belong to Thee. I beseech Thee to grant the clarity and magnetism of the word of truth to my utterances and make them a message for the millions of people who passionately thirst after truth and for those who shall, in the future, seek the truth. 0 God Almighty, my nation and I offer our thankful salutations to the souls of Thy great prophets, in particular, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Mohammad - Thy peace be upon them - who did their utmost and gave their lives in order to spread and immortalize the message of awareness and salvation of man, and our humble salutations to the pure and enlightened hearts who obeyed Thy message, especially to those among them who sacrificed their lives because of it.\nMy country has been a centre of man's civilization and culture at some important, elevated stages of history and at present is the setting for a political system based on the same cultural background and traditions, which are now further enriched by an Islamic awakening. I come here from a land which is the birthplace of a more famed but Less understood revolution in contemporary history, a revolution founded on the religion of God, marching along the path of the prophets and great spiritual reformers, a path as long as the history of mankind.\nIslam's Unitarian theory is the unshakable foundation and the fundamental thinking of this revolution. The meaning of man, the interpretation of history, the analysis of past, present and future events, the concept of the material world, the explanation of elements that bind man to the world outside him, the earth, human beings and objects, man's understanding of his own existence - in short, everything that goes into the formation of human society's value system to attain an orderly human administration - are rooted in and emanate from this divine outlook. In Islamic thought all existence is the creation of God and an image of His knowledge and power; the whole universe is attracted to Him and man is His creature superior to others and His heir on earth.\nExploiting his intrinsic talents man can build the world created for him in the most beautiful ways and, flying on the two wings of faith and knowledge, rise to the highest spiritual and material peaks. Conversely, man can create a hell of oppression and corruption by going astray and wasting and perverting his God-given potential. The only light illuminating his path is belief in God and submission to His commands. The temporal world is a cultivating ground for the next world and death is not the end of life but only a passage to immortality and the beginning of a new existence.\nIn Islam's divine thought all mankind are brothers and sisters and creatures of the Almighty. There is no discrimination because of colour, race, sex or geographical location of people and these distinctions do not make one man or a nation superior to others. When racial and geographical characteristics are disregarded, an act of aggression against a person is aggression against humanity.\nThe feeling of superiority and monopoly has set brother against brother, and the blood that has flowed has never dried. The same motives and the same actions created streams of blood and, finally, seas of blood have appeared between those seeking superiority and domination and the victims of such arrogance. In this way peace has been taken out of man's life.\nThe prophets invited people to submit to God, because this crushes the feeling of egocentrism and superiority in man and offers him the purity and tranquillity of a paradise on earth before the eternal one in heaven. They persuaded man to control his instinct of domination and superiority. They also warned against wasting human potential and slipping into the mire of moral corruption. They opened fountains of virtuousness, honesty, love, work, initiative, knowledge and consciousness and they stressed the love of God and His blessing of people, which are man's only insurance against perversions and are a guarantee of the sublimation of his soul.\nThey taught man to use his power to safeguard these values, to block the path of the intruding satans of corruption and perversion, to fight ignorance and the cruelty of slavery, to safeguard knowledge, justice and freedom. They taught him neither to oppress nor to let others oppress him  they taught him to rise in defence of equity and justice and not to give evil a chance. They also taught him that surrendering to enemies of justice, virtuousness and charity only results in the destruction of these values and amounts to acquiescence in evil, oppression and corruption. \nIn Islam's divine thought the religion of God is not only the crowning of man's virtuousness, but the very form of life itself. Religion offers man a complete social system, not merely some forms of worship and certain traditions  even though services of worship and traditions are full of the spirit of life and serve the same system. The social system is based on the same religious outlook. Freedom and liberty, the equality of people, social justice, awareness of society's individuals, the combating of corruption and perversion, the superiority of human ideals over individual desires, the rejection of satanic domination, personal behaviour and ethics, and occupational and political scrupulousness are all born of and inspired by the same universal interpretation of the world and man. Islam rejects as immoral all systems founded on force, oppression, ignorance, suppression, tyranny and humiliation of man through discrimination on grounds of race, nation, blood or language It commands the faithful to approach with love, affection and support all mankind, co-religionist or not, except those determined to fight the Islamic order, who must be faced uncompromisingly.\nIt was on such basic principles and with such objectives that an Islamic revolution emerged in Iran and laid the foundations of an Islamic republic. Many analysts have searched for the roots of the Islamic revolution in February 1979, and many of them have failed to understand it correctly. In our opinion, this great event was partly a consequence of the inefficiency of the existing systems in the world and the emptiness and falsehood of the slogans of democracy and equality in those systems. Islam was able once again to shine in this dark atmosphere through the dust of distortions and misconceptions thrown in its way for many centuries. The sun of Islam shone on Iran and brought about a revolutionary storm. It is expected to shine on many other parts of the world. We must wait and see. But, despite earfuls of adverse propaganda, the awakening of Muslims in many Islamic countries is not an offspring of Iran's Islamic revolution; it is its brother-in-Islam.\nIran is located at one of the most sensitive sites of strategic importance. It has a background of science and culture and abounds in material resources. The Islamic revolution in Iran was meant to be against a regime that had put all this at the service of the interests of the imperial-minded Powers of the world, particularly those of the United States of America, for almost a quarter of a century. Nobody needed the spiritual and material wealth of Iran more than the Iranian people, but they were denied it. The ancient regime's claims of progress and modernization were all false, but the West's propaganda machine, especially its Zionist component, keep publicizing them. It was such a regime that the Islamic revolution toppled, proposing its own significant goals. Nine years have passed, yet it is still felt that the answers too many questions are not quite clear. The fact is that in the case of our revolution and our views and principles much more uninformed opinion and evil talk has been heard than in other cases.\n1 shall now try, for the benefit of those interested in truth, to shed light on certain exceptional aspects which give different characteristics to this revolution. I shall end my statement with a brief message.\nFirst, the revolution was from its beginnings a people's revolution - totally, 100 per cent. None of the familiar forms that have been instrumental in certain other revolutions were active or even present in our revolution: no armed guerrilla groups, no active military-political party, no groups of revolutionary, free officers and the like. There were only people, and unarmed people at that, who filled Tehran and other cities and towns in Iran with their presence. They crowded the streets and filled the air in the cities with their revolutionary presence and revolutionary slogans, in such a way that there was no room to breathe for the ruling clique and its government\u00b7, they simply had to leave their castles and centres of power and, one by one or in groups, to leave the country hastily. The Shah, the Prime Minister, generals of the army, ministers and other important criminals fled the country when they could to avoid the wrath of the people.\nThis, of course, happened after a long year during which the regime had exploited all the political, military and police resources at its service to disperse people and force them back to work or to their houses, and in order to achieve this had shot and killed thousands of them in the streets, in the mosques, in the universities and in their workplaces, openly and indiscriminately. Despite all these measures, however, the people's presence had increased. In the very last months, when the regime became more violent, the people came out in millions. The regime, cracking under the pressure of people who no longer had any regard for their lives, could not withstand the onslaught of the masses and was forced to make its greatest concession; it sacrificed the Shah, He fled the country, never to return, and after this the regime's retreat accelerated.\nThe great leader of the revolution, whose every word to every individual Iranian was a lesson in awareness, resolve and purpose, was able to announce the formation of a revolutionary administration with trust in God Almighty, Who encompasses all other powers, and with reliance on the people's indomitable will. The Shah's tyrannical rule, which was left with no option, collapsed automatically and melted away. The last bastions of the regime were barracks with no soldiers or officers, in the last hours a few garrisons showed some resistance, but all was in vain, because people were everywhere and overcame them. The miracle of this revolution was the victory of the people. It was only after the collapse of the military garrisons that arms fell into the hands of the people\u00b7, but then the kingdom had already collapsed and these weapons were used for the protection of the new revolutionary order. People, young and old, men and women, were the agents who defeated the Shah's regime, which was armed to the teeth and enjoyed the support of the biggest Powers. \nIt was the people who established the order of an Islamic republic, and their weapons were their faith, their determination and their blood - and blood overcame the sword. The doctrine of blood overcoming the sword is the old policy of the oppressed resisting and fighting the oppressor that was declared by the leader of our revolution long before it took place. Thus the first victory of our revolution was against the armed regime of the Shah, who was strongly backed by the West and the United States, It has since gained us other victories, some of which may even be rated as more important than defeating the Shah. This unique experience - unique at least in the last century - deserves to be carefully studied by both the oppressed nations and those oppressive Powers which underestimate the power of the people.\nSecondly, this revolution had its roots in religion, in Islam. There have been many revolutionary movements in history the combative spirit of which was fuelled by a religious faith, but little or no account has been taken of this factor by many analysts. In our revolution, however, everything was taken from Islam; its aims, its principles and its methods of struggle, as well as the formation of the new order and the particular form of its administration.\nThis fact gives certain surprising dimensions to the definition of revolution and new meanings to its victory. As we know, Islam has been a target of assaults for the last century and a half by colonial Powers and their subservient, reactionary agents exactly because of its inexhaustible capacity for revolution and reconstruction. Furthermore, Islam is a sacred faith and a divine religion in more than 50 countries and among some 1,000 million Muslims and, therefore, a revolutionary victory the spirit and substance of which is derived from Islam is in fact the victory of those billion people over all historic invaders against Islam. It is for this reason that hundreds of millions of Muslims in dozens of Islamic countries have welcomed the victory of our revolution. \nThis religious characteristic also stops the people, the leader of the revolution and its administrators from any retreat, defeat, fear or weakness, when you fight for God there is no defeat, let alone fear, weakness or retreat.\nThirdly, non-reliance on either East or West was another exceptional characteristic of this revolution and is now the fundamental policy of out revolutionary system.\nThis in itself is one of the manifestations of the belief and trust in God in all spheres of our individual and social life. The dominant thinking in the political world today believes that without reliance on one of the power blocs no movement may survive in the contemporary political world. There may be a difference of emphasis about this but there seems to be no argument on the sacred principle. There are also people who, ideologically speaking, endorse non-reliance or non-alignment but do not suppose, pragmatically speaking, that it could work. Our revolution has, in such an atmosphere, offered a new philosophy and followed it most sincerely. Our revolution proved that the imperial-minded Powers may be ignored, that their bullying tactics may be resisted and that blackmailing may not be effective provided that there is belief in a power much more powerful than all material powers; belief in God Almighty,\nWe know quite well that for this belief and in this struggle we have to pay a heavy price and we are prepared for it.\nLet this experience illuminate the path of nations to true independence and the total rejection of the hegemony of the big powers; the present division of power threatens humanity with a very bitter future.\nFourthly, there is another peculiarity to our revolution \u2014 very active to the present; it had to suffer an incredible amount of hostility and receive many exceptional blows. Certainly no revolution is safe from the counter-strikes of the power system dominating our world but the variety, the depth and the enormity of the enmities and the wild anger unleashed against us for the last nine years is an exceptionally interesting story to hear.\nThe revolution had not yet reached its climax when hostile behaviour mostly by the United States of America started to challenge it. Certain officials, who reveal secrets through the passage of time, now confess that in the last months of the Shah's tyrannical regime the United States Administration, the President and his national security adviser tried to hearten the Shah by encouraging him to be \\\"more decisive\\\". The meaning of \\\"decisiveness\\\" was later explained in the statements of a fellow called General Huyser who had come to Tehran as the special representative of the President of the United States of America. In his opinion and according to advice given to him, the Shah's regime had to be safeguarded even if this resulted in the slaughtering of tens of thousands of people. And his incredible justification was: \\\"It would be preferable to the killing of many more thousands later\\\". In the honourable opinion of the United States authorities it was not valid that if the United States did not interfere in the internal affairs of Iran, neither the blood of tens of thousands then nor the blood of \\\"many more thousands later\\\" had to be shed!\nCertainly there was no other reason for the abortiveness of Huyser's mission and his flight from Tehran as well as for the arrest or flight of all those elements whom the United States needed for the carrying out of its evil plans except the crushing ferocity of revolutionary waves and the great might of a nation who had risen to fight for God and feared nothing but God. It was not the enemies of revolution who simply walked off; it was the revolution that forced them to flee. They had already exerted all their pressure at the hands of the treacherous Shah. After the victory of the revolution, hostile plots were hatched in a variety of forms. The very first clever measure was the infiltration of revolutionary posts and positions by enemy agents and the second was the organizing of all sorts of \\\"opposition\\\" parties and groupings in a free, political atmosphere after decades of dictatorship and suppression. In the former case it is interesting to note that a loyal agent who, a few weeks after the revolution, was tried in a revolutionary court and executed for treason had, by hook or by crook, got himself appointed as the commander of the Air Force in the first days of the revolution! And in the latter it would suffice to say that in the very first months after our victory some 400 political parties and groups surfaced in Iran that included anything from Loyalist to Communist to Separatist to Pan-Iranist. And it should not, of course, be forgotten that certain foreign embassies in Tehran, especially the embassy of the Arch-Satan, were the centres that organized some of these groups and helped them financially and ideologically!\nA bloody, merciless kind of terrorism was another vengeful hostility towards our revolution. Terrorist groups who lacked any form of popular base, by stealing arms and ammunition and explosive material, not a difficult job in those chaotic days of revolution, and through the assistance of certain foreign governments, established a vast, terrorist network in Iran. individual and group assassinations, colossal bomb explosions, the hijacking of aircraft, kidnapping, horrible incidents of torture, indiscriminate shootings and the deliberate slaughtering of people were among the measures carried out in Iran by some terrorist groups supported and encouraged by the infamous enemies of our revolution. The victims of this barbarous violence represented all strata of Iranian society; they Included important leaders and authorities of the revolution, as well as ordinary people such as the oppressed workers and toilers, men and women and, of course, innocent children and passers-by.\nToday, the leaders of these terrorist groups, who have often claimed responsibility for their criminal actions, are given security and protection and are provided with a comfortable life in the United States, France and some other Western countries and go by the euphemism of \\\"opposition to the Revolution\\\"; and the countries that patronize these terrorists accuse the Islamic Republic of Iran of \\\"terrorism\\\". An astonishing paradox of politics is that the innocent victims of a blind, barbarous terrorism are themselves accused of \\\"terrorism\\\" by those who helped establish these terrorist groups and are at present looking after them well.\nAs the President and servant of my country, and as a victim of a savage terrorist attack, which was aborted by the will of the Almighty, I have the honour to declare here that none of these brutalities, none of this shedding of blood, could shake the will of our people despite the fact that the extent of the terrorism was unprecedented: in one act alone, some 72 leading members and administrators of the revolution, including several cabinet ministers, a score of deputies of Parliament, and some irreplaceable personalities of our revolution, such as Martyr Ayatollah Beheshti, died inhuman deaths; and in another incident the President and the Prime Minister were blown to death together. But these brutal atrocities have served only to strengthen the people's faith and trust in God and to increase their revolutionary wrath. \nMilitary coups d'\u00e9tat are the traditional, sanguinary experiment in all revolutions organized by the great Powers. In the case of the Iranian revolution they were organized many times and in one case reached a very dangerous state. Had it not been for our people's support and for the vigilance of our officials, the predictions of the American General that there would be several blood-baths and the massacre of millions of people would have materialized.\nBut the greatest, the most painful and the most catastrophic act of hostility by our enemies was the imposition of war on our revolution, that is, the stirring of the ambitious instincts of a neighbour, persuading it to invade and assuring it of all sorts of assistance and support.\nToday, after some seven years of war, it is quite clear to all that the invasion of Iran by the Iraqi army on 22 September 1980, that is, 19 months after the establishment of the Islamic Republic, was in fact aimed at defeating the revolution and at the overthrow of the Islamic Republic. The invasion was carried out with some 10 divisions and hundreds of fighter-bombers; they attacked from the ground, from the air and from the sea. There were also such expansionist aims as the annexing of a province of Iran, a fact that has frequently been confessed to in the Iraqi press and publications as well as in articles by non-Iraqi paid pens. The Iraqis have, more often than expected, declared both these goals openly and in a revealing way.\nWhat Iraq anticipated as a reward for this invasion, apart from the stabilizing of its internal situation, was to emerge as the dominant Power in the region or at least in the Arab sphere. This would have been a lot for the nonentities ruling Iraq, access to a considerable coastal border in the very important Persian Gulf region was certainly another motive. By an Iraqi victory which would accompany Iran's defeat, its disintegration and the collapse of the Islamic Republic, the imperial-minded Powers would also reach an important goal: the removal of a new system which had disturbed the existing political-economic balance and put an end to the influence of big Powers, especially that of the United States, in the event of our defeat, the circumstances would be back to \\\"normal\\\" for the United States and some others, and the same old story of political and economic influence would be repeated.\nWe were at first taken by surprise, we should admit. Our preoccupation with innumerable internal problems relating to the revolution and our lack of sufficient experience made the invasion possible; but the particular characteristics of this revolution came to our rescue: within a few months the heroic, miraculous efforts and sacrifices of our people and their armed forces had resulted in the liberation of a large part of the occupied territories. Nevertheless, the catastrophic effects of this invasion are beyond description; prosperous cities such as Abadan, Khorramshahr, Hovaizeh and Qasre-Shirin were razed to the ground; even the small city of Dezful was hit by some 250 ground-to-ground missiles; numerous happy villages of which not even a half-smashed wall is left; factories that were turned into piles of metal rubble; numerous farms that were wiped out; invaluable cultural monuments that have been seriously damaged; and, most important of all, the innocent people who lost their precious lives.\nThe committing of war crimes, such as savage attacks against civilian, residential areas; the massacre of thousands of defenceless women and children; the imprisonment of passengers and passers-by on the occupied roads - all in the first weeks of the war - violations of international commitments and regulations, such as the use of chemical weapons on a large scale, air attacks on commercial ships, civilian aircraft and passenger aeroplanes and trains, are some examples of acts on the part of the Iraqi regime in the course of this war that have been identified but are continuing.\nAfter the initial war efforts, when the people of Iran had time to think over and sum up the events, they realized a very bitter fact, namely that security based on the promises and commitments of a warmongering aggressor has no validity and that trusting in such security is illogical and very naive.\nThe Head of the Iraqi regime had publicly announced that its Agreement with the Iranian Government in 1975, otherwise known as the Algiers Agreement, was signed at a time when Iraq was weak, and therefore it was not binding or valid any more. He tore a copy of the Agreement to pieces and a few days later invaded Iran.\nThis was a bitter but enlightening lesson for the Iranian nation. From that moment on, our people, awakened and revolutionary, took a decision and set a clear objective for their efforts. They decided not only to liberate the occupied territories and seek war compensation - to both of which they are unambiguously initiated, despite the fact that they could not be compensated for a great part of the damages - but also, as a more important goal, to punish and remove the aggressor. By proposing the punishment of the aggressor we have sought not only a secure base for our national security but also security and stability throughout the region. If an aggressor is once punished by the international family of nations for its aggression, we can rest assured that the aggressor instinct, which is often found in evil and opportunistic elements, will be suppressed for many years to come, and our region, and perhaps the whole world, will not have to suffer the catastrophic consequences of unprovoked aggressive wars.\nThe Nuremberg Trials have guaranteed some 40 years of peace and security for the war-addicted European States. Why should we discard the experience of Nuremberg?\nWhen thousands of square kilometres of our country were under occupation, the big Powers, exploiting their powerful weapons of publicity, put us under very heavy pressure to accept a cease-fire in return for the formation of a committee that would arrange for the invader to return to international borders. This would have meant our leaving part of our existence, our honour and our dignity under the feet of the enemy and soliciting the attention of this or that international committee in the hope of regaining our integrity. There could have been no bigger insult to the intelligence of an honourable revolutionary nation. Even the least informed people in the world have the sanguinary tragedy of the Palestinian people before their eyes and would reject such tyrannical proposals. If imposed cease-fires and deceitful, empty promises had restored the legitimate and obvious rights of the Palestinian nation, they might also help others to regain theirs.\nIn our case, even today, when we have liberated the largest part of the occupied lands through the heroic efforts of our people and at the cost of their precious blood, with some parts such as Naft-Shahr still under occupation, we believe that our most important task is to punish the aggressor. And today, when we look back at the irrecoverable cost of this imposed war, we consider this more important than ever and believe that without punishment of the aggressor any other achievement would be a loss for our people. As a nation which has borne the burden of a seven-year war, we long more than anybody else for peace, but we believe that that peace, a lasting peace, can be established only with punishment of an aggressor who has added many other sins to the original sin of aggression since it started the war.\nToday, as in 1975 Iraq is again in a weak position and everyone knows this. The kind of peace approved by the Iraqi regime today would, after a few years or whenever it suspected itself to be in a strong position, evaporate in a moment, and another war would engulf the region. The only guarantee for the future is punishment of the aggressor.\nPeace is, without a doubt, a beautiful and attractive word. This is so true that even the biggest international warmongers and the producers of weapons for global destruction flirt with it and love it hypocritically. But, in our opinion, justice, a word that the powerful and the oppressors regard with fearful caution, is even more important and more beautiful.\nThe number of those who have given up their well-being, their peace and their life to secure justice is not small. These people are always recognized as great heroes. European cities still take pride in their resistance against Hitler's aggression; Moscow still prides itself on a self-burning that astonished and disappointed Napoleon's army and Leningrad on its four-year-long resistance when besieged by the Nazi invaders.\nThe United Nations in particular has an obligation, according to the very first Article of its Charter, to secure justice through the special process of taking measures against acts of aggression. And this is all that we expect from the world and from the United Nations. The big Powers have hypocritically called the war imposed on us a meaningless war, but at the same time they have consistently supported the initiator of and aggressor in this war politically, militarily and economically.\nThere is no doubt that starting such wars is always meaningless, but as long as the aggressor was still hoping to achieve its evil end it was never called that.\nToday, however, this war is very meaningful for our people: it means selfless, heroic efforts to eradicate aggression and prove that nations have the power, in the face of the will of the big Powers, to defend their revolution, their stability and their integrity. Our nation, through a great deal of sacrifice, is engaged in rejecting a concept that has always resulted in aggression and war: the concept that reliance on advanced weapons and the support of the big Powers is a guarantee of success.\nIn the last seven years the Iranian people have searched for the answer to an important question. Today I want to raise this question here from this rostrum. Why have all those Governments that know very clearly that it was the Iraqi regime that started the war and initiated aggression - and there is no scarcity of those that know this - chosen to remain silent vis-\u00e0-vis this great international crime? And why have the world mass media tended to ignore their great responsibility to the conscience of mankind and the interpretation of history in this case?\nPerhaps the key to the solution of this problem lies in the particular political relationships in our world today and the defective geometry created by the domination of the big Powers in international relations. However, our people seem to have discovered the facts.\nBut the question to which no convincing answer may be found is this: why has the Security Council of the United Nations, as an organ that was created primarily to safeguard international security and oppose aggression, totally ignored its obligations and even acted in defiance of its duty? I think everyone knows that the Security Council did not show any reaction when Iraq invaded Iran on 1,OOO-kilometre front. The Iraqi army overran international borders in only a week and established itself at points ranging from 70 to 90 kilometres inside Iran. Some Iraqi authorities announced that their army intended to stay there forever.\n\n\n.\nIt was only after the establishment of this invasion that the Security Council issued its first resolution, on 28 September 1980. This resolution neither mentioned any aggression or occupation nor made a request for a return to international borders, but, astonishingly enough, called on both parties not to resort to any further use of force. What this really meant was total connivance in the occupation of the affected areas and a conquest to the Iraqi army not to advance further. And as far as Iran was concerned, it called on our people to stop fighting against the aggressor.\nThis was the very first measure by the Security Council, in which it trampled upon all its principal obligations concerning the safeguarding of international peace and security in an ugly, tragic manner.\nAfter that, a deadly silence fell upon the Security Council for a long time - that is, up to the liberation of Khorramshahr through a military operation that broke the back of the occupation army and resulted in the humiliating capture of thousands of enemy soldiers and officers. Yet, up to that time, the Security Council had completely forgotten about the bloody, continuing war that headed the international news bulletins every day.\nThus the Security Council suddenly remembered the Iran-Iraq war again. A few weeks after the liberation of Khorramshahr the Security Council's second resolution, dated 12 July 1982, was adopted. Now the Council called for a return to international borders. What it requested had already been achieved because our heroic people and their selfless and valiant combatants had by then liberated the greater part of the occupied lands. This resolution, too, was conspicuous for its many omissions: no reference to aggression; no mention of the aggressor; nothing about destruction, damages or any compensation; no guarantee of teal security and stability and not a word about punishing the agent of insecurity. The Council had chosen to be silent in its resolution about all those vital points.\nTherefore, once again, we found ourselves quite alone in restoring our legitimate rights, and I must inform the Assembly that the Security Council's stance in relation to the war that was imposed upon us has not changed up to this moment.\nOf course, the Secretary-General's independent initiatives went some way towards helping the United Nations in the realization of its objectives, but his good offices were not appreciated. I ought, however, to register a thankful note here for his efforts and his good offices. It would also be appropriate to remember the good name of the late Swedish Prime Minister, Mr. Olaf Palme, who, as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, sympathetically tried to help.\nThe Secretary-General's trip to Tehran and the useful talks regarding Security Council resolution 598 (1987) were another step in that direction. We consider those talks objective and instructive, as is the report of the Secretary-General. Regrettably, it seems that some influential members of the Security Council wish to ignore that fact. They are the same members as have from the outset attempted to exploit that resolution as a means of exerting pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran. We have conveyed our unequivocal views to the Secretary-General and expect the Council to use correctly the possibilities open to it.\nHas the Security Council anything to say regarding the infringement of its very first obligation, to take measures against acts of aggression, which is stated in the first Chapter of the Charter to be the most important objective; what pressures has the Security Council brought to bear on Iraq in relation to threatening peace, breach of the peace and resort to force as mentioned in Chapter VII? Impartiality is the least that the Islamic Republic of Iran - a victim of a bloody, devastating aggression - can expect from the Security Council, because we all know that the Council's obligation is to take measures against acts of aggression and to support the victim of aggression, rather than remain neutral between the aggressor and the victim. But can the Security Council even claim that it has behaved impartially in this case?\nOur feeling is that the Security Council has been pushed into this indecent, condemnable position by the will of some big Powers, particularly the United States, Therefore, one may say that the foundations of the security supported by such a Security Council is nothing but a nice-looking house of cards. The nations of the world, especially the peoples of the third world, who wish to remain independent of the super-Powers, may never have the security guaranteed by such a Security Council.\nThe fact that Iraq was never condemned for aggression has not only helped keep the imposed war going but also fanned its flames.\nAnd now, with the United States presence in the region and the presence of other countries that have followed as a result of the arch-satan1 a insistence and pressure, the Persian Gulf has turned into a dangerous powder-keg.\nAt this juncture I must draw the attention of the General Assembly and the people of the United States urgently to the very grave and immediate danger provoked by the United States Administration through its latest action in the Persian Gulf, which is threatening not only the region but the whole world. Yesterday United States battleships attacked Iran Air, an Iranian merchant ship. They murdered four people and wounded three. The ship was seized and its crew detained, American television stations announced yesterday that United States battleships fired at this ship while it was laying mines in the waters, and thereby, as usual, told a pack of lies to the American people. But I declare here that the ship was a merchant vessel called Iran Air, not a military speedboat.\nThis is the beginning of a series of events the bitter consequences of which will not be restricted to the Persian Gulf, and the United States, as the initiator of the trouble, will bear responsibility for all ensuing events. Should we now believe the passionate United States claims of a desire for peace and tranquillity in the Persian Gulf or this open, flagrant and concrete measure to fan the flames of war? I declare, very unambiguously, that the United States will receive a proper response to this abominable act. This is only one of the evil consequences of the imposed war and a direct result of the Security Council's inability to take proper measures against the Iraqi aggression. If the Security Council had condemned Iraq for starting the war, and later, for starting the so-called war of the cities, and Later, for attacking ships, today the United States would not dare threaten international peace and security so openly in spite of world public opinion, despite pressures from inside, and immediately after the adoption of resolution 598 (1987) for the preparation and adoption of which the United States had played a key role. Was resolution 598 (1987) only adopted to put pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran?\nI must here announce to the world and especially to the great people of the United States that the threatening, military presence of the United States in the Persian Gulf is yet another clear manifestation of the American regime's hostility towards the Iranian people.\nA big chapter of our history, a very bitter, bloody and evil chapter, is saturated with American enmities and grudging hostilities towards our nation some 25 years of support for the Pahlavi butcher and dictator, complicity with the Shah in all his crimes against our people, participation in plundering the wealth of the nation, serious confrontation with our revolution in the last months of the Shah's regime, persuading the dictator to suppress the millions-strong demonstrations of our people, employing all sorts of means and devices to obstruct the path of revolution in the first years of our victory, the constant, provocative contacts of the United States embassy in Tehran with counter-revolutionary elements, continuous help and assistance to terrorists and counter-revolutionaries outside Iran, freezing of the people's assets and property, non-deliverance of commodities that had been already paid for, non-payment of assets taken from the public treasury by the Shah and deposited in his own name in American banks, efforts for an economic blockade of Iran and the formation of a United Western front against our people, flagrant and effective support of Iraq in its war against us and now the bullying and illogical tactic of throwing an American armada into the Persian Gulf and seriously endangering peace and tranquillity of the region.\nThese are pacts of our nation's indictment against the United States administration, an indictment that will bring under question all American claims for peace-loving and all statements by American leaders declaring their good intentions towards the Islamic Republic, which are apparently meant for internal consumption.\nThe latest in the long list of American hostilities towards out nation was the bloody massacre of innocent, defenceless pilgrims at Mecca in the holy sanctuary of God at the hands of the Saudi regime where some 400 Iranian and non-Iranian pilgrims, mostly women, were martyred and a greater number were beaten, injured or maimed. There are certain indications that the United States played an influential part in this unprecedented, historical monstrosity.\nDo the United States administration and its Saudi stooges have any convincing explanation for the slaughtering of so many innocent men and women?\nUndoubtedly the culprits will try to justify their evil actions with some excuses and allegations but the nature of the incident with some 400 dead visitors mostly women on the one side and the local police armed with machine-guns, clubs and poison gas on the other is very revealing.\nAlthough blood that is shed wrongly at the hands of cruel, merciless tyrants will carry its clear message with it, not only for today but for all times, and will reveal the evil nature of the butchers, the Mecca incident also demonstrates the co-ordinated behaviour of the United States and the Arab reactionaries and unveils the secret co-operation of the two sides in the Persian Gulf region. This gives the incident an international dimension that must be carefully looked at by international forums.\nI must emphasize here that this indictment is directed against the leaders of the United States regime and not against the American people who, had they been aware of what their governments have done against another nation, would certainly endorse our indictment. Our people have shown that they have faith in their goals and are ready to defend them at the cost of their lives.\nSuch a nation has no fear of the United States or any other Power and with the help of God it will prove that victory belongs to truth and the believers in truth.\nThis was the story of our revolution. This revolution brought great hopes for nations which suffered from the oppression of the imperial-minded Powers  equally it provoked the violent hostility of the big Powers which seek to dominate the world. This storm of opposition, however, could not break off the young tree of this revolution because of its very deep roots. The tree was growing fast but it did withstand some very strong, damaging storms. And now the revolution is still alive despite the opposition of the big Powers and it shall certainly survived that is the dictate of divine traditions in history and it shall not be altered. And that is our most vivid and emphatic message.\nThe system of domination had relentlessly tried to prove the contrary in order to make the nations of the third world believe that their fate is decided by the will of the big Powers. We have rejected and repudiated it. There is no doubt that the system of world domination did not wish the Islamic Republic to survive but our will overcame. Our message to all nations and Governments which wish to remain independent and ignore the wishes of the big Powers is to rely on their own people without any fear.\nThe message of our revolution remains as it was the rejection of the doctrine of domination. Today our world is in fact divided among the big, imperial-minded Powers, They believe that they are the masters and owners of the world. In other words the world is divided into dominator and dominated parts and the dominator s decide on the fate of the dominated. The system of world domination feeds on the existence of unequal relations between the two parts. The system of world domination arbitrarily rejects revolution and creates problems for revolutionary regimes. Nicaragua and the countries of southern Africa are a few living examples.\nThe system of world domination decides for peoples against their will. The innocent Palestinian nation is a perfect case and Afghanistan is another. The system of world domination fiddles with human ideas and concepts, changes and distorts them at will and tries to inject the distorted meanings into people's minds terrorism and human rights are two such manipulated concepts.\nThe system of world domination is bold enough openly and directly to invade such countries as have aroused its anger. The United\u00b7 States invasion of Libya and Grenada are two recent examples.\nThe system of world domination makes decisions for the whole world and all nations. Yesterday it was Hiroshima and today the President of the United States is proud of the horrendous behaviour of his predecessors and even argues that if they did not kill those several thousands, mote people would have been killed throughout the world! The President of the United States does have a soft spot in his heart for all mankind - is he not the godfather of mankind?\nThe system of world domination supports fascist and racialist regimes such as the ones in Israel and South Africa and employs them as bloodthirsty, armed agents to bully the oppressed nations. Muslim Lebanon, patiently resisting the criminal aggressions of Zionists, and the African front-line States are good examples.\nThe system of world domination considers that it has the right to put pressure on international organizations; the Security Council and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) are living examples.\nThe system of world domination believes that its own interests are absolute and the interests of others are non-existent. A good example of this is the dangerous, peace-threatening presence of American battleships in the Persian Gulf that have come to \\\"defend America's interests\\\" while completely disregarding the interests of the countries of the region.\nThe system of world domination has, above all, the propaganda machine and the mass media of the world in its hands, distorts all the facts and gives a humane image to its satanic behaviour and in this way escapes confrontation with world public opinion. We believe that the nations and Governments of the third world as well as the peoples of the dominator countries should not tolerate this evil order of things. The big Powers must be told to go back home and leave the affairs of the world to its peoples. We must tell them: you are not anybody's legal guardians!\nIn the United Nations there are two unjustified distinctions - the right of veto and permanent membership in the Security Council. These must be removed. And their removal would indeed turn the United Nations into a truly popular organization in which all problems may be solved. Otherwise the Security Council will remain, as it is today, a paper factory for issuing worthless and ineffective orders. And the peoples of the world will continue to think that there is no place for settling international problems and that the only option left is to use violence.\nUnder these circumstances our message to the Governments of the third world, as long as the system of domination remains, is to unite with each other. This is the only way to become stronger. The Powers dominating our world do not value anything but power and we must speak with them in the only language they understand, the language of strength.\nThe awakening of peoples and their awareness of the nature and function of the system of domination is the strongest support for the third world Governments and a source of real strength to resist the dominating Powers. The leaders of these Governments will have nobody to help them except the will, the power and the ideas of their own peoples.\nThe union we propose to the third world countries is not a pact for fighting the big Powers; it will be a union for our own defence and the prevention of the usurpation of our legitimate rights.\n\n\nThe dominating Powers are also the big agents for dissemination and justification of corruption: moral corruption, sexual corruption and ideological corruption. The political, economic and espionage motives of the big Powers are the true perpetuators of these moral perversions. And the fact is that in our world today, which includes the nations of the big Powers too, moral values have been discarded, the foundation of the family has been weakened, alcoholism and addiction to drugs have become rampant and spirituality and morality have become least appealing.\nWe must start a tough campaign against corruption in our own countries. We must strengthen the foundation of the family and make this original school of man a home of affection, sincerity, love and spirituality. We must safeguard the rights and values of women. On this last issue, we must revise all the standards that were created by the system of domination and in order to liberate women from the humility of being \\\"sex objects\\\" that the dominant, Western culture has in practice imposed on them. Women as scientists, politicians, directors and managers, partners and mothers must be welcome but their exploitation as objects for pleasure, lechery and commercials should be rejected. This will help restore the dignity and personality of half of humanity and re-establish the lasting and holy foundation of the family.\nThese are some of the messages of our revolution, not only for those eager to listen but also for those who can decide to listen to the truth and to welcome fairness and justice.\n \n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nWe feel very proud, Sir, that you are presiding over the General Assembly- Your qualities and qualifications affirm your ability to handle the responsibility. You also come from a friendly country, one with which my own enjoys cordial relations. Our common endeavour to achieve peace increases our confidence that this session will achieve positive results to that end. Allow me to congratulate you on commanding such confidence and to wish you every success in your task.\nWe would be remiss if we did not on this occasion express our high appreciation to the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, who conducted the business of the forty-first session of the General Assembly with success.\nWe should also like to pay tribute to the continued and constructive efforts of the Secretary-General to help achieve political and just solutions to so many of the conflicts in different areas of the world. We feel very proud that this session is taking place simultaneously with our Yemeni people's celebration of the twentieth anniversary of our national independence r which crowned the bitter struggle of our people to end colonization, in which thousands of martyrs gave their lives.\nWe are proud, too# that over the past 20 years, in spite of all the difficulties and conspiracies that we have had to face, we have been able to bolster our political and economic independence and make tangible progress in the political, economic and social spheres. Our happiness is increased by the fact that this important occasion comes at the same time as our Yemeni people\u2019s celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 26 September revolution, which ended the isolation imposed by the tyrannical regime of the Imam over our people and signalled a new dawn, opening up for them prospects of progress and development.\nIn keeping with our profound faith in the interdependence of the principles and objectives of the 26 September and 14 October revolutions, we have spared no effort at the national level in continuing to work with our brothers in the northern part of the nation to take steps towards unified action by the two Yemens and to give meaning to that interdependence. There is no doubt that the meeting held in Sana in the last half of July 1987 between Ali Salem Al-Beedh, Secretary- General of the Central Committee of the Yemeni Socialist Party, and President All Abdulla Saleh was a new approach in the course of joint action by the leadership of the two Yemens towards reunification of the national territory and its people by peaceful and democratic means.\nOn the regional level, too, our relations with our brothers in neighbouring countries have been developed on the basis of mutual respect, independence, sovereignty, non-interference in the internal affairs of others and constructive co-operation in our own interests and those of other peoples.\nSimilarly, our foreign policy embodies certain principles that have promoted relations of co-operation and friendship with many countries of the world and intensified our activities within the context of the Non-Aligned Movement. The continued escalation of the Iran-Iraq war and the prospects of its expansion to the territories of other countries not parties to the conflict double the risks faced by our region. Those risks include the stepping up of the military presence and imperialist intervention in the area, towards increasing the tension. An example of this is the presence in the area of forces and fleets and the United States \\\"Bright Star\\\" military manoeuvres there. While we reaffirm our position that the countries of the area bear the responsibility for the security and safety of the region, we are also anxious to remove those risks and promote efforts of those countries to bring security, stability and peace to their peoples.\nWe also reaffirm that the war, which is so destructive of the potential of two sister countries, Iraq and Iran, must end immediately to avoid further loss of property and life, for its continuance will serve only the interests and designs of imperialism and Zionism, while jeopardizing the stability, security and sovereignty of the peoples of the area.\nWe therefore welcomed the efforts that culminated in the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 598 (1987) . In that context, we pay tribute to the Secretary-General's efforts to ensure implementation of that resolution and we express the hope that they will receive a positive response so that the conflict between the two neighbouring countries may be settled by peaceful means.\nOur support for Security Council resolution 598 (1987) is based on our belief that it represents a serious collective step by the Council to carry out the responsibility assigned to it by the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security and demonstrates the Council's ability to work in a constructive manner to achieve and maintain a peaceful settlement of that conflict. However, we believe that this action should not be taken in isolation and applied to that case only; it should be followed by other similar steps, with the Council assuming similar responsibility in various parts of the world, thus reaffirming its credibility as the organ charged with finding just and lasting political solutions to international problems, especially those that threaten international peace and security.\nRegarding the Middle East, there is international agreement to convene an international conference on peace in the Middle East, and it is only the opposition of the United States and Israel that has prevented it. We call for the adoption of urgent measures to ensure the convening of that conference \u0159 to reach a just, comprehensive solution to the problem based on the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to establish an independent State on its national territory. All the parties concerned should take part in that conference, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and the permanent members of the Security Council. The credibility of the Security Council and the international community will be established only when rights are restored to those that have been deprived of them.\nIs it not high time for the historical tragedy that befell the Palestinian people 40 years ago to be remedied? Is it not high time for a just and permanent solution to be found to the Palestinian problem, the core of the Middle East crisis and the main reason for the continued conflict there? Is it not high time for Israeli occupation of Palestinian Arab territories to be ended? Is it not high time for practical steps to be taken to implement the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council on Palestine and the Middle East, to reject the processes of the annexation of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights and to end the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon? \nWe call also for an end to Israeli policies and practices based on aggression, occupation and expansion in the area. We feel that some permanent members of the Security Council - in particular the United States of America, which adopts a thoroughly partial attitude in its position towards Israel - should take a position consonant with that body's responsibility and the provisions of the Charter instead of obstructing efforts to give effect to the will of the international community.\nAt the same time, with regard to the tragic situation in Lebanon, we believe that every effort should be made to restore security and stability to that country and its people and to guarantee its unity and territorial integrity.\nIn southern Africa, we face a litmus test of our determination to match words with deeds. Credibility would be enhanced if some Western States ended their opposition and some practical measures were taken to implement the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia, approved in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). That resolution attracted international unanimity nine years ago and was rejected only by the racist regime illegally occupying Namibia, which has found encouragement in the policies adopted by some Western countries.\nNo matter what we may call those policies, they are all aimed at obstructing implementation of the resolution and circumventing some of its provisions by linking Namibian independence to extraneous conditions such as the withdrawal of the Cuban forces from Angola. Again, credibility would be affirmed through the adoption of comprehensive measures against the racist regime of South Africa in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter, particularly since recent developments in southern Africa have made it clear that there is no alternative to sanctions if there is any seriousness in the attempts to eliminate the policy of apartheid practiced by that regime, which the international community considers to be a crime against humanity.\nHere we pay tribute to the struggle of the people of Namibia under its sole, legitimate leadership, the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). We pay tribute also to the struggle of the people of Azania and its liberation movement, and we call for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners, foremost among whom is the African hero Nelson Mandela. At the same time we affirm that the struggle of the peoples of southern Africa cannot be crushed by the racist, military war machine.\nTo play a positive role we must provide more support to the struggle of those peoples and the front-line African States as they face the aggression perpetrated against them by the racist Pretoria regime. We are in duty bound to face up to the close collaboration between the two racist regimes in Israel and South Africa, particularly in the military and nuclear fields, in view of the gravity of that collaboration for the Arab and African peoples.\nWe are pleased that this session's agenda includes a new item calling for the convening, under the auspices of the United Nations, of an international conference to define terrorism and distinguish it from the struggle of peoples for national liberation. My country has had the honour of supporting that idea from its inception since it would respond to the importance the international community attaches to the question of terrorism. At the same time, it would counter the attempts of some Western countries and some racist countries, to label as terrorist the legitimate struggles being waged by countries enduring colonialist and racist occupation - in particular the peoples of Palestine, South Africa and Namibia - and by their liberation movements.\nIn that context we should like to state that we condemn terrorism, which claims the lives of innocent people. We also condemn the State terrorism practiced by the racist regimes in Palestine, South Africa and Namibia and by some countries to undermine independent national regimes. At the same time, we caution against the confusion deliberately created by some countries that wish to discourage international unanimity and use \\\"combating terrorism\\\" in an attempt to eliminate the legitimate struggle of peoples to determine their own political, economic and social destinies. We turn now to problems facing different parts of the world.\nWe hope that the question of Western Sahara will be resolved in a way that guarantees the right of its people to self-determination. To that end, we call for direct negotiations between the parties concerned.\nWe also call for a political solution to the question of Cyprus that guarantees the island's independence, territorial integrity and non-aligned status.\nWe support the efforts being made by Democratic Kampuchea as well as the efforts to achieve the reunification of the two Koreas by peaceful and democratic means. We call for the Olympic Games scheduled for 1988 to be hosted jointly by the two Koreas. We support the struggles of the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean to promote their political and economic independence  in particular, we support the struggle of the people and leadership of Cuba to defend the revolution, and we call for an end to the economic blockade against it.\nWe are optimistic that there can be a political settlement and national reconciliation in Afghanistan and continued dialogue among the countries of Indo-China and members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), and we hope that security, peace and stability will prevail in South-East Asia.\nWe welcome the peace plan adopted by the Heads of State of Central America in Guatemala, and we hope that it will be a first step towards more positive relations in that area that will lead the peoples of its countries to security, stability and economic progress. There is no doubt that peace and stability in that area would be more readily achieved if the Peace Plan were supported by the international community, if obstacles to it were removed and if an end were put to all designs and aggressive actions aimed at undermining the sovereignty of Nicaragua and its national system. \nThere is no doubt that the imminent declaration of an agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States to eliminate intermediate range nuclear missiles has given international efforts fresh momentum towards progress in the only option\nopen to us: nuclear disarmament or the inevitable extinction of all humanity. Such an agreement would represent the first possibility of eliminating a category of nuclear weapons, and would be a historic event reflecting a new and increasing awareness of the realities of our nuclear age and a step towards meeting the will of the international community to achieve general and complete disarmament under effective international control. That agreement, as also the prospective summit meeting between the Soviet Union and the United States, could also be considered the embodiment of a new realistic attitude in dealing with international problems of our time. This approach, initiated by the Soviet Union, and deserving of our high appreciation, is based on relations of good-neighbourliness and co-operation in international affairs and on replacing lack of trust and confrontation with mutual co-operation and common interest. It is a living expression of the new way of thinking that is needed in our interdependent world and indispensable to common peace efforts. We hope that that meeting will be crowned with success, and we look forward to its outcome prevailing among all the peoples of the world in all fields and contributing to international efforts to find just solutions to complicated problems.\nWe also look forward to new, effective and fruitful measures to halt the spread of the arms race to outer space, to the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction, to the conclusion of a treaty banning the use of chemical weapons, and, in particular, to early agreement on a nuclear-test ban. With regard to the Indian Ocean, to which we belong, we look forward to new developments that will contribute to international efforts to convene the Conference on the Indian Ocean in Colombo as a necessary step towards implementing the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.\nThe magnitude of the challenges faced by developing countries and the lack of progress in establishing a new international economic order are matters of grave concern, especially for the least-developed countries. The international community recently affirmed the indissoluble link between disarmament and development. This affirmation requires new practical measures to increase international co-operation in all technical, scientific and economic fields, measures that contribute towards ending backwardness in development - particularly in developing countries facing economic problems, financial questions and the world debt crisis - and make possible international economic co-operation based on mutual benefit and equality thus enabling all mankind to use its potential to work for development, and making it possible to deal with international economic problems in a way that responds to the economic and social requirements of our peoples. \nWhen we speak of lessening the effects of the economic crisis, we should like to see tangible measures taken to free international trade, improve the loans extended to developing countries and alleviate the debt problem being borne by the developing countries. That is the way to deal with the crisis which, if left unchecked, will halt the development process in several developing countries. We need such solutions if we are to restructure international economic relations and give new impetus to global negotiations aimed at establishing a new international economic order. At the same time, we call upon the international community to take urgent action to achieve the official-development\u2014assistance target agreed upon during the Third Development Decade, together with measures within the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries, to enable those countries to overcome the effects of the economic crisis and to promote development efforts. We feel that this historic turn requires us to make serious collective efforts if we are to assume our common responsibility. \nWe affirm that multilateralism provides the ideal international framework to deal with those problems and is a sound basis for international peace and security. In a world characterized by increasing interdependence among States and by common issues, a collective approach is indispensable to meet the challenges before us. In this respect we believe that the United Nations can play a major, central role in achieving our objectives and that there is adequate machinery in the United Nations system. The problem lies in the obstacles imposed by some countries to hinder the progress that could be made through the use of that machinery.\nWe wish to place on record our support for the administrative and financial reform of the United Nations, so long as that reform is not used to achieve practical ends prejudicial to the United Nations Charter, which declares that the Organization is based on the principles of the sovereign equality of all its Members.\nThis session has begun in hope and optimism. We look forward to a fruitful outcome translating that optimistic outlook into a new reality on which we can congratulate ourselves at the next session, one that will inspire us to work in the same collective spirit and take new, positive steps for the preservation of human civilization and the creation of a better would for succeeding generations of which we can all be justly proud.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI have pleasure in extending to Mr, Peter Florin my sincerest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. It is particularly gratifying in that he is a representative of the German Democratic Republic, to which my country, Kuwait, is tied by the strongest bonds and mutual interests. I am confident that his experience and wisdom will lead this session to success and positive results.\nI also wish to express our appreciation of the efforts of his predecessor as President, our colleague Mr, Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, the Foreign Minister of friendly Bangladesh, during the forty-first session.\nI must also praise the strenuous efforts exerted by the Secretary-General, Mr, Javier Perez de Cuellar, in dealing with the various international issues to which he sincerely and resolutely seeks appropriate solutions while highlighting the significance of the role of the United Nations in achieving and maintaining international peace and security. We the Member States of the United Nations must spare no effort in helping him not only to uphold the Organization and its important role in the world, but also to enhance that role with a view to ensuring the better future we desire for ourselves and coming generations.\nThe present and future of the United Nations depend on the uninterrupted and unconditional flow of material and moral support from the Member States. Of primary importance are political support, the honouring of pledges and total commitment to the obligations and responsibilities defined in the Charter and in resolutions. In the absence of a true commitment to the implementation of the Organization's resolutions, which spell out the will of the international community, our Organization would be no more than a rostrum for people who cry out and give utterance to wishes in words which ate promptly dispersed by the wind or submerged in adverse facts, leaving behind cries that undermine the prospects of peace and human well-being and progress.\nThe Prince of the State of Kuwait# His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, spoke of this in a recent statement as follows: \\\"The United Nations is the world's conscience and executive power. The conscience is in the General Assembly and the power is wielded by the Security Council. Of the latter body the world expects mandatory resolutions which reaffirm its unshakable desire for a solution to the crises that threaten international peace and security.\\\"\nKuwait, which urged and supported the consolidation of United Nations processes last year, believes that it is the duty of all Member States to honour their financial obligations as defined in the Charter to ensure the proper performance by the United Nations of its historic role in the service of world peace.\nThe leaders of the Muslim nation bestowed upon Kuwait the honour and responsibility of presiding over the fifth summit Conference of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in Kuwait. His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah will.' head the Organization for the next three years. \nAt their Conference in Kuwait, the leaders of the Muslim nation discussed the political and economic challenges facing the world, and the Islamic world in particular. That summit Conference adopted a set of resolutions on regional and international issues. His Highness the Chairman of the Conference pledged to\noversee the implementation of those resolutions so that, God willing, they may bear fruit.\nThe leaders of the Muslim nation accorded the highest priority in their deliberations and resolutions to the question of holy Jerusalem - Al-Quds-al-Sharif - the cradle of religions and civilizations. That was hardly surprising; such priority flows from the basic objective of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. It constitutes the fulfilment, recognition and discharge by the Conference of its religious obligation towards the Holy City. The leaders therefore reaffirmed the imperative necessity of preserving its Islamic and Arab character and reiterated that all Zionist legislation concerning Jerusalem are null and void.\nThe overriding concern of the leaders of the Muslim nations in their Kuwait meeting was the Iraq-Iran war, which this month entered its eighth year. This is a war between two principal members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. It was regrettable that Iran saw fit to boycott that important meeting, under false pretexts, and that it mounted an unjust propaganda campaign against the meeting and the State of Kuwait, despite the considerable efforts made by Kuwait, the host, country, and by the leaders of the other Muslim countries, to persuade officials in Iran of the necessity and usefulness of participating in the meeting to present and defend their views and listen to the views of others. But Iran has been adamant in its boycott of the meeting and rejection of its outcome and unanimous resolutions, which were a sincere, conscious contribution to the quest for a quick and just end to that war .\nThe Conference's resolution on the war stemmed from and was inspired by the teachings of true Islam. It was an expression of the leaders' resolve to fulfil their duties towards two Muslim neighbours. It showed an awareness by the leaders of their historical and religious responsibility to preserve the unity and coherence of the Muslim nation and their desire to avoid further shedding of Muslim blood in vain. The resolution was aimed at upholding the right of the peoples of the two countries to enjoy their wealth and resources in peace, security and stability, and the right of the countries and peoples of the region to protect themselves from the dire consequences of the continuation and expansion of the war,\nBy contrast, Iran's policy has been to exacerbate matters and to push the war towards perilous extremes. The flames of that war have started to engulf other countries not parties to the conflict, thereby seriously setting back the international economy. International security and freedom of navigation in the Arabian Gulf have been obstructed and jeopardized by strikes at ships from countries not parties to the conflict. The Arabian Gulf has always been a bridge of love for nations of the region, an oasis of co-operation, security and peace, and a source of well-being for the world. We have to preserve its distinct character} that is our collective responsibility, we the countries of the region.\nThis war erupted, we in Kuwait have been aware of its dangers and have sensed in it and in its undercurrents and developments the potential for expansion. Our preoccupation with the necessity for peace, neighbourliness and the tenets and ties of Islam, prompted us to initiate contacts, both on our own and collectively contacts with other States in the Gulf Co-operation Council, and other regional and international organizations, through the League of Arab states, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations, in an attempt to bring this war to a prompt and just end. Subsequently, we tried to persuade the leaders of Iran to opt for peace - just as our brothers in Iraq had done - to heed the international will as reflected in numerous resolutions and initiatives.\nBut the Government of Iran rejected all those sincere calls, initiatives and resolutions. It erroneously and arbitrarily interpreted Kuwait's actions and endeavours to achieve this noble aim and thereby set out to target us - though we have never been a party to the conflict. Since 1984, Iran has been striking at our tankers in the waters of the Arabian Gulf. We have exercised the utmost self-restraint in the face of those provocations and assaults. We have no wish to see them intensify and expand. We have sought an end to them and have had recourse to international legitimacy as embodied in the Security Council, with a view to halting the attacks and safeguarding the interests of countries not parties to the conflict,\nNevertheless, the leaders in Iran are determined to continue to deprive us of the secure flow of our oil exports, thereby undermining our ability to meet our domestic and international obligations and play our role as contributors to the economic development programmes of developing countries. Paced with such a posture, we had to make certain normal and habitual commercial arrangements - arrangements previously made by many other countries, including Iran itself to ensure safe passage to our tankers.\nIran raised an unjustified commotion about those commercial measures, this was a ruse by Iran to divert attention from its policies and practices directed against us. This Iranian posture is one of the most ominous aspects of the escalation currently witnessed by our region. In formulating its foreign policy, Kuwait has always held that, the security of the Gulf region is the exclusive responsibility of the countries of the region. That strategically important region supplies the world with a valuable, indeed indispensable, resource and makes a considerable contribution to the development and well being of the world. The region must therefore remain free of tensions and crises if major-Power rivalry and sinister foreign interventions are to be avoided, the use or threat of the use of force should have no place in the region.\nIran's determination to continue the war, its expansion of the hostilities, its threats to and bombing of ships of countries not parties to the conflict, its mining of waters throughout the Gulf, have brought matters to their present, state, turned the Arabian Gulf into a highly volatile tinder box and led to the presence of foreign fleets and warships, each seeking to protect interests and freedom of navigation in that international waterway. It has now become clear, particularly through developments over the past few weeks, that Iran is determined to infringe upon our sovereignty and territorial integrity by all means. Residential and industrial areas in some parts of Kuwait, as well as its islands, have come under attack by Iranian missiles in overt acts of aggression that have no purpose but expanding of this war, further fanning its flames and increasing the number of its victims.\nMoreover, the inviolability of our embassy in Teheran was breached, its members were detained and mistreated, its contents were ransacked and burned and the embassy was, and still is, occupied in violation of the most basic rules of international law and norms of diplomatic behaviour. The tragic incident in Holy Mecca during one of God's holiest and more glorious days bears witness to Iranian irresponsibility. From this rostrum we call upon Iran to desist from such practices and to respect the rules and laws that govern relations between countries and ensure good-neighbourliness, in the interests of the region.\nGood-neighbourliness can never be achieved through aggression and provocation.\nOnly through co-operation, cohesion and fraternity can people live as good neighbours.\nThere is not a single war in contemporary history that has lasted as long as this one or has wrought as much destruction. There has never been so much effort, on the regional, international, individual and collective levels - as that which has been directed at putting an end to this war. The latest in the series of international efforts has been Security Council resolution 598 (1987). This has been a historic resolution indeed in terms of the very fact that it has been adopted, the balance, fairness and unanimity which have characterized it and the popular support and official enthusiasm it has generated.\nWe now find that this resolution could well be the last chance to secure a just and lasting peace between the two Muslim neighbours and ensure peace in the region. The responsibility for pressing ahead towards the implementation of the resolution is shared by all. History will judge us mercilessly should we fail to make the effort and exert the pressure that will ensure implementation. Interests among countries have become so shared and interlocked that there are no longer any limited conflicts that affect only those who are party to is. Therefore, we are all partners in good and evil, as well as in war and in peace. So let us all work together for peace, and while hailing Iraq's acceptance of this resolution, let us call upon Iran to accept it fully and unambiguously and implement it without delay so that the curtain may fall on the last act of this tragedy which is at odds with heaven's values, let alone earth's laws. While we fully appreciate the unremitting efforts of the Secretary-General to implement the said resolution, especially his recent trip to both Tehran and Baghdad, we believe that we are all in duty-bound to support fully his endeavour without falling into the snares of deception or chasing a mirage.\nThe Palestinian question was at the forefront of the agenda and attracted the attention of leaders of the Muslim nation during their meeting at Kuwait. In-depth and detailed consideration was given to the current statement; the continued suffering of the Palestinian people under the sway and oppression of the Israeli occupation forces; the continued occupation of the Arab territories, most notably Holy al-Quds, and the preventing of the Palestinian people from establishing their independent State on their national soil, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation organization (PLO).\nThe leaders' resolutions expressed the unity of purpose and the awareness of a common destiny with regard to this sacred cause. The leaders found that moving the issue along the path of a solution will be achieved only through an international conference held under the auspices of the United Nations and attended by all parties on an equal footing, including the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\nWe in Kuwait have always considered and will continue to consider the Palestinian cause as our principal concern. It is a cause that involves our dignity and credibility as Arabs. Thus, while thanking the countries and regional organizations that have supported the convening of the international conference, we ask those countries that wield decisive influence over Israel to join the mainstream of the overwhelming international majority and pressure Israel in to ensuring the holding of that conference, whose purpose is to establish peace in the Middle East region and secure the Palestinian people's right of return to their homeland from the torment of homelessness and ruin.\nSince the brutal Israeli invasion of its territory five years ago, Lebanon continues to see parts of its native soil in the South languishing under the heel of Israeli military occupation. Despite numerous resolutions by the Security Council demanding Israeli withdrawal, Israel continues to refuse to withdraw in pursuance of its policy of expansion at the expense of others, interference in Lebanon's domestic affairs, undermining its security and destabilizing its independence. The world community must force Israel to withdraw from all Lebanese territory. We are also required to stand firmly by Lebanon and support the steadfastness of its people in order to ensure Lebanon's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and the security of its people and institutions.\nThe situation in Afghanistan continues to be a source of great concern to Kuwait. That question was taken up by leaders of the Muslim nation in Kuwait.\nThey have demanded the withdrawal of foreign forces and supported ongoing efforts by the United Nations to reach a just solution to this issue, securing the return to their homes of all Afghan refugees, non-intervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and the preservation of its Islamic and non-aligned character.\nWe in Kuwait welcome the constructive efforts of the Secretary-General, through his Special Representative, and hope that the negotiating parties may show sufficient flexibility in their endeavours to reach a solution that ensures the region's safety and security. With the same attention and sense of historic responsibility accorded to the study of Zionism and Israel's continued occupation of Arab territories, the Muslim leaders in Kuwait discussed the question of racism, the persistent occupation of Namibia and South Africa's repeated attacks against its neighbours, the front-line States. They found that a comprehensive and sincere boycott of the racist regime in South Africa is the only means of forcing it to respond to the will of the international community and respect the rights of the black majority, primary among which is their right to be treated as equals.\nKuwait has always supported the legitimate and courageous struggle of the Namibian people, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) , and believes that it is no longer permissible or fair to let Security Council resolution 435 (1978) be held hostage to elements extraneous to that resolution and detrimental to the achievement its legitimate objectives, namely peace and security in the region.\nOn the basis of its commitment to support international and regional efforts towards a peaceful solution of political problems, Kuwait views with satisfaction the signs of agreement among Central American countries in the development of well-thought-out and approved bases for solving the political problems of that region in a manner that precludes super-Power intervention and manipulation of situations to serve their own ends. We support the aspirations of the region's nations to an environment of tranquillity and stability wherein the national energies may be focused' on development, reconstruction and the achievement of human well-being.\nAmong the primary concerns of the Muslim nation's leaders during their meeting in Kuwait was the issue of terrorism - the phenomenon that has spread in our world today to the extent that it now threatens the very foundations of world stability. The leaders expressed their concern and dismay at the alarming proportions which that phenomenon had now reached and declared their utter rejection of the tendentious attempts by anti-Islam forces to link terrorism to Islam.\nBoth in essence and substance, Islam rejects violence in whatever shape or form because it is a faith based on affection and fraternity and depends, in precepts and practice, on dialogue and persuasion. The Muslim nation is willing to co-operate among its members and with the world community to eradicate international terrorism and highlight the differences between terrorism and the sacred right of peoples to wage a legitimate liberation struggle. To that end, the leaders supported the convening of an international conference under United Nations auspices to draft a definition of terrorism.\nWhenever signs of concord in the relations between the two super-Powers appear on the horizon, their positive effects are reflected on the peace and security of the whole world. In that connection, Kuwait welcomes the tentative agreement reached between the United States of America and the Soviet Union on eliminating their medium-range missiles and nuclear warheads, and hopes that that will be the beginning of an ongoing process that leads to disarmament.\nAnnouncement of that understanding gave peace-loving peoples hope for the dawning of a new era in which co-operation will prevail among the world's major Powers instead of the rivalry which has squandered huge resources and diverted them away from their real functions of serving mankind and upholding peace. In the interests of peace, we call upon the super-Powers to give regional wars and conflicts the same attention they have accorded to their unresolved bilateral issues. We in Kuwait believe that preserving the lives of people, wherever they may be, must be our goal, because man is the maker of peace and progress and the generator of their motive power.\nIn the turmoil of the political situation of today's world, the Islamic Summit Conference was held and concluded its work under the shadow of critical international economic conditions. The leaders discussed those problems thoroughly in the light of their commitment to the right of Muslim and other nations of the world to a secure and stable life, economic development and social well-being.\nThroughout, the participants in the Conference were able to steer, with God's help, the ship of the Islamic Conference clear of storms and rocks towards a new horizon where Muslims' blood is spared and their ranks closed, while basking in brotherhood, co-operation and peace.\nWe confidently hope that the United Nations - the living model of international co-operation - will benefit from the success of the Islamic Summit Conference, to which my country, Kuwait, served as host.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMay I begin by congratulating you. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. We look on your election, as well as on other elections to office, not as a matter of routine but as an expression of our conviction that each and every Member State has a constructive role to play in the deliberations of this world Assembly, and we are convinced that you will fulfil your role with distinction. Our congratulations go also to the other officers who have been elected, as well as to the outgoing President for his positive contribution in leading the work of the forty-first session. \nI also wish to pay tribute to the untiring efforts of our Secretary-General, Mr, Perez de Cuellar, for the persistent active role he is playing in the service of the Organization in trying to bring together parties to a number of conflicts to reach negotiated solutions of their problems, such efforts deserve our full support.\nIt has been 20 years since the Head of Government of Malta last addressed the Assembly. The newly elected Government of my country naturally faces hard and urgent tasks at home. But fully conscious that domestic issues should not be allowed to overshadow our equally important role as a member of the international community of nations, I have taken this opportunity to confirm our confidence in the role the United Nations has to play in the maintenance of peace in the world, the enhancement of security for each and every Member State, the substitution of dialogue and negotiations for armed conflict, and the encouragement of co-operation at all levels and across the barriers of race, ideology, size, power and wealth for the welfare of mankind. At the same time, we are fully aware that this potential for positive action has not yet been fully exploited and, indeed, at times it may appear that it has been abused, misused or ignored in the pursuit of perceived national interests.\nNational interests cannot be ignored. We are here as individual nations/ some of us grouped in formal or informal joint defence, economic or regional interests. Yet our presence here should be a declaration of faith in the common interest of humanity beyond the limitations of frontiers, and our main objective should be to harmonize national interests for our mutual benefit.\nMalta has always believed in these ideals, and our initiative 20 years ago in this Hall, when we launched the idea of the sea and the ocean floor beyond national jurisdiction as being the common heritage of mankind, is evidence of this. The progress of this initiative over the years, under different administrations and in the context of ever-evolving political and economic realities  should encourage us to be both bold in our ideas and more active in pursuing them.\nMy party is now in Government in Malta and my presence here is a confirmation that the same ideals which inspired my predecessor, Mr. George Borg Olivier, guide us today.\nIn this connection I should like to submit two considerations which seem to me to be of real importance in this period between the signing of the Convention on the Law of the Sea and its fully coming into force.\nThe first is that there is a great need for some kind of forum where the representatives of States can meet with those of the United Nations specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, in order to discuss ocean affairs in an integrated manner. No such forum exists today. Several different proposals worthy of consideration have been advanced to fill this gap. The most important thing is that, in view of the interrelatedness of the multiple uses of ocean space on which the Convention is so insistent, the gap be filled. The second point is that a major result of the Convention, especially with the establishment of the exclusive economic zones, has been the vast extension of national jurisdiction over large areas of ocean space. It is also clear that many nations will however be unable to benefit from the new resources at their disposal, either directly or in co-operation with other nations, unless they are able to establish effective management systems. It is not difficult to realize, however, that many nations will not be able to set up the appropriate national institutions without at least the scientific and technical help of the international community.\nLet me take this opportunity to expound to this Assembly the policy of my Government and the way it will be manifested in our attitude during this session of the General Assembly and at other international gatherings. The Maltese people believe in democracy, where the rule of law is supreme; where governments change as a result of the freely expressed will of the people at regular elections. We do not take things for granted, and we do not wish to convey any chauvinistic impression. Our belief in a pluralistic democracy has passed through a period of trial, but it has passed the test and it is the stronger because of it.\nAs a result, I speak as the Head of Government of a nation that has recently introduced an important amendment to its Constitution reflecting a consensus in Parliament. Malta is declared today a neutral State actively pursuing peace, security and social progress among all nations by adhering to a policy of non-alignment. We intend to adhere to this constitutional provision and to interpret it with the responsibility and seriousness that it deserves, we want to engender confidence. We mean what we say and we say what we mean.\nNeutrality does not imply for us a passive disinterested role in all that goes on around us. To start with, we are not colourless in our ideological beliefs and without condemning the beliefs of others we Intend to defend and stand up for the democratic, social and cultural values in which we believe. We attach great importance to human rights and to the freedom to exercise such rights without undue restriction for the benefit of the individual and of the society in which he lives. Such freedom should not be restricted by race, creed or sex and therefore we cannot support the apartheid policy in South Africa, and in so far as it is in our power to do so we shall seek not so much to condemn such a policy verbally as to make a positive contribution towards its elimination. We do not believe that armed conflict is the best way to bring about such changes; simmering confrontation, which inevitably bursts out in armed conflict from time to time, is not to be supported; honest negotiations and constructive dialogue - and the United Nations should be the ideal place for these - should be encouraged. Guided by these ideals, we do not want to be associated with sterile statements of condemnation, especially since routine condemnations tend to become stereotyped and discriminatory in nature. Worse still, they are not likely to make any positive contribution to the initiation of dialogue and resolution of problems.\nOn our agenda we are faced with many situations of conflict, some of which have defied solution for more than a generation. We should not let ourselves fall into the position of accepting such issues as a permanent feature of the international scene. Boldness of vision and a break with routine sterile attitudes is required if solutions are to be found. The change that is required is not so much one of military might or geographical distribution, as one in the minds of men, a change that can best come about by enhancing confidence in one another. We look on the recent agreement in principle between the United States of America and the Soviet Union on the elimination of short- and medium-range nuclear missiles as a positive step along the lines we have just stated. As the representatives of other States have already remarked, we should all be careful to see that the easing of tension at the focal points of confrontation does not lead to an increase in tension on the flanks.\nThe Mediterranean, right in the centre of which Malta sits, is both a focal point of confrontation and the flank of other points of conflict. We do not pretend to have any magic formula for resolving the several, interrelated conflicts and strands of tension that criss-cross that historic sea. What we strongly believe is that allocating blame and mutual accusations are negative in character. All Mediterranean countries, big or small, African, Asian or European, as well as their allies and friends, including those non-regional States with a military presence there, have a role to play. No one can be ignored} no one can impose on others; no imposed solutions, including military ones, will be lasting; and we cannot rely on the passage of time to produce a solution. A solution has to be the product of positive action, through dialogue and negotiations, if need be in an ad hoc international conference in which all interested parties will participate on an equal footing.\nMentioning first the Mediterranean in general as an area of conflict that needs urgent consideration does not imply that we are not conscious of other areas that demand our attention. We note with interest and appreciation the efforts put forth by the Secretary-General, the Security Council, the General Assembly itself, regional groupings and individual countries to bring about peaceful solutions to long-festering wounds.\nSuch are the relations between Israel and the Arab States; the sorry state of the Palestinians, who are still denied a State of their own; the plight of war-torn Lebanon, vividly depicted by President Amin Gemayel in this Assembly a little while ago; the escalating and dangerous tension in the Gulf resulting from the long-drawn-out conflict between Iran and Iraq; Afghanistan, which is still occupied by foreign forces; the explosive situation in Central America, not yet pacified by the recent agreement reached by the States of the region; Namibia where the people are still denied self-determination in an era when colonialism is an anachronism; the sorry situation in Kampuchea where foreign troops are still present; Fiji, which recently added another element of uncertainty in that area; and, nearer home, Cyprus, still a divided island.\nAll efforts to defuse tension and bring peace deserve not only our praise, but, more important still, the genuine support of the world community. Each of us in his own way has a role to play; the most powerful States, as well as the other permanent members of the Security Council, have a very special responsibility. As long as they go on enjoying a privileged position in the United Nations, they must also assume special responsibilities. But we would stress that we do not share the simplistic approach of those who view the unfolding world developments in terms of super-Power rivalry only. \nWorld expenditure on armaments, usually at the expense of social and economic development, particularly in developing countries, is not attributable solely to super-Power activity. There cannot be flourishing arms producers unless there are also willing arms purchasers; and a surfeit of armaments, be they nuclear or conventional, can only encourage conflict and lead to the temptation of pressing claims and solving issues by the use of those armaments. As a small island with negligible armed forces, we look on this situation with stark realism, fully conscious of its implications for our security, independence and territorial integrity.\nA common strand in what I have been saying is that while we all face global responsibility - and indeed the United Nations came into being as a direct result of global conflict - many of today's problems are regional in character. The Importance of geographic regions was not lost on the founders of the United Nations, and we have the regional economic and social Commissions. Other regional developments have taken place since then, both within and outside the United Nations system. Perhaps the time has come for a serious study of the role of regional institutions within the United Nations system as a positive and practical contribution to more effective co-operation in the various fields of security and economic and social development. We may have to supplement the present continental regional concept with overlapping but equally valid regional approaches. The Mediterranean is one area which springs to mind automatically, and indeed in the field of environment, progress has already been made. We are happy to host in Malta a United Nations regional oil pollution combating centre.\nRegional centres for the advancement of marine science and technology ate foreseen in articles 276 and 277 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but none has so far been established. My Government proposed the setting up of such a centre for the Mediterranean region at the fifth ordinary meeting of the contracting parties to the Barcelona Convention, in Athens last September. We proposed that the centre's structure should be based on the models of the EUREKA and EUROMAR projects. This means, among other things, that both private and public enterprises, as well as national and international organizations, should be involved in the financing of projects judged to be of general benefit. We believe that the Mediterranean region is an ideal context for pilot undertakings of this kind, in which the co-operation of both developing and developed countries is desirable and reciprocally beneficial.\nI should like to stress the view that funding agencies in the fields of development and co-operation, both national and international, should orient their support much more than hitherto in the direction of scientific research and technological development projects. So far these have tended to be neglected; yet it is in these areas that over time investment is most likely to make the most enduring contribution to bettering the relationship between North and South in a constructive way.\nSecurity, independence and territorial integrity are basic to law, order and progress, but unless they lead to improvement in the quality of life and the dignity of the individual they remain hollow words. Indeed, we are all aware of instances of the domination of a people being perpetuated, only the dominators having changed. The world community cannot ignore or condone such developments.\nHowever, there are more genuine instances in which, in spite of serious efforts by Governments of independent States, the goal of viable economic and social development has been found to be rather elusive - quite often owing to circumstances over which one has little or no control. When these external causes are dramatic, such as natural disasters, world co-operation tends to be more easily forthcoming than when the causes are chronic and less dramatic. As a European country, Malta looks forward to the time when all Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals, is united. However, that ideal can be reached only step by step. As a nation with a Western European character, history, culture and way of life, not to mention our overwhelming economic and commercial ties, Malta has had long-established co-operation with the European Economic Community (EEC) through an Agreement of Association. My Government feels that the time has now arrived to seek the right conditions to enable us further to enhance this association by becoming a full member of the Economic Community.\nIt is a well-known fact that political issues cannot be separated from social and economic issues. The development of our economies and our social structure is a corollary of wider political issues. It is a recognized fact that security and development are necessarily interrelated. Malta, as a small developing country, is aware of the unsatisfactory state of the world economy. It is for us a matter of deep concern that the international community has still not resolved such problems as large external and internal imbalances, instability in exchange rates, reduced flows of resources to developing countries, limited access to markets, particularly for the exports of developing countries, and the low prices of primary commodities.\nIn pursuing adjustment programmes and instituting a number of wide-ranging policy measures and reforms, some developing countries have had to undergo tremendous economic and social upheavals. Malta is no exception. As a small developing country with a net import economy and foreign earnings mainly from the export of manufactured goods and tourism, the international economic environment conditions our economy.\nMy country's struggle for economic viability has to be conducted within the constraints of a developing island economy limited by its small size and its lack of resources. It is imperative that friendly countries which are bigger and stronger assist us in overcoming such difficulties.\nThe world economy is passing through a difficult stage, but this should be an added reason for closer co-operation between the developed and the developing countries, the importers and the exporters, the free-market and the centrally planned economies, the commodity producers and consumers. The tendency to protectionism is understood but world progress cannot be achieved unless there is a balance of benefits spread as evenly as possible among the various parties.\nMay I also call upon the organizations and specialized agencies of the United Nations system to increase their financial and technical assistance to Malta. At this point I wish to reiterate my country's disagreement with the criterion which has been adopted by the United Nations system and continues to be the yardstick for assisting small developing countries such as my own, namely, that based on the per capita national income. This has effectively cut off the much-needed resources for the development of my country. While some headway has been made in reversing such a misguided approach, much more is needed in order to bring to fruition the efforts of countries which are dependent on outside assistance in their development process.\nFrom time immemorial Malta has been a meeting-place of different cultures. Peoples of different nationalities have transformed our island into a microcosm of world history. The many tourists and personalities who visit our country, with its rich cultural heritage, stable and friendly environment, are agreed that this small island in the Mediterranean could serve as a place where human-resources development could flourish and its national experiences in the educational and technical fields could be fruitfully put at the disposal of other countries. Today I would like to reiterate my Government's willingness to offer Malta as an international centre for academic studies where facilities exist for training programmes, meetings and seminars; where the attempts to achieve understanding through dialogue and negotiations could evolve in a quiet ambiance; where the warm traditional hospitality of the Maltese people could be utilized for the benefit of nationals of other countries. The International Ocean Institute, the Mediterranean Institute and the International Environment Institute are already in place at the service of the International community. The setting up in Malta in the very near future of an institute on aging, within the framework of the United Nations, will enhance further activities in training at all levels in skills relevant to the implementation of the International Plan of Action on Aging.\nDuring the last few days the Assembly has been witness to many expressions of support for peace and co-operation among all States; for a halt to armed conflicts; for radical reductions in and in some cases the abolition of, entire categories of nuclear weapons; for the cessation of nuclear tests; for a reduction in military expenditure; for agreements on multilateral arms control; for the improvement of the economic and social conditions of all peoples of the world, in particular those of the developing countries; for the promotion of and respect for human rights; and for other noble causes.\nAgreement on these complex issues must be pursued vigorously and with a sense of urgency. For 42 years this Organization, with its specialized agencies, has been contributing towards this end. One thing is certain: many problems still exist. While these goals have inspired us all along, we are still far away from an ideal world.\nFar from being discouraged, we in Malta are determined to carry out an independent foreign policy for the benefit of our people and as a contribution to the peace and stability of our region and the rest of the world. We are friends to all and foes to none, and our aim is to contribute to a peaceful solution of international disputes, renouncing violence and war as an instrument of policy.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt gives me pleasure to begin my statement by congratulating you, Sir, on the great trust accorded you by\u00b7 the representatives of Member States in electing you President of the General Assembly, to wish you every success in your task.\nI should also like on this occasion to express my appreciation for the efforts of your predecessor, Mr. Choudhury, President of the last session of the General Assembly, who was entrusted with important tasks.\nMore than seven years have now passed since the outbreak of the conflict between Iraq and Iran, during which time it has been discussed on many occasions in both the General Assembly and the Security Council. On all those occasions we expressed our views on the subject and my present statement will be limited to it alone.\nThe war imposed on Iraq, as representatives know, is in the forefront of the Issues that concern my country at present and is also in the forefront of the Issues which preoccupy this Organization and the international community.\nMembers will no doubt recall that 1986 was an important year in the course of the aggressive, expansionist war imposed by the Iranian regime on Iraq. In February of that year the Iranian regime invaded and occupied the Iraqi port city of Pao following its consideration of the grave situation in the area resulting from that act of aggression, the Security Council on the twenty-fourth of that month unanimously adopted its resolution 582 (1986), which the members of the Council formulated independently, uninfluenced by either party to the conflict, and in which they set out the procedures for a comprehensive settlement in accordance with, the provisions of the Charter and the rules of international law. In the face of the rejection of that resolution by the Iranian regime, the Security Council considered the conflict once again and adopted unanimously, on 8 October 1986, resolution 588 (1986), which affirmed the necessity of compliance with the previous resolution. Once again the Iranian regime rejected the resolution - a matter which led the Security Council to issue its statement of 22 December 1986 in which it reiterated its call for implementation of the comprehensive settlement procedures set forth in its resolution 582 (1986). The Iranian regime rejected that call, too Throughout that period the Iranian regime was making preparations for a large- scale operation to invade Iraq which its leaders named \\\"the final and decisive offensive\\\". At the same time, those very leaders were preparing for a meeting of their agents in Tehran for the purpose, as they claimed, of \\\"determining the future of Iraq\\\" in all its aspects. The said meeting began on 24 December 1986 and continued until the twenty-ninth of the same month, with direct and active participation of Iranian officials at the highest levels. On the night of 24/25 of that month, while the meeting was still in session, the Iranian regime launched a new invasion with the object of occupying the Basrah area, when its attempt was foiled, it undertook another operation on the night of 8/9 January 1987, also in the Basrah area. Yet another attempt was staged on the night of 13/14 of the same month in the central area of the front.\nThe aims the Iranian regime intended to achieve by those operations are quite clear. Having failed over six years to occupy the whole of Iraq by large-scale offensives launched every year, that regime, in December 1986 and January 1987, targeted the Basrah area with a view to establishing therein a puppet government controlled by Iran, and proceeding thereafter to realize its dream of occupying the whole of Iraq, threatening the Arab Gulf States, and achieving regional expansion at their expense. The Israel people and its armed forces, however, thwarted those pernicious designs by dint of an ability based on deep faith in what is right and on the just cause of self-defence in the face of aggression and evil. \nAmidst these grave developments, on 13 January 1987 the Secretary-General of the United Nations issued a call for a meeting of the Security Council at the foreign ministers' level to discuss the situation between Iran and Iraq. The Secretary-General's initiative reflected a heightened state of concern for the grave implications of the continuation of the aggressive, expansionist war waged by Iran against Iraq. The intensified international efforts undertaken on the basis of this initiative were crowned by the unanimous adoption on 20 July last of a binding Security Council resolution, namely, resolution 598 (1987), which expressed the wish of the international community to achieve peace without delay and promote a comprehensive, durable settlement of the conflict.\nIraq expressed its position on the resolution in clear terms only two days after its adoption: it welcomed the resolution on the basis of a firm position of principle rooted in a commitment to peace and faith in resolving the conflict by peaceful means. Iraq stressed that it was prepared to implement the resolution as an indivisible whole and that it was keenly interested in having its provisions applied in full.\nNow Iraq did not welcome the resolution because it was an Iraqi resolution; nor did it do so because the resolution entailed any gains for Iraq. As a matter of fact, all the considerations pressed by Iran and those who worked behind the scenes in the Security Council to further Iran's interests were included in that resolution. Iraq welcomed resolution 598 (1987) because, in its view, it was a balanced resolution which contained the elements for a comprehensive settlement and because from the very beginning Iraq adopted the position of accepting the settlement of the conflict by peaceful means through the international Organization, on the basis of the Charter and international law.\nBy contrast, from 20 July to date, the Iranian regime has manoeuvred for position vis-\u00e0-vis the resolution and engaged in procrastinatory and delaying tactics, while contriving such ruses in expressing its position on the resolution as have no parallel in the history of dealing with Security Council resolutions. This attitude of Iran can mean only rejection of the resolution and insistence on continuing the war and aggression. Then, after the Secretary-General's visit to Tehran the Iranian regime began to present its position on the resolution in evasive terms by focusing on the question of responsibility for starting the aggression as the principal issue - and that was what the President of Iran focused on in his statement here.\nI shall therefore concentrate in my statement on this important question and its details so as to reveal the truth and make it clear to representatives as it is, not as those who call for the continuation of the war, the killing and destruction wish to project it - although we have explained this Question on previous occasions and in many documents circulated in this Organization, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, and to the Member States.\nIn 1979 when the new regime came to power in Iran, Iraq made a point of establishing good-neighbourly relations with it. That position by Iraq was an extension of its foreign policy and consistent with Iraq's paramount interests on the national and international levels. Iraq had among its priority concerns to ensure continuation of the comprehensive development plan that it had launched following the July 1968 Revolution, the advancement of the standard of living of the Iraqi people, the achievement of general evolution in the economic, cultural and social fields, and construction of the political and social institutions that enable the people to exercise their democratic rights.\nIn the field of external relations the objectives of Iraqi foreign policy included the achievement of stability in the region, non-intervention in the internal affairs of neighbouring countries, and settlement of differences by peaceful means. Those were the principles proclaimed in President Saddam Hussein's declaration of February 1980. It was a policy which it pursued both officially and actually, internally and externally, and which qualified Iraq to be selected to host the Seventh Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Second Summit Conference marking the twentieth anniversary of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\nThe basic interests of Iraq and its prominent international position were most closely linked to the preservation of security and stability and the maintenance of the best of relations with its neighbours and the other countries of the world. Iraq had no interest in creating problems either with those neighbours or with any other country of the world. In line with that approach in its foreign policy, Iraq gave the new regime in Iran a friendly reception and was among the first States to accord it recognition. At a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran at the Havana Conference in 1979, President Saddam Hussein emphasized Iraq's concern to maintain neighbourly relations based on non-interference in internal affairs and co-operation aimed at serving the Interests of peace and stability in the region. Iraq emphasized this approach again at a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries at the United Nations.\nThe Iranian regime, on the other hand, pursued an entirely different policy from the very beginning. The Iranian regime has, since its inception, maintained a hostile attitude towards Iraq. The regime  leadership expressed that attitude even before it came to power when, during his stay in France in 1978, Khomeini declared that changing the Government of Iraq constituted one of his priority objectives.\nThe Iranian regime, by reason of its ideology based on the theory of the divine jurisdiction of the claimed Imam over the whole Muslim community in the world as expounded in Khomeini's book The Jurisdiction of the Pagih, that is, the leading theologian - a book which assumes in the Iranian system the same role as that of Hitler's Mein Kampf in Nazi theory - proclaims the principle of the exportation of the revolution outside Iran as a binding obligation on the constitutional authorities of the Iranian State. That is why work on the so-called export of the Iranian revolution has been the main preoccupation of the Iranian Government, the most important element in defining its external relations and activities, and the major cause of all the aggression, disorder and insecurity from which the region has been suffering from the time that regime came to power in Iran until today\u00b7 In line with this anomalous course which it has insistently pursued, the Iranian regime has not concealed the fact that the primary objective of its revolution-exporting programme is to destroy the political and social system of Iraq, occupy Iraq and annex it as an Iranian dependency.\nWhile the occupation and subjugation of Iraq continue to be the primary objectives of Iranian expansionist plans, they are not by any means the only objectives. Ever since its inception the Iranian regime has resorted to terrorism and subversion and conducted propaganda campaigns against all the countries of the region and many countries of the world. It has committed open, armed aggression against Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other countries of the region; and Iranian armed forces have occupied parts of Lebanon and raised the Iranian flag there.\t-\nIt was supposed that relations between Iraq and Iran would be governed by a standing Agreement, namely, the 1975 Agreement. The 1975 Agreement, with its special characteristics, had been concluded to regulate border issues between the two countries and questions of security and stability along these borders as well as to ensure non-interference in internal affairs. Article 4 states that any violation of any part of the Agreement shall constitute a violation of the Agreement as a whole.\nFrom the beginning the Iranian regime proceeded to attack this Agreement and to treat it as suspect. Officials of the regime at various levels began to issue declarations of non-compliance with its provisions. Those declarations are documented in the records we have submitted to this Organization and to other international bodies and institutions. Furthermore, the Iranian Government brought back to Iran the puppet Barzani gang of plotters, who pose a threat to the unity of Iraq, and assisted that gang in committing acts of sabotage against Iraq. Iran had supported that same gang in all sorts of ways before the conclusion of the 1975 Agreement, but then ceased to support it, in compliance with the provisions of that Agreement.\nThese attitudes and acts constitute a deliberate, flagrant violation of the 1975 Agreement, as does the violation of other clauses providing for the return of Iraqi territories which Iran has been occupying since the time of the Shah's regime, and constitute an assault on the Agreement as a whole. By committing these deliberate acts Iran brought back the state of insecurity and instability along the common borders of the two countries. This state of affairs was the actual beginning of Iran's aggression against Iraq.\nThose hostile acts and attitudes, which threaten Iraq's sovereignty and its internal security and stability, continued throughout 1979 and for the first nine months of 1980. Iraq was careful to deal with these issues by diplomatic means and through dialogue. On scores of occasions Iraq drew the attention of the Iranian authorities to the fact that those acts constituted violation of the 1975 Agreement. On 27 June 1979 Iraq requested the Iranian Government to clarify its position on that Agreement. In spite of the gravity of this question as far as the relations between the two neighbouring countries were concerned, Iran did not take the trouble to respond to that substantive Inquiry from Iraq.\nThose violations were accompanied by other acts of no less gravity, all of which moved in the main direction of threatening Iraq's sovereignty and security and attempting to place Iraq under Iranian hegemony. During 1979 and 1980 countless feverish statements, declarations and speeches issued almost daily from officials of the Iranian regime calling: for changes in the political and social system of Iraq; for the promotion of acts of disorder and terrorism in Iraq and the employment of inhabitants of Iranian origin actually to commit such acts; for citizens to boycott and oppose the national authority and to paralyse governmental machinery; for the armed forces to rebel against authority, desert their barracks and evade national service; and openly for the assassination of political leaders in Iraq. I refer in particular to the statements made by the former Foreign Minister of the Iranian regime, Sadeq Ghotbzadeh, in Damascus on 27 April 1980, in which he announced an alleged plot against the life of the President of the Republic of Iraq.\nWhat was even more serious, Iranian officials began to speak openly and publicly of using their armed forces to achieve their designs against Iraq. I made special reference to the speech by the President of the Republic of Iran, Abol Hasan Bani-Sadr on 11 April 1980, in which he said:\t\u00b7\n\\\"When the Iranian army moves west no power on earth can stop its march to Baghdad.\\\"\nNo less serious was the announcement by Ghotbzadeh, the Foreign Minister, on 9 April 1980 that his Government had decided to overthrow the Iraqi Government, or his announcement the day before that Baghdad and Aden were Persian.\nIranian officials at the time considered the making of ever more threatening statements against the security and sovereignty of Iraq to be a basic means of promoting their influence within the new regime and climbing to ever higher positions in the Iranian power structure, on the supposition that he who proved to be the roost extreme in that area would be closer to the Khomeini line of exporting the revolution and would thus be closer to his heart.\nWith the continuation of these political and propaganda campaigns and campaigns of subversion to undermine security and stability, the Iranian regime began to use the force of arms against Iraq to achieve its aggressive aims. In the period from February to September 1980 Iranian aircraft committed 249 violations of Iraqi air space. There were 244 instances of Iranian armed forces firing across the border and on Iraqi border posts or subjecting them to attacks and artillery fire and obstructing navigation in Shatt al Arab, the vital artery of Iraq. We were also three instances of firing upon Iraqi civilian aircraft and seven instances of shelling Iraqi economic installations. \nIn all these deliberate acts Iraq would give warning, call attention and engage in dialogue by diplomatic means in the hope that the Iranian regime would listen to the voice of reason and good sense, conform to the rules of international conduct and obey the dictates of international law. in 293 notifications by official memoranda dispatched to the Iranian authorities concerning these violations in the period from 5 March 1979 to 30 October 1980 the Iraqi Government drew attention to the risks involved in these acts and warned against their grave consequences for the relations between the two countries, but to no avail. The Iranian leaders continued to escalate their threats against Iraq and to compete with each other in discovering the best means to export their backward revolution to Iraq.\nOn 4 September 1980 the Iranian regime moved to a dangerous level in its plan of aggression against Iraq. Iranian armed forces used heavy 175-millimetre artillery to shell the towns of Khaneqin, Mendell, Zirbatya and Naftkhaneh. Iranian artillery fired on these Iraqi towns from the Iraqi territories which it had refused to deliver back to Iraq as dictated by the 1975 Agreement and on which it had amassed military forces. The Iranian Government thereby deliberately threatened Iraq's sovereignty and security in two ways: on the one hand by a deliberate military occupation of Iraqi territory and on the other by a deliberate shelling of Iraqi towns by heavy artillery from that Iraqi territory.\nAlthough Iraq, by a memorandum dated 7 September 1980, called Iran's attention to this conduct, which was in contravention of its international obligations, and requested it to remove its military encroachments on Iraqi territory, Iranian artillery fire continued unabated. Iraq was therefore obliged again to notify Iran by an official memorandum dated 8 September that it was compelled to exercise its right to legitimate self-defence under the Charter and international law by removing the Iranian occupation forces should Iran fail to stop its military transgressions against Iraqi sovereignty and territorial integrity\u00b7\nRather than respond to the Iraqi representations the Iranian authorities continued their military attacks on Iraq. We were therefore obliged for the third time, on 11 September 1980, to deliver to Iran a detailed official memorandum in which we suggested that the Iranian leadership seek the view of its organs responsible for border affairs and agreements as to the validity of the Iraqi position based on the binding commitments undertaken by both countries under the 1975 Agreement. The memorandum further urged the Iranian Government to realize that to attack heavily populated cities with their civilian inhabitants, as it did when it shelled Khaneqin and Mendel, could not be taken lightly; it was a grave matter which Iran should be careful to avoid if it did not wish the relations between the two countries to suffer serious deterioration\u00b7 It is to be noted that on all occasions Iraq was careful to remind the Iranian Government of its International obligations, including the 1975 Agreement. It is also necessary to make note of the fact that as late as 11 September 1980 Iraq stressed to Iran, albeit for the last time, the need to abide by the provisions of the 1975 Agreement. How did Iran respond? Iran did not reply to our diplomatic memoranda in kind but resorted instead to threats and denunciations and continued to use military force against Iraq\u2019s borders, cities, economic installations and essential facilities.\nHaving long suffered all this with patience and made countless efforts to resolve matters, the Iraqi Government, faced with clear evidence and with the failure of the Iranian Government to respond to this historic memorandum, became convinced that the Iranian Government's violations of the elements of the comprehensive settlement contained in the 1975 Agreement were deliberate in character. Iraq therefore had no choice but to consider that Agreement and all subsequent agreements based thereon null and void, having regard to the fact that Iran had already nullified them by word and deed. Iraq's position was in accordance with the provisions of clause IV of that Agreement and article 4 of the Treaty on international Boundaries and Good-Neighbourliness, based on the Agreement.\nBy accusing Iraq of nullifying the 1975 Agreement, Iran wants this Assembly and ourselves to ignore its own violations of the Agreement, whether those relating to Iraq's territorial sovereignty or external and internal security or those relating to non-intervention in its internal affairs, while maintaining at the same time, without officially recognizing the Agreement, the privileges therein accorded Iran to delimit boundaries in Shatt al Arab on the basis of the Thalweg line. The Iraqi diplomatic and legal attempts to draw Iran's attention to the gravity of the acts of aggression and threats it was committing and warning it against the dire consequences of such acts on the relations between the two countries were responded to by Iran with more threats and the increased use of military force.\nIran continued to escalate the conflict. As from 19 September 1980 it intensified its heavy artillery fire and air attacks on heavily populated residential complexes and vital economic installations in Iraq as well as on Iraqi and foreign merchant shipping entering and leaving. Furthermore, the Iranian authorities announced the closure of the Strait of Hormuz to Iraqi navigation and declared a general mobilization, while amassing military forces in huge numbers along the borders and embarking upon a large-scale military operation openly using regular forces.\nEffective from 18 September 1980 the Iranian armed forces issued four military communiqu\u00e9s on their activities. In the third communiqu\u00e9, issued on 19 September 1980, Iran stated that it used its air force in its military operations, in the fourth communiqu\u00e9, issued on 19 September 1980, the Iranian authorities boasted that the fields of Naftkhaneh, an important Iraqi oil area, had been set on fire\u00b7\nThe military operations undertaken by Iraq with effect from 7 September 1980 to expel the Iranian forces which were occupying its territory and shelling its border cities from that selfsame occupied Iraqi territory, as well as the military operations undertaken on 22 September 1980 to face the Iranian troops amassed on Iraqi borders with the object of effecting a deep incursion into Iraqi territory order to attain their aggressive and expansionist objectives against Iraq, were < purely defensive in character\u00b7 In September 1980 Iraq had two options and no other: either to submit to the Iranian aggression aimed at the occupation of Ir. and its conversion into an Iranian province or to exercise legitimate self-defend. All of these attitudes adopted and actions taken by Iran had happened before 22 September 1980 and constitute a flagrant violation of a number of principles rules of international law governing friendly relations among States as codified the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States, which the General Assembly approved by consensus its resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, chief among which are the principle; of good-neighbourly relations, the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs of States, the principle of sovereign equality of States and the principle that States shall fulfil their international obligation in good faith. \nMoreover, the net result of the actions of the Iranian Government - which was the first to use military force against Iraq, with effect from 4 September 1980, and even before that date - fall within the concept of direct armed aggression as laid down by the definition of aggression which the General Assembly approved by consensus in its resolution 3314 (XXIX), of 14 December 1974,\nOn the other hand, the measures taken by the Iraqi Government since 4 September 1980 to counter the Iranian aggression are consistent with the right of legitimate self-defence because they meet the conditions of necessity and reasonableness established by international law for the legitimate exercise of this right. Iran, whose President spoke before the Assembly a few days ago, wants the Assembly and the Security Council to forget all these acts of aggression and actions contrary to international law and the nature of relations between States In modern times, and to believe instead its allegation that Iraq committed aggression against it.\nIran claims that Iraq has not resorted to political means to resolve the conflict and that it has waged war against Iran with a view to overthrowing the Iranian regime\u00b7 Let us ask ourselves this\u00b7 Did not all the efforts made by Iraq from February 1979 to September 1980, the latest of which being our memorandum of 11 September 1980, constitute political and diplomatic processes for resolving problems? Is it not Iraq that welcomed the establishment of a Republic in Iran, invited its Prime Minister to visit Iraq, sent congratulatory messages to its leadership and dispatched 293 notifications in diplomatic memorandums cautioning Iran against threats to Iraq's sovereignty and security? Is it not Iran that has heaped abuse on Iraq, threatened its security and stability insistently sought to change its political and social system, considered Khomeini to be Iraq\u2019s guardian, used military force to violate Iraq's borders and threatened to invade its capital and erase it from the map of the region?\nWhich of the two parties has rejected dialogue and the mediation of friends to resolve the problems between the two countries? In a speech he made in April 1980 Iran's then President, Bani-Sadr, boasted to his audience that President Saddam Hussein had on three occasions sought to send mediators to resolve the problems with Iran and that he, Bani-Sadr, had refused to talk to them. Any fair-minded person must ask himself this: was Iraq alone in being unable to resolve its problems with Iran by diplomatic means at that time, or was the entire world at a loss as to how to deal with that anomalous, aggressor regime, which has no respect for international law or established custom in State relations, and is thus unable to this day to resolve its problems with that regime?\nLet us go back to 1979 and 1980 and go over the daily events one by one, and ask the States of the region and those other States that have had problems with Iran which of them has been able to establish a constructive dialogue with the Iranian regime on the basis of international law, the rules of international conduct and mutual respect for sovereignty and interests. Has Kuwait, or Saudi Arabia, or Bahrain, or the Soviet Union, or the United States, or Prance or Britain? Which State, big or small, whether near Iran, far away from Iran or neighbouring Iran, was able at that time, or is able even today, to resolve its problems with Iran through dialogue, on the basis of international law and the rules of conduct in today's world? There are 1,001 proofs that the whole world has suffered and continues to suffer from deliberate Iranian violations of international law and agreements and breaches of contracts signed between Iran and the countries of the world, as well as from Iranian terrorist plots, Iranian audacities and Iranian rejection of dialogue. Perhaps former Secretary- General Waldheim' s notes on his visit to Tehran provide the best proof of what we have stated and of the way the Iranians have conducted their talks even with the representatives of our international Organization.\nThe world has witnessed many conflicts, which had their origin in various causes, and it continues to witness many such conflicts. What should a Member State of the United Nations do when an armed conflict arises between it and another State? In this world to which we all belong there is an international authority concerned with security and stability in the world. That authority is the Security Council, On 28 September 1980, having met and considered the situation between Iraq and Iran, the Security Council adopted resolution 479 (1980), which called for the cessation of hostilities and the initiation of negotiations. Iraq, a responsible Member of the United Nations, which believes In the United Nations Charter and in the laws and rules governing relations among States, accepted that resolution immediately, Iran, however, which has refused to resolve the problems with Iraq by political means, through negotiations, and which believes In using means that contravene international law and custom with a view to threatening the sovereignty and security of Iraq, refused to accept Security Council resolution 479 (1980) and. Instead, has Insisted on continuing the war to this day.\nJust as it refused to abide by the will of the International community and end the war in September 1980. So Iran has refused to resolve the conflict through other international organizations and bodies, such as the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement, by seeking, as in the case of the United Nations, to impose conditions which are contrary to international law and to the concepts of the age, with a view to enabling Iran to attain all its expansionist aims based on the theory of exporting the revolution, which is the root cause of all the problems plaguing the region today.\nToday we have a huge dossier of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and of the decisions and appeals of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, all of which call for the settlement of the conflict between Iran and Iraq by peaceful means on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations, international law, the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Islamic principles. Iran has rejected all these calls, while Iraq has accepted them all. If a country had truly been the victim of aggression, could it have rejected all those International efforts over a period of seven years and all those international appeals and calls. Insisting all the time on war, slaughter and destruction? Is not this attitude, rather, one characteristic of a covetous aggressor harbouring aggressive, expansionist designs? Which of the two parties to the conflict has considered the war a gift of God and a suitable occasion for liquidating internal opponents, allowing the revolution to strike root and getting rid of the older generation and a newer one? \nThe declarations of Khomeini and all Iranian officials made since September 1980 until today have sung the praises of war and recounted its virtues and implications for the survival of the regime and the regime's ability to crush its opponents. Those declarations have also extolled the war's implications for the growth of Iran's Influence in the region and at the International level. Could war be an imposed situation on a regime that glorifies war in that manner? Or, rather, is it not that that regime Itself wanted this war and imposed it on Iraq and on the countries of the region, thus involving the international community as a whole in its effects? Who other than the aggressor Iran - which insists on exporting its backward revolution with its heinous crimes, which insists on bringing the countries of the region under its control and which Insists on resorting to terrorist means In all countries of the world - bears the responsibility for this war and for the slaughter and destruction which have been going on for more than seven years?\nThe statements made by the leadership of the Iranian regime seven years ago and the statements they hysterically keep repeating today are enough to enable us to determine the side which has Initiated aggression and war and which is unable to survive without war, to say nothing of its responsibility for the continuation of the war, despite all the well-intentioned efforts that were made and continue to be made to end it. By concentrating on a three-week period of conflict between two neighbouring countries, after which the Security Council intervened, Iran tries, through lies, to present a topsy-turvy view of things. It wants us to forget all the acts of aggression and subversion and all the violations of international law which it committed against Iraq and all the countries of the region before, during and after that period. It wants the world to forget the death, slaughter and destruction which has continued for seven years because of its insistence on war, its refusal to abide by international law and its rejection of the jurisdiction of the international organization over the conflict, as well as its insistence on its own methods and concepts to resolve this conflict by force, terrorism and blackmail.\nI have called to mind what happened in 1979 and 1980 before the outbreak of the conflict between Iraq and Iran and I have cited the aggressive acts of Iran against my country and its threats to the sovereignty and security of Iraq. You, Mr. President, together with all the Members of the international Organization, know what is going on in the region now and what Iran does and says against the other States. You no doubt have heard of the missiles which Iran has launched against a small, peaceful country like Kuwait, and you know of the continuous threats to Kuwaiti shipping. You know of the impudent threats Iran has directed against Saudi Arabia and of its aggression against Saudi vessels and airspace, as well as of Iran's calls to overthrow the Saudi Arabian regime. You know the facts of Iranian efforts to intervene in the internal affairs of all the countries of the region, without exception. You also know that there is in Iran an alternate Government for many of the legitimate regimes in our region. You know of Iran's role in terrorism in Arab States of North Africa, which have been obliged to close Iranian embassies to avoid subversive and seditious acts carried out and financed by those embassies. You certainly also know of the facts of the acts of terrorism committed by Iranian agents even in non-Islamic States, such as in European countries. You know of the hostage game used by the Iranian regime as a means of political blackmail and the acquisition of arms to enable it to continue war and aggression against my country and others in the region.\nAll these acts of aggression which are being committed by Iran against the countries of the region nine years after the establishment of its anomalous regime fall within the meaning of armed aggression under the definition of aggression approved by the General Assembly, to which I have already referred. If Iraq has borne more Iranian aggression than the other countries of the region it is only because there are 1,180 kilometres of common boundaries between Iraq and Iran and because our cities are only a few kilometres from those borders and the capital of our country is only 120 kilometres away from them.\nThis is the Iranian regime whose representatives come to this forum to shed crocodile tears before members so as to make members believe that they are the victims of aggression. No one, however, has asked the representatives of the Iranian regime about their definition of aggression. The Iranian regime conceives aggression in terms different from those accepted by the other States of the world. According to the Iranian regime, it is aggression for my country to defend Itself against Iran's attempts to invade my country. In the view of the rulers of Tehran, it Is aggression not to allow them to intervene in our internal affairs, and it Is also aggression not to allow them to violate the rules of International law and the rules of conduct among States whenever they desire to do so. Aggression, in the eyes of the rulers of Tehran, consists in not allowing them to Impose their hegemony on the countries of the region. That is the concept of aggression of the rulers in Tehran.\nThe anomalous and criminal Iranian regime, which wallows In the bloodbaths it has triggered in its country, which has driven children over minefields, which has sent hundreds of thousands of human beings to their deaths by its insistence on war for more than seven years, which treats international law and the rules of conduct among States with contempt, which has slaughtered prisoners of war and subjected them to unspeakable atrocities, which has failed to build good relations with any other State of the world apart from opportunistic and business relations with a few countries, which poses a threat to international security and stability, which lays down mines in international waters in the Gulf and threatens free navigation and which commits crimes in the region and in many areas of the world - such a regime has no right to set out conditions to the international Organization. Anyone who wishes to satisfy that regime and bargains with it at the expense of the principles of international law and the rules for the settlement of disputes between States is not rendering any service to peace, justice and the supremacy of law in the world. Such a person could be either miscalculating or seeking cheap gains at the expense of respect for the Charter and international law and respect for this Organization, as well as at our expense, we, the peoples of the region, which are being subjected to Iranian aggression, terrorism and blackmail.\nI should like, therefore, to make it quite clear that Iraq, which has struggled and striven with courage and ability against the Iranian aggression, and which has protected its sovereignty, security and the life of its citizens against the barbaric waves of invasion waged by Iran year after year, has stood as an Invincible barrier to protect the region and the world from Iran's evil. Any sensible person can well imagine what great dangers would threaten the region and the world should that barrier, God forbid, give way. Iraq will never allow more concessions to that murderous monster with its insatiable appetite for aggression, expansion and blackmail. \nThe Iranian regime has rejected the resolutions of the Security Council one after the other, from resolution 479 (1980), adopted in September 1980, up to resolution 588 (1986), adopted in October 1986. Each time it has attacked the Security Council, blackmailed it and said: \\\"I do not like this resolution. If you want me to accept a resolution from the Council, you should include in it such and such\\\".\nWhen we come to the Security Council to deal with the situation and discuss the question of adopting another resolution, we find certain parties behind the scenes in the Security Council saying: \\\"Well, let us include something of what Iran wants; perhaps this other resolution will be acceptable to it\\\". And the - second resolution includes what Iran wants. But Iran then rejects the second resolution, just as it rejected the first, stating that it has not been given enough. The attempt is repeated a third, fourth and fifth time. Iran rejects all these attempts and continues the war, the blackmail and the game of deception.\nWe have witnessed such scenes on all the occasions on which the conflict has been discussed, and we have heard the repeated Iranian claims and demands. On all those occasions the Security Council has made concessions with the object of achieving peace. Peace, however, has not been achieved; the war has continued. After the adoption of each resolution of the Security Council, the Iranian regime has undertaken a new campaign to invade Iraq, to reinforce its political blackmail with a military act it has tried to Impose on the ground. If, God forbid, the Iranian regime had been successful in only one of those invasions, which we have opposed and foiled, that would have been enough for Iran to establish its hegemony over the entire Gulf area and to extend its power even further, thereby overturning all balances and confronting the world with a dangerous situation. \nNow there exists a binding resolution, adopted by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter - resolution 598 (1987). It is the strongest resolution ever adopted concerning the conflict, and it is also among the strongest resolutions adopted by the Security Council in its history. It was adopted unanimously by the 15 members of the Security Council, and is unambiguously cleat j its meaning needs no interpretation. The first step in implementing it is the observance of a comprehensive cease-fire, with withdrawal to internationally-recognized borders; the second is the establishment of supervision over that process; the third is the release and repatriation of prisoners-of-war. Thus the various steps follow each other in sequence. This is what Security Council resolution 598 (1987) says, not the delegation of Iraq.\nNow we see the representatives of Iran attacking the Security Council, as they did seven years ago, and placing conditions on it. They have rejected this balanced resolution, and they want the Security Council to interpret its own resolutions in the manner they, the representatives of Iran, desire. They want the Council to read the resolution in Persian. What we call for is respect by the Security Council for its own resolution and its strong rejection of the attempts at blackmail and deception. This is not just an Iraqi demand; it is a demand in harmony with the resolution and its true meaning. We regret that some of those who voted for the resolution are acquiescing in the attempted acts of blackmail and deception by Iran although they participated in its formulation and voted for it.\nWe hope that there will be an end to those attempts and that the text of the resolution, which was adopted unanimously by members of the Council, will be observed. We also call on the Council to move forward unhesitatingly, without succumbing to any kind of manoeuvre or blackmail, within the context of resolution 598 (198T), namely# use of the means provided by the Charter for the purpose of establishing comprehensive and durable peace.\nI should like on this occasion to state again that we welcome resolution 598 (1987) and are prepared to co-operate with the Secretary-General and the Security Council to implement it faithfully and honestly and as it stands. We shall strongly reject any attempt to review the resolution or the arrangement of its provisions.\nFinally, I should like to point out that if one is searching for more evidence on the contempt of the Iranian regime for international law and its non-adherence to its obligations under the Charter, then the statement of the President of that regime, made on Tuesday last made from this rostrum, provides the best possible such evidence. It was full of insults and abusive language against the Security Council and its permanent and non-permanent members over more than seven years# numbering more than 40 Member States from all continents.\nThe President of the Iranian regime, speaking from the rostrum of the United Nations, did not say that his country adheres to the Charter of the United Nations and international law. We delivered a lecture to the Assembly on the concepts of his regime and his concept of international relations. We did not commit himself to respect the rules of our age, developed over the 40 years that have passed since the establishment of the United Nations.\nThat statement, full of falsifications and lies and contradicted by the daily actions of the Iranian regime over the last nine years, clears any remaining doubts to the true position of that aggressive and expansionist regime. The statement puts an end to all the utterances, which have no basis in reality, that have been made in certain circles concerning a probable change in Iran's position on the resolutions of this Organization and the will of the international community. \nThe President of the Iranian regime in fact declared war on the international community and the system of international relations as we know it in this Hall, filled as it is, with the representatives of the peoples of the world. We has revealed all the cards which the Iranian regime, and those who keep it company, have tried to cover. It remains for the international community - and the Security Council in particular - to declare itself, to affirm its credibility and to maintain before the world respect for the Charter of the United Nations, the hope of all peoples, on which they rely to face aggression decisively and achieve a just peace.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nTwenty-five years ago, following the attainment of its independence, Jamaica's first policy statement was made at the seventeenth session of the United Nations General Assembly, under the presidency of an illustrious citizens of Pakistan, Sir Zafrulla Khan, from the Group of Asian Countries. Today the presidency is in the able hands of a most distinguished representative of the German Democratic Republic. This is indeed testimony to the important contribution which the varying political, economic and cultural systems can bring to the global search for peace, development and stability.\nMy delegation congratulates you, Mr. President, and all the other officers on your election to the leadership of this Assembly. We anticipate that under your guidance there will be marked progress in the search for effective, durable solutions to some of the issues which confront us. The forty-first session of the General Assembly benefited from the expert leadership of Foreign Minister Choudhury of Bangladesh. We cannot overstate the value of his contribution to the achievements of that session and we commend him for it.\nWhen we look at the statement we made at this rostrum 25 years ago we see that much the same issues remain. Of course, it would be too much to expect that within this arbitrary 25-year period, this quarter-century, human nature would have been so altered as to make conflicts and wars and social and economic problems disappear. In fact situations which demonstrate the persistence in the international community of a lack of respect for the principles of the Charter concerning the peaceful resolution of conflicts, non-aggression and the non-use of force or the threat of force continue to abound. Nevertheless there have been \nimprovements. The world has also experienced vast political, economic, scientific and technological changes, some of which today challenge man to cope adequately with the accelerating pace of the convulsions surrounding him.\nToday we contemplate a General Assembly agenda which is much larger than the one we looked at 25 years ago. Some of the items are new, but all concern the persistent effort to use this Organization and the forum it affords to deal with living on this planet. Whether defined in political, economic, social, cultural or technological terms, they are all fundamentally related to the basic question: how do we cope or how are we coping?\nToday, after 2 5 years, the United Nations can proudly point to its record on decolonisation. Since 1962, when Jamaica and five other countries took their seats as States Members of this Organization, 4 9 others have broken the shackles of colonialism. This is a great achievement) yet we still have a little way to go. South Africa's continued defiance with respect to the independence of Namibia is a major blot on the record. South Africa has maintained its oppressive rule over Namibia the better to facilitate its plundering of Namibia's resources, in defiance of the international community. South Africa's policies are as unconscionable today as they ever were. Yet the failure to deal with them rests squarely on those countries whose policies have prevented the implementation of the enforcement measures possible under Chapter VII of the Charter.\nJamaica reiterates its call for Security Council action under Chapter VII to ensure the implementation of resolution 435 (1978).\nWe reaffirm our total rejection of the concept of linkage and restate our firm belief in the legitimacy of the struggle of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) , the sole authentic representative of the Namibian people. \nIn 1962 Jamaica proposed to the General Assembly that an international year for human rights be declared. This was observed by the international community in 1968. Since 1962 much work has been undertaken in the United Nations system, resulting in the adoption and entry into force of several very important conventions for the promotion and protection of human rights. My delegation notes with satisfaction the work of the several committees established under the various human rights instruments and of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Nevertheless, flagrant violations of human rights continue in many regions of the world.\nHow can the world continue to tolerate the vicious system of apartheid - a gross example of human rights denied? For our 25 years as an independent country despite several changes of Government, our people have supported the Government's stance against the apartheid system. During those years we have seen the inhuman situation which is the result of this abhorrent system grow steadily worse as it claims the lives of thousands of innocent victims, including children; as it allows thousands, including children, to languish in jail without trial\u00b7, as it leaves further countless thousands, including children, both physically and emotionally maimed as it denies 2 5 million persons who constitute the black population some of their most fundamental human rights - thus seeking to impose on the majority population a kind of modern-day serfdom for which Pretoria's only justification is the colour of a person's skin.\nWe have seen the growing resentment and anger of an oppressed population. We have watched with deep concern as the situation has developed with a frightening inevitability to the point of explosion. We have seen the way in which this racist regime wilfully and cynically manipulates all efforts to negotiate a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. And we have watched with dismay as the international community has unanimously condemned the apartheid system but nevertheless has failed to agree on measures to bring that system to an end. But we have also seen the influence which economic pressure has on that regime and we maintain and remain convinced that the implementation of comprehensive mandatory sanctions is the only option for a peaceful solution of this intolerable situation. Strong and concerted international action against apartheid must match the international condemnation which is so freely expressed. \nThe front-line States against which Pretoria has committed acts of aggression and sabotage must be able to rely on the effective solidarity of the international community as they seek to eliminate the dependence on their economic linkage with South Africa and improve their capacity to defend themselves against Pretoria's continuing aggression. The situation in Mozambique and Angola cries out for concerted international attention. Will this be just another General Assembly from which only strong anti-apartheid resolutions emerge?\nFrom time to time we ask ourselves what is the use of the United Nations? But we know that whatever its shortcomings that the past years have revealed it is an indispensable institution. Whether in the Middle East, where the central issue of the right of the Palestinian people remains unfulfilled and the right of Israel to a peaceful existence within safe and secure borders must be assured, or in Kampuchea, or Afghanistan where we call for the withdrawal of foreign forces to enable the peoples to exercise fully their right to self-determination, the United Nations must have an increasing role to play. Jamaica continues to support an international conference under United Nations auspices to design a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. The same is true of Kampuchea. In Afghanistan the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General and his representatives must continue to be supported by all.\nIn the Gulf Jamaica believes that the United Nations has an important role to play in the achievement of a peaceful solution. We support Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General to fashion a settlement in the area. Jamaica is of the view that a cessation of the war between Iran and Iraq is a vital pre-condition for stability in the region and for peaceful passage of maritime traffic. It is therefore essential that both Iran and Iraq comply with the demands of the international community for a speedy solution to their conflict. We are encouraged to hope that violation of the territorial integrity of Chad will be put to an end soon now that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has again become very actively involved.\nIn our region, the conflict of Central America did not exist in its present form 25 years ago. But the seeds were there. The longstanding social and economic disparities have given rise to conflicts into which, more recently, ideological differences have intruded. We have followed closely and have supported diplomatic initiatives to bring about a negotiated settlement acceptable to all the parties involved in that regional conflict. Time and time again our expectations have been dashed as an effective solution eluded these efforts. We were, however, encouraged by the Agreement signed on 7 August in Guatemala by the five Central American Presidents as a demonstration of their determination to resolve their differences through dialogue.\nThe Government of Jamaica wishes to commend the longstanding and painstaking efforts of the Contadora and Support Group and their contribution to this latest development, and also the role of President Arias of Costa Rica, whose proposal formed the basis for the Agreement. It is our hope that the parties to the Agreement will respect those commitments and that implementation will follow the agreed schedule. We urge the international community to support this endeavour to generate peace, stability and development in the region. In particular, we would urge all those States external to Central America and which have interests in the region, to support fully this noble endeavour and thus allow the Central American States to resolve their conflict without external intervention.\nWhatever the regional conflict may be or wherever it is, one major issue overhangs us all, and that is the threat of nuclear war and the persisting race between the super-Powers to acquire more sophisticated nuclear weapons systems. The United Nations has been strenuous in its efforts to put a stop to this madness. In 1962 Jamaica expressed its concern at the escalation of the arms race. Today, 25 years later, the situation is infinitely more dangerous. We continue to urge and support the adoption of measures for the achievement of general and complete disarmament. We expressed our optimism at the news of the agreement between the two super-Powers to eliminate one entire class of nuclear weapons. This is a major event for the international community. But we should not be euphoric. There are still enough nuclear weapons to destroy civilization several times over. Hence, we must persist in maintaining the pressure on the nuclear Powers\u00b7. At the same time, the race for the accumulation of conventional armaments must not become a substitute for the race in nuclear weapons.\nA few weeks ago the Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development ended. We deeply regret that all States did not participate, but we believe that the message which emanated from the Conference will find a ready, positive response among peoples of the East and West, of the North and South.\nThe paradox of millions of dollars spent in weapons of mass destruction, in order to maintain peace and security, while millions of people remain in abject poverty and deprivation, cannot continue. We have had occasion to refer to new kinds of problems with serious international impact, among which were international terrorism, illicit trafficking in drugs and the debt crisis.\nJamaica condemns international terrorism whether it be state-perpetrated or from any other source. We are concerned and appalled by its random and destructive mature; by its ability to weave a web of fear, hostility and distrust among nations and peoples, thus gnawing away at the framework of peace, stability and good will which the United Nations has so painstakingly sought to develop. We are fully committed to the adoption of measures to eradicate international terrorism and will continue to support efforts to this end.\nThe international community has recognized the need to close ranks in the fight against drug abuse and the illicit traffic in narcotics. Conferences at global, regional and sub regional levels have fostered action by the large majority of States to wipe this evil from the face of the earth. Not only are we concerned about the irreparable damage to our people that can result from drug abuse, but we are gravely troubled by the security implications, as the illicit traffic is inevitably linked with international crime, which respects no frontier. The multilateral plans of action which resulted from the various conferences, in particular, the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking which was held earlier this year, reflect our commitment as sovereign nations to co-operation in the relentless struggle against drug abuse and illicit trafficking in drugs. We believe the development of international law, through the adoption of a convention on this matter, could greatly enhance this international campaign.\nOn the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of our membership in the United Nations, my Government would have liked to be able to state unequivocally that considerable progress had been made in promoting the goals and principles of this Organization in economic development. Regrettably, we are unable to do so.\nThe challenge of development is even more pressing than it was 25 years ago when the world economy was vibrant. Despite the significant advances made during the last two decades in living standards to which the United Nations system has made valuable contributions the developing countries have been facing unprecedented economic difficulties in the 1980s. These difficulties threaten the economic and social gains made by, and the stability, of our States. \nDeveloping countries are being encouraged to pursue export-led growth but, at the same time, the very industrialized countries which encourage this path to growth are seeking to erect protectionist barriers around their own uncompetitive domestic industries. This leads to a reduction in the level of exports from developing countries to developed country markets, to a fall in foreign exchange earnings, and therefore to a reduction in the capacity to import goods necessary to sustain our economies. The imbalances within the world economy are thus perpetuated.\nThe new round of multilateral trade negotiations which was launched at Punta del Este, Uruguay, in September of last year, emerged in response to the overall continued deterioration in the international trading environment and the need to halt this trend by restoring international trade to agreed multilateral discipline. The contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), face new challenges as they negotiate a wide range of trade related issues during this round. Jamaica attaches much importance to these negotiations as we feel that agreed rules and principles, which seek to provide a stable, practical and secure international trading environment, not only help trade, but foster the climate for foreign investment.\nThe burden of external debt has now become the greatest obstacle to economic development. The gap between average living standards in developing countries and those in the developed world has widened and there are growing disparities between different parts of the developing world. We believe that our creditors are now fully aware of the need for creative and positive action on their part with a view to alleviating the situation.\nThe view that the external debt problems of developing countries would become manageable within a brief period is no longer realistic. The focus on short-term stabilization programmes supported by the International Monetary Fund and the rescheduling of bilateral obligations through the Paris Club and commercial debt directly with commercial banks have to be re-examined. New thinking must take into account the capacity to service the debt and the situation of small middle income countries with high debt service burdens and limited room for additional indebtedness. The resumption of a growth path must be a fundamental objective.\nThe Prime Minister of Jamaica has put forward a proposal which, we submit, can assist in co-ordinating and improving approaches to the debt crisis. The proposal is for a new type of policy-based lending programme which directly addresses the need for both debt service and secure economic growth. This facility, to be offered by multilateral financial institutions, would be conditioned on the basis of a targeted reduction of debt service ratios to sustainable levels over a programme period, geared to release sufficient disposable resources to achieve targeted growth. As a parallel programme, the Paris Club and commercial banks would also condition their multi-year rescheduling to the targeted debt service ratios.\nWe would welcome discussion on this proposal in the Second Committee, and we solicit the support of Members of the United Nations for what we are convinced is a useful and constructive initiative in the complex search for solutions. I am convinced that there is wide agreement that a solution to the debt problem will not only assist in improving the economies of developing countries, but will also form part of a broader solution of the problems which together contribute to the present stagnation of the world economy.\nThe seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII) which was recently held in Geneva, was eagerly awaited by the countries of the developing world. It presented an opportunity for the international community to seek concrete solutions to the many problems which beset the world economy. We looked to that forum for policies and measures which would revitalize development, growth and international trade and foster a more predictable and supportive environment.\nUNCTAD VII was not the resounding success for which we had all hoped. The decisive action that the current world economic situation required was not forthcoming. However, it was an important advance in multilateralism and interdependence. It was a renewed commitment to UNCTAD. The international community recognized that the four-yearly UNCTAD conferences continue to provide an opportunity for frank and useful discussions of development issues. The final act of UNCTAD VII, that consensus document which brings together the assessment of world economic trends, policies and measures in the areas of resources for development, commodities, international trade and special measures for the least developed countries, will remain an important policy document for implementing reforms to the international economic and financial systems.\nJamaica remains fully committed to multilateralism and will continue to play a positive role in the programmes and projects sponsored by the institutions of the United Nations. We expect that these programmes will complement those introduced at the national and regional levels. We believe that our efforts, coupled with those introduced and developed by the wider international community, will assist us in achieving our national goal of a better life for our people in a peaceful, secure and stable international environment.\nWe note with great satisfaction that major progress has been made in the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority on the problem of overlapping claims. This good news should help to convince the remaining doubters about the viability of the regime that the members of the international community fashioned by consensus. We expect the meeting in December to be successful. It continues to be our hope that ratification of the Convention will move speedily along.\nJamaica recognizes that the United Nations can be effective only to the extent to which we, the Member States, seek to make it so. There have been recent indications of a disposition to do that. We are encouraged by this. The United Nations is all of us. We all share the responsibility to use it to help make a better world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the delegation of Somalia, I extend our sincere congratulations to Mr. Peter Florin on his unanimous and well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. I assure him of the full co-operation of my delegation in the successful discharge of his responsibilities. I take this opportunity to express our appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Huraayun Rasheed Choudhury, under whose skilful guidance there were significant achievements at the forty-first session.\nI wish also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, for his active role in promoting just and peaceful solutions to international problems.\nThis session of the General Assembly, like others before it, has a long agenda covering a wide range of topics, I think it is true to say, however, that there are just three broad categories into which those items fall - namely, peace and security, self-determination, and human rights. It is to those three areas that the purposes and principles of the Charter ace directed. I believe it to be essential that we never lose sight of those purposes and principles as we address ourselves to the specific problems before us.\nWe must ask ourselves, for example, whether the world community is taking effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace. Is the principle of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples being fully respected? Is there effective international co-operation to promote fundamental freedoms and human rights, including the right to economic and social stability? The extent to which we can answer these questions in the affirmative is the extent to which our obligations as Member States are being fulfilled. Obviously, there is a large gap between the statement of the goals we profess to seek and the attainment of those goals, and the effort to reduce that gap must be a constant one.\nWith regard to peace and security, it can be said that these benefits ultimately depend on the widest possible compliance with all the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. However, world peace can today be more specifically identified with a strong commitment to disarmament and collective security, and particularly with full adherence to fundamental human rights. As a former colonial territory which achieved independence under the aegis of the United Nations, Somalia is particularly conscious of the importance of the right to self-determination and independence in the strengthening of regional and international peace and security. In our view, the world community owes a debt of gratitude to the framers of the Charter for affirming those rights at a time when the process of decolonisation was in its infancy and the likelihood of its success far from certain. It was their wisdom and foresight which provided the basis for the General Assembly's historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.\nToday, the concern expressed in the Charter and the efforts by the United Nations to promote self-determination have been strongly validated. One of the clearest lessons of the history of our times is that attempts to suppress the will of peoples to self-determination and independence inevitably lead to violence and conflict and are in the end doomed to failure. Oppressed people will make any sacrifice, including the sacrifice of their lives, in order to establish conditions of freedom, justice and human dignity.\nThe task of creating a community of sovereign States with universality as the final goal is not yet completed, but the work of the United Nations in this area has strongly reinforced the hopes and dignity of millions of former colonized people in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, the Pacific and other areas who have recovered their national identity and now enjoy statehood. Somalia believes that the completion of this task must be a high priority of the United Nations. It has been said that peace, in the last resort, is a matter of human rights. I do not think there can be any question about the fact that gross violations of human rights, which undermine the dignity and worth of the human person, provoke both national and international tensions and conflicts. Somalia strongly supports the efforts of the United Nations on behalf of oppressed peoples. We believe that the world community must take an unequivocal stand when confronted by racist, aggressive and genocidal policies.\nThe United Nations responsibilities in the promotion of human rights do not stop, however, with attempts to put an end to intolerable oppression. Its responsibilities must also include the creation of a climate in which all States have the opportunity to provide adequately for the economic and social needs of their peoples. This, undoubtedly, is the meaning of the Charter's injunction that we promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\nIt is against the background of these thoughts on peace, self-determination and human rights that I shall address myself to specific international issues of particular concern to Somalia,\nThe question to which we give the highest priority in our foreign policy is that of peace and stability in the Horn of Africa. Our region has suffered from decades of conflict and tension, from the ravages of drought and desertification and from the human misery caused by mass refugee flows. The establishment of a climate of peace and stability would enable the people of the region to carry out with greater success the tasks of rehabilitation and development.\nIt was in recognition of this need that the Heads of State of Somalia and Ethiopia initiated a process of dialogue between the two countries at their meeting in Djibouti in January 1986. My Government is strongly committed to the success of the ongoing talks aimed at creating conditions for the normalization of relations, the resolving of fundamental problems and the establishment of a just and lasting peace. We believe it is a measure of progress that the last meeting of the Somali-Ethiopia Joint Committee held in April of this year agreed that the two sides would continue the dialogue and refrain from any action which might jeopardize the peace process.\nIn our view a climate of confidence and trust must be created in which negotiations on substantive issues can be successfully pursued. We believe that the search for a just and lasting settlement could then go forward, based on a realistic appraisal of existing conditions and, most importantly, with a firm recognition of the legitimate aspirations and fundamental rights of the peoples involved. It is our firm conviction that respect for the inalienable rights of peoples to justice and self-determination constitutes a solid foundation for peace and stability in the area.\nIn spite of some difficulties and setbacks, Somalia will continue to promote the peace process that has been set in motion - which would be in the interests, and contribute to the welfare of, all the peoples of the region. I should like now to state Somalia's position on another urgent and grave international problem: the tragic war between Iran and Iraq. It has continued for almost 8 years without any prospect of an end in sight. It has exacted a heavy toll in human lives, in the destruction of property and in the depletion of the resources of both countries.\nSomalia welcomed the Security Council's mandatory resolution calling for a cease-fire, which we considered to be an appropriate response to the destruction and bloodshed and to the widening repercussions of the war. We appeal to both sides and especially to Iran to respond speedily and explicitly to international efforts to end the hostilities and to achieve an honourable settlement. The good offices of the Secretary-General in this regard must certainly be given appreciation and support. Bringing an end to this tragic war is in the best interests of the peoples of the area, of Arab and Islamic solidarity and of regional world peace and security\u00b7\nIn the Middle East, after decades of tension and conflict, the path to peace is still being obstructed by Israel's contempt for the rule of international law. Clearly, there will be no peace while Israel continues to deny the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, while it violates the human rights of the Arab people under its occupation and while it pursues expansionist policies of illegal annexation and occupation. The world community must demand an end to those policies and to the arrogant violation of Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity \u00b7\nMy Government will continue to support United Nations resolutions calling for a comprehensive Middle East settlement, which would include the right of the Palestinians to return home and to establish a state in Palestine and Israel's withdrawal from all annexed and occupied Arab territory, including Jerusalem. We also support the convening of a peace conference on the Middle East as an important step towards a just and lasting settlement.\nThe responsibility of Member States to promote human rights and remove threats to peace is nowhere heavier than in the case of southern Africa. My Government welcomes the increasing application of measures that demonstrate the world community's abhorrence of South Africa's apartheid policies. Regrettably, the apartheid system remains essentially in place, and institutionalised oppression against the majority population and against all who oppose apartheid has been intensified.\nUndoubtedly the situation in South Africa today is one of dangerous crisis, as the confrontation between the forces of oppression and those of the liberation struggle becomes increasingly violent. My Government strongly supports the international consensus on the need to impose comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the Pretoria regime. This is the only peaceful and effective measure available to the United Nations in its effort to promote the establishment of a just society in South Africa. The case for mandatory sanctions is, of course, further strengthened by South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia, and by its use of the Territory as a springboard for military aggression against sovereign States. In our view, it is the inescapable duty of the Security Council to take firm action to ensure that the plan for Namibia's independence contained in resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) is implemented speedily and without pre-conditions.\nIn a number of other areas of conflict it is essential that international pressures continue to provide the momentum towards just and peaceful solutions. In this context, Somalia joins the vast majority of States in calling for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan. The independence, sovereignty and non-aligned status of Afghanistan must be fully respected, and the Afghan refugees must be allowed to return home in safety and with honour.\nOn the question of Cyprus, we urge the parties concerned to take full advantage of the good offices of the Secretary-General in working for a peaceful settlement. In our view, the resolution of this problem lies in the recognition by all concerned that the fundamental human, civil and political rights of the ethnic groups which constitute the population of that island State, must be fully respected and safeguarded, if there is to be lasting peace and internal harmony.\nThe strengthening of peace and security throughout the world depends more heavily, of course, on progress towards disarmament, in particular nuclear disarmament. Without doubt, the nuclear arms race overshadows all other issues in importance and urgency. That is why my Government warmly welcomes the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union for the elimination of medium-range nuclear missiles. This development certainly has historic significance as it represents the first agreement, in principle, on the elimination of a specific\nclass of nuclear weapons. Of equal significance, in our view, is the spirit of co-operation which has fostered agreement in the crucial area of arms control. The world community is now encouraged to hope that a first step has been taken in a process which will lead to the elimination of long-range strategic missiles, to the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty, and to a freeze on the production and deployment of all nuclear weapons.\nI turn now to the economic issues that are of great concern to my Government. Unfortunately, the lack of progress towards the solution of international problems in the political sphere is also evident in the major economic problems before the General Assembly.\nThe stalemate in efforts to establish a North-South dialogue and to promote a more just world economic order is again cause for disappointment and concern. For African States, the question of greatest urgency is the economic situation on our continent - a situation that continues to generate unacceptable levels of deprivation and misery. The worst ravages of natural and man-made disasters have abated, but one year after the convening of the Special Session on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa, it cannot be said that the crisis on our continent is over. The pervasive constraints of underdevelopment and the effects of climatic and other disasters cannot be overcome easily.\nFor example, Somalia has been host for over seven years to successive mass influxes of refugees. Even though basic needs are met through international assistance, the presence of 700,000 refugees in official camps, and as many more in the country at large, continues to place a heavy burden on our weak infrastructure, economy and resources. We naturally hope that efforts to create a climate of peace in the region will help to promote the optimum solution to the refugee problems - that of voluntary repatriation, unfortunately, the majority of the refugees are still not assured that they can return home to safe and stable conditions. \n\nMy Government is grateful to the donor countries and United Nations agencies which have given the refugees a measure of hope for the future. Nevertheless, I must take this opportunity to make an urgent appeal for the fulfilment of food aid pledges. At the present time, there are serious food shortages and outbreaks of nutrition-related diseases in many camps, and unless speedy and effective measures are taken the situation could soon become catastrophic\u00b7, We hope that generous and prompt support for immediate and medium-term needs will continue to be made available to the refugees, in accordance with the commitments made at the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa.\nI believe there must be great recognition of the direct connection between the economic plight of developing countries and the constraints of the existing world economic order. It should be stressed that when the developing countries call for a North-South dialogue on interrelated questions of trade, money, debt servicing and development, they are not speaking of ideologies or economic abstractions. They are speaking of matters of life and death. They are speaking of the need to overcome conditions of widespread hunger, poverty, ignorance and disease.\nSomalia strongly supports United Nations policies and programmes dealing with the related questions of the environment, population and human settlements. We believe that the promotion of the status of women, the rights of the child and the needs of youth, the aging and the disabled admirably carry out the humanitarian and social purposes o\u00a3 the world body. Campaigns against such evils as racial discrimination and the traffic in drugs illustrate the continuing vitality and relevance of the Organization.\nWe are all aware that many issues in critical areas of peace and security, self-determination and human rights remain unresolved. This calls for deep concern because all the goals of human endeavour and human aspirations are encompassed by these three fields of international action. My delegation is encouraged by the fact that practical solutions, based on the principles of the Chatter, have proved successful in many critical situations that have come before the United Nations. Those solutions reflect the collective wisdom of the world community, and thereby bring moral pressure to beat on events.\nTo conclude, the United Nations must continue to remain the centre for promoting the rule of international law and for fostering co-operation among States for the good of all. In this unique human endeavour, the United Nations can always depend on the full support and co-operation of the Government and people of Somalia. \n"

        "file_text": "It gives me pleasure at the outset, Sir, to congratulate you on behalf of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic on your election to the presidency of this forty-second session of the General Assembly. There is no doubt that the eminent qualities which you possess and your diplomatic skill will greatly contribute to ensuring the success of our deliberations. I wish to reaffirm to you that my delegation will spare no effort in co-operating with you so as to crown your mission with success.\nIt also gives me pleasure to express, through you, our sincere appreciation of your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, who achieved resounding success in guiding the deliberations of the last session.\nI am also pleased to congratulate, in my own name and on behalf of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General of our Organization, on his worthy endeavors in the service of this Organization and its objectives in maintaining international peace and security. I wish him further success in the great tasks entrusted to him by the Assembly, the Security Council and other bodies of the United Nations.\nThe forty-second session is taking place while preparations are under way for the third summit meeting of the two super-Powers, following their summit meetings in Geneva and Reykjavik, which coincided with the two previous sessions of the General Assembly. The agreement in principle achieved by the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union and the Secretary of State of the United States of America concerning the final elimination of short- and intermediate-range missiles is a positive move which my country has supported and which we consider to be a step on the right path towards the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.\nWe feel, however, that the long-awaited detente in international relations continues to be far from being reached, since the weapons to be eliminated under such an agreement constitute only a very modest proportion of the weapons in the possession of the two super-Powers and in their nuclear stockpiles - merely 3 per cent. Furthermore, the arms race remains as intense as ever. Tension and mistrust and recourse to force to resolve disputes continue to endanger international relations in many parts of the world.\nThough the last two summit meetings did not arrive at radical solutions for many of the problems which are alarming our world, we still cherish the hope that the forthcoming summit will yield more positive results that will make it possible to arrive at definitive solutions such as the halting of the arms race, the elimination of nuclear weapons, the permanent demilitarization of outer space, the reduction of tension and reassertion of the rights of the deprived peoples.\nMy country wishes to express its support for the Political Declaration of the Eighth Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in September 1986 in Harare. In particular we wish to highlight the parts of that statement concerning disarmament and international security.\nMy delegation supports the Soviet Union's call for the final elimination of nuclear weapons by all nuclear-weapon States by the end of the century, in addition to the repeated calls made by six countries - Argentina, Greece, India, Mexico, Sweden and Tanzania - on 23 May 1984, 28 January 1985 and 7 August 1986, all of which advocate a halt to nuclear-weapon testing, the consolidation of the economic role of the United Nations and the diversion of the resources consumed by the arms race to socio-economic development, for most of the developing countries are in dire need of them.\nThe Yemen Arab Republic believes that the Program for the militarization of outer space means new perils for humanity, perils it can well do without. My country believes that such Programs should be reviewed in the talks on general and complete disarmament, which should be pursued in a constructive and responsible spirit.\nThe Yemen Arab Republic reiterates its rejection of any military presence in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea and again expresses its support for transforming the Indian Ocean region into a zone of permanent peace and security, free from nuclear weapons. We also support all efforts aimed at creating nuclear-free zones in other parts of the world, foremost among them the Middle East region, which is fraught with danger and simmering with constant tension.\nThe conflict which has been raging in the Middle East for over 39 years can be attributed essentially to the Palestinian question. The region will remain explosive and peace and security will be threatened, not only in the Middle East but also in the world at large, as long as Israel maintains its unremitting intransigence and its insistence on continuing its occupation of Palestine and other Arab territories, its denial of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, its aggressive policies against the people of Palestine and other Arab countries, and its brutal practices of repression and terrorism, basing itself on the direct political and military support it receives from the United States of America and other allies.\nIt is perhaps not necessary to trace the historical chronology of the implantation of Israel in the heart of the Arab homeland and examine what danger this poses nor do we need to enumerate Israel's aggressive racist and settlement policies in the region, from the usurpation of Palestine to the wars of aggression waged against the Arab countries, the aggression against Lebanon in 1982 - which is continuing to this day - and the repeated acts of provocation and attacks against neighboring countries.\nIt is hardly necessary to remind the Assembly of the various resolutions adopted by the Organization on the Palestinian question and the Middle East conflict, or of Israel's continuing rejection of all those resolutions and its blatant defiance of the international community. That would be merely to state the obvious. It is more important that we focus on a significant reality that has been reaffirmed by developments in the Palestinian question over the past four decades. ?he time has come for the international community to realize that no initiative, effort or arrangement aimed at arriving at a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement in the Middle East will ever be successful without recognition of the rational, legitimate, inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the light to return to their homeland, to self-determination and to establish an independent State on their national soil, under the leadership of their sole, legitimate representative, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\nSome may feel that unilateral solutions are the right means of resolving the Palestinian question and the Middle East conflict. However, the recent past has provided daily reaffirmation of the fallaciousness of such a belief. The Camp avid accords and separate initiatives have only complicated the issue, distancing t even further from a just solution, because such attempts ignore the national lights of the Palestinian people. Hence, the Yemen Arab Republic continues to maintain that the solution of the Palestinian question and the Middle East conflict can be found only in an international conference on peace in the Middle East, to be attended by the five permanent members of the Security Council and all the parties concerned, on a footing of equality, including the PLO, the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Such a conference would constitute the practical framework for and a sound and suitable step towards a just and lasting peace in the region.\nIt is more necessary than ever before that the countries that maintain special relations with Israel - foremost among which is the United States - reconsider their partial attitude to Israel and their policies in the region in an attempt to contribute to a solution in a more positive and effective manner, with a view to arriving at a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region.\nThe Yemen Arab Republic follows with deep sorrow and alarm developments in the war that has been raging for seven years between Iran and Iraq. It expresses its profound apprehension and alarm at recent developments, which threaten a conflagration and the internationalization of the war as a result of Iran's rejection of the peaceful resolution of the conflict, its continuing attacks against Iraq and its occupation of Iraqi territory, as well as the escalation of its attacks on parties not involved in the conflict.\nThe international community in general welcomed Security Council resolution 598 (1987) , of 20 July 1987, because it sets out the correct path to an honorable settlement and the ending of the war between Iran and Iraq while protecting the rights of both parties. However, we find ourselves facing a refusal by Iran to comply with that resolution. We therefore call upon all countries, especially the members, including the five permanent members of the Security Council, to play their role in the maintenance of international peace and security and uphold the\nreputation and prestige of our Organization by implementing that resolution comprehensively and completely so as to put an end to this war and preserve international peace and security in the region.\nAt the same time, we call once again upon Iran to heed reason, abandon its recalcitrance, accept Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and have recourse to peaceful means to end the conflict. The continuance of this futile war constitutes in unprecedentedly serious threat to international peace and security, with unforeseeable consequences.\nThe Yemen Arab Republic has followed attentively the latest round of negotiations on the question of Afghanistan, in Geneva, under the auspices of the assistant Secretary-General, and believes that the continuing failure to solve this issue is very serious. We maintain that the necessary elements of a just solution ire: negotiations between all the countries concerned, the return of the Afghan refugees, the ending of all forms of outside interference in the affairs of Afghanistan, whatever the purpose may be and recognition of the right of the Afghan people to sovereignty and to choose their own social and political system, free from outside influence.\nWith regard to the question of Cyprus, we believe that negotiation and dialog are the best means of finding a satisfactory formula for ensuring freedom f religion and equality of rights and duties for both Cypriot communities, while reserving the unity and independence of Cyprus.\nThe current situation in southern Africa is even more threatening than formerly as a result of the increasingly aggressive actions of the racist regime in Pretoria, which continues to reveal its true hideousness by its acts of repression, terrorism, butchery, torture and arbitrary arrest in confronting the nationalist uprisings in southern Africa. This is also revealed in the continuing occupation of Namibia, Pretoria's relentless attacks against the African front-line States and its blackmailing of other neighboring countries.\nThe Yemen Arab Republic continues to follow developments in southern Africa and reaffirms its support for the legitimate struggle of the peoples of South Africa to attain their national rights. We condemn all illegitimate acts by the racist regime in South Africa against the national majority in South Africa and denounce all aggressive acts against the African front-line States. My country stresses the need to impose more effective economic sanctions against the racist regime of South Africa. We reaffirm our complete support for the Namibian people, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), their authentic representative, in their legitimate struggle for independence and freedom.\nThe presence of the item on Namibia on the agenda of the General Assembly for the past 41 years, since the adoption of resolution 65 (I) at the first session of the General Assembly, in 1946, presents a great challenge to the international community and makes it incumbent upon it to exert effective, constructive efforts to solve this problem. We believe that the correct procedure lies in implementation of the peace settlement endorsed in Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nIf the situations in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf and southern Africa are threats to international peace and security, the situation in Central America is no less menacing. The Yemen Arab Republic, having followed with great attention the recent developments in Central America, wishes to express its support for the peace plan put forward by the Heads of five States, the aim of which is to restore permanent peace in the region free from outside interference and surmounting the complications inherent in the existing situation.\nWith regard to the problems afflicting other parts of the world, we believe that the ideal way of resolving disputes and differences is by peaceful means and through dialog, enabling the peoples involved to express their will without outside pressure, allowing them their right to self-determination, and halting all outside intervention on whatever pretext.\nAlthough the matters I have just mentioned constitute part of the subjects that call for our attention today, there is another matter that is no less important. I am referring to the continuing deterioration in the international economic situation and the resultant great imbalance, due to the setting of the prices of raw materials and to the indebtedness with which the developing countries are overburdened, as well as to the technological monopoly of the industrialized countries, which widens and deepens the abyss separating the industrialized and developing worlds. That situation portends the total collapse of the present economic, financial and monetary order.\nWe believe that to escape from this vicious circle a new international economic order must be established, in order to provide fair and adequate prices for the exports of the developing countries. Those countries must be enabled to play a greater role in orienting the international monetary system towards the financing of development and towards increasing their production in the industrial field through the transfer of technology, better debt terms, sovereignty over their own natural resources and a consolidation of the United Nations role in international economic co-operation. It is incumbent upon us to devote increased efforts towards achieving the new international economic order based on equality among all countries, with balance and justice in all sectors.\nThe developing countries have submitted a number of proposals designed to overcome the world economic crisis:\tthe\tCaracas\tplan of action, the principles set\nforth at Buenos Aires, the Cairo Declaration and the Economic Declaration issued at the Eighth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held at Harare in September 1986. Because our world needs greater interdependence and integration, an objective response from the industrialized world, based on a comprehensive vision of the dimensions of the crisis, could bring prosperity for all mankind.\nThe Yemen Arab Republic, while giving due attention to world economic problems, continues to give its attention to many of the world's social and humanitarian problems as well. In this connection my delegation reaffirms the need for the international community to give greater attention to implementing the World Program of Action concerning Disabled Persons and to observing the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons, and the need to give greater attention to the situation of refugees and to implementation of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women, along with other social and humanitarian issues.\nThe Government and people of the Yemen Arab Republic recently celebrated the silver anniversary of the 26 September 1962 Revolution. In those celebrations we were joined by a number of friendly and fraternal countries. Our celebration takes place at a time' when the Yemeni people have made great forward strides in all areas - social, political and economic. This is attested to by many of those who knew Yemen prior to its Revolution. The choice of democracy as one of the objectives of our glorious Revolution is one of our people's most important victories, and it will culminate in free and direct parliamentary elections to be led at the beginning of next year in keeping with the guiding principles established by our political leadership, represented by brother Colonel Ali tbdulla Saleh, President of the Republic, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces ind General Secretary of the People's General Congress. Our country enjoys security and stability and has made great progress. The beginning of the first ear of the third five-year plan, 1987-1991, represents a new phase of elf-reliance during which we will export the first shipment of Yemeni oil from the shores of the Red Sea.\nAs for Yemen's unity, our national leadership is working with our brothers in he southern part of our homeland in order to achieve unity through peaceful and democratic means and to realize the hopes and aspirations of the Yemeni people.\nIn conclusion, I would ask the Almighty to guide you, Mr. President, to success on your way, and I pray for the progress of our Organization in the service if freedom, justice, prosperity and equality, unimpeded by considerations of color, creed or race. All members of the human race must live as equals on this earth, however diverse their cultures, however far-flung their geographical locations. Peace will never prevail without equality, security and stability in our world, and this cannot be realized without justice for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the Nigerian delegation, I should like to offer our congratulations, Sir, on your unanimous and well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. My delegation joins previous speakers in expressing our sentiments on your distinguished personal merits, which have eminently qualified you for this high office. I have no doubt that under your able leadership this session will achieve great success. I therefore have great pleasure in pledging to you the full support and co-operation of my delegation in the performance of your onerous task. \nWe approach the work of the current session of this Assembly with a sense of objective realism. The original aims and objectives of the Charter hold even more true today in the quest for a peaceful world order and an enhanced process of economic development. It falls to the present members of this world Assembly to ensure the realization of those lofty ideals. The Charter, as applied from the inception of this Organization and strengthened by decisions and resolutions that reflect a preponderance of shared views and aspirations, remains sufficiently flexible to make possible the current effort to reform the structure of the United Nations system.\nThe reform measures put in place by the Secretary-General reflect a determined attempt to implement General Assembly resolution 41/213. This is admittedly a daunting task which we once again insist must remain faithful to the main purposes and objectives towards which the united Nations has directed its efforts for so many years. The world can ill afford to strip this Organization of its effectiveness and the universalist principles that have lent themselves to the aspirations of all member States, big and small, rich and poor. The need to reduce staff and costs must never obscure the need for the efficacy of collaborative efforts which the Organization has come to represent. \nThe Organization must remain committed to the rigorous pursuit of such laudable ventures as are exemplified by resolution S-13/2, adopted at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly to assist African economic recovery and development. It is our strong belief that nothing should detract from this Organization's resolve to maintain this programme on a priority list of issues which deserves a higher allocation of resources.\nMy delegation will support the ongoing process of reform provided it is geared to efficiency without any decrease in the adequate allocation of resources, be they human, financial or material. Unfortunately, however,  every  attempt at restructuring the Secretariat that occurred earlier this year is certain to undermine the wide-ranging support originally pledged to that process by member States. The Secretary-General must now focus his attention solely on a reorganization that ensures administrative efficiency. More important, it must be carried out with full cognisance of the tenets of the United Nations Charter regarding the sovereign equality of all member states.\nIn order to facilitate a smooth reordering of priorities and invigoration of a worth-while institutional framework geared to the achievement of development, the world needs peace. It deserves peace. yet this ideal situation continues to elude us. The African continent, which has most of the world's least developed countries, is unfortunately, plagued by intractable conflicts. Most of these conflicts can be traced to the nefarious activities of the racist minority regime in apartheid South Africa.\nMy Government has consistently drawn the attention of the international community to the plight of millions of indigenous inhabitants of South Africa. We have collaborated with an ever-widening cycle of concerned nations, which continue to urge those countries whose actions and pronouncements tend to embolden the apartheid regime in its open defiance of world opinion, to be mindful of the enormity of the negative stand they have taken.\nMore than ever before, the need for the international community to take concrete and effective measures towards the eradication of apartheid, which has been roundly condemned as a crime against humanity, cannot be over-emphasized.\nThe apartheid regime has torn families apart and destroyed humble places of abode of its largely impoverished African population. It has set Soweto ablaze, brutalized teenage Africans through torture and imprisonment. It dehumanised the indigenous population by relegating it to a state of statelessness. Today, over 100 laws are in place to stifle all shades of opinion, in particular, the media.\nFriends of the apartheid regime have, in the past few years, delighted themselves with cosmetic measures, which the racists played up to the world as reforms, while its friends extolled these empty gestures, we have never relented in our steadfast opposition to this palliative political posturing. For, there can be no real peace in South Africa until the whole ignoble edifice of apartheid is completely dismantled.\nYet we cannot deny that in the past few years the majority of ordinary citizens, private organizations, educational institutions, religious and other well-meaning organizations in many countries have demonstrated their abhorrence of this unjust rule either by pulling their investments out of South Africa, or by vigorously urging their Governments to apply economic sanctions against the racists. We watch with deep interest and satisfaction the very mature approach of students, businessmen and trade unions in taking concrete action which underlines their commitment to political freedom and economic emancipation for the majority of South Africans. Regrettably, however, certain powerful individuals in high government positions remain unmoved. But the wind of change unleashed in the streets of Sharpeville, and strengthened in the classrooms of Soweto, has become a hurricane, which, as it gathers force, will no doubt sweep away all vestiges of repression and the unjust laws of the apartheid regime.\nThe process of shaping international opinion towards decisive action has been long and at times frustrating. But the present situation augurs well for 23 million Africans in South Africa. The positive roles of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Nordic countries, the socialist States and a few Western countries are noteworthy. The groundswell of the anti-apartheid movement in the United States has now assumed such proportions that the Congress has unequivocally demonstrated its desire for positive change in the apartheid enclave. Apartheid is no longer perceived along partisan, ideological or racial lines.\nThe policy of Nigeria with regard to South Africa is clearly one of honour, but it is also one that holds firmly to the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, we have always stated that our belief in the armed struggle in South Africa and Namibia is predicated on the necessity to wrest, from an unjust order, those basic freedoms that many nations have always fought for in Europe and America. In this regard we also support a dialogue, conducted on the basis of true racial equality, to resolve the issue of the total eradication of apartheid. Let the racists talk to the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) with a view to bringing to an end the violence they started, and this Organization can then squarely face other major issues which still promote division in international relations.\nThe United Nations' failure, so far, to resolve the issue of Namibia's independence is inextricably intertwined with all the problems that call for early resolution in southern Africa. Racism and racial discrimination have always characterized Namibia's subjugation by South Africa. When in 1978 the Security Council agreed on a plan for the independence of Namibia, the world thought that the end of the indigenous population's nightmare was in sight. However, at the prompting of its Western friends, purely extraneous issues were introduced to ensure the denial of freedom to the Namibian people. Nigeria firmly repudiates the infamous linkage concept. We also reject any makeshift political devices that exclude recognition of the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people. The encouragement of break-away factions only serves the purposes of apartheid South Africa, and the economic exploitation of the unholy alliance in that territory. The United Nations Council for Namibia must be strengthened to enable it effectively to administer the territory until the plan envisaged under Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has been fully implemented.\nLast year, the General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring the South Atlantic a zone of peace and co-operation. This was and still remains, in Nigeria's view, a laudable gesture. It is my delegation's belief that the nations contiguous to the South Atlantic remain under an obligation to keep this zone free of super-Power rivalry, thus maintaining its innocent nature.\nMy country is eager to co-operate with any neighbouring country in any endeavour to achieve this objective. We are prepared to co-operate with all nations bordering the South Atlantic in efforts to guarantee freedom of navigation weather-forecasting and all plans favourable to environmental protection thereby ensuring that the interests of all humanity are adequately protected. To our South American friends we offer the vision of the South Atlantic Ocean as an ocean that unites rather than separates us.\nThe situation that exists between Chad and Libya is, to say the least, unfortunate and highly regrettable. The Organization of African Unity has mediated and continues to seek a peaceful solution to the problem. It is essential therefore that we should all give full support to the cause of peace that is being promoted by the OAU in this matter\u00b7 We are therefore happy that the General Assembly deferred the inclusion of this matter in its agenda in order to give more time for further consultation.\nAn opportunity for such consultation took place at the summit level on 24 September 1987, in Lusaka, Zambia. It re-established a climate of dialogue which, we believe, will enhance the process of peaceful resolution of the conflict. In fact, the two parties to the conflict have reaffirmed their commitment and willingness to work towards a negotiated settlement of the dispute. In addition, they have accepted the OAU framework for its resolution.\nIn this regard the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on the dispute underlined the need o find a peaceful, African solution to it and warned against its internationalisation. We, therefore, call on the Assembly and the international community to respect Africa's wishes. We call for respect for the OAU peace efforts with regard to the conflict so that there may be a rapid return of peace to the area so that resources may be devoted to the process of development.\nMy delegation does not believe that the situation in the Middle East is beyond resolution. The fact is that in the absence of the political will to accord to the Palestinians the right to their own homeland, one of the main actors would have been pushed into the background. The main issues in a possible negotiation process would have been ignored. Just as Nigeria would reiterate the right of Israel to exist, my delegation is convinced that the role of peace would be served if all concerned also believed in peaceful coexistence. To this end, my delegation fully supports the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East, where all the main actors in the protracted dispute would be represented. We do not share the view that the peace process would be served by a denial of the right of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to be represented at such a conference. When, on 20 July 1987, the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution which called for the cessation of hostilities between Iraq and Iran, the world heaved a sigh of relief. To render Security Council resolution 598 (1987) effective, we call on all those countries whose naval power is currently being flaunted in the Gulf to withdraw. There is no excuse for calling for the cessation of hostilities on the one hand, only shortly after to proceed with amassing an array of sophisticated naval fire-power that can only make it more difficult to achieve peace. It is doubly disappointing that both Iraq and Iran, two friends of Nigeria of long standing, have not yet achieved the peace they need for socio-economic development.\nIn like manner, the people of Afghanistan deserve peace. To this end, we commend the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General's Special Representative to achieve national reconciliation.\nMy delegation believes that the time has come to enable the people of Kampuchea to embark on reconstruction and development after such a protracted period of conflict and instability. The chronicle of unfortunate events in a friendly country, a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, is of great concern to my delegation. We urge all sides in this dispute to demonstrate their respect for the territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Kampuchea by implementing the relevant General Assembly resolutions to this effect.\nSince 1985 the world has been given reason to believe that the end of the arms race is 9 little closer. The announcement by the super-Powers that a new round of disarmament talks in Geneva would tackle the reduction of nuclear arms, leading to their eventual elimination, was hailed by my Government as a step in the right direction. My delegation welcomes the 18 September announcement that the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have agreed in principle to a treaty to eliminate medium- and short-range missiles. We continue to urge all the nuclear States to devote greater energies to the total elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.\nFor 26 years the United Nations has urged that a test-ban treaty should be signed by nuclear-power States. A moratorium on testing would therefore seem a very logical approach. Accordingly, my delegation commended the Soviet union for its bold initiative last year unilaterally to impose a moratorium on weapons testing. Unfortunately, that commendable initiative has been brought to an end. It is even more regrettable that others were unable to reciprocate, thus making the search for a nuclear-weapon-free world that much more difficult.\nThere is a clear complementarily between disarmament, development and security. For instance, world military expenditure is currently estimated at $1 trillion, while the combined debt burden of all the developing countries is about the same amount. My delegation firmly supports any move to set aside some of this huge expenditure on armaments for development purposes. Care must be taken not to allow an otherwise praiseworthy idea to become entangled in ideological pretension.\nThe recently concluded Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development failed to achieve its main objective. Although it agreed on basic definitions, extraneous ideas were adopted which tended to elevate the abstract \\\"essence of armed security above that of trade and development. The failure to adopt any categorical plan for the release through financing arrangements of resources that it is hoped would be saved by disarmament may render further progress difficult. The current world economic situation, particularly for developing countries, leaves much to be desired. While substantial growth has continued in developed countries for the\tconsecutive year, the economic prospects for developing countries in general, and those of Africa in particular, continue to remain very bleak: Despite the painstaking efforts of most of the developing countries to undertake some appreciable levels of structural adjustment they continue to be haunted by monetary debt problems, insurmountable debt service problems falling commodity prices, unjustified protectionism in some developed countries against developing countries' commodities, and high interest rates.\nIt will be recalled that in May 1986 a special session of the General Assembly was Held which resulted in the adoption of a United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, to be implemented at the national, regional and international levels\u00b7 In spite of the national measures taken by African countries in the form of structural adjustment, and at the international level in support of the United Nations Programme by way of the $12.4 billion replenishment of the International Development Association, 45 per cent of which is to be allocated to sub-Saharan Africa  it is still unlikely that an adequate financial flow will be provided to bridge the financing gap which Africa is expected to face until 1990 and beyond.\nThe Conference sponsored by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and devoted exclusively to the challenge of economic recovery and accelerated development in Africa met in Abuja, Nigeria, from 15 to 19 June this year. It recommended a comprehensive approach to aid flows to support structural adjustment programmes in Africa and focused particularly on disbursing funds for spare parts and material needed to increase the utilization of existing capacity in industry, agriculture and public infrastructure. The Conference called for an exceptional measure to reduce the debt service burden of African countries, which should include measures to convert official development assistance debt into grants, longer repayment and grace periods, lower interest rates on existing official debt, and consideration of the possibility of repayment of debts in local currencies by African countries. I whole-heartedly commend these recommendations to the Assembly.\nOur concern focuses on the fact that a lot is expected of us by way of sacrifice, but it seems that nothing is being realized in return for the sacrifices we have made and continue to make. In the recent past, certain proposals were made by some developed countries to alleviate Africa's crippling debt crisis. Unfortunately, the promises of the Baker plan, British proposals on rescheduling and low interest rate concessions to developing countries have not been fully implemented.\nDespite these efforts, a lot more is still required to meet the expanding resource demands of developing countries, particularly when net private foreign investment has also fallen back substantially, from an estimated $17,2 billion at the peak in 1981 for all capital importing developing countries to $7.7 billion in 1985. Thus, the requirement that developing countries finance debt service from trade surpluses rather than from additional capital inflows remains untenable.\nI have no doubt that when the Secretary-General reports to the Assembly on his efforts in dealing with the financial crisis of Africa, we shall be well briefed on the practical and politically acceptable proposals put forward by the expert group which he set up in April to deal with debt relief and financial flows to African countries. This Assembly and the international community in general can do a lot to support the Programme of Action and proposals that will provide Africa in particular and developing countries in general with the essential external resource input necessary for their development. The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which was held in Geneva in July and August of this year, provided the international community with a unique opportunity to negotiate an agreement on the interrelated issues of debt, resource flows, trade and development. That Conference gave recognition to the belief that any resolution of the debt Question must be within the context of the need to foster growth and development in the developing world. In Geneva, the international community agreed that while developing nations need to restructure their economies, there is a corresponding obligation on the developed nations to increase resource flows to third-world nations. The seventh session of UNCTAD agreed that since the collapse of commodity prices has accentuated the debt burden of developing nations there is urgent need for producers and consumers of raw materials to work together to strengthen commodity agreements, not only because of the need to restore commodity prices to remunerative and equitable levels, but also to revitalize co-operation between the developed and developing nations. The seventh session of UNCTAD reminded us all that multilateral co-operation is a catalyst for reviving the world economy as a whole.\nIt cannot be assumed that ideas, or even mechanisms, for furthering solutions to pressing issues concerning the world economy should be pursued only in the North-South context. On the contrary, developing countries not only are keenly aware of but have, through various mechanisms, given concrete expression to the need to exploit the potential for co-operation among themselves in the economic and technical fields. Nigeria, in close collaboration with its partners in the Economic Community of West African States, has taken steps to invigorate our sub region's capacity to achieve rapid economic recovery through trade liberalization and the pooling of resources. Yet all joint programmes, worked out with the active co-operation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, as well as the Organization of African Unity (OAU), can achieve the desired goal only if the problems of debt, stabilization of exchange rates and greater access to the markets of the developed countries are resolved.\nThe 1972 United Nations Conference on the Environment, held in Stockholm, was an important milestone since it not only sensitised concern for but also helped to fashion a global consensus on issues of the environment. That Conference has generated in its wake a number of initiatives on the environment, culminating in the establishment of the World Commission on Environment and Development, which has issued a report entitled Our Common Future.\nMy Government welcomes that report. We take particular satisfaction in its basic message that there is a close connection between ecology and economy and a need to ensure that sustainable development does not impair the capacity of future generations to meet their own requirements.\nWe care very deeply about the issue of the environment, as is demonstrated by the measures we have instituted to safeguard our environment. None the less we are also keenly aware that major environmental problems are often global in character, and we therefore feel that it is unhelpful to ascribe lack of interest in environmental protection largely to developing countries when they are in fact often marginal to the causes of environmental problems.\nFurthermore, my Government is of the view that we should guard against translating concern for environmental protection into a new form of conditionality for development assistance by the multilateral development and financial institutions, so that the cost of development will not unnecessarily be made even more burdensome for already overburdened developing countries.\nThe problems of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking have reached alarming proportions. The United Nations sponsored international conference held in Vienna earlier this year was timely. Apart from the severe sanctions contained in Nigeria's domestic laws against drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking, Nigeria has, at the international level, signed bilateral agreements with some countries to deal with drug-related issues, especially illicit drug trafficking. Nigeria also has national laws and regulations in conformity with the United Nations conventions on psychoactive drugs. While Nigeria supports the idea of an international convention to deal with drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking, it must be stressed that global uniformity in sanctions against illicit drug trafficking is long overdue. It would certainly put a stop to the movement of drug traffickers from countries with severe sanctions to those with more lenient ones.\nIn conclusion I should like once again to stress my delegation's commitment to the principle of multilateralism in all spheres of activity of the Organization. The United Nations will not be able to achieve a positive role in world events if we stray from the aims and objectives of its Charter. We must therefore be prepared to do more than merely accuse the super-Powers of monopolizing responsibility for and initiatives on the resolution of conflicts.\nIt is our conviction that the time has come when we must all share the responsibility for conflict management through an active commitment to world peace. We must continuously seek to contribute to the basket of ideas that will facilitate such a process. The issue of peace is so critical that we cannot afford to abdicate that responsibility. \n\nOurs should be a world of peace; it should be a world of security, and above all it should be a world of justice, where we work together to uphold the principles and tenets of the Charter in order to attain our common future.\n  \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffYour election, Mr. President, is both recognition of the continuing endeavours of the German Democratic Republic for peace and harmony between peoples and a tribute to your great qualities as an experienced statesman and diplomat. I am therefore pleased to offer you the warmest congratulations of the delegation of Senegal and to wish you every success in the discharge of your mandate.\nYour distinguished predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury of Bangladesh, with his lucidity, wisdom and ability, inspired and successfully presided over the last session, I once again extend to him our thanks.\nI also pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mt. Javier Perez de Cuellar, a man of conviction, initiative and courage, who deserves our appreciation and support. I also welcome Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed, in whom we have complete confidence, and congratulate him on his selection by the Secretary-General, which was well deserved. \nThis forty-second session of the General Assembly is beginning its work in an atmosphere of expectation and hope.\nOur common resolve is to continue the work of building a more balanced and more just world - particularly since the holding two years ago of the fortieth anniversary session of this Organization - has enabled us to glimpse, and sometimes even see, an outline of solutions to some of the major challenges of our age. We must persevere because, above and beyond national stakes and interests, our common efforts are aimed at one objective; to promote the dignity of each individual and of every people through international co-operation. This great noble undertaking - and we have a historic responsibility to future generations to achieve it \u2013 requires of all of us lucidity, political will and active solidarity.\nIt is in this spirit that I would speak on behalf of Mr. Abdou Diouf,\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal, and bring to the Assembly the modest but sincere contribution of the Senegalese people and Government to the implementation of the programme for the rehabilitation of man and peoples in their common rights to peace, development and progress. In this context, re-establishing a growth economy, promoting and protecting human rights and maintaining international peace and security constitute three topics of burning relevance today. May I be permitted to dwell on them for a few moments and share our thoughts with the Assembly.\nAt a time when the developing countries have the greatest need for financial resources to ensure their growth, what we are witnessing is in fact a reverse trend: in 1985 the developing countries carried out a net transfer of resources of $US 31 billion to the developed countries, and in 1986 this situation not only continued but also worsened. In this context we believe that the North-South dialogue is more than mere wishful thinking; rather, it is an imperative to be translated into tangible action at a time when interdependence between nations is the backdrop to international relations.\nThe New Substantive Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries and also, what is closer to us, the United Nations Programme of Action for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa, 1986-1990, if successfully concluded in a spirit of active harmony and solidarity, could help to restore the economic health of many countries of the South that are represented here and thus improve the future of their  peoples.\nAs we are all aware, this United Nations Programme of Action for Africa enshrines commitments solemnly entered into here by one and all - by African Governments and by the international community.\nSince the Secretary-General has already prepared a detailed follow-up report on the matter, it would be superfluous for me to dwell excessively on the work done by our Organization to implement that Programme of Action. However, Senegal would like to hail the many initiatives taken by the Secretary-General, such as the establishment of a Steering Committee of the United Nations, the establishment of a Group of Eminent Persons, and the interagency meetings held in Dakar in March 1986. The continuation of these efforts, together with co-ordination work, and efforts towards implementation at the regional level by the Economic Commission for Africa, should make it possible to strengthen the capacity of the international organizations to respond in time to difficulties encountered in implementing the Programme of Action. \nPart of the international community also responded positively to the debt problem and debt servicing that detract from the adjustment efforts of African countries. My country welcomes the decision taken in this regard by several countries to cancel or to convert into bonds the public debt entered into by African countries that have been seriously affected by the crisis. We trust that this effort of active solidarity will encourage other partners of Africa, if not to take the same political step, at least to take initiatives with the same goal of providing the African countries real relief from the crushing burden of their foreign debts.\nThe African countries, for their part, are not sitting with their arms folded in the face of the critical situation confronting their economies. After all, they have solemnly stated that they must first count on their own efforts to solve the problem.\nI should like to mention briefly the case of my own country, Senegal.\nAccording to the World Bank's Consultative Group for Senegal, which met in Paris from 31 March to 1 April 1987:\n\\\"Two years ago the Government of Senegal began an extremely courageous and large-scale programme for economic restructuring and institutional reform. While no one questions the need for such measures, some persons were sceptical as to the tenacity and courage needed of the public authorities to be able to follow this difficult path which had just been mapped out. Others, invoking the fragility of the Senegalese economy and the difficulties inherent in such change, had doubted whether the measures would in fact lead to real improvement in Senegal's economic situation. Nevertheless, despite these apprehensions, an agreement was concluded between Senegal and its creditors. \n\\\"Two years after the beginning of this undertaking it would seem to us that, as we look at the progress made, a very clear consensus has emerged whereby the Senegalese Government has to a large extent attained its objectives and in fact achieved far better success than many would have ventured to hope.\\\"\nAnxious to benefit to the utmost from the experience gained in implementing its adjustment programme, my Government opted for an institutional and functional development of existing structures following upon the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly, on the critical economic situation of Africa.\t,\nThus at the institutional level, the Inter-Ministerial Committee which, under the effective chairmanship of the Head of State, meets quarterly to supervise implementation of the adjustment programme, and the Technical Committee, which provides follow-up during the inter-quarterly periods, have had their membership changed so as to include all of the ministerial departments involved in the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action.\nOn the functional level, the powers of the Inter-Ministerial Committee and the Technical Committee have been broadened to include follow-up and Implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action. Thus the Technical Committee meets on a monthly basis with the creditors in order to study development projects and programmes and together with our partners, hold economic and financial negotiations as needed.\nThanks to these institutional and functional reforms, the assistance provided by organizations in the United Nations system is directed towards the adjustment programme, the priority programme and the United Nations Programme, thereby strengthening the co-ordinating capacity of the Government in the priority areas. These institutional and organic measures and initiatives are backed up by major economic reforms to respond to the priority programme of modalities and objectives of the United Nations Programme of Action.\nIn the area of public finances, public expenditures representing 32 per cent of the gross national product in 1980-1981, amounted to only 21 per cent of the gross national product in 1985-1986. In 1987, despite the heavy burden of debt-servicing, which accounts for 40 per cent of budget income and almost 25 per cent of export earnings, the deficit is now only 1 per cent of the gross national product, and there has been a sharp drop in the commitments of the public authorities to the banking system and enterprises,\nSenegal has also adopted new agricultural and industrial policies in order to stimulate production and growth.\nThe new agricultural policy is designed essentially to diversify agricultural output; to ensure food self-sufficiency; to ensure that the State is no longer involved in certain activities; to ensure the direct responsibility of the rural population and the peasants; to establish a credit bank to be managed by the peasants Instead of the State; and to provide new impetus for production co-operatives. And there are several other measures, including the setting of remunerative prices for agricultural products.\nThe new industrial policy was instituted in 1986 and is intended to remedy the lack of dynamism and competitiveness in industry. The Government undertook to remove the State from this sector so as to promote private investment, which is essential to re-growth in the secondary sector. This industrial development strategy required corrective intervention mechanisms and techniques. To that end, the State established an inter-ministerial structure to take effective action in restructuring enterprises that were in difficulty. In order to ensure greater investment, the State organizes regular meetings with creditors by holding sectoral meetings and meetings of potential private investors.\nLastly, studies are now under way and measures have been taken to minimize the impact of structural adjustment on the social sector.\nThat, in brief, is a summary of a few aspects of the implementation of the programmes undertaken by Senegal. We solemnly reaffirm our will to persevere on this path of organized and planned adjustment of our economy. Nevertheless, and this is a very important point, these efforts have involved sacrifices on our part in the area of employment and the social sector in particular. Such sacrifices will prove viable for Senegal and for other countries undertaking such reforms only if there is active support and real commitment from the international community.\nOf course, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have established special mechanisms for reform programmes in Africa. Donors have indeed carried out the eighth replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association (IDA) amounting to $12 billion, and the World Bank has decided to raise to 45 per cent the IDA resources for investment in Africa south of the Sahara. The International Fund for Agricultural Development and the Food and Agricultural Organization have also committed themselves to specific programmes for the countries of Africa.\nHowever important those efforts may be, they cannot conceal the even more important and major efforts that remain to be made. That is why Senegal ardently hopes that in the near future the response of the community of donors will deal more with official development aid, on the one hand, and, on the other, with an agreed approach to easing the external debt burden of Africa, whose conditions and modalities will have to be decided on in the context of an international conference. \nThe struggle against drought, desertification and acid rain continues to mobilize us within the African regional context - in the Inter-state Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel, the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development and the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference - so as to ensure food self-sufficiency in a manner in which the balance of the ecosystem will be respected and restored. On the occasion of the fourteenth anniversary of the Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel, in his message of 11 September 1987, President Abdou Diouf, in his capacity as Chairman of that Organization, after expressing once again his thanks to the international community, solemnly stated that despite the perils of drought and desertification, the States members of the Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel were resolved to win what he called \\\"the war against hunger and desertification\\\".\nThe Head of state of Senegal, in speaking about the long-term prospects for action against hunger and accepting the Hunger Project \\\"Africa Leadership\\\" prize here in New York on 17 September 1987, appealed to the international community to stand side by side with the African States in a world front for economic peace in Africa.\nThe objective of such a front is to continue and increase action now under way to deal with the critical situation and nutritional needs and, above all, to establish an integrated strategy for carrying out lasting and definitive solutions to the problem of hunger. The initial responses to that appeal strengthen our conviction that this Assembly, which has already dealt with the concept of countries stricken by desertification, will indeed offer the support which this initiative deserves.\nAs important as economic recovery is, there is another aspect of building a world of progress, justice and peace, namely, the protection of human rights and the rights of peoples. Senegal, Whose Government  has placed the individual at the very centre of its policy and its day-to-day preoccupations, continues to be involved in the exalted work of the international promotion of human rights Human rights are an indivisible and interdependent whole. The same importance must be devoted to promoting and protecting all the rights of man - civil and political rights; economic, social and cultural rights; individual rights or collective rights; the rights of the first generation, of the second generation, and even the third.\nInternational co-operation thus has open to it a vast field in which to seek the necessary conditions to achieve human rights through an approach that embraces the social, economic and cultural heritages of peoples. This must necessarily involve a regional approach, as it is true that such action will also strengthen international co-operation in the area. Against this background, we are happy to welcome the entry into force, on 21 October 1986, of the African charter of the rights of the individual and of peoples, which indeed holds great promise. It is the decisive contribution of our Mother Africa to the universal endeavour of protecting and promoting human rights. We are also pleased that its monitoring group, the African commission on the rights of the individual and of peoples, has now been established with the election of its 11 members on 29 July 1987, and we trust that its work will indeed live up to the hopes of all those who hold justice dear.\nWhile we welcome these measures taken by the Organization of African Unity to ensure true respect for human rights in Africa, we must recognize that much remains to be done, particularly in the southern-most part of the continent, specifically in South Africa, where the apartheid regime, that crime against mankind, continues to run rampant. That system of racism and institutionalised racial discrimination, with its permanent state of emergency, arbitrary detention, unjust sentences and arbitrary executions constitutes a serious challenge and threat to the authority and credibility of the United Nations. It is the most widespread and flagrant violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nIllegally occupying the international territory of Namibia, the Pretoria regime continues to carry on with impunity its acts of aggression, destabilization and invasion against neighbouring African countries, thereby negating the principles and norms of modern international law.\nIn the face of such a situation, it is difficult to conceive of any peaceful solution apart from pressure on the Botha regime. It is difficult to conceive of measures other than the imposition of comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa, to try to provide the conditions necessary to ensure the initiation of honest negotiations, carried out in good faith, between the Pretoria authorities and the legitimate representatives of the liberation movements and patriotic forces of South Africa with a view to establishing a system based on equality, democracy and fraternity..\nThere was a glimmer of hope at the meeting held at Dakar from 9 to 12 July 1987 between representatives of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and a group of white Afrikaners from South Africa who initiated a new approach designed to avoid any conflict situation that could become tragic in its dimensions. That new process of evolution towards a non-racial, democratic and egalitarian society does indeed inspire some hope of dispelling misunderstanding and fear.\nThose who participated in the meeting at Dakar \u2014 people of all races, all political persuasions, all social positions - unanimously recognized that the establishment of a non-racial democracy in South Africa was both urgent and The recent international conference on children, repression and the law under the apartheid regime, which met at Harare only a few days ago and brought together representatives of the ANC, domestic anti-apartheid movements and representatives of more than 30 countries, and the first meeting of 8ou national delegates of South African white groups against apartheid within the context of a conference entitled \\\"Towards Democracy\\\" were carried out in the same spirit as the Dakar meeting and extended its scope.\nThe advent of democracy in the southern part of our continent is indeed a real challenge to the United Nations. To take up this challenge, which is a blot on the millennium that is drawing to a close, the United Nations - which, in 1985, in a coming together of mind and heart, celebrated the fortieth anniversary of its Charter and, in 1986, commemorated the International Year of Peace and the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the International Covenants on Human Rights - must once again show that it is capable of mobilizing support for just causes that are in keeping with its purposes, principles and objectives.\nBy virtue of the powers vested in it under its historic responsibilities, the Security Council must take the necessary measures under Chapter VII of the Charter to dismantle as soon as possible the abominable system of apartheid, which is the source of all the evils from which the southern part of Africa is suffering.\nAchieving peace also depends on improvement of the world situation as regards the maintenance of international peace and security. We can indeed be happy at the agreement, in principle, entered into by the United States and the Soviet Union on eliminating medium-range missiles from Europe. This is a contribution to 3isarmament, to security and to peace among the nations. We would express the hope that this process, now begun, will continue and that it will be extended to other kinds of weapons, to other countries and to other regions; that it will lead to general and complete disarmament and to the strengthening of peace and international security; and that it will help to make available additional financial resources for aid to development.\nOn the question of the conflict between Chad and Libya and the question of Western Sahara, my country welcomes the promising initiatives that have been taken at the African level by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and its ad hoc committee and also at the level of the United Nations by the Secretary-General and the current chairman of the OAU. We hope that such initiatives will yield positive results.\nBut, despite these few encouraging signs, the international political situation over the last year is still marked by the persistence of traditional hotbeds of tension and the intensification of blind violence in many cases.\nThe conflict in the Middle East, because of its complexity and the seriousness of the implications, is one of the most painful problems facing the International community and one for which a final solution must be found. Yet it is not recommendations or resolutions providing the framework for settlement of the conflict that are lacking. There is even a broad consensus in favour of a just and lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East based on the implementation of a global and balanced approach, taking duly into account the interests of all parties involved. This is a consensus, which today is supported by unanimity, on the recommendation of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East. As the appropriate framework for a search for a just and lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East, the conference should be held as soon as possible under the auspices of the United Nations and with the full participation of all parties involved or interested, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole and authentic representative of the Palestinian people\t\nThe question of knowing what role such a negotiating forum should play and who the actors will be should not, in the view of Senegal, continue to block the efforts of the international community to convene it, if the political will to move ahead is indeed present in everybody. The Security Council must resolutely proceed with the preparatory phase of the international peace conference. The tireless efforts of the Secretary-General made throughout this year confirm that this is the only right path in the present circumstances that can lead to the restoring of trust and a dialogue, both of which are essential to a return to harmony and peace in a region that has given so much to civilization.\nNow can we fail to express once again our concern over the interminable war between Iran and Iraq. Recent developments in the conflict do indeed strengthen our belief that the United Nations, through the Security Council in particular, should bring its full authority to bear to limit the threat of a general outbreak and to bring about a cessation of the fighting and lead the two parties to have recourse to the means of peaceful settlement of their dispute. Some months ago information was made available about an imminent complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, but this has not yet been confirmed in fact. On the contrary, the military situation in that country has worsened and the political situation seems to be deadlocked judging by the state of the negotiations in Geneva. It is high time for the resolutions adopted by this Organization during the last eight years to be taken into consideration so that the people of Afghanistan may finally exercise their right freely to determine their own future.\t,\nThis aspiration to self-determination also inspires the people of Kampuchea, who are still living under foreign occupation despite the constantly renewed efforts of our Organization to bring back peace to that part of the world.\nUnder the far-sighted leadership of the President of the International Conference on Kampuchea, Mr. Leopold Gratz, the Ad Hoc Committee established by that Conference, over which my country has the honour of presiding, continues to seek ways and means of removing the obstacles to the application of the principles that were defined in July 1981 for a just, lasting and definitive settlement of all aspects of the problem of Kampuchea.\nSenegal, for its part, reaffirms its support for the eight-point proposal of the provisional coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and will continue to spare no effort to help the people of Kampuchea to regain its dignity. It is, more specifically, a Question of the withdrawal of the foreign troops to enable the Kampuchean people to exercise in all freedom their right to self-determination, achieve reconciliation and buckle down to the tasks of reconstruction and development of a country devastated by war. \nIn Central America, the political settlement of conflicts, both internal and external, should be accompanied by regional guarantees of security and non-interference, protection of human rights and the establishment of democracy, with absolute respect for the sovereignty of States, as recommended by the Contadora Group, the Lima Support Group and the Guatemala agreement. My country welcomes the agreement entered into by countries in the region and assure those friendly countries of our support for its implementation.\nThe international community is faced with the phenomenon of international terrorism, which also constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security. The struggle against international terrorism must be waged with courage and far-sightedness and in accordance with the principles set forth in the Charter of our Organization. Senegal will continue to spare no effort to make its contribution to the international community's efforts to put an end as quickly as possible to international terrorism.\nThis year once again the credibility of this universal Organization has been sorely tested. The political, economic and financial problems facing the human race as a whole constitute real threats to international peace and security. Our people are wondering what the future will be and they fix their hopes on us and our work. We must respond to their questions and expectations by genuine co-operation and international solidarity. We have the means to do this for, as the President of the Republic of Senegal said here when he was Acting Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU):\n\\\"Mankind has in the past given us too many examples of its ability to meet constant challenges for us to have any doubts that it will be able to overcome those that beset it today.\\\" (A/40/PV.42, p. 15)\nEach and every one of us must show the political will necessary for our response to live up to the hopes placed in us. It is in that spirit that my country, whose candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council has been unanimously recommended and endorsed by the countries of our region and by the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) , and which will endeavour to merit the trust that Members would place in us by electing us; assures the Assembly that we will make the most positive contribution we can to ensuring the advent of a world of peace, progress and solidarity and the emergence of a planetary village where, in the shadow of the skyscrapers of Manhattan, taking the place of the baobab tree under which palavers take place, our dialogue will be able to solve all the problems facing the human race.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMay I first of all congratulate Mr. Florin on behalf of my delegation on having been elected to preside over the work of the current session of the Assembly. I am convinced that under his expert guidance, we shall be able to bring to a successful conclusion the important tasks before us.\nI also wish to express our gratitude for the tireless and fruitful work done by his predecessor, Mr. Choudhury. I should also like on this occasion to reiterate our full support for the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who last year was unanimously elected to a new term of office in a post full of challenges - challenges which he has faced and continues to face with courage and Imagination.\nThere has been much talk in the past few years about the crisis of multilateralism. We Member States have collectively pondered the reasons and remedies for that phenomenon. In my opinion, the problem is not so much that the multilateral organizations are imperfect as that there is insufficient political will on the part of Member States to help them fulfil their aims.\nIn the case of our Organization, we are faced with the need to find within ourselves a capacity for renewed and shared determination to lend all our support to this collective project. We must go about this realistically, mindful of the changes that have taken place over the past 40 years - changes that call for greater sobriety and efficiency in the day-to-day running of the Organization. In this way, we will keep alive the spirit that attended the founding of the United Nations and the ideals of peace, justice and solidarity referred to at the last session of the General Assembly by His Majesty the King of Spain.\nThere is no point in inventing an imaginary, idyllic world. We must take as our starting-point the real world, where there are wars, death, starvation and injustice and where freedom and peace still remain a mere hope. We must start from this reality and quite simply try to ensure that this world is inhabitable by the end of the twentieth century.\nIn order to achieve that aim, we must deal with three different sets of issues; those relating to security and disarmament; those having to do with the international economic system; and those concerned with the protection of human rights. I shall deal with each of these in turn.\nThe work of the Assembly is influenced every year by the general climate prevailing in international life, but also - in a very special way - by the state of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Spain is glad to see the improvement that has taken place in these relations and the positive character of the dialogue currently in progress.\nWe believe that d\u00e9tente requires the fostering of confidence among States. This will not come about in the absence of guarantees for the security of all of them, we, for our part, hold to the conviction that security in the world today can and should be achieved on the basis of, among other things, a balance of forces at the lowest possible level. We are convinced that it is possible to move towards a more secure world without this necessarily implying that it will be a more heavily armed world.\nWe are therefore pleased that the Geneva negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union have led to an agreement in principle on the elimination of intermediate-range nuclear systems. There is no historical precedent so far for agreements of this nature, which may well reinforce the positive trend opened up in East-West relations. Spain has from the outset sought to promote the achievement of these agreements and will support every effort to secure further agreements which are both necessary and possible in such fields as strategic weapons, space defence and the banning of nuclear tests.\nDespite its importance, the reduction of nuclear weapons will not by itself generate a satisfactory level of security. A treaty must be rapidly concluded to bring about the total eradication of chemical weapons. Moreover, Spain looks with concern upon the extraordinary accumulation of conventional forces and weapons on European territory - as well as their serious asymmetry. It is therefore urgent that negotiations be undertaken with a view to eliminating these disparities, ensuring conventional stability at lower levels and making large-scale offensives and surprise attacks impossible.\nAll these agreements must be accompanied by verification procedures to ensure compliance, thus increasing the confidence needed to strengthen d\u00e9tente. As Europeans, we attach the greatest importance to the improvement of East-West relations. We shall therefore make every effort to ensure that the work of the current session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Vienna contributes to the Implementation of the commitments undertaken thus far in all fields and develops them further.\nMy Government has repeatedly stressed its determination to preserve Spain's status as a non-nuclear country. That intention has also been ratified by a decision taken in a national referendum and will be legally completed with Spain's imminent accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) . The sovereign decision by the Spanish people not to acquire nuclear weapons of its own and not to permit the nuclear weapons of third parties to be brought on its territory - or deployed or stockpiled there - is thus confirmed.\nWe hope that our accession to the NPT will help to strengthen politically the non-proliferation regime, both horizontally and vertically. All the issues that face us in the field of security and disarmament must elicit a suitable response from this General Assembly, thus paving the way for the forthcoming third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.\nIn this context, we welcome the results achieved at the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. Perhaps our greatest historical piece of folly - one for which we will be held accountable by future generations - is the scandalous squandering of resources on increasingly sophisticated weapons, when the threshold of total destruction was passed long ago and while immense areas of the planet are still sunk in hunger and misery.\nThe second point to which I have referred is the clarification and restructuring of economic relations. This is another of the great challenges facing the international community.\nAccording to the latest United Nations world economic survey, a slowing down of the world economy has taken place for the second year in a row. Moreover, most of the developing countries have not experienced sustained growth and many of them are heading for stagnation in the medium term. Nor is the instability recorded in numerous markets for goods and services very encouraging. In real terms, commodity prices are at their lowest level for the past 50 years and there are no signs that improvement is about to take place.\nSince interdependence is an inescapable reality, both developed and developing countries alike share a responsibility to work for the stability of the system as a whole and to seek pragmatic solutions. The developed countries can do this by adopting policies that favour economic growth and access to markets, and the developing countries by implementing appropriate adjustment policies that foster sustained non-inflationary growth. In this context official development assistance also plays an important part. For the last few years Spain has been endeavouring to increase its contribution to the extent possible.\nIt is out hope that at this session the General Assembly will tackle economic issues with both determination and realism, seeking in the most intractable issues the lowest common denominator acceptable to all, as was the case last year following the promising special session on the economic situation in Africa, but without shying away from imaginative solutions or objectives, which are vital in the long run. The recent example of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII), at which, after painstaking efforts by all delegations, it was possible to obtain moderately satisfactory results, should prompt us to hold even more strongly to that constructive spirit during the current session.\nThe problem of external debt continues to be one of the most pressing matters the developing countries have to face, particularly in the Latin American region. At the same time it also affects the functioning of the international financial system as a whole. I wish to stress here in the Assembly the doctrine that creditors and debtors have a shared responsibility to solve the debt problem.\nSo long as we are incapable of generating sustained growth for the developing countries and helping to co-ordinate the economic policies that will make it possible, so long as those countries are unable to increase their domestic savings and have to live in stagnation, there will be social and even moral limits to their adjustment policies, for it is not possible to follow indefinitely the example of Sisyphus, who pushed the rock up the mountain every morning only to see it roll back down in the afternoon and had to push it back up the next day. It is necessary to build up real hope with real measures, for this is a real problem involving not financial figures but the human beings behind them. Positive action is required, such as more favourable rescheduling, trade liberalization, fair prices, increased resources made available to multilateral agencies and aid for development through an effective transfer of technologies and resources.\nSpain supports such a policy and has advocated and will advocate in every forum a policy aimed at dialogue, such as was called for here by the Spanish Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez.\nI now come to the third issue to which I referred earlier - the defence, promotion and protection of human rights. This is a field in which the United Nations has in the course of its existence tirelessly persevered in an attempt to establish new commitments and respond with determination to unavoidable challenges. The codification of those rights has been perfected and at the same time effective arrangements have been established for the monitoring of the obligations states have entered into in this field. All this has helped to bring to maturity a universal ethical conscience such that the community of nations cannot remain indifferent to the massive and systematic violation of those rights. In such cases there can be no question of resorting to the argument of national sovereignty and non-intervention in the Internal affairs of other States.\nIt is encouraging to note the progress that has been made in defining and developing legal norms, in particular in respect of the monitoring machinery that has been set up. There is, however, still much to be done in both fields, especially in the area of the effective monitoring of respect for human rights and concrete solidarity with those social sectors that continue to be subjected to indiscriminate repression or marginalization.\nThe recent entry into force of the Convention against Torture is an important step in this direction. Spain will ratify it as soon as the parliamentary procedures, which are already far advanced, are complete. It is Intended that that ratification will be accompanied by the declarations provided for in articles 21 and 22 of the Convention, since it is felt that to monitor compliance effectively requires recognition of the jurisdiction of the Committee of Experts set up for that purpose.\nWhile addressing the social and humanitarian sphere, I wish to stress the capital importance of the recent Vienna Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. No one can disregard the increasingly alarming magnitude of this problem, which has now reached worldwide proportions. Its extremely grave repercussions are not merely of a social and economic nature; they are also relate to the notion of security, in view of the links of this phenomenon with others, such as arms trafficking or terrorism, in the impenetrable and powerful networks o international black money, we are convinced that only close international co-operation will make it possible for the illicit traffic in drugs to be combated and their consumption eradicated.\nTerrorism is also taking on a worldwide dimension. It is a scourge that threatens us all and that we must all work together to eradicate. The United Nations, which has already promoted several conventions designed to combat terrorism in the legal sphere, has also taking a far-reaching step In political terms by adopting by consensus General Assembly resolution 40/61, which expresses unreservedly the most uncompromising condemnation of terrorism. This extremely encouraging development must not, however, remain as an isolated declaratory gesture. The consensus achieved must be maintained and broadened by devising recommendations and measures in the various sectoral areas.\nThe task of protecting human rights, which is a vital imperative at this point in history, takes on its maximum significance when those rights are institutionally breached. Racial discrimination, which is always odious and incompatible with the very notion of human dignity, appears in all its starkness in our time with the apartheid system instituted and perpetuated by the South African regime. The international community must once again make it clear beyond all doubt that that system must be totally eradicated once and for all. In this context, we note with grave concern the continuing refusal of Pretoria to commence a genuine internal political dialogue with the representatives of the black majority. \nHaving analysed the major challenges facing the international community, 1 shall now go on, as have some of my colleagues, to discuss some of the regional problems with which the Organization has to deal. If the maintaining of the apartheid system is the result of the purblind reactionary policy of the Pretoria Government, it must be admitted that in the last few months the grave state of tension that prevails in southern Africa has been \\\" deteriorating and that responsibility for the instability in the area also lies with the Republic of South Africa. Spain condemns the attempts to destabilize South Africa's neighbours by means of: a policy of military and economic aggression. \nMoreover, the situation in Namibia, characterized as it is by the maintaining of a colonial relationship and racial discrimination, has still not been channelled along the paths repeatedly called for by this Organization, through the application, without delay or excuse, of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the concomitant independence of the Territory. With regard to the Middle East, it is a positive sign to see the almost universal acceptance by the international community of the principle of convening an international conference. In the present circumstances this is the only formula likely to make it possible to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement of the conflict. Such a settlement should be based upon withdrawal by Israel from the occupied Arab territories, respect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination, and the security of all the States in the region, including Israel, within internationally recognized frontiers. The conference, which must be open to participation by all the parties involved and concerned in the conflict, will certainly have to be approached painstakingly and realistically. But it would not seem appropriate to delay convening it. Spain hopes that all the parties involved will make an effort to overcome the obstacles that still stand in the way of such a conference. Meanwhile, Spain is following with growing concern the deterioration in the human rights situation in the territories occupied by Israel, and the increasing number of illegal settlements there. Such action and behaviour has a negative effect on the peace process in the region.\nIn Lebanon there are tragic recurrences of episodes of bloodshed that impede the necessary peaceful community life of a country which deserves a better fate and whose unity, independence and territorial integrity must be safeguarded. We are also concerned about the sufferings of the Palestinian refugees, aggravated as they are by the internal situation in the camps resulting from the attacks from outside to which they are subjected.\t\nOn the long and bloody war between Iran and Iraq, the Organization took an important step when the Security Council unanimously approved resolution 598 (1987). I reiterate our full support for the Secretary-General, who is continuing to make efforts to bring closer together the positions of the parties to the conflict. We believe that resolution 598 (1987) is balanced and realistic. We urge both parties to express without reservation of any kind their willingness to implement the decisions of the Council in their entirety.\nWe are concerned, moreover, at the recent escalation of the war and call for the immediate imposition of a cease-fire on the various fronts. We also condemn the intolerable attacks on free navigation in the waters of the Gulf. The question of Cyprus continues to be a very dangerous source of tension in an area that is already deeply troubled. We continue to urge a compromise which will fully guarantee the unity, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and enable the two communities on the Island to live together in peace. \n Spain regards the Maghreb as a region of priority Interest and is endeavouring to make a comprehensive and active contribution to harmony and cooperation among all the countries in the area. For this reason, the persistence of the Western Sahara conflict continues to give cause for concern. Spain supports the Secretary-General's efforts to use his good offices to reach a negotiated settlement In accordance with United Nations resolutions. The outcome of such a settlement should be a referendum on self-determination, in accordance with the principles and modalities laid down both by this Organization and by the Organization of African unity to make known the will of the Saharan people.\nIn Afghanistan, the Indirect talks held under the auspices of the Secretary-General have still produced no agreement. The withdrawal of the Soviet troops and respect for the right to self-determination of the Afghan people are the essential elements of a lasting and peaceful solution of the problem. This is the way mapped out by the resolutions adopted, by an overwhelming majority, in the General Assembly year after year.\nIn Kampuchea we are confronted with a similar situation, for in this case, too, we believe that the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops is an essential prerequisite for that country to have the chance to choose in freedom the political system best suited to its interests.\nThe consolidation of the internal processes of democratisation in certain countries in Asia and the Pacific area clearly has an influence beyond those countries and contributes significantly to the stability and security of the region.\nWe Spaniards feel fraternally bound to the peoples of Latin America, and share their aspirations to peace, freedom and justice as if they were our own. It is thus a source of deep satisfaction that, despite the persistence of difficulties democracy is becoming more firmly established, that encouraging steps are being taken towards the settlement of certain conflict situations and that dialogue and co-operation between the Latin American countries is being strengthened. All this highlights the constructive contribution of the Latin American peoples to the cause of peace.\nAs regards the crisis in Central America, we have always maintained that this harrowing conflict is a regional problem the deep-seated causes of which are to be found in the persistence of unjust economic and social structures. Consequently, the solution, which must be a peaceful and negotiated one, must likewise be regional. We still believe, too, that prospects for peace in the area are by no means enhanced by trying to place its problems in the context of the confrontation between the great Powers.\nWe have accordingly encouraged from the outset the activities of the Contadora Group, which has set in motion a process in which its members, together with those of the Support Group, have shown realism and a willingness to engage in dialogue. In the course of this process the Contadora Group and its Support Group have been successful in generating political will and providing a frame of reference for settling the conflict which has secured the support of all the Latin American '\u00b7 countries, the member countries of the European Economic Community and the vast majority of the international community.\nThe recent signing of the extremely important Guatemala agreement all the Central American countries has made it clear that this effort has not been in vain. But the really decisive factor is that the Central American countries are willing to approach the solution of their problems in a spirit of solidarity, using the instruments of dialogue and negotiation. \nThe steps which have been taken since 7 August underscore the importance of the process under way, the firm political will of the Central American countries to carry it through and the need for them to be able to count on the encouragement and support of the international community. Spain sees this as a one-way journey, in which any external interference would be not only Inadvisable but even rash, jeopardizing the establishment of a definitive peace in the area. For this reason, in reiterating the support of the Spanish Government for the Guatemala agreement we urge the Assembly to express in a clear and forceful way the support of the international community for this agreement.\nThe spirit in which the Central American Presidents have acted has also highlighted the profound desire for peace of the Latin American peoples and their reiterated commitment to negotiation and dialogue as the best way of providing lasting solutions to existing conflicts. We are sure that this same spirit will continue to inform the treatment of all disputes that exist or may arise between them.\t,\nI also wish to refer to the colonial situation of the Malvinas Islands, which remain a source of concern to the international community. This problem can be solved only through negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Argentina leading to the restoration of Argentina\u2019s territorial integrity. This need not entail disregarding the legitimate interests of the population of the islands. It is urgently necessary that such negotiations take place between the two Governments, and we urge them to begin there.\nThere is also a colonial Question which continues to affect my country in a very direct way. The Spanish Government and people are still determined to find a definitive solution to the problem of Gibraltar that will enable the Rock to be restored to our national territory without damaging the interests of the population. With this aim, we are determined to pursue the dialogue with the United Kingdom on the lines of the Brussels Declaration, by which both Governments decided to solve the problem in all its aspects, including the sovereignty aspect, by negotiation. This negotiation necessarily includes political and technical elements, and we are willing to make parallel progress in both fields, although always in the direction marked out years ago by the Assembly of completing the process of decolonisation and restoring Spanish territorial integrity..\nI began by referring to the alleged crisis of multilateralism and I shall end with it. One of the elements which in the last two years has been added to this phenomenon is the financial crisis which has overtaken our Organization. Following the passing by a consensus last year of resolution 41/213, on the basis of the report of the Group of 18, a process of administrative and financial reform of the United Nations has been started. It is our wish that the reform currently under way should lead on the one hand to greater rationalization and better use of the means and resources of the Organization and on the other to a strengthening of its work to achieve the purposes of the Charter and meet the needs of the international community in our time.\nThe reform is ultimately a task for all of us and we should all be engaged in it. No country can legitimately withhold its financial contributions, thus failing to meet its obligations under the Charter. We trust, in short, that this year substantial progress will be made in the analysis of the internal situation of the United Nations, that accurate diagnoses will be carried out and that a start will be made on teaching agreement on specific revitalization measures. Only in that way will it be possible to strengthen the role of the Organization as an essential forum for discussion, harmonization and action in international relations, and its character as an irreplaceable multilateral instrument, with which Spain fully Identifies and for the success of which it will spare no effort.\nFifty years ago an eminent Spaniard, Mr. Gregorio Marafton, said something which holds good today:\n\\\"We do not know where men will find their new path and their new faith, or where these will lead, but ... the interpretation of the overarching phenomenon of our time, which is the instinctive sense of panic of our species, suggests that the marvellous discovery which will transform future generations is, quite simply, peace\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the Mauritanian delegation, Sir, may I first congratulate you on your well-deserved election to the presidency or the forty-second session of the General Assembly. Your moral and intellectual qualities and the wise, constructive positions taken by your country are assurances of the smooth functioning of the work of the session. We also congratulate your predecessor, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, on the outstanding way he presided over the work of the forty-first session, and Ambassador Reed of the United States of America on his appointment to his lofty office.\nI also express to the Secretary-General once again out country's respect and confidence in him and I thank him for the effective, far-sighted way in which he performs the task entrusted to him. We also welcome his efforts to promote international peace and security.\t.\nA rapid survey of the international situation makes clear the scale of the dangers threatening the future of mankind. The economic crisis continues to worsen and its effects are being felt more severely each day. The North-South dialogue, on which such great hopes were placed, is, and may continue to be, stalemated. World growth is below the level recorded in the 1960, which suggests there are several years of recession ahead for our economies.\nThe gap continues to widen between the developed and developing nations. The per capita income of the developing countries fell by 4 per cent at the very time when a 3.5 per cent increase was recorded by the industrialized nations. The conjuncture of deteriorating terms of trade, the debt burden, protectionism and the acute instability of financial markets explains this alarming trend.\nThe deterioration in terms of trade reached new heights in 1986 with the fall of commodity prices to their lowest level since the Second World War. At the same time, the price of manufactures continued to rise, wiping out the results of efforts to redress the balances of payment of the developing countries.\nThe strengthening of protectionism in the developed countries, the weakness of commodity markets and the meagre South-South trade are throttling our young industries. Lastly, the scale of debt and above all the scale of debt servicing have resulted in a veritable financial haemorrhage for our economies and have seriously undermined our export earnings, already weakened by the deterioration in the terms of trade.\nThe consequences of these factors for the economies of the developing countries have been disastrous. Unemployment, hunger, disease, illiteracy and social crises are becoming widespread. Several development projects and social programmes have been rendered impossible, and everything suggests that this tendency will continue in future. This situation cannot but be a cause of concern to the whole international community, since no one can live in isolation and it is unthinkable for a minority to continue to live in opulence while the overwhelming majority of the peoples of the world have intolerable standards of living.\nWe are duty bound to become involved in a process that can overcome the present crisis. This process should begin with global negotiations, characterized this time by the determination to achieve concrete results. The short-term objective must be to take immediate steps to believe the suffering of the peoples of the third world, and, over the long-term, the objective must be to make deep-seated reforms in the international economic system in order to establish a just and equitable new order. That is the path of salvation, prosperity and peace, and no one is entitled to stray from it.\nThis economic situation has seriously afflicted Africa, which alone has to bear one fifth of the debt burden of the third world. We continue to place our hopes in the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, and we whole-heartedly desire a special conference on the African debt to be convened.\nOne of the scourges threatening our continent is drought and desertification, which persist despite a slight improvement in rainfall. According to forecasts by specialists, the forests of Mauritania, for example, could disappear in a few years if there is not a marked improvement in climatic conditions. Mauritania has joined with other States of the Sahel, within the context of regional organizations, to combat that threat and promote the economic and social well being of the peoples of the region. Nationally, a vast programme of economic recovery and growth has been in effect since 1985 and tangible results - such as a substantial reduction in the budget deficit - can already be seen.\nThe rural sector occupies pride of place in this programme. The long-term objective is to achieve food self-sufficiency, in accordance with the guidelines laid down in the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development.\nAt present we are receiving significant food assistance, and we take this opportunity sincerely to thank friendly countries and United Nations agencies for this generous aid. Unfortunately, everything suggests that for several years to come we shall continue to have to appeal to them, but we are already beginning to earmark this assistance for production.\nOur policy of \\\"Food for Work\\\" and the assistance rendered by the Common Counterpart Fund for Food Aid are intended to encourage and stimulate activities for community development. The donors are fully involved in the distribution and management of food assistance. That testifies to our determination to work in an open and businesslike way.\nOur National Government, led by Colonel Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, President of the Military Committee for National Salvation and Head of State, is convinced that the battle for development requires the mobilization of all our energies and the establishment in the country of a climate of confidence. That conviction prompted the decision taken on the morrow of the restructuring of 12 December 1984 to declare a general amnesty for political detainees and to restore all individual and collective freedoms to citizens.\t\u00b7\nThe participation of the citizens in the management of their own affairs became a reality with the organization in December 1986 of free and democratic elections in the municipalities - the first in the history of our country. The elections took place in complete freedom, with many candidates and without any trace of pressure. Our citizens will soon vote in all the departments, in the same conditions, to choose their local representatives.\nMauritania is experiencing a climate of unprecedented freedom. The rights of the citizens are respected and protected, and, internationally, this policy has been crowned by the ratification of several international instruments relating to human rights.\nAnother, no less important, dimension of our policy is the fight against illiteracy, the clarion call for which was given in the historic appeal of 20 January 1986 by the Head of State himself. The objective is to eliminate illiteracy by the 199\u00dbS and to make all citizens aware of the stakes, challenges and realities of our age.\nMauritanian women are playing an increasingly important role in various sectors of national life. Educating them is a particular concern of the public authorities. The programmes against illiteracy are particularly directed to women, and their full involvement has become a fact with the attainment by several women of senior posts in the Government.\nThe international political situation is still characterized by instability and the persistence of flashpoints of tension throughout the world. In the Middle East, .Israel continues to carry out a policy of constant aggression and systematic occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories. It is frantically undertaking changes in the physical and demographic character of those territories, with a view to their final annexation. This policy of fait accompli, expansion and aggression maintains a climate of violence and instability, and it endangers international peace and security.\nThe question of Palestine is the core of the Middle East conflict, and there can be no just and lasting peace in the region without total and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from the Palestinian and other occupied Arab territories, including the Holy City of El-Qods, and recognition of the territorial and national identity of the Palestinian people by means of the free exercise of its right to self-determination and the establishment of a sovereign state in its homeland, under the leadership of its authentic, legitimate representative, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\t.\nIn that context, the convening of an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations, with the full participation of the PLO on a footing of equality with all the other parties, would be an important step, and Mauritania welcomes the efforts deployed towards that end this year.\nIn southern Africa, the apartheid regime, an ally and partner of the Zionist entity, is pursuing with equal zealousness a hateful racist, repressive and expansionist policy against the peoples of South Africa, Namibia and the front-line States.\nWithin the borders of the Republic of South Africa, the Pretoria regime is taking an increasingly hard stand, demonstrating that the so-called constitutional reforms were a mere farce. Mauritania rejects Pretoria's racial policy and reaffirm its support for the heroic, just struggle led by the African National Congress. In Namibia, the Pretoria regime is pursuing its policy of occupation and repression and systematically violating the relevant United Nations resolutions, particularly resolution 435 (1978), adopted unanimously by the Security Council.\nThat resolution remains the sole acceptable basis for a just and lasting settlement of the question of Namibia. Pretoria's aggressive policy is directed against all the States in the region and indiscriminately harms civilians and the vital economic facilities of those States. The regime's constant use of force, in defiance of international law, is a challenge to our Organization and to the entire international community.\nMauritania remains convinced that no just and lasting solution to the problems of southern Africa can be achieved without the total elimination of the policy of apartheid, the establishment of a democratic, egalitarian regime in South Africa and the complete independence of Namibia.\nIn the Gulf, the deadly war between two neighbours that are Members of the United Nations continues. It effects every country of that vital region of the world and is a dangerous threat to international peace and security. Mauritania is deeply devoted to agreement among Islamic nations and desires the security and stability of the Gulf countries. For seven years, therefore, it has been calling for an end to that war by peaceful means. The United Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and other bodies with the same good will have taken initiatives to that end. \nToday we are witnessing the danger of an extension of the conflict, with threats to freedom of navigation in the Gulf; hence it is vital that the international community do its utmost to implement as soon as possible Security Council resolution 598 (1987). In this regard we pay tribute to Iraq's openness to all the peace initiatives, particularly Security Council resolution 598 (1987), and hope that Iran will follow the same course.\t,\nWith regard to the question of Afghanistan, Mauritania remains convinced that only a political solution based on the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country and respect for its independence and sovereignty - thus opening the way to national reconciliation and the establishment of an independent and neutral national government - can restore peace to that struggling brother people.\nAs regards Kampuchea, Mauritania reiterates its support for the resolutions of the Assembly on the question, and reaffirms the need for foreign troops to be withdrawn from Kampuchea so that the Khmer people may freely decide their own future.\nWith regard to the situation in Central America, Mauritania commends the efforts of the Contadora Group and its Support Groups to promote peace and stability in that sensitive region, and hopes that their efforts will be crowned with success.\nI return to the African continent and the fratricidal conflict between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Chad. We ardently hope that the ad hoc committee of Heads of state set up by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to find a final solution to the conflict will be successful.\nOn our immediate borders, the problem of Western Sahara continues to be one of our major concerns. With its many close links to the parties to the conflict, Mauritania considers that there can be no just and lasting solution without a shared desire for understanding and dialogue. Therefore, we support the commendable efforts being made, particularly by the United Nations and the OAU, to find a solution to the conflict.\nPeoples of our region yearn for such a solution, which will allow the freeing of all the potential that exists for the construction of the great Arab Maghreb. Mauritania will firmly resist any attempt to involve it in that fratricidal war, and will maintain its policy of strict neutrality. My Government will continue to do its utmost for the restoration of peace and harmony in our region and for the building of a united and prosperous Maghreb.\nThe conflicts to which I have referred are taking up nearly all the resources of many developing countries, preventing them from devoting those resources to the well-being of their peoples.\nAstronomical sums are devoted each year to the design, production, development and stockpiling of weapons, at a time when more than two thirds of mankind cannot meet their basic needs. That is a challenge to morality, common sense and logic. It is terrible to have to say that never has mankind been so close to self-destruction, in a century in which man has discovered the secret of the atom, conquered space and acquired considerable socio-political rights.\nIt is scandalous that despite our great scientific knowledge and technology and the enormous social and political progress that has been made, we cannot even guarantee the perpetuation of the human race, the fruit of the suffering, sacrifices and laborious efforts of past generations, which lived in a much more difficult environment.\nGeneral and complete disarmament, a fundamental goal of our Organization, unfortunately appears as remote as it is crucial. My country devoutly hopes that the efforts both within the United Nations and outside will contribute as soon as possible to the realization of that goal, and thus remove mankind from the scourge of war and at the same time release part of the enormous resources currently devoted to the arms race to economic and social development.\nThe growing impoverishment of the overwhelming majority of mankind and the imbalance in international economic relations, the persistence of armed conflicts and the arms race are challenges to our Organization, which is called upon to bring about a world of peace and international solidarity and ensure economic, social and cultural progress for all peoples. History will judge our Organization on the extent to which it realizes the principles and purposes of the Charter.\nIn that regard, the Member States - especially the great Powers - have particular responsibilities; they have the duty to do everything possible to ensure the success of the noble and universal mission of this indispensable instrument of international peace and co-operation. Therefore, their words and their deeds, their principles and their purposes, should flow from their adherence to the Charter.\nThe complexity, universality and seriousness of current problems relating to peace and the world economy make multilateralism indispensable. Its strengthening demands the renunciation of all kinds of selfishness and compliance with the requirements of our age - the sovereign equality of States, democracy in international relations and the establishment of a just and equitable economic system.\nMy country is aware of the institutional weaknesses and imperfections of the United Nations, but it also fully appreciates its important successes in such diverse fields as the economic, social and cultural, decolonization, peace, education, health and other related specialized areas. Mauritania reiterates its firm attachment to the noble ideals of the Charter and its faith in the need to develop friendly relations between States, achieve international co-operation based on mutual respect and advantage and preserve the United Nations as an instrument for harmonizing the efforts of nations to achieve those common goals.\nThat devotion to international co-operation, peace and the peaceful settlement of disputes results from the nature and history of my country. At the hinge between Africa and the Arab world, Mauritania is a land where cultures and civilizations meet. Its geographical position makes it the pivot for understanding and co-operation between those two nearby, complementary regions. That role dates back several centuries, to the time when our Mahadras welcomed students from all the regions of Africa and our scholars went to teach in the great Arab universities. Moreover, our land was, and still is, a crossroads and a trading centre.\nOur devotion to peace also derives from our roots in Africa, where persuasion and debate are the usual course of conduct, and from the teachings of our holy religion, Islam, which makes understanding, assistance to others and tolerance a religious duty. Those principles recur as a leitmotiv in the Koran and the Sunna. Thus Allah, the All-Powerful, tells us in the Holy Book:\n\\\"Help ye one another in righteousness and piety.\nBut help ye not one another in sin and rancour.\\\" (The Holy Koran, v: 3)\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am very pleased to extend to you, Mr. President, my congratulations on your election to guide the work of this forty-second session of the General Assembly. I wish you full success in the performance of your important and delicate tasks\u00b7\nThe participation for the first time of the head of the executive branch of the Haitian Government in the work of the General Assembly has a twofold significance. It should be seen first and foremost as a reaffirmation of our devotion to and support for the objectives of the United Nations, which are entirely in line with those of the National Council of Government over which it is my honour to preside. It is also a special tribute to this Organization, which, through the Commission on Human Rights and other agencies of the United Nations system, has for a long time concerned itself with the crisis that has afflicted our country for almost 30 years.\nIt is thus fitting that I should express, on behalf of the Haitian people, all our admiration and our deep gratitude to the tireless Secretary-General,\nMr. Javier Perez de Cu\u00e9llar, who, as he himself said, went to Haiti to demonstrate his concern over the urgent situation in our country and to bring us a message of comfort and encouragement. His stay with us was unfortunately all too brief, but it did enable him to judge for himself the scope of the task facing the National Council of Government, which, having come to power in particular circumstances, suddenly found itself confronting a heavy burden of economic failure, shaky political and social structures and, what is more, a wave of demands by the people whose legitimacy could not be questioned.\nThere are indeed very many essential and urgent needs to be met, very many injustices to be corrected, very many failing structures to be rebuilt and new institutions to be established. That is the task to which we are devoting ourselves, convinced as we are that it must have priority if the transition to democracy is to be ensured and the unity and integrity of the nation is to be safeguarded. No effort has been too great as we strive to achieve that aim. In that respect, we are entitled to be pleased with the value, the scope and the consistency of the work that has been done - work which, at the very least, is remarkable and meets the requirements of a situation that demands change, but without confusion or chaos.\nThus, at the political level a set of measures has been adopted and appropriate structures have been established in order to ensure the active participation of all segments of society in the political life of the nation. For the first time in Haiti's history, the rural masses - which make up more than 70 per cent of the population - have elected their representatives to the Administrative Councils of the Communal Sections. That is one of the measures of which the National Council of Government can be proud; it meets the requirements of social justice for a peasantry that had for too long been kept on the sidelines of public affairs. Truly free unions now exist. There is complete freedom of expression and association, and a very large number of political parties are functioning without hindrance, discrimination or ideological considerations.\nIn a word, there is a new political system based on a liberal Constitution with the following main features; there is a balance among the three powers) there is decentralization} the term of office of the President is limited to five years, and he cannot be re-elected; fundamental rights and freedoms have been strengthened an independent body to organize elections has been set up. Under the established time-table, elections will take place at all levels, with the result that on 7 February 1988 power will pass to the Haitian chosen by the people themselves, without any form of interference. \nWe should be deluding ourselves, however, if we thought a legal framework was enough to guarantee the existence of a democratic society. Disorders, unjustified rebellion, lack of discipline, blindness, intolerance, personal ambitions, ' irresponsibility, a complete lack of patriotism, the temptation to yield to anarchy and the totalitarianism of others - all are threats to this democratic enterprise. However, our faith in the future of democracy, which we feel cannot be turned back, is matched only by the determination of the people to decide its own future and take charge of its destiny.\nOn the economic plane, in 20 months of management, significant recovery measures have been implemented in a truly critical situation. Without losing sight of the structural handicaps of the Haitian economy, which are typical of the least advanced countries, it has proved necessary and urgent to correct internal and external imbalances, to improve public finances and to restore the confidence of investors both national and foreign. In a word, it has proved necessary to create the conditions needed to restore the economy after many years of stagnation and even backwardness.\nTo this end, an interim development programme has been launched. Regrettably, because of its dimensions and its objectives that programme may seem limited, considering the extent and complexity of the structural problems facing our country. But one should recall that the rate of unemployment in Haiti is roughly 50 per cent of the active population and the rate of illiteracy approaches 80 pet cent, while the per capita income is approximately $320 per annum. Even so, and notwithstanding its modest dimensions, the programme is important in that it covers many and varied areas such as health, education, public finances, and so on. Thus its value cannot be questioned. If it is to be implemented, the programme requires more than national efforts alone; it requires substantial, sustained support from the international community.\nAt this crossroads, we must say we regret we have been unable to mobilize the resources Haiti had hoped for. Resources have not been raised in accordance with the urgency of the circumstances\nIn spite of everything, as we work towards our goals, we must at the same time develop a human sense of justice, a sense of mutual respect and self-confidence, and we must trust others; indeed, we must cultivate the values of dialogue, concerted effort and tolerance, and at the same time we must create conditions conducive to progress. If we do these things, we shall reach an important stage on the way towards the accomplishment of our democratic ideals.\nAt its forty-second session the General Assembly will be dealing with serious problems which are often inseparable one from another and that concern international peace, security and co-operation.\nAs emerges from the enlightened report of the Secretary-General, an examination of the state of the world reveals the dangers posed by the arms race and the continuation of crises in the Middle East, in Africa, in Asia and in the Americas, which undeniably present many challenges the international community must meet if it is to build world peace and ensure world security.\nAt the same time, tensions are Increasing everywhere. Acts of terrorism are increasingly frequent; there are repeated attempts at murder and the taking of hostages. Such acts are a manifestation of the kinds of crises that have existed in international relations for nearly four decades. This unleashing of violence which affects all the continents of the world on the economic level and causes serious Imbalances which the third world must face, has taken a heavy toll. Only very few countries of the third world have been spared. As for the most vulnerable and most backward countries, their development lags at least one decade behind the others, as was stressed recently in a report from the world Bank. In the circumstances, how can we fail to face such problems as the collapse of commodity prices, the ceiling on the flow of public assistance and the debt problem, all of which have halted the growth of the countries of the third world?  \nThe Republic of Haiti is firmly convinced that international security is one and indivisible and concerns all States and all peoples. Consequently, it attaches the greatest importance to the role of the United Nations, which must be strengthened if it is truly to be a centre for harmonizing common efforts to ensure the maintenance of peace and security and the strengthening of international co-operation. Hence the need to end those situations that, in addition to threatening international peace and security, undermine the credibility of our Organization.\nThis applies to the Middle East, where the persistence of the conflict and the delay in beginning a negotiating process have only spurred on the cycle of distrust and violence. The bloody tragedy in Lebanon has highlighted the need to redouble the efforts to find a solution to this crisis that has already lasted too long.\nHaiti believes that the fact that the provisions of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 33 8 (1973) have been ignored by some has certainly contributed to the continuance of a highly explosive situation. We feel that the time is ripe for the convening of the international conference on the Middle East, which could lay the foundations for an overall settlement that would take into account Israel's right to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries, the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to a homeland like other peoples, and the need to restore Lebanon's sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity.\nRegarding the war between Iran and Iraq, Haiti welcomes the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), which calls for, among other things, an immediate cease-fire by the belligerents. We earnestly hope that the implementation of that resolution will pave the way for a negotiated settlement. \nSimilarly, in the case of Kampuchea and Afghanistan, we continue to support United Nations efforts to facilitate the search for a political settlement guaranteeing the withdrawal of foreign forces and allowing the Kampuchean and Afghan peoples to determine their own future freely and without foreign intervention or interference.\nWe reaffirm also our support for the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of Cyprus and shall continue to support the Secretary-General's efforts in this context. The Haitian people sympathize with the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people to reunification by peaceful means and hope that the coming Olympic Games in Seoul will mark an important stage on the road to that objective.\nAfrica, to which Haiti remains attached by so many bonds, is waging its final struggles to free itself from the forces of colonialism and racism. It deserves the international community's fullest support in this struggle. We are firmly convinced that the persistence of the apartheid regime in South Africa is one of the greatest challenges of the end of this century. Once again we call for the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the racist regime in the hope that finally the South African people will regain their freedom in a United, democratic, multiracial society.\nWe are also opposed to the continuing illegal occupation of Namibia and reaffirm our full commitment to the cause of the brother people of Namibia, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). Further efforts must be made to ensure Namibia's complete independence, in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. We are deeply concerned by the confrontation in Africa between Libya and Chad. Chad, a developing country which, like ours, is one of the least advanced, wants only peace within its rightful national borders and with its neighbours. Here again, we hope that with the active support of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations common sense will eventually carry the day and that Chad, with its sovereignty over all its territory restored, will regain peace, which will allow it to devote itself exclusively to its economic and social development.\nAs regards the situation in Central America we hail the peace plan adopted at the meeting of Heads of State, pointing the way to a negotiated political settlement with the co-operation of the parties involved. We find that a particularly welcome event because we have always believed that a solution to the problems of Central America could be found only by the peoples of the region themselves. In this connection we cannot fail to pay tribute to President Arias of Costa Rica for his timely action following upon the deserving efforts of the Contadora Group. His courageous efforts in support of peace have earned our deep admiration and gratitude.\nIn tandem with the worsening world economic crisis and its negative impact on the developing countries, the arms race - and more specifically the nuclear-arms race, has reached unprecedented proportions. Hence disarmament must become one of our priority objectives. That is why we welcome the success of negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America on the elimination of intermediate-range missiles. That agreement, when implemented, will represent a decisive step towards the global disarmament plan we earnestly desire. In the event, we hope that putting an end to the enormous waste of resources brought about by arms expenditures will, to some extent, offset the corresponding decline in funds for public development assistance, which have fallen well short of the goals set 25 years ago by the first United Nations Development Decade. For the maintenance of genuine international peace is undoubtedly linked to a realignment of international relations that offers real prospects to a third world burdened by debt and dwindling resources.\nAt a time when the Republic of Haiti is entering upon a decisive stage in its history, it wishes to reaffirm its faith in the values embodied in the United Nations. It remains convinced that this Organization, so long as it enjoys the political support of Member States, will continue to make its irreplaceable contribution to the search for appropriate solutions to problems of all kinds caused by accelerating change in international society and by the many challenges posed at all levels in a world with a population of more than 5 billion human beings, more than two-thirds of whom live in the third world.\nIn solidarity with all peoples and all mankind, the Republic of Haiti will give every support to all steps taken by the Organization for the betterment of man; promoting and guaranteeing his rights and fostering the establishment of more balanced and fraternal relations among peoples. Hence we pledge to maintain and strengthen, with all nations, relations of friendship and co-operation based on the principles of sovereign equality, independence, mutual respect, non-interference, and the right of every people to choose in complete freedom the path it wishes to take for its economic and social development.\nFinally, we reaffirm our confidence in the future of the United Nations and in its mission to secure the triumph of justice, solidarity and world peace.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco I should like, first of all, to express our most sincere and heartfelt congratulations to you. Sir, on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We are convinced that at this crucial juncture for the future of our Organization your eminent qualities as a statesman, your long experience and your deep knowledge of the complexity of international relations are great assets for the successful conclusion of our work. Be assured of the full and complete co-operation of the Moroccan delegation, in a spirit of responsibility and pragmatism, in order to respond positively to the hopes of the community of nations for progress at each session of the General Assembly in the cause of peace, stability and harmony among peoples.\nWe take this opportunity to pay warm tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, who carried out his mandate brilliantly during the past session, allowing our Organization to bridge a particularly difficult moment of its history.\nWe must pay a well-deserved tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who has constantly and tenaciously pursued his praiseworthy efforts to settle the many ongoing conflicts and prevent the emergence of new conflicts. We express our gratitude and pledge firm support for his initiatives.\nFinally, to Ambassador Joseph Reed, a long-standing friend and former Ambassador of the United States to Morocco, who has recently assumed new duties in United Nations Secretariat, we wish full success, convinced as we are that he will carry out his new functions with the sane dynamism and effectiveness he displayed while in Morocco.\nIt is unsettling to observe that despite the efforts being made by so many men and women of goodwill throughout the world, we continue to have such a disquieting image of the world that the most determined among us could at any time sink into the depths of despair.\nWars that could never be justified are raging at the four corners of our planet, the most blatant forms of terrorism are daily expanding to hitherto well-guarded Nations, the disparity between the wealthy and the poor nations is increasing with nothing in sight to break this intolerable cycle.\nYet, more than 40 years have elapsed since the creation of the United Nations during that time it has so borne the hopes of all those who believe in a better world that no shortcoming in the present-day world fails to reflect upon our Organization, casting on it a discredit that is often undeserved but that some do not hesitate to stir up for selfish and purely opportunistic motives. The most elementary honesty requires us to proclaim that such discredit is all the more unfair since the United Nations, despite numerous difficulties and hurdles, has in four decades accomplished much for world peace and the advancement of mankind. Nevertheless, the future of our Organization remains very disquieting. Sufficient financial resources and political determination on the part of Member States are too often lacking.\nA few positive steps have indeed been taken. During the last session the General Assembly adopted resolution 41/213, the purpose of which was to improve the efficiency of the administration and financial functioning of the United Nations. The adoption by consensus of that text was a reflection of the common faith in the Irreplaceable role of our Organization. The Secretary-General has used all the means at his disposal to rationalize working methods, reduce expenditure and increase the efficiency of the Organization. We are therefore justified in formulating the hope that his efforts will receive increased support from Member States, which should show greater respect for their commitments, thereby enabling our Organization to face the changes in the international community and the new challenges of the modern world.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco will remain faithful to all its obligations and do its utmost to further the objectives and increase the credibility of our Organization. It was in that spirit, and in order fully to shoulder its share of responsibility to the international community, that my country this year put forward its candidacy to fill for the next two years the seat on the Security Council allocated to northern Africa, in accordance with the principle of rotation which has always prevailed within the regional groups. We hope thus to have a further opportunity to continue to make our contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security. Many centres of tension persist throughout the world, despite the warnings given and the appeals to reason made every year from this rostrum. The fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq, which is now entering its eighth year, continues to spread destruction and suffering among the populations concerned. That war, which every day further depletes the capabilities of the two warring countries, is gravely threatening the future of the whole region by masking the real problems and giving rise to new sources of instability in a geographical area extending from the eastern Mediterranean to the banks of the Arabian-Persian Gulf.\nIn July 1987 the Security Council, in adopting unanimously resolution 598 (1987), provided a historic opportunity for the restoration of peace and security to the region. The Council followed the path o\u00a3 reason and wisdom when it implemented the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter, which are at the core of the whole system of collective security and permit the Council, once the diagnosis of a breach of the peace has been established, to demand the extinction of the fire by the cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of forces to internationally recognized borders. That Is a necessary preliminary to any appropriate action to deal with the crisis in all its aspects and to the just, honourable and lasting settlement already called for, unfortunately to no avail, by resolution 514 (1982), of 12 July 1982.\nThose compulsory measures, which are \\\"without prejudice to the rights, claims, or position of the parties\\\" in the terms of Article 40 of the Charter, should be implemented without delay, to ensure that the credibility of our Organization and the relevance of the key provisions of the Charter are not undermined. We welcome \u013c Iraq's acceptance of resolution 598 (1987) and strongly urge Iran to respond to the expectations of the international community as clearly expressed by the unanimous | vote of the members of the Security Council. In that spirit. His Majesty King Hassan II, in a message to the Heads of State and Government of the Islamic community stated the following;\n\\\"Islam is above all unifying and tolerant and that should be and should remain its mission. We should therefore seek all the available means of strengthening our unitary determination while respecting our diversities.\\\" We pay a tribute once again to the indefatigable and unceasing efforts undertaken in that spirit by the Secretary-General to reconcile the different points of view and create conditions favourable to a constructive dialogue. The fratricidal conflict between Iran and Iraq has overshadowed the Middle East tragedy and the tragic situation of the Palestinian people, who have been subjected for the past 40 years to exile and foreign occupation. The sacrifices made by that people can be measured only by the sufferings and deprivation it has undergone, and nothing can disguise them or silence the poignant appeal for justice to be done - justice in the form of the right to self-determination, to a homeland and to an autonomous State.\nIs it not an anachronism that the sons of Abraham, the children of a land that is the melting pot of the most flourishing civilization in the history of mankind, should be tearing each other apart, with contempt for the values that are the foundation of their very existence? Is it not time to go back to the path of wisdom and of the future outlined by the regional organizations, such as the Arab League in Fez in 1982 or the United Nations in its many resolutions? The just lasting and global solution of the Israeli-Arab conflict can be found by convening an International conference, with the full and complete participation of all the parties concerned and of the permanent members of the Security Council.\nThe Middle East crisis has engulfed in its turmoil the Lebanese people, which daily experiences the horrors of war and intolerance, whereas it was once a people envied by many, a perfect model of cohabitation and the coexistence of communities and religions. On the basis of its solidarity with the Lebanese people, the Kingdom of Morocco calls for the cessation of all foreign Interference in that country, so that it can undertake the exciting task of reconstruction and regain the bases of national harmony. The seeds of conflict are sown and they germinate each time a people is subjected to foreign domination or to a discriminatory system that assails the dignity and fundamental rights of human beings and is therefore intolerable. That is the reason for the explosive situation imposed by the South African regime upon southern Africa, a situation that threatens the peace and security of the whole continent. While history teaches us that apartheid, which is a blatant challenge to the conscience of humanity, is condemned to disappear \u0159 wisdom requires us to take all the necessary measures to precipitate its fall and thereby save many innocent human lives. It is therefore high time for our Organization to use the complete arsenal of provisions available in the Charter to compel compliance with the Charter's objectives and most essential principles.\nThe Namibian people remain under the domination of apartheid and South African foreign occupation despite the adoption some 10 years ago, of Security Council resolution 437 (1978), which set forth the United Nations plan for that Territory. The determination of the international community should remain strong if unconditional implementation of that plan in its entirety is to be obtained. The Kingdom of Morocco resolutely stands\u00b7 by the Namibian people, to which we renew our full support for the realization of their legitimate aspirations to independence and territorial unity\u00b7\nMy country, striving to preserve the coexistence of all people and the respect due to the identity of each, has always supported the right of each people to choose its own political, economic and social regime without outside interference. It therefore renews its call for the evacuation of foreign troops from Kampuchea and Afghanistan so as to allow the peoples of those countries freely to decide their destiny. Central America is not absent from our concerns. Thus we support and will continue to support the efforts of the Contadora Group aimed at bringing peace and stability to that region on the basis of non-interference and co-operation among the countries concerned. We earnestly hope that the peace plan put forward by President Arias of Costa Rica and his Central American peers will succeed in fostering harmony among all the countries of the region, to which we are bound by common and deep ties of friendship and co-operation.\nAs a State bordering one of the most important maritime waterways - the Straits of Gibraltar, which links the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean - Morocco understandably closely follows the situation in the Mediterranean. The strategic situation of that maritime waterway and the extremely sensitive character of that area with respect to the peace and security of the entire Mediterranean basin call for special attention to the remaining sources of tension. Morocco is deeply attached to the virtues of dialogue and will pursue its chosen path with persistence and determination in order to solve outstanding disputes through concerted action. The sensitivity, the strategic importance and the vulnerability of the area call for us to combine our energies so that the Mediterranean may become a harbour of peace and prosperity for the countries on its north and south shores.\nDriven by that conviction, Morocco participated actively in the meeting of non-aligned Mediterranean countries held in Brioni last June, which decided to establish the bases for dialogue between countries of the northern and southern Mediterranean. It was apparent that the security of the Mediterranean cannot be considered separately and that the problems it raises require comprehensive treatment by all the coastal States.\nIn this regard, Morocco notes with satisfaction the agreement in principle reached between the United States and the Soviet Union to remove short- and medium-range missiles from Europe. That represents important progress, that should be extended to include the missiles carried by the fleets in the Mediterranean.\nSecurity and development are intimately linked. But while world security continues to preoccupy, it must unfortunately be acknowledged that in the field of development the 1980s is a lost decade. The world economy continues to sink into an unprecedented structural crisis. International trade is undergoing the strongest protectionist pressures since the Great Depression of the 1930s. On the one hand, markets for commodity goods have been experiencing an unparalleled historic set-back for the past 50 years; on the other, the international financial system is threatened by bankruptcy under the pressure of the overwhelming burden of debt. This situation, which translates in real terms into a lower standard of living in developing countries, cannot persist without affecting the stability of those nations, and thus further compromising their development efforts,\nTherefore, the struggle for development is not only the most important economic and social issue of our time; it is also a major political problem confronting the international community. It is thus urgent rapidly to engage in restructuring the world economic environment with a view to replacing the present relations, which are mostly based on domination, with linkages based on interdependence and genuine solidarity among all members of the human race.\nIn this respect the external debt crisis is a major test that may prove fatal if a global approach, based on shared responsibility, is not taken in solving this problem, not only in with regard to its immediate technical and accounting aspects, but also with regard to its longer term political and social implications.\nIt should be realized that in Latin America, as well as in Africa, the excessive burden of external debt servicing has become unbearable, and in many cases a sizeable part of the debt is already irrecoverable. I should like here, in the name of my country, to invite creditors from developed countries to show the necessary political will and a reasonable view of their own interests by lifting their customs barriers, by lowering their subsidies for agricultural exports, by supporting the commodities market and by increasing their public development assistance and ensuring an adequate flow of financial resources to developing countries during the present period of macro-economic restructuring. \nThis endeavour should necessarily lead, on the basis of resolution 41/202 and the Final Document of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), to an agreement on debt-restructuring and new formulas for rescheduling, repayment and terms, including the reduction of real interest rates and the stabilization of exchange rates.\nIn Africa, where many countries still experience chaotic situations, coupled with natural disasters, such as the drought that plagued the countries of the Sahel, the struggle for mere survival has replaced every hope of development. Faced with deterioration in the economic environment, the debt burden and demographic pressures, there are in Africa, according to the World Bank, about 15 countries threatened with outright bankruptcy.\nYet 1987 will undoubtedly be an historic year for the African continent since for the first time more than half of the countries of the region have commissioned themselves to a liberalization process of their economic systems. Unfortunately  those reforms are taking place under unfavourable national conditions marked by structural handicaps and an inhospitable international environment.\nAs I stated last year, and must reaffirm today, in spite of a few praiseworthy initiatives undertaken by some donor countries on a bilateral basis and by some institutions of the United Nations system at the multilateral level, on the whole, the response of the international community is not always commensurate with its common responsibility, or consistent with the tragedy of a continent crippled by its debt and cruelly affected by its recovery efforts.\nHowever, I hope, that halfway through the evaluation of the Programme of Action for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa the negative predictions will be contradicted by facts and the next session of the General Assembly will not be for our continent a meeting of betrayed hope. In our sub-region of the Maghreb, Morocco has never stopped working for a brighter future full of promise. At this juncture of emerging political and economic groups, it is inconceivable to imagine the future of the Maghreb countries without unity. The future of the peoples of the region, the fulfilment of their aspirations for progress and stability, will only be reached within the framework of Maghreb solidarity and unity. Since the dawn of our independence, the setting up of a unified Maghreb has been and remains a constant goal of our foreign policy because Morocco, which is an inseparable part of the region, entrusts its future to the global destiny of the Arab Maghreb.\nAware of this requirement, the Governments of the Maghreb countries began to follow that path shortly after attaining their independence by setting up common institutions of co-operation in various areas of the economic and social sectors. The first decade of the functioning of these Maghreb institutions was promising in this regard and to a large extent responded to the will and wishes of the peoples of the region, forged out of an age-old common history and a community of religion, culture, civilization, traditions and language. The first accomplishments of this institutional Maghreb co-operation led to an increase in the exchange flows and the launching of unified programmes that benefited all countries of the region, while allowing for the possibility in future of initiating common negotiations with other groups made of industrialized countries on the other side of the Mediterranean.\nIn our view, the Maghreb countries should give absolute priority to solving all existing disputes so as to open the way decisively to inevitable regional integration and in turn meet the many challenges ahead and face up to the technological and economic competition that will intensify within the Mediterranean region in coming years. Morocco, for its part has spared no effort to bring about good understanding and harmony between the countries of the region. Thus, we have always favourably responded to all attempts at mediation and conciliation made by leaders of friendly and brother countries aimed at restoring the climate of calm and understanding inherent in the relations among the countries of the region.\nWe should like to take this opportunity to pay the highest tribute to the Guardian of the Holy Sanctuaries, His Majesty King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, who played an important role in bringing together two sister countries, Morocco and Algeria, and whose efforts culminated in the meeting he attended between His Majesty King Hassan II and President Chadli Benjedid last May on the Algerian-Moroccan border. That meeting resulted in a renewed dialogue between our two countries which, we hope, will further contribute to improving permanently the state of our relations, dispelling all misapprehensions and settling all outstanding disputes.\nWithin the framework of its constant readiness to work towards the elimination of all hotbeds of tension in our sub-region, the Kingdom of Morocco last year expressed its support here for the good offices initiative undertaken by the Secretary-General of our Organization to reach a just and equitable solution of the so-called question of Western Sahara through a referendum on self-determination. That initiative has just taken a decisive step forward, since the Secretary-General decided on 24 September that a United Nations technical mission will visit the territory in the coming weeks. Mr. Perez de Cuellar has entrusted this mission with the task of gathering the necessary technical information and data available on the spot to enable him to formulate proposals designed to facilitate the holding of a referendum in Western Sahara.\nIt is a fact that the Kingdom of Morocco favourably and promptly responded to the Secretary-General's wishes when, a few months ago, he made known his intentions to dispatch United Nations experts to the territory, so that he would be fully informed, on an impartial basis, of the actual situation on the spot. My country will do its utmost to facilitate the task of the technical mission and give it all means to exercise its prerogatives fully. According to common practice, this technical mission should be able to operate freely and without hindrance. \nIt is up to the Assembly to give full and unfettered support to the Secretary-General and to his work in order to ensure the future success of the good office initiative and thereby promote a final settlement of this issue. In so doing, we will, at the same time, have strengthened the credibility of our Organization and helped restore a climate of harmony and peace in the Maghreb region.\nTrue, the state of the world does not inspire optimism. It is none the less also true that the solutions to the many challenges we have to face at the end of this century cannot be found in defeatism and discouragement. Through concerted action and the affirmation of our solidarity, many problems may be solved and many difficulties overcome.\nDialogue, joint action and solidarity should be made the primary virtues of our Organization. It is only through such endeavour that the roots of the tree of life will continue to nourish the progress of humanity. This is the lesson in wisdom, learned from the more than 40 years existence of the United Nations. Experience teaches us that we must keep it in mind if we wish to keep alive the flame of hope.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI should like to begin, Sir, by extending my and Canada's congratulations and appreciation to you on your assumption of the responsibilities and office of the presidency of the General Assembly.\nA year ago the atmosphere in the Assembly was heavy with a sense of crisis. The financial shortfall of the United Nations, serious in itself, was also a symptom of a deeper worry about the very existence of the Organization.\nCanada, and other friends of the United Nations, used this rostrum to call for reform. I am pleased today to note that substantial reform has begun. 7hat is both a tribute to the men and women who make this Organization work and testimony to the recognition by most nations that a strong United Nations is essential to world peace. We are especially impressed by the United Nations resolve to extend reform beyond the institutions in New York to United Nations economic and social institutions throughout the world.\nFor our part, Canada made a point of paying our 1987 assessment fully and early. We hope other nations will quickly pay their current and past assessments. Those that call for internal reform have a particular obligation and opportunity to encourage it once it begins. That good example would increase the pressure upon other Powers whose contributions are consistently delinquent.\nDuring the past year this real internal reform has been matched by solid progress on many of the major issues of concern to the United Nations. Sometimes that progress occurred outside this multilateral Organization - as, for example, in the historic breakthrough on an arms agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, in the steady pressure against apartheid mounted by the Commonwealth, and in the initiative towards peace launched by the five Presidents of Central America. But in many other cases the world's movement forward was rooted here. Those cases are worth enumerating.\nIn the ongoing war between Iran and Iraq, Security Council resolution 598 (1987) reflects a welcome political will and unanimity in the Security Council, and the Secretary-General is to be commended for his patient, persistent mediation. The Secretary-General's mission was not as successful as we all had hoped. And the speech this morning by the President of Iran can only be characterized as destructive and deeply disappointing. Therefore the Security Council should be reconvened to take the next step. Canada would fully support implementation of the axiomatic second half of resolution 598 (1987) - the application of sanctions.\nAt the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) , the consensus statement on trade, debt and commodities may presage a new era of co-operation between developed and developing countries. UNCTAD VII was an example of an international conference for whose outcome the prognosis was uniformly gloomy. The doubters were wrong. The United Nations scored a major success.\nThe special session on Africa is beginning to yield concrete results, albeit there is a long way yet to go. The international community clearly now recognizes that the majority of African countries are making great efforts to turn their economies around. But the international community must equally recognize that the debt situation for many African countries is desperate and must be addressed in new and innovative ways or the entire recovery programme may collapse.\nIn that context, we welcome the Secretary-General's appointment of the Advisory Panel on Resource Flows. We anxiously await its report. As the representative of Zaire has just indicated, Canada is so concerned about this issue that at the Francophone Summit we announced the cancellation of official development assistance debt for several countries in francophone Africa. Next month, at the Commonwealth Conference, we will do the same for countries of Anglophone Africa.\t \nThe Brundtland Commission has produced a blunt and clear report on the urgency of protecting our resources and environment. In that spirit, in Montreal last week nations signed an ozone Treaty controlling the emissions of chloro fluro carbons. Dr. Mostafa Tolba, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, called it \\\"the first truly global treaty that offers protection to every single human being on this planet.\\\" Our Government believes that Montreal Treaty will serve as a model for future international agreements on the environment.\nThe Conference on disarmament and development, which has just concluded, yielded a remarkable consensus document, holding disarmament and development as essential to international security. It graphically demonstrated the capacity of the Organization to find agreement in the most complex fields.\nThe World Health Organization is recognized as a crucial resource for gathering the statistics and carrying out the planning that are necessary as countries struggle to master the world-wide AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) epidemic.\nWithin its own doors, the United Nations has made social strides in another field: the equal rights of women. In 41 years there had not been even one woman permanently appointed as an Under-Secretary-General. Now there are three, and we in Canada take particular satisfaction that the first woman appointed is an outstanding Canadian, Madame Therese Paguet-Sevigny, under-Secretary-General in the Department of Public Information,\nThere have been other achievements in the past year: the successful Vienna international Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking; the coming into force of the Convention against torture  the International Maritime Organization draft convention on maritime security; and the progress made on verification by the United Nations Disarmament Commission, with which Canada is proud to be associated. This is proof of the worth and vitality of the United Nations and clear evidence of the advantages to be derived from continuing to confront the world's problems together.\nThe great purpose of the United Nations is to extend the reach of peace and justice in the world. Sometimes, as in the war between Iran and Iraq, its role becomes most acute when all other efforts have failed. In other cases it can encourage regional initiatives that may lead to peace where peace is threatened, or focus international attention upon injustice that must end. I want today to speak of one initiative that we must encourage and one injustice that we must end. \nThe Initiative is in Central America, where the presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua have joined together in a genuine effort by all parties to settle their differences peacefully. The surprisingly positive outcome of the Guatemala summit meeting was the result of many factors. They included the foundations laid by Contadora and the Contadora Support Groups, the preparatory work of the Central America countries and the concessions made at the summit by each of the five presidents. That achievement was applauded by us all. But it was only the first of many steps along a difficult road.\nCanadian aid to Central America has been steadily increasing, as has our funding and our acceptance of refugees. We have expressed our view that the root problem in Central America is poverty, not ideology  that the real need is development assistance, not military activity, and that intervention by outside Powers will only aggravate the tension. We have supported the Contadora process and have made available to Contadora the expertise Canadians have acquired in the techniques of peace-keeping.\nImmediately after the Guatemala summit two senior officials of our Government visited Central America to discuss what more Canada might do. I will be visiting the region myself later this autumn.\nCanada supports the initiatives of the Central America presidents. We are prepared to provide our expertise in the design and development of verification and control mechanisms which, once peace is possible, can help it endure. The disputes must be resolved by those actually Involved in the conflict, but Canada is prepared to contribute to that process in any direct and practical way open to us.\nThe injustice to which I referred earlier is apartheid. Canada's position is clear and on the record. We have acted upon all of the sanctions recommended by the Nassau Conference of the Commonwealth Heads of Government. We have Imposed a ban both on new investment in South Africa and re-investment of profits. We have banned the importation of coal, iron and steel. We have banned the promotion of tourism and ended air links. In the first six months of 1987 Canada reduced its imports from South Africa by 51 per cent. Furthermore, we have made it clear that, if other measures fail, we ate prepared to end our economic and diplomatic relations with South Africa, We are helping the victims of apartheid with scholarships, legal aid and other assistance. We contribute substantially to the development of the front-line States, both bilaterally and through the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC). We apply our influence, whether it is effective, to build the pressures against apartheid.\nThe Prime Minister of Canada met with the leaders of Zimbabwe and Zambia and Botswana in Victoria Falls in February, and I visited southern Africa six weeks ago, a visit which included a meeting in Pretoria with the South African Foreign Minister. Olivet Tambo visited Ottawa a month ago and met with our Prime Minister and other Canadian leaders. Early in September it was our honour to act as host to the second summit of La Francophonie in Quebec City, which condemned apartheid and established a scholarship programme for black South Africans. Next month, in Vancouver, we shall act as host to the heads of Government of the Commonwealth, the international family to which South Africa once belonged.\nWe are at a critical stage in the campaign to end apartheid. There must be no relenting in that campaign, no pause in the pressure, because a pause might suggest that apartheid is acceptable, and it is not. The pressure against apartheid must continue and increase, and the challenge, in the United Nations and elsewhere, is to find peaceful and effective means to build that pressure. It is not enough to ask others to act.\nIt is Canada's view that the sanctions imposed upon South Africa have been effective, both economically and psychologically. While the Government of South Africa has reacted by limiting liberty even more, growing numbers of individual South Africans have reached out for reform, in meetings in Lusaka and Dakar and in the private contacts, which we must multiply.\nThe instability in southern Africa is both an ally and a product of apartheid. One of the most wrenching conversations I have had was with Canadian aid workers in Mozambique who fear that the projects they build to help people will become targets of terrorists and put at risk the very lives they are working to improve. An essential part of the challenge in southern Africa is thus to bring more stability to the front-line States.\nBefore I conclude my remarks I want to applaud again the new vitality that has been injected into the global arms-control and disarmament process through the important announcement that the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed in principle to eliminate intermediate and short-range nuclear missiles. Radical reduction in nuclear arms has always been the core of Canadian policy in this area. We should celebrate the fact that this is the first time a prospective agreement will actually eliminate nuclear weapons. That is just the initial step in a long and difficult process, but, with continued determination and resolve, we can hope to move to agreements on strategic weapons, on chemical weapons, on conventional weapons, and on a comprehensive test ban.\nI began by talking about the atmosphere of crisis which was so pervasive as we met last year. Today, we must all surely take satisfaction from the atmosphere of hope that surrounds us; hope, because both globally and regionally there is a recognition that a peaceful and secure world is of universal benefit and worthy of relentless pursuit) hope, because the social and economic evils that beset us are being addressed in a meaningful way) and, finally, hope, because this Organization of ours, the United Nations, is reasserting its capacity to play the central role that it was created and designed to play in dealing with the ills that still plague the international community. The United Nations agenda stretches before us - Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Cyprus, peace in the Middle East between Israel and the Arab States, an end to terrorism, and the fundamental human struggle to eradicate hunger and injustice. Somehow, it feels as though we are closer this year than last to tackling that agenda.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn addressing this international forum, I take pleasure in congratulating you. Sir, in the name of the State of Qatar, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session, which we are confident will be a successful one. Your election was a sign of appreciation of your vast experience and proved competence. We are sure that you will put all these qualities at the service of the Assembly's forty-second session.\nI should like also to express appreciation and thanks to your predecessor for the ability and competence with which he conducted the last session's work.\nOur highest commendation is also due to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his efforts and effective good offices in asserting the United Nations role in the preservation of international peace and security. In particular, we welcome his efforts in bringing conflicts to an end and eliminating the spectre of war. We commend his report to this session on the work of the Organization and affirm our support for its content.\nWe, the Members of the United Nations, owe the Organization our allegiance and support in view of its services for the welfare and development of the international community and its consistent efforts to ensure the preservation of international peace, security and stability. Each of us should therefore uphold the Organization's role, strictly observe its Charter and respect and carry out its resolutions and recommendations. It is from this perspective that we should all proceed in our co-operative relationships with other States, regionally and at the global level. \nIt is therefore with great regret that we note the non-compliance of some States Members of the Organization with the resolutions it adopts. We similarly regret the Organization's inability to require from these few States compliance with its resolutions. This state of affairs casts a pall of impotence over the Organization with regard to certain chronic international problems. It also adversely affects its credibility and the standing of its resolutions in the eyes of the world public.\nThis critical view does not, however, detract from our appreciation of the efforts deployed so tirelessly by the Organization and the Secretary-General in the cause of international peace, security and stability.\nThe Palestinian question remains the living example of disregard of United Nations resolutions in defiance of the political will of the world community. Ever since the displacement of the people of Palestine and the usurpation of their homeland, the Zionist racist entity has remained to this day unrivalled in its contemptuous disregard and arrogant defiance of United Nations resolutions. The actions of this racist entity are all contrary to international legality and to United Nations resolutions. Its behaviour is based on terrorism, hegemony and expansionism. In all this the hallmark of its actions has been utter disregard of international legality and deviation from humane and civilized conduct, relying on its military machine to inflict material and moral destruction.\nThe Palestinian question remains the core of the Middle East problem. All other conflicts and problems in the region are by-products of that basic problem, which is, indeed, a problem for the whole world.\nWe are quite certain that this sensitive region will not know stability and tranquillity until a just and comprehensive solution is found to the Palestinian problem, a solution which would return the Palestinian people to their homeland and enable them to set up an independent State on their national soil under the leadership of their sole, legitimate representative the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nWe urge the world community to help put an end to Israel's arrogance and its defiance of the norms of international law so that such a just and comprehensive solution may be achieved. Israel's settlements policy, the aim of which is to deprive the Palestinian people of their historical right to a homeland and obliterate their identity and culture by destroying their educational, cultural and social institutions, must be brought to an end.\nThe State of Qatar believes that the best means of reaching a just and permanent peace is to convene an international conference, to be attended by the permanent members of the Security Council and by the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Iran-Iraq war is a source of concern and anxiety to my country. It has now entered its eighth year and continues to result in an immense loss of life and resources in both countries. The persistence of that war has disrupted the peace and stability of the Gulf region and could disrupt world peace and stability as a result of threats to international shipping in the waters of the Gulf, the interruption of oil and gas supplies, the escalation of the so-called tanker war and the presence in the waters of the Gulf of increasing numbers of naval units of several States.\nThe State of Qatar, together with the other member States of the Gulf Co-operation Council, is striving to find a way to put an end to the war through a negotiated settlement which would safeguard the legitimate rights of both parties, ensure that the Gulf region does not become the scene of international conflict and preclude the possibility of outside intervention, which has grave consequences for the peoples of the Gulf region.\nWe hope that both parties will exercise the utmost self-restraint and not interfere further with freedom of navigation. We urge our two neighbours, Iran and Iraq, to co-operate in implementing Security Council resolution 598 (1907), which expresses the common will of the international community in its endeavour to bring about a peaceful, just and comprehensive end to this war, conducive to tranquillity and peace in the region under the rule of international legality. Only such a solution can promote the best interests of the peoples of the region and of the world at large.\nWe commend Iraq for its positive stand regarding resolution 598 (19t\u00ed7) and welcome its co-operation with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in that respect. We hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran will act similarly.\nThe recent incident at the holy sanctuary of Mecca, the attacks on the embassies of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in Tehran and the launching of a missile at Kuwaiti territory are ominous indicators of where the region may be heading. We express our regret and dismay at those incidents and demand that they not be repeated against any Arab State of the Gulf.\nLebanon, that brother country, has been living a tragedy since its soil was occupied by Israel five years ago. Its people are experiencing atrocious suffering and part of its territory is still occupied. Imperative calls for withdrawal by the Security Council have, as usual/ been ignored by the Zionist entity. We therefore emphasize the need for the international community to fulfil its duty by seeking the complete withdrawal of Israel from all Lebanese territory. We declare our firm support for the independence of Lebanon and the preservation of its territorial sovereignty.\nMy country expresses great satisfaction at the start of the work of a sub-item entitled \\\"Convening, under the auspices of the United Nations, of an international conference to define terrorism and to differentiate it with the struggle of peoples for national liberation\\\".\nTerrorism is indeed a dangerous phenomenon that threatens the world community. We condemn terrorism and look forward to concerted international action to combat it. Agreement on a precise definition of terrorism will be an important step towards that goal. By contrast, national liberation movements seeking self-determination ate legitimate under the United Nations Charter and should be supported by all.\nThe State of Qatar views with increasing concern what is taking place in Afghanistan, which continues to be a focus of tension in the region and with which we share a common heritage of Islamic religion and history. The presence of foreign troops on Afghan territory threatens the peace and security of neighbouring nations, my country looks forward to the speedy withdrawal of foreign troops in order to enable the people of Afghanistan freely to choose their political system. Years of civil war have proved that there is no military solution to the problem. What is needed is dialogue and, ultimately, the opportunity for the people of Afghanistan to set up the kind of Government they prefer. \nThe situation in southern Africa remains one of our concerns. We hope that suitable solutions will soon be found to bring to an end the suffering of the peoples of South Africa and Namibia. This should be possible when and if the racist regime in Pretoria complies with the resolutions of the United Nations and ends its evil policies towards the neighbouring peoples of southern Africa. My country supports the courageous struggle of the national majority in South Africa against the ruling white racist minority. It is the duty of all Member States to mobilize world public opinion in support of this just humanitarian cause. We reaffirm our solidarity with the people of Namibia, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), in their struggle against the continued occupation and colonization of their homeland in defiance of relevant United Nations resolutions.\nThe world economic crisis still wreaks havoc in all States, especially the developing nations. The debt-servicing burden on many States of Africa, Asia and Latin America is increasing. The indebtedness of third-world nations has reached astronomical levels, estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars. The terms of world trade have deteriorated and the negative effects of the protectionist measures imposed by industrial nations have become more apparent. Prices of raw materials produced by developing nations continue to fall, while prices of the products of industrial nations are on the rise. The resulting inflation and economic stagnation call for a renewed and intensified North-South dialogue, aiming at the establishment of a new economic order or, at the least, improvement and reform of the existing order.\nEconomic growth is the only path likely to enable the developing nations to settle their foreign debts and avert financial ruin. In order to further the process of growth and development, developed nations should encourage the transfer of technology to developing nations, increase their imports from those nations and genuinely reduce the interest rates that burden the developing nations. They should even consider the total or partial cancellation of the debts of those developing nations. We consider it appropriate that loans by international financial institutions to developing nations be increased and the markets of developed nations be opened to the products of developing nations within the context of more stable and realistic trade arrangements.\nIndustrialized countries should curb the arms race and allocate a considerable part of their present military expenditure to development assistance to developing countries.\nFurther, the developing nations in turn should adopt economic policies aimed at restricting consumption and increasing investment and job opportunities for their work forces. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me first welcome the Secretary-General back from his pilgrimage for peace in the Middle East. Hundreds of thousands have already fallen in the bloody conflict between Iran and Iraq. All men and women of goodwill pray that the carnage can soon be stopped, and we pray that the Secretary-General proves to be not only a pilgrim but also the architect of a lasting peace between those two nations. Mr. Secretary-General, the United States supports you, and may God guide you in your labours ahead.\nLike the Secretary-General, all of us here today are on a kind of pilgrimage. We come from every continent, every race and most religions to this great Hall of hope where, in the name of peace, we practise diplomacy. Now diplomacy, of course, is a subtle and nuance craft - so much so that it is said that when one of the most wily diplomats of the nineteenth century passed away, other diplomats asked, on reports of his death, \\\"What do you suppose the old fox meant by that?\\\"\nBut true statesmanship requires not merely skill but something greater, something we call vision, a grasp of the present and of the possibilities of the future. I have come here today to map out for you my own vision of the world's future - one, I believe, that, in its essential elements, is shared by all Americans. And I hope those who see things differently will not mind if I say that we in the United States believe that the place to look first for the shape of the future is not in continental masses and sea lanes, although geography is obviously, of great importance. Neither is it in national reserves of blood and iron or on the other hand, of money and industrial capacity, although military and economic strength are also, of course, crucial. We begin with something that is far simpler and yet far more profound - the human heart.\nAll over the world today, the yearnings of the human heart are redirecting in course of international affairs, putting the lie to the myth of materialism and historical determinism. We have only to open our eyes to see the simple aspirations of ordinary people writ large on the record of our times.\nLast year in the Philippines, ordinary people rekindled the spirit of democracy and restored the electoral process. Some said they had performed a miracle, and, if so, a similar miracle - a transition to democracy - is taking place in the Republic of Korea. Haiti, too, is making a transition. Some despair when these new young democracies face conflicts or challenges, but growing pains are normal in democracies. The United States had them - as has every other democracy on earth.\nIn Latin America, too, one can hear the voices of freedom echo from the pea \u0437 and across the plains. It is the song of ordinary people marching, not in uniforms and not in military file, but, rather, one by one in simple, everyday working clothes - marching to the polls. Ten years ago, only a third of the people in La in America and the Caribbean lived in democracies or in countries that were turning to democracy. Today over 90 per cent do.\nBut this world-wide movement to democracy is not the only way in which simple, ordinary people are leading us in this room - we who are said to be the makers of history - leading us Into the future. Around the world, new businesses, new economic growth, new technologies are emerging from the workshops of ordinary people with extraordinary dreams.\nHere in the United States  entrepreneurial energy - reinvigorated when we cut taxes and regulations - have fuelled the current economic expansion. According to scholars at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, three quarters of the more than 13.5 million new jobs that we have created in this country since the beginning of our expansion rate from businesses with fewer than 100 employees - businesses started by ordinary people who dared to take a chance. And many of our new high technologies were first developed in the garages of fledgling entrepreneurs. Yet America is not the only or perhaps even the best example of the dynamism and dreams that the freeing of markets set free.\nIn India and China, freer markets for farmers have led to an explosion in production. In Africa. Governments are rethinking their policies, and where they ate allowing greater economic freedom to farmers, crop production has improved. Meanwhile, in the newly industrialized countries of the Pacific Rim, free markets in services and manufacturing as well as agriculture have led to a soaring of growth and standards of living. The nations of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Japan, Korea and Taiwan have created the true economic miracle of   the last two decades, and in each of them much of the magic came from ordinary people who succeeded as entrepreneurs.\nIn Latin America, this same lesson of free markets, greater opportunity and growth is being studied and acted on. President Sarney of Brazil spoke for many\nothers when he said that \\\"Private initiative is the engine of economic Development. In Brazil we have learned that every time the state's penetration in the economy increases, our liberty decreases.\\\" Yes, policies that release to flight ordinary people's dreams ate spreading around the world. From Colombia t Turkey to Indonesia, Governments are cutting taxes, reviewing their regulations, and opening opportunities for initiative.\nThere has been much talk in the halls of this building about the \\\"right to development\\\". But more and more the evidence is clear that development is not itself a right. It is the product of rights: the right to own property; the right to buy and sell freely; the right to contract; the right to be free of excessive taxation and regulation, of burdensome government. There have been studies that determine that countries with low tax rates have greater growth than those with high rates.\nWe are all familiar with the phenomenon of the \\\"underground economy\\\". The scholar Hernando de Soto and his colleagues have examined the situation of one country - Peru - and described an economy of the poor that bypasses crushing taxation and stifling regulation. This \\\"informal economy\\\", as the researchers all it, is the principal supplier of many goods and services, and often the only ladder for upward mobility. In the capital city it accounts for almost all public transportation and most street markets. And the researchers concluded that, thanks to the informal economy, \\\"The poor can work, travel, and have a roof over their heads\\\". They might have added that, by becoming underground entrepreneurs themselves or by working for them, the poor have become less poor and the nation itself richer.\nThose who advocate statist solutions to development should take note - the free market is the other path to development and the one true path. And, unlike many other paths, it leads somewhere. It works.\nSo this is where I believe we can find the map to the world's future - in the hearts of ordinary people in their hopes for themselves and their children  and in their prayers as they lay themselves and their families to rest each night. These simple people are the giants of the Earth, the true builders of the world and shapers of the centuries to come. And if Indeed they triumph, as I believe they will, we will at last know a world of peace and freedom, opportunity and hope, and, yes, of democracy - a world in which the spirit of mankind at last conquers the old, familiar enemies of famine, disease, tyranny, and war.\nThis is my vision - America's vision I recognize that some Governments represented in this Hall have other ideas. Some do not believe in democracy or in political, economic, or religious freedom. Some believe in dictatorship - whether by one man, one party, one class, one race, or one vanguard. To those Governments I would only say that the price of oppression is clear. Your economies will fall farther and farther behind. Your people will become more restless. Is it not better to listen to the people's hopes now, rather than their curses later?\nAnd yet, despite our differences, there is one common hope that brought us all to make this common pilgrimage - the hope that mankind will one day beat its swords into the hope of peace. In no place on Earth today is peace more in need of friends than in the Middle East. Its people's yearning for peace is growing. The United States will continue to be an active partner in the efforts of the parties to come together to settle their differences and build a just and lasting peace.\nThis month marks the beginning of the eighth year of the Iran-Iraq war. Two months ago the Security Council adopted a mandatory resolution demanding a cease-fire, withdrawal, and negotiations to end the war. The United States fully supports implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), as we support the Secretary-General's recent mission. We welcomed Iraq's acceptance of that resolution, and remain disappointed at Iran's unwillingness to accept it.\nIn that regard, I know that the President of Iran will be addressing representatives tomorrow. I take this opportunity to call upon him clearly and unequivocally to state whether Iran accepts Security Council resolution 598 (1987) or not. If the answer is positive, it would be a welcome step and a major breakthrough. If it is negative, the Council has no choice but rapidly to adopt enforcement measures.\nFor 40 years the United States has made clear its vital interest in the security of the Persian Gulf and the countries that border it. The oil reserves there are of strategic importance to the economies of the free world. We are committed to maintaining the free flow of this oil and to preventing the domination of the region by any hostile Power.\nWe do not seek confrontation or trouble with Iran or anyone else. Our objective is now, and has been at every stage, finding a means to end the war with no victor and no vanquished. The Increase in out naval presence in the Gulf does not favour one side or the other. It is a response to heightened tensions and followed consultations with our friends in the region. When the tension diminishes, so will our presence.\nThe United States is gratified by many recent diplomatic developments - the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), the Arab League's statement at its recent meeting in Tunis, and the Secretary-General's visit. Yet problems remain.\nThe Soviet Union helped in drafting and reaching an agreement on Security Council resolution 598 (1987). But outside the Security Council, the Soviets have acted differently. They called for removal of our navy from the Gulf, where it has been for 40 years. They made the false accusation that somehow the United States - rather than the war itself - is the source of tension in the Gulf. Such statements are not helpful. They divert attention from the challenge facing us all - a just end to the war.\nThe United States hopes the Soviets will join the other members of the Security Council in vigorously seeking an end to a conflict that should never have begun, should have ended long ago, and has become one of the great tragedies of the post-war era.\nElsewhere in the region, we see the continuing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. After nearly eight years, a million casualties, nearly 4 million others driven into exile, and more intense fighting than ever, it is time for the Soviet Union to leave.\nThe Afghan people roust have the right to determine their own future free of foreign coercion. There is no excuse for prolonging a brutal war or propping up a regime whose days are clearly numbered. That regime offers political proposals that pretend compromise, but really would ensure the perpetuation of the regime's power. Those proposals have failed the only significant test: they have been rejected by the Afghan people. Every day the resistance grows in strength. It is an indispensable patty In the quest for a negotiated solution. \nThe world community must continue to insist on genuine self-determination prompt and full Soviet withdrawal  and the return of the refugees to their homes in safety and honour. The attempt may be made to pressure a few countries to change their vote this year, but this body# I know, will vote overwhelmingly as every year before, for Afghan independence and freedom.\nWe have noted General Secretary Gorbachev's statement of readiness to withdraw. In April I asked the Soviet Union to set a date this year when this withdrawal would begin. I repeat that request now, in this forum for peace. I pledge that, once the Soviet Union shows convincingly that it is ready for a genuine political settlement, the United States is ready to be helpful.\nLet me add one final note on this matter. Pakistan, in the face of enormous pressure and intimidation, has given sanctuary to Afghan refugees. We salute the courage of Pakistan and the Pakistani people. They deserve strong support from all of us.\nAnother regional conflict we all know is taking place in Central America - in Nicaragua.\nTo the Sandinista delegation here today I say: Your people know the true nature of your regime. They have seen their liberties suppressed. They have seen the promises of 1979 go unfulfilled. They have seen their real wages and personal income fall by half - yes, half - since 1979, while your Party elite live lives of privilege and luxury.\nThis is why, despite a billion dollars in Soviet-bloc aid last year alone, despite the largest and best equipped army in Central America, you face a popular revolution at home. It is why the democratic resistance is able to operate freely deep in your heartland. But this revolution should come as no surprise to you. I' is only the revolution you promised the people, and that you then betrayed.\nThe goal of United States policy towards Nicaragua is simple. It is the goal of the Nicaraguan people and the freedom fighters as well: it is democracy - real free, pluralistic, constitutional democracy. Understand this: we will not, and the world community will not, accept phoney \\\"democratisation\\\" designed to mask the perpetuation of dictatorship.  In this 200th year of our own Constitution, we know that real democracy depends on the safeguards of an institutional structure that prevents a concentration of power. It is that which makes rights secure. The temporary relaxation of controls - which can later be tightened - is not democratisation. Again, to the Sandinistas, I say: we continue to hope that Nicaragua will become part of the genuine democratic transformation that we have seen throughout Central America in this decade. We applaud the principles embodied in the Guatemala agreement, which links the security of the Central American democracies to democratic reform in Nicaragua. Now is the time for you to shut down the military machine that threatens your neighbours and assaults your own people. You must end your stranglehold on internal political activity. You must hold free and fair national elections. The media must be truly free - not censored or\t'\nintimidated or crippled by indirect measures such as the denial of newsprint or threats against journalists or their families. Exiles must be allowed to return, to minister, to live, to work, and to organize politically. Then, when persecution of religion has ended and the jails no longer contain political prisoners, national reconciliation and democracy will be possible.\nUnless this happens, democratisation will be a fraud. And until it happens, we will press for true democracy by supporting those fighting for it.\nFreedom in Nicaragua, or Angola, or Afghanistan, or Cambodia, or Eastern Europe, or South Africa or anyplace else on the globe is not just an internal matter. Some time ago the Czech dissident writer, Vaclav Havel, warned the world that\n\\\"respect for human rights is the fundamental condition and the sole genuine guarantee of true peace\\\". And Andrei Sakharov, in his Nobel Lecture, said:  \\\"I am convinced that international confidence, mutual understanding, disarmament, and International security are inconceivable without an open society with freedom of information, freedom of conscience, the right to publish, and the right to travel and choose the country In which one wishes to live.\\\"\nFreedom serves peace. The quest for peace must serve the cause of freedom. Patient diplomacy can contribute to a world In which both can flourish. We are heartened by new prospects for improvement in East-West and, particularly. United States-Soviet relations.\nLast week Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze visited Washington for talks with me and with Secretary of State Shultz. We discussed the full range of issues. Including my long-standing efforts to achieve, for the first time, deep reductions in United States and Soviet nuclear arms. It was six years ago, for example, that I proposed the 2ero option for United States and Soviet longer-range intermediate-range nuclear missiles. I am pleased that we have now agreed in principle to a truly historic treaty that will eliminate an entire class of United States and Soviet nuclear weapons. We have also agreed to intensify our diplomatic efforts in all areas of mutual Interest.\nTowards that end Secretary Shultz and the Foreign Minister will meet again, a month from now, in Moscow, and I will meet again with General Secretary Gorbachev later this fall.\nWe continue to have our differences and probably always will. But that puts a special responsibility on us to find ways - realistic ways - to bring greater stability to our competition and to show the world a constructive example of the value of communication and of the possibility of peaceful solutions to political problems. Here let me add that we seek, through our strategic defence initiative, to find a way to keep the peace through relying on defence - not offence - for deterrence and for eventually rendering ballistic missiles obsolete. The strategic defence Initiative has greatly enhanced the prospects for real arms reduction. It is a crucial part of our efforts to ensure a safer world and a more stable strategic balance.\nWe will continue to pursue the goal of arms reduction, particularly the goal that the General Secretary and I agreed upon: a 50 per cent reduction in our respective strategic nuclear arms. We will continue to press the Soviets for more constructive conduct in the settling of regional conflicts. We look to the Soviets to honour the Helsinki accords. We look for greater freedom for the Soviet peoples within their country/ more people-to-people exchanges with our country and Soviet recognition in practice of the right of freedom of movement.\nWe look forward to a time when things we now regard as sources of friction and even danger can become examples of co-operation between ourselves and the Soviet Union. For instance, I have proposed a collaboration to reduce the barriers between East and West in Berlin, and more broadly in Europe as a whole. Let us work together for a Europe in which force or the threat of force, whether in the form of walls or of guns is no longer an obstacle to free choice by individuals and whole nations, I have also called for more openness in the flow of information from the Soviet Union about its military forces, policies and programmes so that our negotiations about arms reduction can proceed with greater confidence.\nWe hear much about changes in the Soviet Union. We are intensely interested in these changes. We hear the world glasnost which is translated as \\\"openness\\\" in English. Openness is a broad term, it means the free, unfettered flow of information, ideas and people, it means political and intellectual liberty in all forms. We hope, for the sake of the peoples of the USSR, that such changes will come. And we hope, for the sake of peace, that it will include a foreign policy that, respects the freedom and independence of other peoples.\nNo place should be better suited for discussions of peace than this Hall. The first Secretary-General, Trygve Lie, said of the United Nations:\n\\\"With the danger of fire, and in the absence of an organized fire department, it is only common sense for the neighbours to join in setting up their own fire brigades.\\\"\nJoining together to drown the flames of war - this, together with a universal declaration of human rights, was the founding ideal of the United Nations. It is our continuing challenge to ensure that the United Nations lives up to these hopes.\nAs the Secretary-General noted some time ago, the risk of anarchy in the world has increased because the fundamental rules of the United Nations Charter have been violated. The General Assembly has repeatedly acknowledged this with regard to the occupation of Afghanistan, The Charter has a concrete practical meaning today because it touches on all the dimensions of human aspiration that I mentioned earlier: the yearning for democracy and freedom, for global peace and for prosperity.\nThat is why we must protect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from being debased as it was through the infamous \\\"Zionism is racism\\\" resolution. We cannot permit attempts to control the media and promote censorship under the ruse of a so-called new world information order. We must work against efforts to introduce contentious and non-relevant issues into the work of the specialized and technical agencies where we seek progress on urgent problems, from terrorism to drug trafficking to nuclear proliferation, which threaten us all. Such efforts corrupt the Charter and weaken this Organization.\nThere have been important administrative and budget reforms. They have helped. The United States is committed to restoring its contribution as reforms progress. But there is still much to do. The United Nations was built on great dreams and great ideals. Sometimes it has strayed. It is time for it to come home. It was Dag Hammarskjold who said:\n\\\"The end of all political effort must be the well-being of the individual in a life of safety and freedom.\\\"\nShould this not be our credo in the years ahead?\n\nI have spoken today of a vision and of the obstacles to its realization. More than a century ago a young Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville, visited America.\nAfter that visit he predicted that the two great Powers of the future world would be, on the one hand, the United States, which would be built, as he said, \\\"by the ploughshare\\\"; and, on the other hand, Russia, which would go forward, again as he said, \\\"by the sword\\\". Yet, need it be so? Cannot swords be turned to ploughshares? Can we and all nations not live in peace?\nIn our obsession with antagonisms of the moment, we often forget how much unites all the members of humanity. Perhaps we need some outside, universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world. And yet, I ask, is not an alien force already among us? What could be more alien to the universal aspirations of our peoples than war and the threat of war?\nTwo centuries ago, in a hall much smaller than this one, in Philadelphia, Americans met to draft a constitution. In the course of their debates, one of them said that the new Government, if it was to rise high, must be built on the broadest base - the will and consent of the people. And so it was. And so It has been.\nMy message today is that the dreams of ordinary people reach to astonishing heights. If we diplomatic pilgrims are to achieve equal altitudes, we must build all we do on the full breadth of humanity's will and consent and the full expanse of the human heart.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI come before the Assembly representing the Guatemalan nation and its desire to contribute to peace in the world by helping build peace in Central America.\nThe Guatemalan people, as I pointed out in my statement in this Assembly in 1986, have taken over the conduct of their own history and are determined to travel, step by step, the road leading to the attainment of our own utopia: to make Guatemalan society a profoundly humane society, based on participation and pluralism, in which all inhabitants, without distinction as to race, ideology, social sector or economic status, can contribute actively to the taking of decisions essential to our nation. In order to travel that road, the people have chosen the criteria that we have proposed, and in order to attain our objectives we are making rational use of the available human and material resources.\nIt is important to emphasize this latter point, because when one seeks to understand the nature of the proposals we have made to our nation and to Central America one finds in all of them a conscious choice of absolute respect for the life of men and the preservation of the natural resources available to us, so that they may serve all Guatemalan families rather than the interests of a single sector. \nThe attainment of objectives at the lowest possible cost without compromising our principles is the common denominator of each of the measures we have adopted. We reject the concept that appears to have become widespread in recent decades, that the attainment of objectives justifies loss of human life or the destruction of the infrastructure and of natural resources, which do not belong to any ideology, faction or economic group but rather to the nation.\nOn the basis of that principle, we have made it our practice in all circumstances to work towards agreement and avoid confrontation. We define consensus as the maximum degree of agreement possible within disagreement and/ even though we exercise legitimate power in taking final decisions, we always make the greatest effort to ensure that those decisions will be the fruit of an extended process of consultation, discussion and the contribution of ideas even by those social, economic or political groups that do not share with us the ideological underpinnings that define the democratic society that we espouse. If at any time we have had to confront any sector, group or faction of our society, it has been because of its intransigence or negative attitude in the search for a common solution for the benefit of the community.\nWe call this process of seeking a consensus concerted effort. It is a method that some would describe as naive and others as slow or inefficient. But, since we pride ourselves on being familiar with our own history and do not wish to relive it, we well know that all other methods - violence or the exercise of absolute power - have, in the course of our independent life and particularly in the past 20 years, produced only destruction and death without achieving positive results for the benefit of our peoples, which still await a solution to many of their most elementary problems. \nA decision of this nature requires historic courage because it involves a definitive change in many of the traditional attitudes of certain of the leaders of our countries: the temptation to seek absolute power; the rejection of ideological pluralism; party or sectoral fanaticism; the selfishness of the economic interests of families or individualism and, especially, the Impatience that often leads to erroneous decisions to accelerate processes that should develop throughout the life of an entire generation, in the hope that they can be completed successfully within a presidential term of office. Our peoples are tired of being sacrificed to experiment and expect of us, the current leaders of the Central American and American nations and of the nations of the world, a serious, prudent and realistic attitude, so that the path towards the construction of a more humane society will become a one-way street.\nToday, democracy and human rights are inseparable concepts. If the restoration of democracy in a nation that has lost it is a difficult task, it is no less difficult to establish respect for human rights in a society that has suffered from a climate of violence.\nThe constitution of Guatemala, which governs our democracy, accords a primary place to human rights, and my Government has successfully undertaken to guarantee and protect those rights. Those concepts, which guide Guatemala's political conduct, are also fundamental to the policies we advocate at the international level, namely, active neutrality and a Central American parliament.\nIn defining the concept of active neutrality, particular account should be taken of its political, ideological and methodological aspects, and a due relationship to the legal sphere should be established as appropriate. Some who have commented on this concept have indicated that there can be no active neutrality, because when viewing the concept they take the two words separately; naturally, the word \\\"neutrality,\\\" taken in its international context, has its basis in legal language. Our proposal is an integrated concept that would correspond to our international policy and would mean rejecting involvement in armed conflicts and working actively to achieve peace through diplomacy or political action involving concerted effort.\nThat policy is based on the belief that those efforts should be aimed at achieving agreements and establishing consensus to reduce any chance of confrontation so as to achieve the final objectives at the lowest possible cost. Of course, although we reject armed confrontation, we must recognize that there are problems in our region that could lead to such confrontation. In our history, many of the internal conflicts of our country have been instigated, supported, fomented or, at the very least, tolerated by some neighbouring countries that have  sought to impose their own ideology or to prevent the implantation of a neighbour's political system in their own country. That gravely erroneous course must not be repeated. We must attempt to establish in each country of Central America the conditions necessary for tolerance, pluralism and the free participation of all sectors in the political life of the nation.\nIf we act within the framework of established norms and in consultation with the people, using the most appropriate machinery to secure their effective and free participation, that will reduce domestic tensions and the chance of conflicts among our countries and inevitably lead to mutual respect, which we are entitled to expect.\nInstead of accepting confrontation, we must act to establish methods that allow dialogue to lead to an understanding of our problems and to their solution. That is the meaning of \\\"active neutrality\\\": the rejection of armed conflict and active efforts to secure peace through concerted effort.\nAn international policy such as the one we have defined, the backbone of which is recognition of the realities peculiar to each country and the search for accords designed to establish regional consensus, requires a permanent instrument for implementation of the proposed method of concerted effort to establish the bases for Central American political unity, which would be the historical consequence, in the medium or longer term, of such a process.\nThus the proposed Central American parliament would be a forum for discussions and the taking of decisions relating to the solution of problems common to all of us or that affect one or more of the region's countries, problems that could threaten generalized conflict and impede the economic and social development of our peoples.\nSuch a parliament, inspired by the model of the European Parliament, would also seek to make our peoples and the various political and economic social sectors parts of the process of regional integration. It is vitally important that its members be elected directly. That would resolve the problem presented by broad political spread and pluralism and would open the way to proportional representation. At the same time, the proposed system would guarantee respect for the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of each country. The parliament could even eventually establish a higher-level political body in the form of a presidential commission to give executive validity to agreements reached at the parliamentary level.\nA Central American parliament could also complement and strengthen those negotiating formulas that may lead to peace in the region through concerted effort and the setting aside of traditional attitudes of polarity and confrontation.\nConcerted effort, active neutrality and a Central American parliament - those are the political instruments that embody our country's position in the context of the present-day reality of Central America and the need to achieve political stability, security and peace in the region.\nWith those instruments, we seek to inspire a positive and optimistic attitude towards the future without forgetting our geopolitical context and our economic and social problems, and to bring about specific and imaginative solutions to those problems that take both national and regional interests into account. With those concepts, we hope to give the countries of Central America an opportunity to work with all nations interested in our region. We hope to enable them to act together so that with each agreement and each year a further step will be taken towards making the peoples of Central America true protagonists in the historic events we are experiencing.\nFrom the foregoing, it is easy to deduce the short- and medium-term objectives of Guatemala's international policy. The first objective is the initiation of a peace process. Peace in Central America is more than a utopian goal; it is a fundamental necessity in the process of the economic and social development of each country.\nArmed groups that use violence in their attempts to wrest political power from constituted Governments provoke armed clashes that are no longer merely modes of political struggle but serious obstacles to the solution of political, economic and social problems. Those struggles, which entail a constant waste of resources, destroy the scant infrastructures of regions that have barely begun the process of modernization, and they compel Governments to allocate vast resources to armed confrontation instead of to the building of broader and more efficient infrastructures that can meet the basic needs of the populations. In such small-scale conflicts the final outcome is less significant than the fact that they prevent the countries involved from consolidating the democracy to which all aspire.\nIt is obvious that in the situation in Central America, at least in certain ' countries, violence is a major obstacle to the solution of economic and social problems. We are concerned that such violence may increase and become more widespread. The prevention of such a disaster was the goal of the Central American Presidents at the two meetings held in Guatemala, Escruipulas I and II, in which we sought formulas to eliminate the causes of confrontation and lay the foundations for harmonious and fraternal coexistence.\nAt the last meeting we not only worked to avoid the eventuality to which I have referred; when discussing the proposal contained in the document submitted by the President of Costa Rica, we also lay the foundations for processes to eradicate the causes of problems created by armed conflict that were leading to difficult situations, particularly in some countries.\nThus, in Central America it is not necessary merely to stop war; it is also necessary to begin to construct an infrastructure that would help to institutionalise democracy in the area and guarantee lasting peace and economic and social development. The essential corollary of peace is political stability, which is possible in a pluralistic environment in which all the sectors of society can organize and take part in the major decisions of the nation. My personal idea - and I am sure it is shared by the Guatemalan nation - is that that process can occur only in a democratic society, because that kind of society makes it possible to lower the tensions that lead to polarization and confrontation. In fact, our current experience in Guatemala - like the experience of other Latin American nations - shows that it is possible to solve economic and social problems through political pluralism and the organized participation of the people. If that process is consolidated in the Central American region over an extended period, we shall guarantee the wise use of our resources and their equitable distribution among all the sectors of the population.\nBut, while stability is necessary for the development of a nation, it is even more necessary for the development of a given region. Therefore, we state that institutionalising the political processes and learning to work together and develop our autonomy of action are factors that will help to make the Central American region stable.\nNo efforts to achieve peace and political stability can be sustained long enough unless the process of what I have referred to as \\\"concerted effort\\\" becomes institutionalised. That is why the proposal for a Central American parliament has been made - a political institution which would appropriately complement the various economic and cultural organizations that have been developed over recent years in the region, and which would help to create new institutions to strengthen and update the functioning of those earlier institutions.\nThose three objectives are absolutely complementary, and we can state that we are on the way to achieving them, having signed the agreement of 7 August this year. The five Central American Presidents, overcoming the regional tradition, resolved their differences and, taking realistic account of the factors and circumstances that have a bearing on the Central American region, reached an agreement which, by its political scope and its potential effects, is in itself an example of concerted effort for the other nations of the world to see; the highest level of agreement possible within disagreement.\nThe document signed by the Presidents in the quest for a procedure for firm and lasting peace in Central America is truly a logical step towards the achievement of the objectives that I have described. That agreement would not have been possible without the contribution and the efforts of the Latin American countries of the Contadora Group and the unreserved solidarity of the nations of the Support Group. There can be no doubt that those efforts helped to promote an appropriate environment for a thorough discussion, in the various political and economic forums throughout America, of the problems of Central America. That led to the serious and strong endorsement of the expectations opened up by the signing of the \\\"Esquipulas II\\\" agreement.\nIt is my duty to acknowledge the role played by each of my Central American colleagues in the drawing up of this agreement. I laud the political courage and the historic commitment demonstrated by each of the nations in subscribing to that agreement, notwithstanding all the difficulties that each one of us could face as a result of internal and external opposition. Of course, we could not have taken any decision without the untiring efforts of the Foreign Ministers and their working teams, which made the necessary opening that enabled us to take the decisions at the right time. \nThe \\\"Esquipulas \u0399\u0399\\\" agreement is only a first step on a long road. We cannot proclaim to the world that the mere fact of having signed it has solved all the problems, that peace and stability have been achieved. Far from it: now comes the hard part of this task, because if it was difficult to achieve agreements that seemed quite improbable, it is even more difficult to put them into effect.\nWe Guatemalans, at any rate, are optimistic, because we believe that we can go a very long way if there is the political will to move ahead. Our peoples back us up. We look forward ardently to peace. We ate tired of suffering. That is why this agreement has encouraged a regional movement for peace, which young people and women have joined. That was the case at the first meeting of Central American First Ladies, held recently in Guatemala. And there will be other cultural and social events during the remainder of the year at which young people will manifest their feelings in this respect.\nToday, I appeal to the international community to help us to convert the \\\"Esquipulas II\\\" agreement into concrete reality, so that that process will truly lead to a firm and lasting peace in Central America which will make it possible for us to change, once and for all, the sad destiny that had seemed inevitable for our peoples. There have been certain major achievements in this process already. For example, the interest of many countries in various continents has been aroused in the need to co-operate foe the economic and social development of the region. It has repeatedly been pointed out that it would be most important for this co-operation to be provided to the five Central American countries at the same time as a process of democratisation was being developed. This is the time for the international community to show its solidarity at all levels. I have no doubt that the response to this appeal will be enthusiastic and will enable us to feel that we are not alone in our struggle for a new regional society.\nIn that sense, we regard the interest of North American public opinion in the problems of Central America as very positive. We know that the people of the United States have a commitment to the cause of democracy and freedom in the world. That is why I wish to repeat here the appeal of the Central Americans for a quest for a bipartisan agreement in the United States in regard to our region.\nIn order to achieve these objective, it is essential to accept the idea that in the quest for peace and democracy in Central America the agreement by the Presidents is not a point of reference that one can take or leave, but, rather, a point of departure for finding solutions. For the agreement represents what we want, and it is within the framework of that agreement - if it is respected - that the discussion for the achievement of a firm and lasting peace in Central America should be placed.\nWe Central American Presidents have said what we should do to start, at long last, on the road leading to the realization of our aspirations: real and true democracy, in which all the sectors of the country will contribute and will participate in the taking of those decisions that will enable the political leaders to set up a government that will truly be of, for and by the people.\nThe alternative is to let the process collapse, or to force us to choose some other path. I do not wish to discuss that here, or even to comment on it, because it is what has always occurred in the countries that do not have the monopoly of force. That is the sad part of the history of the world.\nFortunately, a discussion has now been opened, in which we can talk about the method to change this traditional attitude and can abandon confrontation and move towards concerted political effort.\nWe Central Americans are aware that our problems are embodied in a world-wide set of problems, and that our imaginative efforts can contribute to the quest for solutions in that context. The subjects of peace in the world deserve our special attention. That is why we look forward with great hope to the attainment by the great Powers of agreements leading to gradual disarmament and the elimination of nuclear weapons and all the risks of the destruction of mankind.\nDisarmament and development are two of the problems that weigh most heavily on the contemporary world they must be understood as two distinct processes that are closely related. Each has a separate development and distinct goals. One complements the other. Disarmament complements development by means of the reallocation of financial resources, which can be put to better use in development programmes, particularly the struggle against illiteracy, disease and malnutrition and the eradication of the poverty that afflicts more than two thirds of mankind. We sincerely believe in the need for a new international economic order and will therefore energetically support any effort to restore North-South dialogue\u00b7, and we are, of course, working to find new ways for South-South co-operation. I believe this is an area where much remains to be explored. Our role in the Group of 77 will always be to increase awareness of the need for greater and deeper links among developing countries.\nThe situation of the world economy weighs heavily on the developing countries. What is even more serious, the prospects for their future development are gloomy. This state of affairs obtains despite the internal effort most of our countries have made through adjustment programmes. We are facing an alarming decline in the standard of living of large sectors of our societies, and we meet with a lack of understanding and with selfishness on the part of some of the most privileged sectors.\nIt is clear that to escape the present deadlock we must make exhaustive efforts and accept sacrifices. Thus, we also need resolute and appropriate co-operation from the developed world. This must be a joint effort by all of us who make up the international community. The debt burden, limited financing and the sharp deterioration in terms of trade are problems we must face together, taking into account principles such as joint responsibility and solidarity.\nSubjects such as the establishment of machinery to facilitate the renegotiation of external debt payments and the promotion of agreements among developed countries enabling us to recycle capital in order to modernize our service infrastructure should be the subject of prompt, careful analysis.\nI am convinced that we are at the dawn of a new age in the history of mankind, when an awareness of the repercussions of war is making us try to build peace. The greatest responsibility here belongs to those who hold a monopoly of power, for they must let us exercise the sole power we have in good measure; the power of our own convictions.\nMay God help our international society move in that direction. For then our efforts in Central America could enable us to set a good example, so that other regions, now suffering the consequences of violence and confrontation, might look with hope upon the power of appropriate political agreements to build peace and stability and respond to the call of our peoples for the fulfilment of their own basic needs.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is for me a great honour to address this Assembly, an important forum in the struggle for the preservation of peace and the consolidation of friendship and solidarity among peoples. The United Nations plays an essential role in easing world tension and containing conflicts. It is the cornerstone of closer diplomatic ties between Member States and of the struggle for progress and development.\nIn addressing the forty-second session of the General Assembly I should like to express my delight at seeing the presidency in your hands, Sir, you are an experienced diplomat who has achieved a high standing in international relations and I am confident that the present session of the General Assembly will benefit greatly from your wisdom and even-handedness. I should like to pledge my country's determination to co-operate closely with you in carrying out your duties.\nI also congratulate the President of the forty-first session, Mr. Huraayun Rasheed Choudhury, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, on the energy he devoted in bringing that session to a successful conclusion. I have the pleasure of conveying a message of appreciation and recognition from the Mozambican people to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. Your commitment and devotion to the search for solutions to problems besetting humankind have earned you, Mr. Secretary-General, the admiration and esteem accorded to great international personalities. Your name will forever be associated with the international community's efforts aimed at seeking solutions to serious problems obtaining in southern Africa. Your name will be particularly associated with all that has been done to relieve the human suffering caused by natural calamities and the war of aggression against Mozambique.\nTen years ago the President of the People's Republic of Mozambique, Marshal Samora Moises Machel, addressed this Assembly for the first time. We brought a message from a country that  having just won its independence by force of arms, fully understood the need for peace to build a future of prosperity and well-being. Samora Machel devoted all his energies to the search for solutions to southern Africa's problems.\nOn 19 October 1986 Samora Machel was returning from yet another mission for peace and development when the aircraft in which he was travelling was diverted from its normal route by an unregistered radio beacon (WR). As a result of that diversion, the aircraft crashed in South African territory, causing the death of President Samora Machel and 34 people accompanying him. We are convinced that this radio beacon (VOR) was deliberately installed and operated with criminal Intent. The Mozambican Government reaffirms its determination to pursue the investigation until the whole truth is revealed. Those who assassinated Samora Machel are the enemies of peace, progress and justice. Those who killed Samora Machel are the enemies of the purposes that guide the United Nations. In evoking the memory of President Samora Machel, I should like to thank all those who, in those tragic moments, enveloped us in the mantle of their sympathy and strengthened our determination to pursue the struggle for peace.\nMy country continues to experience a difficult situation brought about by an undeclared war waged against us by South Africa. With repeated massacres and massive destruction of our social and economic infrastructures, this war of aggression, which initially was led by the racist and minority regime of Ian Smith of the then Rhodesia and was taken over in 1981 by the apartheid regime of South Africa, has reached an unprecedented scale. At various moments this war has involved either direct military aggression by the South African armed forces or attacks by mercenaries and terrorists recruited, trained, armed, directed and supported by Pretoria. As a backdrop to this war, and using the vast financial and technological resources at its disposal, the apartheid regime resorts to threats, blackmail, economic blockade, sabotage and a campaign of d is in formation and calumny against our country.\nThe Nkomati Agreement, signed in 1984 by the People's Republic of Mozambique and South Africa with a view to establishing a climate of peace and good neighbourliness between the two countries, has not yet fully achieved its purpose. As the Gorongosa documents have amply demonstrated. South Africa, instead of ceasing its involvement in the aggression against Mozambique, has escalated the infiltration of terrorists into our country and increased military support to them. Despite the unmasking of this scheme, through the irrefutable evidence provided by the Gorongosa documents, Pretoria has remained captive to its plan of waging an undeclared war against Mozambique, Despite the immense propaganda effort made by the circles that finance the armed banditry in an attempt to give it an acceptable face, these terrorists and mercenaries in the pay of Pretoria remain faithful to their criminal, anti-social and anti-national character. That is proved by, among other things, the massacres perpetrated by the terrorists in Homoine, Manjacaze, Mandimba, Mechungwe and Sena. It is proved by the destruction of property and social and economic infrastructures and by the looting, robbery, rape and sadistic mutilation of defenceless populations.\nWithout being exhaustive, the following are some of the nefarious effects of the attacks perpetrated by the terrorists: From 1982 to 1986, the terrorists destroyed or looted 1,500 shops and consumer co-operatives, 1,800 schools, affecting 315,000 students; 490 hospitals, health posts and centres, affecting more than 2 million citizens, who lost access to regular health care. In the same period, more than half a million people died as a direct or indirect result of the terrorist attacks; more than half of this total is made up of children below the age of five.\nBut who are these criminals that indiscriminately sow death and destruction? Who are these murderers that, under the command of foreigners, brutalize and massacre the Mozambican people? Who are these terrorists - or armed bandits, as they have become known in Mozambique and throughout southern Africa? They are agents of colonialism who were always opposed to the liberation struggle of the Mozambican people and who, after the triumph of this struggle in 1974, desperately attempted to prevent the realization of our rights to self-determination and independence. \nIn their ranks we find drug addicts, thieves, outlaws and criminals, mercenaries and murderers. Their creation and leadership were dictated by objectives and interests foreign and hostile to the most legitimate aspirations of the Mozambican people. On the testimony of their very creator, the former head of Rhodesia's intelligence service, Ken Flower, this group was formed in 1974 in Ian Smith's Rhodesia, It was created as a pseudo-guerrilla movement based on Ken Flower's experience gained from the Portuguese array in Angola. To this pseudo-movement the Rhodesia secret services gave the name of MNR in the middle of 1976.\nAs a consequence of the war Pretoria is waging against us, and of the natural calamities that affect our country, 4.5 million Mozambicane have been displaced inside the country or have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. In the face of this catastrophe, the international community has shown gratifying understanding and solidarity. On the initiative of the Secretary-General, and in response to our appeal, an international meeting on humanitarian assistance to Mozambique was held earlier this year. As a result. United Nations specialized agencies, governmental and non-governmental institutions, humanitarian and religious bodies have been giving our country precious support in foodstuffs, clothing, medicine, seeds and tools. Thanks to this programme, it has already been possible to save the lives of thousands of Mozambicane.\nOn behalf of the Mozambican people, I thank all the donor countries and the entire international community for the support given our country, without this support it would have been impossible for us to cope with the countless difficulties faced by the population displaced by war or returning from neighbouring countries where they had sought refuge. \nThe war in southern Africa is a creation of the apartheid regime. The forces that carry out the massacres are an extension of Pretoria's army. The South African regime wants to subjugate the whole of southern Africa. That is very obvious to the countries in the region. Therefore, Zimbabweans and Tanzaniane are today fighting in Mozambique, side by side with Mozambicane, against South African aggression, in operations that have the logistical support of Angola, Zambia and Botswana. The front-line States understand that what is at stake in Mozambique is the future of the region as a whole. The war being waged against Mozambique is a struggle between freedom and oppression, between equality and racial discrimination, between independence and colonialism.\nEven beyond the borders of the front-line States, we are beginning to note positive signs of co-operation intended to bring an end to this terrorism. That is the case of Malawi, with which we have signed a security agreement that is being implemented with positive results.\nThe broad movement of solidarity we enjoy from member States of the Organization of African Unity, the Non-Aligned Movement and the international community in general strengthens our determination to fight and our confidence to Our economy reveals deep structural and conjectural distortions, as a consequence of a combination of factors such as the financial and trade imbalances  the unprecedented reduction in prices of commodities which constitute the main source of revenue for developing countries  unemployment  the disproportionate increase in the prices of manufactures from industrialized countries  high real interest rates  the adoption of protectionist measures that hamper the access of exports from developing countries to developed countries' markets  recurring hunger that affects millions of human beings  the critical situation inherited from colonialism; the losses occasioned by the implementation of sanctions against Southern Rhodesia direct and indirect military aggression and economic blockade pursued by South Africa; natural calamities  and our managerial shortcomings in the implementation of our economic policy, as recognized by the Fourth Congress of our Party.\nOf all those factors, it is the war of aggression being waged against us by the South African regime that most aggravates our economic and financial difficulties.\nBetween 1975, the year we became independent, and 1981 we scored successes in our national reconstruction. During this period our gross domestic product achieved a reasonable annual growth rate. Our exports reached a peak of $OS 280.8 million. In the field of education, the illiteracy rate, which was 92 per cent at the time of independence, was reduced to 72 per cent by 1980. Our success in the field of health resulted in the establishment of 900 rural health posts. In 1981, for the first time in our country's history, every district had the services of a health professional able to provide diagnosis and treatment.\nSignificant achievements were registered in many other economic, social and cultural fields. It is those successes that are being threatened by the escalation of South African aggression.\nBetween 1981 and 1985 our economy registered a decline every year, which brought a decrease in standards of living and an increase in our foreign debt.\nAnalysing our situation, we concluded that, although the war was the main aggravating factor in our economic crisis, we could not wait until its end to adopt fundamental measures to deal with and overcome the crisis. On the contrary, rehabilitating our economy was a condition of paramount importance for us to win the war. \nSo at the beginning of this year our Government devised an economic recovery programme that envisages, among others, the following measures: a new system of exchange control that encourages exporters! the abolition of price control on some goods; incentive to producers by means of an increase in the prices of produce; better management methods in the co-operatives; reorganization and rationalization of some State farms, with a resultant redistribution of land to the family sector, co-operatives and private farmers; and a new salary policy, with the aim of increasing productivity. The goal of this four-year programme is to revitalize the national economy and to obtain a level of growth in gross domestic product of the order of 12 per cent by 1990. The assessment made of the first six months of implementation of the economic recovery programme has been encouraging. In the first six months of this year, industrial production rose by 34 per cent over the same period last year. Furthermore# there is likely to be a rise of 12 to 15 per cent in agricultural marketing this year over 1986, owing mainly to an increase in production in the family sector.\nIn general, we note that the various economic elements are reacting in a positive way to the measures that have been taken and there are indications of a trend towards an overall recovery in our economy. It should be pointed out that there is inevitably a high social cost to be paid for the adoption of an economic programme such as this one.\nThe international economic crisis, the impact of the war imposed on us by Pretoria, and the disproportionate increase in foreign debt servicing that absorbs or even exceeds our export earnings have all meant that Mozambique, like many other developing countries, finds itself in a strait-jacket of foreign debt which, little by little, is restraining our efforts and initiatives.\nTo complement our national efforts, we have negotiated the rescheduling of our debt. In May of this year we came to a better understanding, and the terms agreed on were reasonably favourable.\nThe recent meeting of the Consultative Group for Mozambique resulted in encouraging promises of new resources to revive our economy and sustain a new start. However, we note that in reality a large part of the additional resources will enter our country only to leave almost immediately in the form of payments of outstanding obligations. We therefore add our voice to the growing demand for profound reforms in international financial and economic relations and for lasting, effective and equitable solutions.\nIn this context, we share the views held by many countries, organizations and personalities, such as the Vatican, on an ethical approach to the issue of international indebtedness that emphasizes the need for both creditor and debtor countries to share equitably in the sacrifices and efforts required by the adjustment programmes, and criticizes the prescription of authoritarian and technocratic measures that do not take into account the particular circumstances of each country. This view reinforces the authoritative stand taken in favour of an equitable settlement of the debt of the developing countries.\nSome of these concerns are echoed in the Venice Declaration made by the seven industrialized countries, which shows an awareness of the need to encourage structural changes and to review the intolerable interest rates. It is my hope that this awareness will generate the necessary will to work out a just and equitable solution of the debt problem.\nThe undeclared war waged against Mozambique by South Africa is part of the latter\u2019s strategy of domination of the whole of southern Africa. The twin vectors of this strategy are to maintain the essence of apartheid within the country, on the one hand, and to impose South Africa's hegemony on the region, on the other. This hegemony has been challenged by the triumph of the national liberation struggle in Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.\nThe attempts to mask apartheid through cosmetic reforms that do not change the essence of the system are firmly opposed by the South African people. The South African people are not struggling for the modernization of the racist regime: they are fighting for a democratic society in which all women and men have equal rights and duties, and where all - black, white, Coloured and Asian - are simply citizens of one country. The declaration of a state of emergency, the strikes, the demonstrations and the mass arrests are clear signs of the failure of the reformist option in South Africa. In response to the popular uprising, the regime is becoming more deeply entrenched in obstinacy and violence. It has now become more obvious to the international community that Pretoria is not sensitive to the demands of the South African people for freedom and democracy and that it refuses to negotiate the end of the apartheid system.\nThe international community must firmly support the struggle of the South African people under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa (\u00c4NC) and other democratic forces in South Africa. It should, moreover, exert effective pressure on the South African regime to persuade it to accept the only peaceful means of solving the conflict, namely, to abolish the racist laws, to free Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners, to legalize the ANC and other democratic political bodies, and to negotiate with them the political future of the country.\nWe note, with satisfaction, that wider and wider circles in the South African white community understand the need to tread this path. The movement against apartheid inside South Africa draws to its ranks thousands of white South Africans, especially the young, who want to destroy the artificial barriers imposed by racism and to play a role in building a non-racial and democratic society. Significant political, economic, social, cultural and religious circles in the white community are establishing contacts with the ANC in the hope of finding a solution to the problem of South Africa. Since its independence in 1975, the People's Republic of Angola has been facing devastating invasion and attacks carried out directly by the South African armed forces. It is the duty of the Assembly to reaffirm its condemnation of the South African aggression against Angola and to demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the South African regime's troops. We reiterate our fraternal solidarity with the people and Government of the People's Republic of Angola.\nRegarding Namibia, we pay a tribute to the recent proposals made by the People's Republic of Angola aimed at bringing to an end South Africa's aggression and occupation of parts of Angolan territory and creating conditions conducive to a negotiated settlement of the issue of Namibia. We once again reject the policy of \\\"linkage\\\" and demand immediate and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We salute the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the sole, legitimate representative of the Namibian people, who are struggling with courage and determination for Namibia's independence.\nIt is encouraging for us to note that there is, on the part of the international community, an increasingly clear understanding of the real nature of the conflict and the difficulties southern Africa faces. Evidence of this can be found in the growing support that the front-line States enjoy in their efforts to establish a lasting peace in the region. The international community must ensure the strengthening of the defence capability of the countries in the region so that they may effectively face South Africa's aggression.\nThe international community in general and the Western countries in particular should make a firm commitment to promote the economic and social development of the independent countries of southern Africa. This commitment could find expression through bilateral or multilateral channels, particularly within the framework of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC), which has shown itself to be a valuable instrument in the struggle for economic emancipation and to lessen our dependence on South Africa.\nThe proliferation of conflicts in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America, the continuous growth in stockpiles of nuclear arms and other means of mass destruction, the steadily widening gap between developed and developing nations - all are issues that represent a grave threat to the future and the very survival of mankind.\nDespite the efforts made by our Organization in the promotion of peace and international security, it has to be admitted that the progress achieved so far is modest.\nOn the African continent, the occupation of parts of the territory of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic and the denial of the right of the Sahraoui people to self-determination and independence continue. We are still convinced that solution of this problem will be made possible by implementing the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations. We reiterate our support for and solidarity with the Sahraoui people.\nSpeaking of the conflict between Chad and Libya, we regard as positive the acceptance by both parties of a cease-fire, as announced in Ethiopia by the current Chairman of the OAU. Similarly, we hope that Chad and Libya will co-operate with the efforts of the ad hoc committee that recently met at the summit level in the Zambian capital, Lusaka.\nRegarding the issue of the Middle East, the People's Republic of Mozambique reaffirms its support for the just cause of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), their sole, legitimate representative: the establishment of a free, independent and sovereign State. We favour the convening of an international conference on the Middle East as a step towards a negotiated settlement of this question.\nWe demand that Israel withdraw its forces from all Arab territories occupied since 1967 and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the States of the region, including Lebanon.\nWe renew our appeal to the Governments of Iran and Iraq to bring to an end the fratricidal war that is devastating both countries and to co-operate with the United Nations endeavours for a negotiated settlement of the conflict.\nWe support the efforts being made by the Secretary-General with a view to helping the two Cypriot communities find a just solution to the problem of Cyprus without foreign interference.\nThe Asian continent continues to suffer from violence and war.\nWe urge the withdrawal of foreign forces occupying the territory of East Timor, in order that the Timorese people may freely exercise their right to self-determination and independence, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and Security Council.\nWe express our solidarity with the struggle of the Timorese people, led by FRETILIN, for the attainment of their legitimate and inalienable rights.\nOn the Korean peninsula, the People's Republic of Mozambique supports the initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for a peaceful reunification of that nation.\nWe encourage the Secretary-General to pursue his efforts aimed at finding a just and lasting solution to the question of Afghanistan.\nOne can consider positive the results reached in the negotiations between Indonesia and Viet Nam on the issue of Kampuchea. My country is following developments in Latin America with attention and concern. We express our solidarity with the people of Nicaragua in their struggle in defence of their national sovereignty, territorial integrity and peace. We pay a tribute to their repeated readiness to find a negotiated settlement of the conflict affecting Central America. We are in solidarity with the struggle of the people of El Salvador for the triumph of democracy in their country. The efforts made in that region to resolve current conflicts by means of negotiations - and particularly the Agreement reached by the Central American countries in Guatemala - offer hopeful prospects for the restoration of peace in the region. \u2116e People's Republic of Mozambique supports these initiatives and hopes that the international community will do likewise.\nIn the South Atlantic, we favour a negotiated solution to the question of the Malvinas. The good offices of our Secretary-General can play an important role in this question.\nTurning now to the Indian Ocean, of particular interest to my country are the efforts being made to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace, free of nuclear weapons.\nIn this context, we urge all Member States to co-operate with the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean, so that it can successfully complete its work and fulfil its mandate without further delay, and pave the way for the early convening of the international Conference on the Indian Ocean. It is with anguish that all humankind notes that the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction at current levels entails in itself the danger of destroying the life of our planet. It is essential not only to halt the development of these means of mass destruction but also to ensure their limitation and complete elimination.\nThe People's Republic of Mozambique regards as highly significant the talks between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics with a view to reaching agreements on the limitation and elimination of nuclear weapons and other arms of mass destruction.\nWe welcome the result already achieved on medium-range missiles. This is a significant step towards general and complete disarmament. We hope that the commendable efforts made and the flexibility demonstrated by the two parties will continue. We look forward to seeing the redoubling of the political will of all those whose contribution is relevant to the success of this endeavour. Detente between the nuclear Powers will decrease tension and the tendency to create zones of influence detrimental to the interests of the world community as a whole. The reduction of arms will release resources that must be used to the benefit of the harmonious development of nations, particularly developing countries.\nThe Mozambican people are steadfast and determined. We love freedom and we prize independence. Now, as in the past, we are making huge sacrifices to preserve our freedom and independence.\nToday, when we take up arms, we do it solely in defence of a nation that is ours, in defence of a freedom that was achieved through a hard-fought struggle. We do it in defence of the interests of our people, of the objectives of our non-aligned State, of our ideals of liberty, peace and social progress. The solidarity we enjoy is evidence that the international community understands that this is the guiding force of our people and the main aim of our State.\nIn saluting the international community, governments, international institutions - the United Nations specialized agencies in particular - and non-governmental and humanitarian bodies for the assistance rendered to our country, we urge them to continue and increase their support so that our people may defend themselves more effectively from the aggression to which they have been subjected.\nIn concluding, I want to reiterate our adherence to the principles of the United Nations. We reaffirm our determination to co-operate with the United Nations system and all countries in the realization of the objectives of this great world Organization, namely, the elimination of focal points of tension  the containment and elimination of conflicts; the establishment of a just international economic order  disarmament  the elimination of wars, small or big, local or world-wide  and the preservation of peace and security. Our active non-alignment is the foundation of the strengthening of our friendship and co-operation with all nations regardless of the economic and ideological systems they embrace. We are always ready to co-operate with all those that respect our independence and those that wish to work with us on the basis of mutual respect and all the universal principles of the United Nations.\nI am confident that representatives will faithfully convey to their peoples and Governments this message of co-operation, friendship and peace. The struggle continues.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt is my pleasure to extend to you, Sir, the warm congratulations of my country on your election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. Your election to this high office reflects the international community s appreciation of your outstanding abilities. I wish you success in conducting the affairs of this session.\nAllow me also, Sir, to convey to your predecessor my country's deep appreciation of the wisdom and ability with which he presided over the work of the previous session.\nDemocracy is the best option of the peoples of the free world. Our Sudanese people has unanimously opted for democracy and adamantly clings to liberty. The Sudanese have experienced dictatorship and military rule at first hand.\nIt is a source of pride for me to be able to state that my country has now succeeded in building a number of multilateralist democratic institutions. Our belief in political democracy must of necessity lead to the democratisation of our country's economic and social life. Thus the fabric of democratic rule would become whole. It is for this reason that the Sudan strives after economic and social development. This is no easy task in a country as vast as ours which, as a third world country suffers from the accumulated problems of the past and the present, which beset its endeavours vis-\u00e0-vis the challenges of the future.\nThe nascent democratic experience in Sudan faces numerous internal and external challenges. Therefore, it needs the support of all the democratic forces of the world. Experience has shown that the developing nations can find it beyond their reach to tread the path of democracy in the face of the difficult problems which stand in their way.\nMy country is a case in point. Only the concerted efforts of the international  community represented by the United Nations system and friendly countries, threw us a lifeline when we faced the horror of famine. The problems facing my country are the following: first, the problem of drought and desertification. This is one of the most dangerous threats to life for man and animal alike in the continent of Africa to which the Sudan belongs. It is a deadly threat because it begets famine and its attendant miseries. Therefore, it calls for regional and international co-operation in the study of its root causes and practicable preventive measures. It also calls for the provision of the material and technical means that would make possible the study and the development of such measures. In this respect, my country commends the efforts of the United Nations and its specialized agencies and calls for the continued assistance of the entire international community.\nSecondly, the refugee problem. For more than three decades now, Sudan has become the recipient of ever increasing numbers of refugees. It has adopted a constantly hospitable policy vis-\u00e0-vis this problem. This was only natural in the case of a country with its deeply rooted traditions of hospitality and a strong commitment to the relevant regional and international instruments. However, the influx of refugees is on the increase, especially in the eastern, western and southern areas of the country. Refugees now constitute more than 10 per cent of the total population of the country. Obviously, this has created excessive pressures which the country's economic and human capabilities cannot withstand.\nWhile the Sudan fully abides by the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of its neighbours, it favours the voluntary return of the refugees to their countries of origin. The Sudan will spare no effort in seeking appropriate ways and means to achieve the national reconciliation which would ensure the voluntary return of the refugees to their countries. In the meantime,   is necessary to organize the refugee situation in such a way as to ensure their safety, and provide them with the necessary health and educational facilities without overburdening the country's means or jeopardizing the security and Well-being of Sudanese society.\nWhile we deeply appreciate the support of the international community in this connection  my delegation looks forward to more efforts being made to find lasting solutions to the root causes of the refugee problem and to step up the relief operations.\nIn this connection, Sudan welcomes all missions dispatched by the world body. We also highly commend the report of the specialized inter-agency mission which visited Sudan last year and warmly welcome the mission now assessing our country's needs in relation to the refugee problem. Sudan also sets great store by the implementation of all the recommendations relating to the linkage of relief assistance to development efforts in the refugee areas.\nIn the context of the collective responsibility of the international community in addressing the problem of refugees, my delegation wishes to give notice that we all face an extremely grave situation which will deteriorate further unless all the United Nations resolutions and recommendations relating to the refugees are fully and urgently implemented.\nThe third problem facing my country is that of indebtedness. The present democratic Government in the Sudan inherited, among other problems, a heavy burden of external debts which were incurred, on the one hand, as a result of the reckless policies of the deposed military regime and, on the other, because of the worsening of the acute international economic crisis. The cost of debt servicing now exceeds our export earnings. \nSudan, like other less developed nations, is unable to strike a balance between the repayment of its debts and the continued provision of urgently necessary and basic services to its people. The debt situation, in our view, calls for mote concerted efforts on the part of the international community and the immediate development of creative remedial solutions. It also calls for new and more concessional repayment and rescheduling over more extended periods of time, with longer grace periods.\nIn this context, my delegation welcomes the positive signs which indicate the earnestness of the international community in seeking a solution to the debt problem. We welcome also the final statement of the recent Venice summit of the Western industrialized countries. We sincerely hope that those intentions will be translated into practical, positive steps. Together with other African countries, my delegation calls for the convening of an international conference to consider the ever-escalating problem of African indebtedness.\nThe current world economic situation continues to affect adversely the economies of many countries of the world, particularly in Africa. Those are countries which face deteriorating conditions that make it extremely difficult even to think of formulating plans of economic and social development. Lack of foreign exchange is not the primary difficulty in that respect. In many instances it is the inability to provide the local components required for the implementation of development plans that is the greatest difficulty. \nBy the end of this decade, all the countries of the world, regardless of wealth, will face grim prospects that will threaten their very existence, unless North and South join hands and co-operate in all economic areas. Such concerted efforts will require greater sacrifices and concessions on the part of the developed nations and more diligence on the part of the developing nations in putting their house in order and redressing their administrative and financial infrastructure to eliminate shortcomings and adverse elements.\nWe have continued to call  from this rostrum and in other forums, for the sort of genuine and effective international interdependence that would meet all our needs. Our world has become so compact and interdependent as to make all its small nations vulnerable to the repercussions of any policy decision by any of the industrialized countries.\nWe remain convinced that a proper formula for addressing economic backwardness and the problems of development will never be achieved under the existing inequitable international economic order. An equitable formula is essential if we are to protect the rights of producers of primary commodities and make them compatible with the interests of the manufacturers.\nThe hope of a new international economic order, though distant, still seduces the peoples of the third world. None the less, we concede that it is incumbent upon our Governments to rationalize their economic and fiscal policies. In this respect, we wish to put it on record that many African Governments have taken considerable steps towards the achievement of that goal in line with the resolutions of the African Steering Committee. However, the African attempts at rationalization have not been matched by a parallel attempt at economic rescue. While the returns on our commodities have slumped, the costs of agriculture inputs and other manufactured goods have soared. Aid has dried up, our export earnings have fallen. We are indeed caught in a vicious circle.\nThe United Nations was created primarily to maintain international peace, ensure security, bring about international co-operation in the economic and social fields, foster the principles of good-neighbourliness, resolve disputes by peaceful means and ensure non-interference by any State in the internal affairs of others. We have acted to translate those lofty purposes and principles into guidelines in the conduct o\u00a3 our foreign policy and our relations with our neighbours and the other countries of the world.\nIt is the duty of Members of the United Nations to demonstrate the Organization's credibility and reaffirm its world role. We can do that by showing respect for the spirit and the letter of the Charter, applying its principles and adhering to them in coping with international problems. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Charter, the partisan, self-seeking approach of some countries at the expense of the international community's interests and the tendency of certain States to bypass the United Nations in dealing with disputes constitute, in our opinion, an infringement of the commitments of Member States with regard to the Organization and a retreat from what the world had agreed upon when this Organization was created.\nThe achievements of the United Nations are a source of pride to us all. We believe that this is the view of all Member States. However, there are evident shortcomings. The Organization is still unable to ensure independence and sovereignty for the Palestinian people on their native soil. It has failed to achieve the independence of Namibia. It has failed to put an end to the heinous policies of apartheid practised by the white minority in South Africa. And it has failed to curb the nuclear and conventional arms races.\nThe United Nations continues to face a naked challenge in the Middle East. The situation there is deteriorating. The adoption of yet more resolutions to be added to those already on the records of the Organization would no longer be useful. The dimensions and origins of this question are clear enough. The international community is well aware that peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without justice. The Organization's resolutions state that quite clearly. The Palestinian question is the crux of the conflict in the Middle East and its root cause. There can be no peace in the Middle East without Israel's total and unconditional withdrawal from all the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967f including Al-Quds Al-Sharif# that is# the Holy City of Jerusalem.\nIsrael's continued disregard of United Nations resolutions, its contempt for the international consensus and its persistent and flagrant violation of the Charter are, in our view, the cause of the deteriorating situation in the region.\nIn view of all this, we reaffirm once more the importance of convening an international conference on peace in the Middle Last, in accordance with the 1983 Geneva Declaration on Palestine, endorsed by this Assembly. The international conference should be held under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\nMy country watches with sorrow and anxiety the Iran-Iraq war, which has entered its eighth year. That war has exacted a heavy toll in lives and resources of the two countries, with which we have close spiritual and historical ties. The developments arising from that conflict have created a new situation fraught with danger for the security of the region and the peace of the world. My delegation commends Security Council resolution 598 (1987), which is proof enough of the wish of the international community to see an immediate end to the conflict. We also commend the efforts of the Secretary-General towards the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), and hope that he will continue his mission of good offices and achieve a comprehensive and honourable settlement to this protracted dispute.\nMany years have passed since the international community voiced its first unequivocal condemnation of the abhorrent crime of apartheid practised by the racist minority in South Africa. None the less, the racist Pretoria regime continues to defy the international will, and ignore the world Organization's resolutions, following the lead of its twin, the Zionist entity in Israel.\nThe overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa are still deprived of their basic human rights and subjected to the most brutal measures of oppression and racial violence. From this podium, we salute the struggle of the South African people and laud their just cause. We reiterate our unflinching support for their just revolution under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania. We also reiterate our conviction that the dismantling of the abhorrent system of apartheid and the realization of the aspirations of the African majority in South Africa can be achieved only through the cornering of the Pretoria regime and imposition of a total embargo and comprehensive sanctions against it under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The world is duty-bound to undertake further concerted action in support of the just struggle of the people of South Africa in order to bring about the long awaited change in that part of the African continent. \nThe international community has reiterated often enough its condemnation of the racist regime's continued illegal occupation of Namibia and its plundering of the wealth of that Territory. All the African States agree that there must be a peaceful democratic solution to this problem. However, the manoeuvres of the racist regime continue to obstruct and thwart every effort aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace. It should be emphasized here that the only acceptable framework for a comprehensive, urgent and peaceful settlement of this problem is Security Council resolution 435 (1978), Until such time as that resolution is implemented, there is no alternative but to support the struggle of the people of Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization until the attainment of full Namibian independence and sovereignty over its entire territory. We therefore call upon all peace-loving nations to continue to support that people's just struggle for liberation.\nWe listened attentively to the statement of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, which gave details concerning the policy of national reconciliation recently declared by the government of Afghanistan and its new intention to make Afghanistan an independent non-aligned country. We are of the view that unless all foreign troops are withdrawn from all Afghan territory, realization of the aspirations of the Afghan people to national reconciliation, complete independence and non-alignment will remain remote.\nWe share the view that national reconciliation is but another facet of peaceful coexistence, a principle which we have embraced as a guiding light for our policy. Such national reconciliation, in Afghanistan or in Kampuchea, cannot be achieved without the total withdrawal of all foreign forces from those countries. Withdrawal would be the starting-point and the essential springboard for national reconciliation. \n\nThe arms race has pushed all nations, especially those in possession of huge arsenals, to the brink of a very dangerous situation and has caused them to manufacture ever increasing quantities of new, more lethal weapons. Like other developing countries, my country looks with anxiety and alarm upon the vast resources being squandered on nuclear and conventional armaments at a time when millions in Africa and the rest of the third world are dying of hunger and millions are suffering from disease, poverty and ignorance.\nIn recent years, the arms race has sucked in certain developing countries under the pressure of regional conflicts. The acquisition of weapons by those countries has placed a heavy burden on their resources, hampered their development programmes, put them deeper in debt and exacerbated their economic problems.\nDespite all this, we feel heartened by the initial agreement in principle between the United States of America and the Soviet Union on the elimination of short-range and medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. We hope that this significant step will be followed by further steps towards the cessation of the arras race.\nWe hope too that the Conference on Disarmament will be able to formulate a comprehensive test-ban treaty that would prohibit nuclear testing in the atmosphere, underground and under water. The conclusion of such an agreement is a prerequisite for an end to vertical and horizontal nuclear proliferation.\nThe International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which recently concluded its deliberations here in New York, was a landmark; it affirmed the principles of multilateralism in disarmament negotiations, and highlighted the link between disarmament and development. For the first time in the history of international relations, the Conference succeeded by promoting acceptance of the principle of trade and development. The very fact that it was possible to convene the Conference sent a strong message to the major Powers that disarmament negotiations are no longer the preserve of nuclear Powers. The Conference recognized too that non-military threats are among the dangers facing regional and international peace and security.\nAlthough the final document of the Conference was adopted by consensus, it fell short of the hopes and aspirations of developing countries, which are the prime victims of the arms race and of its negative impact upon their security and their social and economic development. Nevertheless, my delegation sees in the Conference a beginning of a long path which may lead to success if we show the resolve to affirm the principle of collective security, as envisioned by the Charter. \nIn conclusion and notwithstanding the foregoing, we meet at the forty-second session in hope and optimism. We feel optimism because the international Organization has restored its credibility and regained its ability to cope with hotbeds of tension and solve conflicts between its Members forcefully and with firm perseverance, and because Member States have recognized that the obnoxious system of apartheid cannot be reformed and must be eradicated, and the major Members of this Organization have begun the march towards disarmament. Another reason for optimism is that the international community has highlighted the grave and imminent dangers that threaten our world. Moreover, there is growing progress regarding the peace initiatives in Central America, and constructive bilateral and multilateral consultations are now under way to solve the critical situation in Angola, which could accelerate the attainment of complete independence for Namibia. It is our earnest hope that this optimism will prove justified.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, your great country, the German Democratic Republic, and your region of Eastern Europe, have done the international community great honour in making available to it the services of such an outstanding internationalist as you are. We are confident that your stewardship will be rewarded with Important achievements for our Organization. As a member of the General Committee, my delegation will give you its unstinting support as you carry out your tasks. I also congratulate my namesake, Mr, Joseph Reed, on the new career upon which he has now entered.\nWhat can we say about your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury. It was his tireless efforts and patient negotiating skills that brought about bold compromises on the difficult question of restructuring the United Nations system, a process that we hope is genuinely aimed at revitalizing the delivery system of the United Nations rather than at crippling the Organization. The Assembly will miss his authoritative gavel but it can take comfort in the fact that his successor is a man of no less sound diplomatic skill and experience.\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, continues to be a true successor of the great men of letters and impeccable credentials who have come to our Organization to serve their fellow men. His annual reports are invaluable tools in our work. We must heed his advice on what needs to be done to deal with the intractable problems confronting us. My delegation salutes him and his staff at the end of another year of their dedicated service on behalf of us all.\nAs the year 1987 draws to a close, there is mounting evidence that the international economic situation will not be much different from that of last year. The overall environment still presents blurred images and conflicting visions. Most economic observers agree that growth, even in the industrialized countries, remains sluggish and volatile.\nFor the developing countries, this means that the spectre of woes that has haunted their economies in recent years, is still present. But for Africa, which in solidarity with the international community adopted the African Priority Programme for Economic Recovery (1986-1990) in this Assembly last year, the situation is particularly serious. The unity of purpose demonstrated at that historic session has not been vindicated. Although Africa has demonstrably tried to initiate the reforms called for by the Programme, the international economic environment has, on the other hand, deteriorated sharply since last year, making nonsense of some of the reforms we have undertaken.\nThe economically ravaged continent has enjoyed no relief. Prices of primary commodities from which African countries derive most of their foreign exchange remain terribly depressed, the debt burden has become unbearable, interests rates are still sky-high, exchange rates of major currencies have remained volatile, while protectionist tendencies are rearing their ugly heads and multilateral official development assistance has been reduced. Add to this litany of economic woes persistent natural calamities ranging from drought, desertification and cyclones to crop pests and the population explosion, as well as man-made ones, such as civil wars and destabilization: and one has a continent on the verge of economic collapse.\nThe World Bank estimates that during 1986 the economies of developing countries grew by only 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product. This was hardly enough to cope with the population growth rate, which is around 3.5 per cent in a number of these countries. African economies grew by only 1.2 per cent in 1986. The prospects for this year are such that for developing countries the overall growth would hardly average between 3 and 4 per cent of gross domestic product. Out of these figures, the Economic Commission for Africa (EGA) estimates that the African region will experience a growth rate of between 2 and 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product.\nThe Commission has been quick to point out, however, that even these figures may have to be revised downwards, given the fact that in a number of African countries the output of cereal and agricultural products is threatened by new dangers. In spite of the good rains that have fallen in some parts of Africa, locusts and grasshoppers are threatening crop harvests in East and southern Africa, the Sahel and some parts of West Africa. In southern Africa, it is already clear that cereal harvests have not been good this year, owing partly to these pests and also to persistent drought and destabilization - destabilization caused by another pestilence, namely that of apartheid. \nThe fact is that Africa has done its very best to implement the Priority Programme. Painful structural reforms have been initiated in a bold attempt to rehabilitate and revitalize the economies of the continent in response to the Programme and the urgings of the international community. There is more than enough evidence of that a fact to which ECA can attest, and what is lacking is a decisive response on the part of the international community. While we sincerely appreciate and welcome concrete pledges made at the special session, some of which we know will be made good, it is our studied conclusion, nevertheless, that the international community at large has remained generally indifferent to our plight. And this does not help the reforms upon which we have embarked.\nWe are somewhat disappointed also that the recent seventh special session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) held in Geneva has not met our expectations. The problems of resource flows, money and finance, commodities, international trade, and the least developed countries were basically hedged and thus left without any fundamental and permanent solutions. It is out hope that more follow-up efforts will be put forth to continue to seek meaningful and durable solutions to these problems.\nSimilarly, we welcome the continuation of the Uruguay Round talks in the belief that they will find solutions to the problems of tariffs and non-tariff barriers which restrict free trade in the world to the detriment of third world countries. We, in Africa, are determined to play our role in the difficult search for solutions to these problems both in terms of developing strategies of self-reliance and in terms of playing the role of co-operating partners with other countries, especially the developed countries. It was in this spirit that an international conference on the challenge of Economic Recovery and Long-term Development in Africa was held in Abuja, Nigeria, in June this year, and an African Symposium on Grassroots Development was held in Niamey, Niger, during the same month. Heads of State of the Organization of African Unity have also called for an extraordinary session on the debt problem in the not-too-distant future.\nMy delegation also welcomes the setting up of an advisory group by the Secretary-General to look at the question of African resource flows. We hope the report of this eminent group will be considered seriously by those in a position to assist.\nThe political agenda of the session is familiar. It is almost the same agenda we have seen year after year, session after session in the past several decades. In our part of the world, in that troubled region of Southern Africa, the deadly menace of apartheid remains a source of great anxiety to the people of the region. The situation there is worse that it was when we met here last year. The country-wide state of emergency, through which the South African authorities had hoped to shield their strife-torn country against the eyes of the world and thus give free reign to the brutalities of apartheid, remains in force, but it has not given the country the peace it so desperately needs, nor has it made apartheid any less despicable and evil, or the pressure for change any less imperative. \nSouth Africa remains a violently racist and polarized country, despite the deafening rhetoric about reforms in Pretoria and Cape Town. Despite all the urgings of the international community for change \u2014 and dramatic change - black townships are still under military occupation and detentions without trial of anti-apartheid activists - trade unionists, members of the clergy, students and even children - continue unabated. Even leaders of the United Democratic Front, who have taken such pains to follow the rules of peaceful agitation for change, are either in hiding or in prison. Indeed, no organization or institution in South Africa which seeks to identify itself peacefully with the struggle for change has been spared. Universities have become the latest candidates for emasculation and/or pacification. This may come as a surprise but talking peace and change in South Africa has become a dangerous undertaking. I must repeat, talking peace and change in South Africa has become a dangerous undertaking, if not a crime, for those who are not part of the same government which does not want peace and change on terms acceptable to the totality of the people of South Africa. The visit to Senegal a few months ago by a group of white South Africans who have accepted the wisdom of talking peace with the real leaders of black South Africans has become an act of treachery in the jaundiced view of the rulers of South Africa. Those who engage in such extra-parliamentary but peaceful activities have been threatened with dire consequences.\nMy country remains adamant in its conviction that if there is a way out of the quagmire of apartheid - and we believe there is for the rulers of South Africa - it is the way of peaceful negotiation, the kind of negotiation which the Commonwealth mission of peace that went to South Africa last year had tried to encourage, without success. We know what happened to that mission. It is not the kind of negotiation envisaged by the so-called National Council on which \\\"black moderates\\\" are to be invited to serve while the African National Congress of South Africa (AWC) and those other leaders of black South Africa who are considered radical are to be included only on condition that they renounce violence.\nWe ask: how can a government that employs so much violence - a government which has killed so many children, so many old people, men and women - simply to enforce apartheid demand renunciation of violence on the part of apartheid's victims, the very same people it kills with impunity? As the Commonwealth negotiating concept envisaged, violence is to be suspended, not renounced, on both sides to enable the initiation of negotiations. This remains the best way to proceed with negotiations, and the onus is on the Pretoria regime to prove that its lavish rhetoric on negotiations is not one of those transparent ploys it often resorts to mask continuing intransigence on its part.\nThe necessary conditions have to prevail for meaningful negotiations to have a chance of success. First, the white community, or its leaders, must accept as a fundamental and inescapable point of departure, the principle that nothing short of the creation of a truly democratic political order in a united non-racial South Africa will bring peace to that country. Nothing short of that would bring peace to that country. And an important corollary to that is the release from prison of the very leaders - Mandela and others - whose absence from amongst their people will not allow any negotiations to begin. Also necessary and crucial as prerequisites for a successful launching of genuine and meaningful negotiations ate; the lifting of the state of emergency; the removal of troops from black townships; and the un banning of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC), Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and other political organizations whose unfettered participation in the creation of a new democratic constitutional order in South Africa is indispensable. Anything less is a waste of time. Just as we have said, and we say now, the so-called reforms are a waste of time - a waste of time and a vindication of our contention that all these reforms are designed to modernize the tyranny of apartheid, to make it acceptable or bearable to its victims, if that were possible.\nIt is nearly 10 years - and this is another scandal - since the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (1978) as a blueprint for peaceful decolonization, of Namibia. That the resolution remains a dead letter to date speaks uncharitably of the United Nations. Where is the Security Council which drafted resolution 435 (1978)? Where are the Western Powers, the so-called contact group that worked so hard nine years ago to have that resolution adopted by the Security Council? Why the silence, the inaction now?\nThe failure to implement this important resolution cannot be explained away in any credible way, for the simple fact is that the Security Council has allowed itself to be enfeebled by the arrogance of a small Power, with the result that its own plan - its own blueprint - is likely to die an unnatural death. The United Nations Charter contains all the powers the Security Council needs to have its resolution 435 (1978) implemented. The Security Council must demand - and demand with conviction and with a determined sense of purpose and not with equivocation - that South Africa co-operate in the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) or face the consequences. In other words, the demand for implementation of that resolution calls for the same toughness and determination with which the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (197b) on the Iran-.Iraq conflict is being pursued. We want to hear all the permanent members of the Security Council in unison, as we saw them the other day on television, threaten dire consequences if Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is not implemented. \nThat is what they have been doing with regard to implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) . But we do not see the difference between the two conflicts - the conflict in southern Africa threatens peace; the conflict in the Gulf threatens peace. Hence we do not see why people should spend sleepless nights and restless days trying to implement resolution 598 (1987) , and when we ask them to implement resolution 435 (1978) they resort to the veto. We cannot understand that.\nSo we call for a redemption of honour on the part of the United Nations: the United Nations must redeem its honour. The people of Namibia must not be forced to continue to die needlessly in a war whose termination was decreed by the Security Council nearly 10 years ago through the adoption of resolution 435 (1978) . The South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) is ready, and has always been ready, to begin implementation. The Secretary-General has been itching for action. The front-line States are ready to be as helpful as they can in the implementation of the resolution.\nToo much is at stake in our region. Thousands of lives are being lost in wars whose root cause is the situation in South Africa - in other words, apartheid. Like the sword of Damocles the apartheid military machine hangs over our heads. The majority-ruled States of the region have been reduced to war zones where bandit gangs in the employ of the Pretoria regime, complemented occasionally by its commando incursions, sow death and destruction. Massacres such as those that have been occurring with increasing frequency in the People's Republic of Mozambique are threatening to become the order of the day. Using Namibia as a buffer to protect white supremacy in South Africa and as a base from which repeated acts of aggression are committed against its neighbours, Pretoria and its UNITA bandits are carrying out a scorched-earth policy in the south of Angola where untold misery is a common plight, the common plight of the people who live there. The cost in destroyed economic infrastructure runs into billions of dollars.\nOf the nine countries of the Southern African Development Co\u2014ordination Conference (SADCC), only the United Republic of Tanzania has not been physically affected by South Africa's war of destabilization. For the rest, the magnitude of the havoc wreaked by destabilization is ghastly. It is estimated that between 1980 and 1986 the cost in destroyed social and economic infrastructure in the SADCC States is roughly $US 30 billion. This is infrastructure SADCC needs desperately if its member States are to liberate their economies from South Africa's economic colonialism.\nBut there is another cost which cannot be quantified: the cost in human life. How does one put a price on the massacred victims of Homoine, Majacaze, Mandimba, Mechungwe and Sena in Mozambique? How can we put a price on them?\nAnd yet the RENAMOs and UNITAs of this world still have friends here from the Western world and elsewhere. South Africa is not alone in playing godfather, employer and financier to them. They still get weapons and stinger missiles from some Members of this Organization. There are those who seem to derive comfort from the bloody carnage in southern Africa so long as their own interests, be they ideological or simply racist, are served.\nThe countries of SADCC have no capacity to wage war against South Africa, not is it their intention or ambition to acquire such a capacity. They have sought to devote their meagre resources and the energies of their peoples to the development of their economies in an endeavour to lessen their dependence on South Africa and to promote regional economic integration in the spirit of the Lagos Plan of Action. In this endeavour they have sought and received the assistance of the international community, it is what we do with this assistance - the bridges, oil storages, hospitals, schools and several other socio-economic infrastructures in the SADCC countries - which the bandits and their South African supporters are reducing to rubble. Is this what the people who give us aid want to see happen to their aid? Do they want to give us aid to build schools and hospitals only to allow them to be turned to rubble by their friend, the South African Government?\nWe appeal to the international community to help us end this madness. All we want for the countries of SADCC is to be allowed to develop our economies in peace and tranquillity. That is all we ask of the international community.\nThe Middle East has continued to be a hotbed of tension. There appears to be no willingness on the part of Israel to countenance the establishment of a homeland for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel continues to spread Jewish settlements in the territories it captured in war. Meanwhile, Palestinians remain in squalid refugee camps all over the Middle East, with no respite in sight to their misery.\nBotswana does not accept the supposed incompatibility of the existence of the State of Israel within internationally recognized borders alongside an independent homeland for the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza. We believe that that is the only sure basis for durable peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours. My Government does not accept the policy of might is right, and we will never accept it. The Jewish people who have suffered for so long should not be the ones to show so much insensitivity to the plight of others, especially people with an equally sound and legitimate historical claim to the land of Palestine. The long-talked-about international conference on the Middle East must be convened with the full participation of all parties to the conflict, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), because we believe that therein lies the hope for peace in the area.\nI speak as one who comes from a war-torn region, but I still find the continuation of the Gulf war incomprehensible, for this is a war that really benefits no one, especially the two protagonists. The destruction it has wreaked on the economies and lives of the peoples of the two countries is horrendous and unspeakable. We appeal to the two sides to implement the recent Security Council resolution 598 (1987) , calling for a cease-fire and an end to these hostilities.\nOn the questions of Kampuchea and Afghanistan, we remain unshakeable. We remain convinced that withdrawal of foreign troops in each case would constitute a first important step to normalizing the political life of these two war-torn countries. Meanwhile, my country will continue to encourage international efforts whose aims are to find lasting negotiated solutions to both questions. We have noted in both cases that, indeed, efforts of one form or another have been made to try and promote solutions through dialogue. But as long as foreign troops remain in those two countries we remain convinced that the best way the United Nations can approach the problem is to ask that those troops be withdrawn.\nThe problem of Western Sahara continues to defy solution. One party to the conflict has just completed the building of the so-called defence wall. This move can only create more stumbling-blocks in the search for peace in the Maghreb. We reiterate our conviction that the good offices of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations remain the only logical means whereby the parties to the conflict can engage in a free and fair dialogue aimed at allowing the process of self-determination to take place in the territory.\nThe question of Chad is important to us. That the people of that war-torn African country have never known peace since they attained their independence is a painful fact known to us all. This is why we attach a great deal of importance to the current efforts of the OAU to bring an end to the conflict. And we ask all strangers to that purely African conflict to stay away from it - very far away from it - and to refrain from inflaming the passions of the belligerents and making business out of the fratricidal horrors between those sister African countries,\nChad and Libya,\nLooking at the Latin American region, we are encouraged that after a period of inactivity on the diplomatic front concrete steps have been taken to bring peace to the region. The agreement signed by the leaders of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador in Guatemala City in August has the potential to end fratricidal strife in Central America, if given a chance. It is our fervent hope that outsiders will not find other excuses to sabotage these efforts for their own selfish ends. Let the people of Central America lead the way to their own destiny. Let nobody tell them how they must run their own affairs. \n\nWe similarly invest our hopes in dialogue in the search for solutions to the problem of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) . The United Nations has always been ready to assist Argentina and the United Kingdom to resolve their differences at the conference table. The sooner they co-operate in this crucial endeavour, the better for peace and tranquillity in the South Atlantic.\nBotswana's position has not changed on the question of the reunification of Korea, because the factors that tutored us into adopting that position have not changed. We remain adamant in our insistence that: first, the two Koreas must be unified peacefully; secondly, there must be dialogue between the two sides to resolve common problems; and, thirdly, there should be no foreign interference in such a dialogue.\nOn the question of war and peace, Botswana welcomes the ongoing negotiations between the super-Powers aimed at reducing their nuclear arsenals. We have no doubt that any significant reduction upon which they can agree on this score will be welcomed by all nations. We urge them to persevere in this constructive endeavour.\nThe holding of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development in New York during the period 24 August to 11 September this year was long, long overdue. Although its results were not anything dramatic, the Conference nevertheless explored many worth-while possibilities that deserve serious attention in the future. The fact that there is an organic relationship between disarmament and development can no longer be in dispute.\nResolutions of the General Assembly and Security Council must not be taken lightly or dismissed with the kind of contempt to which we have grown accustomed. The image and credibility of our Organization are not enhanced by the very painful fact that Cyprus remains an occupied country despite the adoption of Security Council resolution 365 (1974) and General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX), indeed, the indications are that the grip of occupation is tightening. That is very sad, foe Cyprus is a non-aligned country with impeccable bona fides, a Commonwealth member of no mean import and a third-world country whose only crime apparently is to have been placed by geography and fate, like my own country, near a powerful neighbour. Cyprus must not be allowed to perish under the heavy boot of military occupation. The United Nations must prevent this from happening. The independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-alignment of that harmless and peaceful island are very important, at least to the continuance of the precarious existence of small countries of the third world.\nThe OAU has finally adopted a declaration of its own on the protection of human rights. This is as it should be, for as newly independent countries, some of which are literally still trying to find their feet or bearings, we have a lot of human rights to protect, because the process of growing up following decades of colonialism is not always a peaceful one. None the less, we deeply believe that no human life should be devalued on any basis whatsoever, be it ideological, religious, ethnic or racial.\nWe pay homage to the High Commissioner for Refugees for his selfless dedication to the cause of refugees. We have found his work invaluable and would urge increased support for him in his difficult task.\nThe terrorism perpetrated by individuals, groups of individuals and States which have lost their sense of humanity is a universal scourge. My country is pleased to note that there is now a concerted international effort to combat this scourge in all its aspects or branches, including State terrorism. States enjoy no exemption, regardless of their size and the power at their disposal. All forms of terrorism are evil and must be fought without let.\nDrugs also continue to wreak havoc in the world. The young generation of today is a hallucinated generation. We note with satisfaction the outcome of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, held in Vienna this past summer. The steps and remedies that were agreed there roust be implemented without delay. The United Nations may not have been able, in the 4 2 years of its existence, to satisfy all our expectations in the struggle for the creation of a better world for mankind. Indeed, the agenda before us clearly shows that we still live in a dangerous world - a far cry from the kind of world envisaged by the founding fathers of the Organization. But we are not bereft of hope. The United Nations is the best human edifice ever built. Our imperfect world would have been far worse without it. So I reaffirm my country\u2019s unshakeable faith in the Organization, and I say this with the confidence and hope that it can still use all its potential to respond decisively to the needs of our troubled world in order to remain faithful to its principles and attain its objectives. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation extends to you, Mr. President, our heartiest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its forty-second session. We have no doubt whatever that the conduct of the business of the Assembly is in capable hands. I wish also to express our deep appreciation of the firm and skilful manner in which Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury conducted the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly.\nI have the honour to address this Assembly as head of the new Government which came peacefully and constitutionally to power by the will of the people, overwhelmingly expressed in a general election held in December 1986. A peaceful transition has taken place in my country after 30 years of unbroken rule by the previous regime. This has certainly been an extraordinary, if not an unparalleled, event. The mandate given to my Government in that election was reaffirmed only three weeks ago in another election at the local government level. The commitment of our people to government by consent of the governed is abiding and irrevocable.\nNearly 30 years ago I attended the United Nations General Assembly for the first time as an observer and a member of Parliament. It was the year which witnessed the entry into the United Nations of an unprecedented number of new States. It was a time of great hope and promise in the decolonisation movement and of a remarkable upsurge of nationalism in what has since come to be known as the third world. It was the era of new, dynamic nationalist leaders whose ideas and personalities ignited the pride and aspirations of millions throughout the developing world.\nIn the Caribbean we were at the time struggling to weld together a federal State out of ten separate territories with a population of about 5 million and forming an archipelago spread over 1,000 miles of sea, from Jamaica in the north to Trinidad and Tobago in the south. That ideal still remains a dream. Meanwhile, we have been seeking to define and redefine the meaning and limits of independence and sovereignty - not unlike the United Nations itself.\nWe continue to face the contradiction between formal political independence and the reality of continued economic dependence. We contend with the psychology of dependence, sometimes reinforced by political oligarchies whose narrow interests are served by the time-worn strategy of divide-and-rule. We have come, through long and difficult years, to the hard-won understanding that co-operation among States enhances independence and does not detract from it. \nWe have therefore been forging closer economic ties and have progressed from \u0430 free trade association to a common market, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), serviced by a secretariat and a number of regional institutions. Apart from our institutional arrangements, we are in the process of building a network of relationships and contacts among each other at the level of private enterprise organizations, labour bodies and professional groups and associations, as well as intensifying our cultural and sporting contacts.\nThe Government which I have the honour to lead is deeply committed to the ideal of regional unity. We have cultivated a closer relationship with other CARICOM leaders and have consciously adopted a CARICOM perspective in our dealings with the wider world. We applaud the move towards a political union within the Organization of Eastern Caribbean states, a sub grouping within CARICOM. It is by such incremental steps that we will move towards the realization of our inevitable Caribbean destiny.\nWe in the Caribbean are the product of the cataclysmic historical forces that fashioned European, African and Asian civilizations. We are the triumphant survivors of the dehumanising horrors of slavery. We have been influenced and inspired by the great revolutions and liberation movements of Europe, America and the third world, whose themes have been the inalienable rights and the quintessential dignity of man. In the Caribbean we cherish passionately the concept of the dignity of the human being. If we oppose war, racism and the iniquitous system of apartheid, as well as terrorism and totalitarianism, if we struggle to eradicate poverty, famine and disease, it is because we consider them to be an offence to human dignity. The struggle against these forms of oppression is deeply rooted in our history. \n\nThe Caribbean region has often been simplistically regarded as a historical backwater, a mere tourist destination whose main offerings are sea, sun and sand, yet the reality is that geographically, historically and culturally the region constitutes a link between North and South and East and West and has played - and continues to play - a part in world affairs out of all proportion to its size and population.\nWe take pride in our intellectuals and artists who have become world figures - Marcus Garvey, C. L. R. James, George Padmore, Eric Williams, V. S. Naipaul, Derek Walcott, George Lamming, Arthur Lewis, to name but a few. Our sportsmen, particularly in the field of cricket, have written their names in international halls of fame.\nWe have created the only new musical instrument of the twentieth century out of an industrial artefact, the steel oil drum. We have married it to our indigenous rhythms, the rhythms of carnival and calypso, and made it into a versatile instrument capable of rendering the most intricate musical compositions. Out of many transplanted peoples brought together to service the capitalist and plantation systems, a human phenomenon has evolved - a coexistence and intermingling of peoples of varied ethnicity, religion and culture with growing appreciation of the values of each other's culture and philosophy, and with increasing awareness of a shared identity of ideals.\nThe peoples of the Caribbean form a virtual Diaspora of their own, and their culture has always exerted and continues to exert a subtle influence far beyond its boundaries. In reality, therefore, we are a crucible where a new civilization is taking shape. Compounded of the civilizations of Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas, Caribbean man is forever developing new and exciting variations of cultural synthesis.\nOur commitment to the brotherhood of man, our historical evolution and experience as a people determine decisively our attitude to world affairs. Hence our attitude, for example, to the system of apartheid practised in South Africa. We consider that system a heinous assault on human dignity. Its continued existence is a burning reproach to all of us here today, a blot of shame on our international community. Its perpetrators must understand that their conduct is repugnant and totally unacceptable to civilized humanity. There must be no accommodation with apartheid in South Africa.\nMy Government will continue to interdict economic, cultural, sporting and other links with South Africa. At the international level, we will continue fully to support measures aimed at ending the apartheid system, including the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.\nWe strongly condemn South Africa's acts of aggression against the front-line States, and the use of the illegally occupied Territory of Namibia as a platform for the launching of attacks. The sacrifices of the front-line States in the anti-apartheid struggles of the peoples of South Africa and Namibia are deserving of the maximum political and economic assistance by the international community.\nWe invoke the support of the international community for the Namibian people in their just struggle for self-determination, freedom and genuine independence. Essential ingredients in any measures of support are, first, strict adherence to Decree No. 1 for the Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia  secondly, unswerving support for the universally accepted United Nations plan for Namibian independence contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978); thirdly, rejection of and dissociation from any illegally installed administration in the Territory? and, fourthly, the extension of sanctions adopted against South Africa, which must be mandatory and comprehensive.\nIt is also of the utmost importance that this Organization closely monitor the situation in the other 17 countries on the United Nations list of Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories. The United Nations must seek to protect the rights, including the right to self-determination and independence, of the peoples of these dependencies. We must assist in ensuring that no policies or practices are adopted in these colonies that may eventually lead to heightened tensions and conflict in their post-independence period.\nI turn now to the situation in Central America. The Procedure for the Establishment of a Firm and Lasting Peace in Central America, signed by the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in Guatemala City on 7 August 1987, is a laudable attempt by the peoples of the region to solve their problems by a regional initiative. The Guatemala agreement is a delicate plant which will need careful and sensitive nurturing if it is to blossom as it can, into the enduring peace which the peoples of the region so deeply desire and need. The agreement responds to the historical imperatives of the region and reflects the ideals and inspiration of the great liberator, Simon Bolivar.\nIt is also in the spirit of those ideals and aspirations that my Government looks forward to the early ratification of the amendment to the Charter of the Organization of American States, which would permit Belize and Guyana to take their rightful place in the family of American nations.\nTrinidad and Tobago is a proud member of that distinguished family. We value highly our links with the nations of Latin America and the wider Caribbean with which we share common traditions, common origins and common interests. And we shall work towards a strengthening of these bonds in the years to come.\nI turn now to the situation in the Middle East. Permit me to congratulate the Secretary-General on his dedicated efforts, with the full backing of the Security Council, to bring about an end to the conflict between Iran and Iraq. We trust that these efforts will be rewarded with an early peace. We are also painfully aware that problems of equal gravity remain, and I refer, in particular, to the Palestinian question, the resolution of which is fundamental to peace in the area.\nIn this connection, we endorse the proposal for an international peace conference on the Middle East. We also urge an intensification of the search for a just and lasting peace which recognizes the rights of all States in the region to exist within secure and recognized boundaries and which guarantees a homeland for the Palestinian people.\nIt is not only in the Middle East where problems afflict us. Throughout the world there are areas of conflict which must be satisfactorily resolved. I recognize that the task will be a long and difficult one, but it is one we ignore only at the risk of continued global instability and disorder. \nThe issue of nuclear disarmament continues to be a source of great concern to the international community. All nations, large and small, developed and developing, would be affected by the consequences of a nuclear conflagration. For this reason, we will continue to voice out deep disquiet and apprehension over the spiralling arms race and to highlight the dangers of nuclear arsenals which, in the final analysis, add to a sense of insecurity among peoples throughout the world.\nWe welcome the recent agreement in principle entered into between the United States and the Soviet Union on the elimination of intermediate range nuclear missiles. It is a development of the first importance and engenders optimism for the future. The leaders of both countries merit our warmest congratulations on this historic step. \nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that threats to security are not only military in nature. My Government shares the views of those who recognize the importance of social and economic development as a stabilizing factor in the quest for security. From its inception the United Nations recognized disarmament and development as two of the fundamental issues facing the world community\u00b7 The recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development not only reaffirmed the validity of this perception, out also underscored the profound linkages between these two most urgent challenges of our times.\nReduced spending on arms by the industrialized nations can result in the release of enormous financial resources for development. We of the developing world ourselves, however, also have a responsibility in this process to reduce spending on armaments. Too many of our developing nations expend inordinate amounts of scarce financial resources on increasingly sophisticated weapons. These acquisitions very often tend to disturb regional balances and to aggravate tensions, leading to the perceived need for more and more weapons and to the negation of efforts to attain the desired goals- Every effort must be made to break this vicious circle. Its cost in human, material and financial resources is unacceptable-\nI turn now to the global economic and financial situation. Most developing countries have experienced in the 1980s sharp economic and social decline. The world economy has grown but slowly and, in the process, the benefits have accrued largely to the developed countries, with the result that the gap between developed and developing countries continues to widen. For the countries of the developing world the major constraints inhibiting growth and development have been chronically low commodity prices, difficulties in securing financing for productive investments, the imposition of trade barriers which restrict access to export markets, and the burden of servicing a tremendous external debt. These influences on the world economy must be addressed if we are to avoid in the 1990s the hardship and wasted opportunities of the 1900s. \nThe new international economic order, which was conceived as a vehicle for promoting a more equitable distribution of global wealth and resources between developed and developing countries, has continued to elude us. The fundamental rules of the existing international economic system are still determined by a few wealthy nations and weighted against the economic aspirations of developing countries. Many States advocate a free and open trading system, but too often words are not matched by the necessary action to encourage access to domestic markets. We cannot overemphasize the fact that measures to facilitate trade remain a vital requirement for redressing the imbalances in the flow of resources. My Government consequently welcomes the decision taken last year at Punta del Este to launch a new round of multilateral trade negotiations within the context of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This decision provides the international community with an opportunity to tackle, and resolve, the problem of the many impediments in the international trading system.\nThe need to facilitate capital flows to developing countries must also be urgently addressed. Concessional assistance has stagnated and the international commercial banking sector, stunned by the debt crisis, has moved swiftly to withdraw and to reduce its exposure in developing countries. In addition, countries like Trinidad and Tobago are denied access to resources solely on the basis of the criterion of per capita gross national product. Such decisions lack sensitivity to changing situations and to the negative effects of declining national income, particularly on vulnerable groups. Decision-making by multilateral institutions should surely take into account a wider range of economic and social factors. \nIt has now come to be accepted that structural adjustment is an imperative for developing countries during this period. Structural adjustment must, however, be regarded as only one aspect of a meaningful, growth-oriented process. Multilateral financial institutions, particularly the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which have been the main proponents of such policies, should be afforded the necessary resources for an expanded and supportive role in this process. Their impact on an expanding world economy can be enhanced only if they are provided with a larger capital base and allowed more flexible and innovative approaches.\nThe debt problem has largely been met with a series of uncoordinated responses determined out of frustration and anxiety. Debtors are thus caught on a treadmill of debt-servicing and rescheduling and have in fact become net exporters of capital. The perverse situation in which developing capital-deficient countries are forced to be net suppliers of capital is neither acceptable nor sustainable.\nWe owe it to our peoples, which hopefully follow our deliberations, to search for and find new and imaginative responses to this crisis- We believe that the agreements struck at the recently concluded seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will provide a basis on which we could build and advance. We emphasize that solutions to the problem must be based on the acceptance of shared responsibility between debtors and creditors. We support the several positive proposals put forward to that end at the recent joint meetings of the Bank and Fund in Washington.\nWe of the developing world need not wring our hands in despair or be mere passive observers of international economic interaction. It is incumbent upon us, as developing countries, to take bold and decisive steps to improve our performance and economic structures, and to make them more efficient and responsive to the goals and aspirations of our peoples. Several of our countries are doing exactly that. Collectively, the countries of the South must awaken to our vast potential and diverse strengths. These must not be squandered but harnessed in our striving for development. Joint action by the international community, however, is the inescapable imperative for our continued existence on this planet.\nWe the Members of this body are committed by our Charter to work towards a world in which nations coexist in peace based on respect for law and justice. If the measure of a State's ability to make a significant contribution towards this end is the extent of its coercive power, then we in the Caribbean are indeed irrelevant to the deliberations of the Assembly. But we do not hold that power can be so narrowly defined or that international affairs can be conducted on the basis that might is right.\nIt is the cause of man, the cause of human dignity, for which we plead. It is for this reason that we remain committed to the community of the United Nations; because it is here that the weak, the poor, the oppressed, the hungry millions who form the majority of the peoples of this earth, can find a voice and receive a hearing among the leaders of the world. And I am confident that their voices will be heard.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, it is indeed a pleasure for me and the members of my delegation to extend to you our sincere congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. Your election to this high office is a tribute to your personal qualities and record of distinction in your career as well as a recognition of your experience. It is also a well-deserved tribute to your country, with which Maldives has most cordial relations. I am fully confident that under your wise and able stewardship the Assembly will make positive and substantive progress and reach successful conclusions. My delegation joins previous speakers who have expressed appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasneed Choudhury, for the able and exemplary manner in which he discharged his duties as President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. As a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation, we were particularly proud and honoured to be associated with him and with his successes in our deliberations during the last year.\nWe are meeting at a time when important changes are taking place in the world and historic trends are taking shape. Some of these changes are to be welcomed, as unprecedented opportunities emerge from them for the advancement of peace, justice and security, while others pose new problems and challenges confronting the international community. While recalling the momentous and timely decisions taken by this Assembly to revitalize the functioning of the United Nations and to strengthen its role and its capacity in facing the enormous challenges confronting the international community, we are happy to note that the significant developments that have taken place in several areas of international relations have resulted in renewed confidence in the vital and irreplaceable role of the United Nations and recognition of the values upheld by this body. It is with satisfaction that we note the distinct improvement in the international climate and in particular in relations between the East and the West.\nLike a number of previous speakers, we warmly welcome the agreement in principle reached last month between the United States and the Soviet Union on the complete elimination of intermediate- and shorter-range nuclear forces and we hope that this accord will lead to further agreements on the larger issues of global concern, such as strategic and space armaments. We also hope that this significant agreement will enhance the new atmosphere with respect to the multilateral disarmament negotiations aimed at genuine arms limitation and complete disarmament. In this context, we should like to see the Conference on Disarmament, in Geneva, progress rapidly in its deliberations on a chemical weapons convention and continue dealing with the vital issues on its agenda, such as a comprehensive test ban and the prevention of an arras race in outer space.\nWe should also like to acknowledge the link between disarmament and development as highlighted by the recently concluded Conference on Disarmament and Development.\nMaldives resolutely continues to support all efforts being made towards the objective of disarmament and demilitarisation. It is also our belief that, while the bilateral agreements between the super-Powers and multilateral negotiations to provide the necessary catalyst towards general disarmament, ample opportunities exist for regional and sub regional arrangements which would eventually contribute towards the ultimate objectives of disarmament. It is for this reason that Maldives has supported the proposals for establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace in various parts of the world. We have, obviously, given particular importance to the United Nations Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace and the proposal for establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, where Maldives is located.\nWhile highlighting the significant events that have taken place during the past year, I should also like to recall the conclusions of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII), convened in Geneva this summer, and to note with satisfaction the positive trends embodied in the final act of the Conference, which we genuinely hope will lead to a resurgence of momentum in North-South dialogue and signal a reversal of the current sceptical and adverse situation regarding international co-operation for development. While we are encouraged by the positive developments in the overall international climate, we remain deeply concerned at the mounting dangers and problems which threaten international peace and security, some of which are well within the issues discussed and debated again and again in this Assembly for many years.\nThere is no doubt that the most urgent concern of the international community at the present time is the conflict between Iran and Iraq, two independent countries, Members of the United Nations, have been engaged in a senseless war for seven long years, during which hundreds of thousands of people, including civilians, have lost their lives and enormous material destruction has been inflicted. The international community has now recognized the dangerous implications of this conflict for world peace and security. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) reflects the grave concern of the world community over the issue and the need for intensified efforts in halting that bloody conflict. As before, Maldives renews its call to the combatant nations to stop the fighting and resolve their dispute by peaceful means. It is our belief that the United Nations has an important role to play in the achievement of a peaceful and just solution to this conflict.\nThe aspirations of the Palestinian people to their inalienable national rights remain unfulfilled. Israel retains its unyielding hold on Arab and Palestinian lands, including Al-Quds, and continues relentlessly to go ahead with its policy of establishing illegal settlements in Arab lands. We have long acknowledged that the question of Palestine is the very core of the Middle East problem and that its just settlement is the only way to peace in the Middle East. \nWe have called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied Palestinian and Arab lands. We firmly believe that there cannot be a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian question and the aggravated crisis in the Middle East unless the inalienable right of the Palestinians to self-determination is recognized and fulfilled. Maldives strongly supports the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East, with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, in order to find \u0430 comprehensive solution to the problem.\nMaldives has always condemned the odious policy of racial discrimination and resolutely supported measures towards its elimination. In particular, we resolutely condemn the policy of racial discrimination and apartheid practised by the regime in South Africa and consider it a crime against humanity. We view the latest developments in South Africa with the utmost gravity and concern. The crisis situation, as it continues to unfold, demonstrates the fact that South Africa's black majority is under virtual siege. The racist regime has shown itself to possess neither the policy nor the capacity for progressive change. We believe that apartheid cannot be reformed or improved upon by trifling incremental measures. It must be dismantled in its entirety. We are disappointed that agreement has not been reached on applying comprehensive and effective sanctions against the arrogant regime in Pretoria. However, we welcome the decision made by some multilateral corporations to stop their operations in South Africa.\nThe racist regime in Pretoria continues to occupy Namibia in defiance of international law and world-wide condemnation. It is plundering the immense natural resources of Namibia, to the benefit of the privileged white minority, and, to our deep regret, it is doing so with the help and complicity of some other States Members of the Organization. We believe that the only basis for a peaceful settlement in Namibia is Security Council resolution 435 (1978) , and we reject any attempts to link the question of Namibia's freedom to extraneous issues.\nThe situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea have remained tense, without any significant developments towards a settlement. We reiterate our conviction that only through a comprehensive political solution on the basis of the withdrawal of foreign troops can the sovereignty and territorial integrity of those countries be restored, allowing their peoples to determine their own affairs for themselves. We pledge our full support for the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General in these complex issues.\nAnother conflict that needs our attention is the one in Cyprus. This prolonged conflict should be solved urgently, with due regard to the national integrity of Cyprus and the aspirations of its people. We appreciate the tireless and sincere efforts of the Secretary-General in seeking the settlement of that conflict.\nThe world economy still continues to be caught in serious imbalances and dislocations, while the majority of developing countries are faced with serious difficulties in adjusting to structural changes imposed upon them by such reversal factors as the debt burden, exorbitantly high real interest rates, the fall in commodity prices and the arrogance of protectionism. On the other hand, the significant decrease in the growth rate in the industrial world has caused much disparity in an already aggravated situation. Debate as been going on for many years about the world economic order. A dialogue was initiated between the North and South without any concrete results. My delegation hopes, as I mentioned at the beginning of my statement, that with a new positive trend emerging in the international climate steps will be taken towards the implementation of measures capable of meeting the needs of global economic reform.\nIn a world which is teeming with tensions, conflicts and wars and in which mankind is still hostage to awful nuclear arsenals of its own creation, the importance and indispensability of the United Nations cannot be overemphasized. Although our Organization has its problems and difficulties, we feel that there is no better institutional arrangement than the United Nations to deal with problems and grievances among States and of peoples. Our firm belief in the constructive role which the United Nations is playing will not be diminished by its shortcomings, which are often caused by the deliberate and self-centred acts of a few. We will continue to have full confidence and trust in the United Nations and will support it as best we can.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\nMay I be permitted first of all to extend to Mr. Peter Florin my deepest personal congratulations on his election to the presidency of this Assembly and to wish him full success in his mission.\nToday I have the great honour to deliver the message of His Royal Highness Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, President of Democratic Kampuchea, addressed to the forty-second session of the Assembly. This is the message of His Royal Highness; \\\"It is a pleasure for me to extend to Mr. Peter Florin, on behalf of the people of Democratic Kampuchea, their Coalition Government and on my own behalf, our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session. His political and diplomatic experience, as well as his great personal skill, are tokens that will ensure the success of our work. \n\\\"May I be permitted to pay an earnest tribute to his honourable predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, an eminent son of Bangladesh, who has brilliantly proved himself to be a man of remarkable diplomatic skills, of wisdom and impartiality in conducting the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly.\n\\\"Last but not least, I should like to render a fervent and ringing homage to our very distinguished Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whom we hold in very high esteem. I am particularly pleased to stress that his untiring and deserving efforts strengthen the confidence we have always had in him. His faith in the United Nations Charter and his dedication to fulfilling his high mandate, which is both complex and exacting, and often thankless, have greatly contributed to strengthening the role of our world Organization in the maintenance of international peace and security.\n\\\"My country, Cambodia, has the tragic misfortune of being the prey long coveted by its big predatory neighbour, Viet Nam, whose half-century-old ambition to absorb it into its 'Indo-China Federation' is now well known to all. Never in their long history have the Cambodian people endured such cruel humiliation, grief, misery and suffering as that sown by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam since 25 December 1978, the day of the invasion of my country.\n\\\"Like Hitler's Panzer divisions which were dispatched for the so-called liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1938 and Poland in 1939, the Vietnamese divisions sent to Cambodia for its so-called liberation, in their blitzkrieg and later in their countless mopping-up operations, razed entire villages, looted and destroyed public and private property, crops, fields and rice fields, and massacred or starved to death hundreds of thousands of Cambodians. With a view to eliminating any kind of resistance to their so-called liberation, the Vietnamese forces did not hesitate to use toxic chemical and bacteriological weapons to suppress all those whom they could not reach with their conventional weapons. Excelling in the art of turning themselves into victims and shifting the responsibility for their crimes on to others, the leaders in Hanoi have baptized their occupation of Cambodia 'national defence' against an 'undeclared war'. Proceeding under that banner, they forcibly conscripted tens of thousands of Cambodians aged between 15 and 45 and sent them to the battlefields to fight and die for the defence of the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. Since 1984, under the pretence of 'labour in defence of the motherland' and 'jungle clearing', they have conscripted more than 1 million men and women, young and old alike, and sent them to carry out forced paramilitary labour in mine infested battlefields and malaria and endemic disease-ridden mountainous and forest areas. Several tens of thousands of those conscripts have been killed by mines or maimed for life, while many hundreds of thousands of others have been stricken by malaria. In the name of the 'Viet Nam-Kampuchea special friendship and solidarity', hundreds of thousands of Cambodian villagers have been expelled militarily and their houses, fields and rice fields have been expropriated and later distributed to Vietnamese settlers who already number more than 700,000, I systematically sent to settle in Cambodia, within the framework of a well-defined settlement policy. \n\\\"In the currently occupied areas where, according to Vietnamese propaganda, a marvellous rebirth has been taking place  the population is subjugated, oppressed, arrested, imprisoned, tortured and killed under the slightest pretext or suspicion in the very presence of Vietnamese 'experts', or simply sent to the notorious re-education camps from where people never return. The Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh regime is one of terror and oppression. \\\"This entire exercise of physical elimination is carried out in parallel with a planned attempt to eliminate the Khmer culture. Cambodia's history, and in particular that of its relations with Viet Nam, is rewritten/ while in schools maps already show Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea as a single geographical entity. The ultimate goal is all-out Vietnamization, body and soul, of Cambodia as in the cases of the Islamic Kingdom of Champa, which was absorbed in the seventeenth century to form the present-day Central Viet Nam, and of Lower Cambodia - Kampuchea Krom - which was annexed to form the present-day South Viet Nam, In order to escape from this Vietnamese steamroller, almost a million Cambodians have been obliged to go into exile and inside the country millions of others have fled their native villages and lands to seek refuge in remote areas or in areas controlled by our national resistance forces.\n\\\"For many people, first the invasion of Cambodia and then the array and scale of the crimes committed by the leaders in Hanoi called for a heart-rending explanation. They did not understand why those same people, who for a span of 30 years of resolute patriotic struggle had managed to make their people and country a symbol of resistance to foreign domination and of struggle for national independence should have revealed themselves almost overnight to be - as we have known them to be for many centuries - a perfect model of an anachronistic imperialism, the expansionist strategy of which has become a principle of Government.\n\\\"Nevertheless the persistence of the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia has enabled the most sceptical, and even some supporters of Viet Nam, to face the facts. The longer this occupation lasts, the greater is the evidence of Vietnamese crimes in Cambodia. Moreover, the obstinate refusal of the leaders in Hanoi to withdraw their forces and allow the Cambodian people to exercise their right to self-determination, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions, reveals their will to pursue at all costs their policy of Indochina Federation', Despite their repeated denials, that policy is very much alive. In addition to numerous past and present proofs there is a quite recent one.\n\\\"According to directives broadcast on 6 June 1987, the first objective of the celebration of the thirty-sixth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of the puppets in Phnom Phen was; to demonstrate clearly that the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party has its origin in the Indochinese Communist Party founded by President Ho Chi Minh and that all the victories of the Kampuchean revolution have always been linked with the revolution of Viet Nam and Laos. '\n\\\"One of the keynotes of this celebration was that:\n'President Ho Chi Minh, founder of the Indochinese Communist Party, lives forever in the revolutionary cause of our country. '\n\\\"I shall not add any comment to that exuberant and enthusiastic pride of the Phnom Phen puppets at being Viet Nam's subjects and working for the elimination of the identity of their own nation.\n\\\"Judging by the endless flow of the ill-fated boat people, the regime imposed on the Vietnamese people by the leaders in Hanoi is one of the worst dictatorships that have ever existed in the world. More than a million Vietnamese - men, women, children, the elderly - have already fled their native country, preferring to risk their future to the often deadly perils of the sea rather than to living under the repressive regime imposed upon them. Thousands of others continue to do so every month. Who can still believe that the Vietnamese leaders are philanthropists who have mobilized all the resources of their country and sent hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese soldiers to fight and die for the freedom of the Cambodian people when they have not been able to ensure a decent standard of living for their own people? The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has never believed that and every year, by an overwhelming majority, it adopts a resolution which, inter alia, 'reaffirms that the continuing illegal occupation of Kampuchea by foreign* - that is Vietnamese - 'forces deprives the people of Kampuchea of the exercise of their right to self-determination and constitutes the primary violation of human rights in Kampuchea at present. ' The resolution also stresses that, inter alia, 'the continuing illegal occupation of Kampuchea and the reported demographic changes in Kampuchea are a threat to the survival of the Kanpuchean people and culture.'\n\\\"The Vietnamese crimes in Cambodia bear witness to the fact that the war stirred up and sustained by the leaders in Hanoi is not an ordinary war of aggression as witnessed so far in world history but rather a war of genocide. As a corollary, they show that we have the right to fight against an implacable and perfidious enemy, whose cynicism is equalled only by the refinement of its hideous crimes. They explain why the sacred goal of our struggle, beyond the liberation of our motherland  is the very survival of our nation and people, the preservation of our national identity.\n\\\"In 1979, after the Vietnamese blitzkrieg, the situation in Kampuchea was very gloomy and even, for many people, desperate; indeed it seemed inconceivable that small, weak Cambodia could oppose a Viet Nam 10 times more populated, infatuated with its powerful army - ranking third in the world - puffed up with pride after a long and, in addition, strongly supported and armed by the Soviet Union. For the Vietnamese leaders, the Cambodia case was definitively settled, the situation being irreversible and their dream of an Indochina federation being at last realized. Today it is well known to all that this dream, far from being a reality, has truly turned into a nightmare.\n\\\"The scale and the enormity of the Vietnamese crimes have accelerated the national resistance, which is now mobilizing the entire people and an increasing number of soldiers, self-defence guards and civil servants at every level of the puppet Phnom Phen regime as they become aware of the real meaning of the struggle - which means the very survival of their nation and their national identity. The unceasing and extensive attacks launched by the national resistance forces in order to dismantle the administrative centres at village and commune levels have liberated the people and large tracts of territory and as a result have done much to dry up the human, economic and material resources of the enemy. The Khmer soldiers forcibly enlisted by the enemy in order to serve as a pillar of the Phnom Phen regime have become an important force, participating actively with us in the national resistance movement. The irresistible vitality of the national union against the Vietnamese occupation has led to the military impasse into which the Vietnamese forces have been driven for several years, to a point where they are now mainly on the defensive, confined in towns and entrenched along the main lines of communication and in some strategic positions, isolated from one\nanother and kept under repeated attacks by our forces. The Vietnamese forces are caught in the guerrilla net of our national resistance and that net keeps tightening upon them year after year. The political and military map of Cambodia has drastically changed in favour of national resistance. \n\\\"Foreign observers agree on this. \\\"The Phnom Penh regime continues to exist thanks only to some 180,000 Vietnamese soldiers and advisers. \\\"The Vietnamese political and military set-backs in Cambodia have brought about inextricable socio-economic problems in Viet Nam and serious internal conflicts within the Vietnamese leadership. The country whose leader, Ho Chi Minh, gave an assurance that it would be 10 times more beautiful after liberation is today struggling with an annual rate of inflation of 700 per cent, a stagnant production, millions of unemployed, an undernourished population and widespread corruption within the party, the Government and the army. Instead of the promised paradise, the leaders in Hanoi have opened 're-education camps' for political prisoners and created more than a million boat people, who prefer the vicissitudes of exile. They have turned Viet Nam into one of the poorest countries in the world, kept afloat thanks only to Soviet aid. The irony of fate has led Viet Nam, after a long struggle for independence, to become more and more dependent on the Soviet Union, to which, in exchange for the support of its expansionist policy, it has already yielded the strategic military bases of Cam Ranh and Danang. \n\\\"Moreover, fear of Cambodia has become widespread among all social strata, as stated by Jean-Claude Pomonti in his article 'Viet Nam; Mend Itself or Sink', published in Le Monde on 18 June 1987,\n\\\"Internal rifts between Vietnamese leaders in their race to occupy the vacant seats of power are no secret to anyone. After the Party Congress we did not know for six months who would take those seats. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Nguyen Go Thach, himself a candidate for Prime Minister, told Agence France Presse on 18 June 1987 that 'The election of a new Prime Minister and President of the Council of State has given rise to much debate because of varying opinions on the choice of candidates.\n\\\"The new Hanoi leaders speak of reforms to alleviate the suffering cruelly afflicting their country and their people, but they continue to be intransigent in their annexationist adventure in Cambodia, which is the main cause of that suffering. Everyone agrees that if they do not end their aggression against and occupation of Cambodia and withdraw all their forces they will never solve their political, social and economic problems and proceed to the development of their country. Such development demands the mobilization of all the country's human and material resources and the creation of the climate of trust necessary for international co-operation.\n\\\"But, instead of listening to reason in the interest of Viet Nam and its people and of peace, security and stability in South-East Asia, the Vietnamese leaders actively pursue their efforts in the international arena to obtain by tricks and traps what they have been unable to conquer by military force. To attain that un-avowed goal they are trying hard to conceal the root cause of the problem of Cambodia - their invasion and occupation of the country, dismember the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, destroy our national unity and prevent national reconciliation. They are also striving to sow confusion among out friends in the world and weaken, if not eliminate, international support for our struggle.\n\\\"Indeed, by proposing negotiations on the problem of peace and security in South-East Asia between Viet Nam and the Indo-Chinese countries on the one hand and the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on the other, the Vietnamese leaders are attempting to deny the existence of the problem of Cambodia, thus perpetuating their occupation of the country.\n\\\"By proposing negotiations between the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea of certain components of that Government and the puppet regime in Phnom Penh or certain leaders of that regime, they are attempting to turn the problem of Kampuchea into an internal problem of civil war, thus bringing about the de facto recognition of the regime they have installed in Phnom Penh. Such negotiations would also make null and void the relevant resolutions adopted for eight years in succession by the General Assembly, to  Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea, and our eight-point peace proposal. They would disavow the noble and valuable support for the just cause of the people of Kampuchea and their Coalition Government granted, to date, by 115 states Members of the United Nations. If Viet Nam succeeded in this manoeuvre it would free itself from world condemnation and international isolation, and make the international community accept, de jure if not de facto, its fait accompli in Cambodia, the Indo-China Federation.\n\\\"To achieve a political solution of the problem of Cambodia it is essential for the Hanoi leaders sincerely to accept reality. There is no way that they can evade the well-known fact that the problem of Cambodia is not a problem of civil war, but rather the result of the invasion and occupation of Kampuchea an independent sovereign State Member of the United Nations, by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, in flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter, the principles of non-alignment and international law. The continuance of that invasion and occupation is the principal threat to peace, security and stability in South-East Asia and Pacific Asia.\n\\\"The relevant United Nations resolutions on Cambodia and the Declaration of the 1981 International Conference on Kampuchea have set out all the components of and defined the framework for a comprehensive, just and lasting solution. On 17 March 1986 I put forward, on behalf of the Cambodian people and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, an eight-point proposal for a political settlement of the problem of Kampuchea in conformity with those United Nations resolutions and the Declaration. I spoke here last year of that magnanimous proposal. I stress now that to reach a political solution it is indispensable that those now fighting on the battlefield come to the negotiating table. There can be no political solution so long as the Hanoi leaders refuse to negotiate with the representatives of those against whom they are fighting. Their proposals for negotiations are nothing but ruses and diversions to enable them to remain in Cambodia indefinitely. As evidence of our good faith and desire to arrive speedily at a political solution we have, even before the commencement of negotiations, made all the necessary concessions to enable our adversary to withdraw without losing face, in the interest of all: our interest, theirs, the region's and the world's. \n\\\"First, we propose that Viet Nam withdraw its forces in two phases, within a definite time-frame and under United Nations supervision. Secondly, even before the total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces, we propose that those installed by Viet Nam in Phnom Penh participate in our Coalition Government, which would then become a quadripartite Coalition Government of Kampuchea, thus achieving national reconciliation and enabling all components to have the same rights as political forces. Thirdly, to Viet Naro - which claims that it is threatened by small, weak Cambodia - we offer an independent, united, peaceful, neutral, non-aligned Cambodia, with no foreign bases, with United Nations guarantees and with a United Nations presence. Fourthly, we propose also to Viet Nam that relations be established between our two countries in all fields, including even the signing of a treaty of non-aggression and peaceful coexistence.\n\\\"What more can we offer, apart from surrender? It is this that the Hanoi leaders actually want to achieve by continuing to reject our proposals and demand that we lay down our weapons and agree to dismember our Coalition Government by eliminating one of its three components or those not to Viet Nam's liking. We must remind those Hanoi leaders of the following points; first, no law of international relations authorises them to interfere in the internal affairs of another State or impose their laws on them secondly, the Cambodian people cannot exercise its right of self-determination and national reconciliation so long as Vietnamese forces are present; thirdly, national reconciliation is not an exclusive process, but is extended to all citizens f the country} and, fourthly, it is a sacred right and a patriotic duty for a] . Cambodians to fight in every way to regain and defend national independence freedom honour and national dignity, as was true of the Vietnamese people in its pre-1975 struggle and of all the peoples of the world in their struggle against warmongers during the two world wars.\n\\\"So long as Viet Nam refuses to withdraw all its forces from Cambodia, the Cambodian people and its Coalition Government have no choice but to pursue their struggle resolutely and call upon all countries that cherish peace and justice to continue to support that struggle and exert pressure on Viet Nam. If we stray from that path or lack resolve we shall lose for ever our motherland, our freedom and our national identity.\n\\\"It is for the Hanoi leaders to decide whether they will continue the occupation of Cambodia, in the framework of their policy of an Indo-China Federation and in keeping with their strategy of regional expansion, and maintain their hostility towards the countries of the region and the rest of the world or agree to heed the international community's repeated calls to reason urging them to withdraw all their forces from Cambodia, abandon their expansionist policy, re-establish good relations with all the countries of the region and once again become a part of the family of nations. \n\\\"The Soviet Union bears a heavy responsibility in the Vietnamese choice. Indeed, it is the Soviet Union that provides the important and seemingly inexhaustible financial, economic and military means without which Viet Nam could not carry out its policy of 'Indo-China Federation' and regional expansionism. More particularly, Viet Nam could not have invaded and occupied Cambodia up to now without Soviet supplies. It is undeniable that the cessation of Soviet aid would rapidly force Viet Nam to withdraw from Cambodia, for even with that aid Viet Nam has been struggling for nine years already with inextricable and growing difficulties in Cambodia, at home and in the international arena. Unfortunately, the Soviet Union has thus far continued to support Viet Nam's policy of aggression and expansion and has even come to the rescue of Viet Nam so that it can maintain its occupation of Cambodia. The South-East Asian tour of the Soviet Foreign Minister was not designed to seek a political solution to the problem of Kampuchea, but rather was aimed at completing the manoeuvres to split up the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and to ease the international pressure on Viet Nam. So long as the Soviet Union continues to help Viet. Nam to pursue its occupation of Cambodia, it will not convince anyone, especially not the peoples of South-East Asia, of its 'glasnost', still less of its peaceful intentions and willingness to establish friendly relations with all countries in the region.\n\\\"Our eight-point peace proposal attests to our sincere willingness to put an end as quickly as possible to the war that is ruining both Cambodia and Viet Nam and proves the importance we attach to the fundamental and long-term interests of our two countries, which are bound to live side by side for all eternity. We are of the opinion that it is time for us to sit at the negotiation table in order to find together a solution to the immediate and long-term problems between our two peoples and nations leaving behind the past which has divided us so much. Once again we declare that the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea is ready to start at any time to embark upon negotiations with the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam so as to put an end to the war in Kampuchea, to re-establish normal relations between our two States based on the principles of peaceful coexistence in the interest of our two peoples and countries, as well as those of peace, security and stability in South-East Asia, Pacific Asia and the world at large. It rests only with Viet Nam and the Soviet Union to put an end to the war in Kampuchea and tension in South-East Asia.\n\\\"Peace and co-operation are not built on words and deceit, but on deeds and sincerity. Viet Nam and the Soviet Union are in a good position to understand that no power, still less a power imposed by foreign forces, however strong, can indefinitely resist the struggle of a people who unite against it and are determined to free themselves, in so far as this struggle is firmly supported by the international community. History has provided sufficient examples showing that it is impossible to suppress a people's freedom for a long time.\n\\\"This forty-second session of the General Assembly is taking place in a still tense international atmosphere in which, despite an agreement in principle and some encouraging signs, no concrete act has so far been carried out with a view to a balanced and verifiable reduction of nuclear weapons, in which the race for conventional weapons and programmes of armaments modernization are being stepped up, in which local and regional armed conflicts continue to worsen and the problems of under-development, external indebtedness and the food shortages of third world countries are getting worse all the time. \n\\\"The International Conference on the Relationship Between Disarmament and Development has stressed the correlation between security, disarmament and development to such an extent that it is undeniable that the threat to peace and security is not merely military, but also social and economic, and that there cannot be development without peace. It is the balance to be brought to this correlation that will determine the stability of international relations and the continued improvement of the human condition and peace in today's world, where boundless discoveries of science and technology make interdependence even closer and international co-operation vital for all.\n\\\"The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which was successfully concluded with the adoption of the final act, again stressed this interdependence and the need to find an equitable solution to the problem of the indebtedness of developing countries and that of restructuring international economic relations for sustained, sound and balanced economic growth that benefits developed and developing countries alike.\n\\\"However, those efforts of the international community to preserve international peace and security and to make life on this planet more stable and harmonious are being impeded by the repeated and continued violation of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, which were solemnly proclaimed and accepted by all. This violation is the main cause of the breaches of the peace in various parts of the world, and it creates and maintains hotbeds of tension and wars that cause death, suffering and devastation for victims, prevaricators and violators alike.\nIn southern Africa, so long as the Pretoria regime is not compelled to give up its apartheid policy and its illegal occupation of Namibia tension will only increase and the front-line States will continue to be the victims of acts of aggression, subversion and destabilization by that racist regime. The bloody events which are continuously intensifying as a result of the intransigence of that immoral and inhuman regime attest nevertheless to the Irresistible rise of the struggle of the South African black population under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC), the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and other political movements and organizations. They also attest to the favourable development of the struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) \u0113 They show more than ever before that only implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will lead to a peaceful, just and lasting settlement of the problem of decolonisation of Namibia and that the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist Pretoria regime, followed by a plan of assistance to the front-line States, will bring about the swift eradication of apartheid and hasten the establishment in South Africa of a genuinely democratic and non-racial government, which will result in the restoration of peace, security and stability in the region.\n\\\"In Chad, in welcoming the recent successes of the brotherly Chadian people and Government, we wish to assure them of our constant fraternal support as they pursue of their noble and just struggle for national reconciliation and recovery of their territorial integrity.\n\\\"In the Middle East, the efforts aimed at bringing the parties concerned to the negotiating table are being hampered by reciprocal suspicion, denial of the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people/ failure to implement the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of foreign territory by force and reluctance in recognizing the right of all States of the region to live and coexist in peace and security. We continue to support and encourage the efforts made by the Arab countries and the Palestinian people to find a just and lasting political solution to the problem of Palestine and the Middle East. We believe that a propitious framework for negotiations could be that of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) , the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n\\\"The tragic and devastating war between Iran and Iraq keeps intensifying and causes the greatest concern to the international community because of the risk of its spilling over to other States of the Persian Gulf, which has become alarming. The longer this painful conflict lasts, the stronger will be the conviction of all that only a peaceful settlement can bring it to an end. We wholeheartedly hope that the mediation efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General, backed by Security Council resolution 598 (1987), will result in such a settlement.\n\\\"The chaos and internal strife in Lebanon, which has been going on for more than 10 years, is a source of grief to us all. It is our sincere wish that that country might recover its cohesion and national unity, free from any foreign forces.\nIn Central America, the initiatives of the Contadora Group, with the assistance of the Support Group, deserve the support and encouragement of all. it remains the only regional body promoting a peaceful solution based on respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the States of the region. Its steadfast efforts have caused the peace initiatives of President Arias of Costa Rica to become the Guatemala Agreement, which attests to common desire to restore peace in the region through peaceful means and democracy. \nIn Asia, the unanimous sacred wish of all the Korean people to see their fatherland reunified is far from being realized, despite the commendable efforts made each year by Marshal Kim II Sung, President of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with a view to maximizing the process of an independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean fatherland. It is essential that the two parties - the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea - meet to build reciprocal understanding and confidence that could pave the way for a peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean nation. We are of the opinion that the wise proposal of President Kim II Sung to organize high-level political and military talks between the two parties is a realistic one. We hope that those talks can be held as soon as possible for the good of the Korean nation and people.\n\\\"In Afghanistan, after nearly eight years of a devastating and an exterminating war, the Soviet Union is more than ever bogged down and has learned to its cost the vanity of its anachronistic ambition. It is time that it realized that the sole, just and lasting solution to the problem does not reside in the slaughter and destruction it is committing in Afghanistan, or in its deceit and manoeuvres, and still less in its bombing of and pressure on Pakistan, but rather in the framework of the relevant United Nations resolutions calling for the immediate and total withdrawal of its forces, so as to enable the Afghan people to exercise freely their inalienable right to self-determination. The sooner it reaches this inevitable conclusion, the quicker it will restore its prestige as a super-Power and the credibility of its rhetoric. We should like to pay tribute to, and reiterate our support for, Pakistan, its Government and its people for their compassion towards the Afghan refugees and also for its steadfastness in not yielding to any intimidation.\nLast but not least, we wish to reaffirm once again to our neighbours to the north, our brothers and sisters of Laos, out unswerving support for and fraternal solidarity with their just and heroic struggle to free themselves from the same Vietnamese yoke that is also imposed upon us.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me pleasure to join other speakers who have preceded me and to convey to you, Sir, my delegation's warm congratulations upon your election to the high office of the presidency of this forty-second session. I should further like to extend to your predecessor, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, our appreciation for the exemplary manner in which he conducted the business of the forty-first session. Permit me also to express our gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, our Secretary-General, for the able manner in which he has continued to guide his team of international civil servants in the service of the international community. \nForty-two years ago the tragedy of the Second World War called for the creation of an effective international arrangement to prevent the recurrence of a world war. The fundamental lesson learned in the wake of that war is to be found in the opening words of the Charter, which speaks of the determination of the peoples of the United Nations to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. The founders of the Organization reaffirmed, further, their faith in fundamental human rights, the dignity and worth of the human person and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small. Those noble ideals and objectives, among others, constitute the guiding spirit of the people and Government of Kenya.\nSince the founding of the Organization, one of its greatest achievements has been the catalytic role it played in the decolonization process. In the 1960s and 1970s a large number of peoples and Territories exercised their right to self-determination and achieved their national independence. They have since taken their rightful places as full, equal and active members of the comity of nations. Regrettably, however, pockets of colonialism, which must be eradicated, still remain in Africa and elsewhere.\nThough the immediate post-war years saw the establishment of the United Nations and were characterized by relative international peace and security, decolonization and socio-economic progress, the present international political climate and socio-economic environment appear sombre by comparison. One of the paradoxical developments of our time has been the replacement of colonialism and foreign domination by super-Power rivalry for spheres of influence. The most powerful States, to which special responsibility was entrusted by the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security, have become engulfed in a bitter rivalry for control of the world's resources and for an extension of their political and economic influence through devious and unethical devices, including interference in the internal affairs of weak developing States and economic blackmail of them. This trend is not conducive to the promotion of peaceful coexistence among sovereign States, and must be arrested.\nI now turn to specific issues of which the Assembly has been seized over the years and which have remained potentially explosive, thereby threatening international peace and security.\nThe failure to find a just and durable solution to the question of Palestine remains the basic cause of the continued tension and instability in the Middle East. In this context we support the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East. We consider that for a just and lasting peace to prevail In the region it must be recognized that every State there has the right to exist within internationally recognized boundaries. By the same token, we believe that no solution to the Middle East problem is possible without the establishment of an independent State for millions of displaced and homeless Palestinian people.\nWith regard to the situation in Afghanistan, no durable solution can be found to the problem while foreign troops remain in that country. We therefore call for the withdrawal o\u00a3 all foreign troops from Afghanistan. Similarly, we support the call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kampuchea. On the Iraq-Iran war, we join the many delegates who have called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and support Security Council resolution 598 (1987) of 20 July 1987 and subsequent efforts by the Secretary-General in that regard. Concerning the Korean Peninsula, Kenya firmly believes that direct contact is the best way to reduce tension in the area, leading to a peaceful solution of the Korean question, in conformity with the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification, and great national unity, as set forth in the North-South Joint Statement of 4 July 1972.\t \nIn Central America, we applaud the efforts of the leaders of the region in their continued search for peace and the democratic process. In this context, we support the evolution of the peace process as initiated by the Contadora Group, augmented by the Support Group and culminating in the Guatemala agreement, which seeks to establish firm and lasting peace in the region. In this connection, we reject externally imposed solutions.\nAt home in Africa, the overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa continue to suffer the indignity of the evil system of apartheid, despite a clear and universal consensus that the system of apartheid is evil, cannot be reformed and must be dismantled. Various measures proposed to accelerate the destruction and demise of apartheid have met with stubborn and aggressive resistance launched by the racist regime, with the support of its allies and major trading partners. This resistance has made it impossible for the Security Council unanimously to agree on measures necessary to undo apartheid. We firmly maintain that there is a moral duty on every country and people to ensure the total destruction of this abhorrent system.\nIn the struggle to liberate South Africa from the tentacles of apartheid, we salute, and declare our unwavering solidarity with, the peoples of South Africa in their struggle against oppression, exploitation and denial of the right to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination. We therefore continue to demand the unconditional and immediate release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners and detainees, so that they can participate fully in the political process in South Africa. Similarly, we call for the immediate lifting of the state of emergency, the ban on the liberation movements operating both inside and outside South Africa, and other oppressive measures. The current wave of censorship of news, escalated repression, indiscriminate detention, torture and murder of the black population, and aggression against the front-line States gives even more urgent reasons for the Assembly strongly to urge the Security Council unanimously to impose comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist regime, because of its persistent defiance of the demand by the international community that it dismantle apartheid.\nThe world has for a long time been treated to a series of deceitful manoeuvres and tactics all designed to delay indefinitely Namibia's genuine independence or to substitute for an independent Government a puppet administration subservient to, > and controlled by, the racist regime. These evasive moves by South Africa to delay further Namibian independence must be brought to an end. We call upon the Security Council to convene immediately and take a firm decision with respect to the implementation of its resolution 435 (1978) , which remains the only internationally acceptable basis for the independence of Namibia. We now urge the Security Council to adopt an enabling resolution to trigger the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia's independence. \nThis session is held against the background of a situation where the solution of the major problem of our time, namely, the elimination of nuclear danger, has entered a new phase. The ongoing negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union in Geneva and elsewhere fairly demonstrate that they have embraced the commitment of intent to reduce offensive weapons systems. They have also shown the world that significant progress in disarmament can be attained if there is political will on their part to engage in genuine dialogue and negotiations. We welcome the recently concluded agreement between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as the first ever involving an attempt at dismantling a certain category of nuclear weapons. Any success to this end should lead to further agreements on the larger issues of disarmament. Consequently, Kenya will continue to support the work of the Conference on Disarmament and the efforts of the super-Powers at arms limitation.\nThe recently concluded Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development formally recognized and accepted that there does exist a relationship between disarmament and development. To this end, reduction of military consumption of resources could lead to a healthier international co-operation for development.\nI turn now to some legal aspects of the work of the United Nations which are of special interest to my delegation. Since the Law of the Sea Convention was adopted in 1982, the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has been meeting to translate the laudable principles enshrined in the Convention to a reality. My Government has noted that although the preparatory work for the implementation of the Convention and bringing into being a universal regime for the exploration and exploitation of the deep sea-bed has been disappointingly slow, the last few sessions of the Preparatory Commission have registered encouraging progress. We therefore welcome the decision of the Commission, on 17 August, in registering the first pioneer investor. Kenya looks forward to the evolution of a practical sea-bed mining regime that will assure the international community as a whole the full benefits of the resources in the deep sea-bed beyond national jurisdiction which are the common heritage of mankind.\nOver the past year the world economy has continued to lurch on an uncertain and perilous course. This assessment is fully corroborated by the overall thrust of our general debate here and by various analyses available before this Assembly. This adverse trend has been punctuated by stagnant and sluggish growth and widening disparities, by increasing imbalances and inequities which operate to the detriment of the developing countries. As a result the burden of economic adjustments is being disproportionately shifted to the vulnerable economies of the developing countries, thus seriously impeding their economic growth and stultifying their development efforts.\nThis persistent world economic crisis has dealt a severely damaging blow to practically all the developing countries. Many of them are already mired in economic stagnation. Further contraction of their development process would not only undermine the social and political fabric of their societies but also pose an added threat to international peace and security. In order to avoid such grim scenarios, there is no alternative but to strive for an early resumption of world economic growth, reactivation of the development process, in particular in the developing countries, and a drastic reduction of disparities between the developing economies and those of the developed countries.\nInternational trade has traditionally been a vital engine for growth. Regrettably this function has now been gravely impaired. Rampant protectionism and numerous distorting devices, such as tariff barriers, export subsidies and voluntary quotas, together with numerous non-tariff barriers, in contravention or in circumvention of the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) have in recent years eroded the effective functioning of the international trading system. Moreover, the commitments by the developed countries to \\\"stand still\\\" and \\\"roll back\\\" protectionist measures remain practically unimplemented. In fact the liberalization of international trade has not only slackened but has also run counter to the interests of the developing countries, resulting in insurmountable constrictions of their exports and severe impediments to their access to international markets. It is indeed a telling indictment of the present international trading system that the share of the developing countries in international trade has risen only very modestly over the past two decades.\nMoreover, their trade with developed countries has declined while manufactures imported from those countries have at the same time increased considerably and now represent a substantial portion of the total exports of the developed countries.\nIt is almost impossible for us to discuss international trade without singling out commodities. The crash in commodity prices and the near disastrous situation in commodity markets warrant our serious and close attention. This crippling situation has affected the majority of the developing countries where commodity exports account for most of their export earnings. We are deeply disappointed with the operations of some of the existing commodity agreements. However, we urge the need to pursue the full implementation of the Integrated Programme for Commodities, including making the Common Fund operational as quickly as possible, to complete the pending negotiations on individual commodity agreements and to improve the system of compensatory financing facilities.\nAt the heart of the current \\\"development crisis\\\" is the inadequacy of international flow of financial resources. Sharp declines in commercial bank loans and private foreign investments have accentuated the problem of reduced net disbursements from official development assistance sources. Consequently, since the early 1980s the developing countries have ironically become net suppliers of capital rather than net recipients. This reversal of financial flows is central to the payments difficulties and financial crisis facing the developing countries. The external debt crisis is the most visible manifestation of these reversals and casts a dark cloud over the entire international financial system. Few, and perhaps none, of the developing countries have been spared its adverse effects. The external debt crisis has reached alarming proportions engulfing the majority of the developing countries worldwide. Despite the most painful and strenuous adjustments by the developing debtor countries, debt servicing is also rapidly growing beyond their capacities to contain it and beyond their ability to withstand the resultant political and social pressures.\nKenya was particularly encouraged by the positive and business-like climate which prevailed in the deliberations at the recently concluded seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), It is worth recalling here that UNCTAD VII was unique in that its substantive discussions remained positive, non-confrontational and constructive. We managed, for the first time in the history of UNCTAD, to adopt by consensus a Final Act recommending a number of policy approaches and measures to deal with debt problems, resources for development and related monetary issues, commodities, international trade and the problems of the least developed countries. It is now for the international community as a whole to work out the modalities for the implementation of the conclusions of UNCTAD VII and translate them into reality. The General Assembly has a major role to play in this exercise, and I urge that before we conclude our current session we should be able to agree on the necessary modalities to enable us to put into practice the content of the Final Act as adopted by consensus in Geneva on 3 August.\nIt is true that the magnitude of Africa's development crisis was spelt out at the thirteenth special session of the Assembly. The adoption by consensus of the United Nations Programme of Action for Africa's Economic Recovery and Development 19B6-1990 raised great hopes for Africa's economic recovery. Regrettably, the international community has not yet adequately responded to the commitments it undertook in the Programme of Action. Kenya and other African countries are aware and convinced that the expected assistance from the international community as expressed in that Programme of Action can only supplement their own efforts. In this connection, and as will be observed from the records of the recent summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity, economic recovery and development continue to be given topmost priority by our Governments. African Governments have also adopted a series of bold and radical measures to save their economies from collapse and ensure fundamental restructuring and policy orientation geared to re-launching the continent on the path to self-sustained development.\nWe have come to the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly in the hope that it will be able to establish mechanisms for the evaluation of the implementation of the Programme of Action. Kenya will participate fully, together with other Member States, to ensure a successful culmination of such exercise. At this stage we wish to reiterate once more the significance of the important role that can and should be played by the international community as a whole in the implementation process of the Programme of Action. We therefore appeal for the expeditious adoption of realistic measures to mobilize the resources required for the successful implementation of the Programme, since time is not very much in our favour.\nWe all recognize the mutual advantages that could accrue from economic co-operation between developed and developing countries and also from co-operation between developing countries. Economic co-operation among developing countries should not, however, be seen as in any way the application of an isolationist policy. Rather, it is aimed at achieving international co-operation of wider scope. Kenya has continued to work closely with, particularly, other countries of east, central and southern Africa in pursuit of different types of economic trade and other forms of co-operation. Kenya is a member of the Preferential Trade Area (PTA), which encompasses 15 member States of eastern and southern Africa, with a market potential of well over 160 million people. We are also actively involved in the 6-member-State Djibouti-based Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development, one of whose objectives is to give member states early warnings on drought, which continues to plague most parts of the continent. In the recent past we have also concluded agreements with most of our neighbours establishing joint consultative economic commissions, including sectoral commissions.\nIt will be recalled that the Assembly, cognizant of the close interrelationship of economic development and environmental issues, established the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1983, through resolution 38/161. Today the Assembly has before it the report of the Commission, entitled \\\"Our Common Future\\\". I wish to record my delegation's appreciation of that excellent document, which we feel will be useful as reference material on the related issues of development and the environment. We congratulate Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of Norway, who so ably presided over the Commission. The Commission's propositions are consistent with policies adopted by the Government of Kenya, particularly on issues related to food security, energy, industry, housing and human settlements, to mention but a few. Kenya continues to appreciate and support the United Nations Environment Programme for its commendable work in the field of the environment.\nIn another interrelated area, that of human settlements, I wish to put on record the Government of Kenya's appreciation of the role that the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (HABITAT), working closely with Governments and other concerned institutions, has continued to play to improve shelter conditions all over the world, particularly for the poorer and disadvantaged segments of the society. I also wish at this stage to reiterate the Kenya Government's full commitment to the right of all persons to an adequate standard of living, including adequate housing for themselves and their families. This year is being observed as the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless, which was successfully celebrated on the tenth anniversary of the formation of the Commission on Human Settlements, in April, at HABITAT headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya. The International Year of Shelter for the Homeless has provided an impetus in mobilizing governmental, non-governmental and international support for shelter problems. We wish to appeal for continued support for the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements in order to enable it to cope with the pressing challenges of our time relating to shelter and homelessness.\nThis year has also witnessed the successful holding of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, in June, in Vienna, Austria. Indeed, that Conference was an important milestone and a rich experience for most of us. We managed to adopt by consensus both the Declaration and the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline of Future Activities in Drug-Abuse Control. The Vienna recommendations set forth practical measures that could contribute to the fight against drug abuse and illicit trafficking. It is now for the Assembly to work out modalities for the implementation of the Vienna Declaration, together with its Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline of Future Activities in Drug-Abuse Control. Kenya will co-operate fully with other Member States towards the realization of such an endeavour.\nFinally, let me recall here that we fully share the notion that peace cannot be maintained in a world where one third of the population lives in economic splendour while the other two thirds continue to wallow in the vicious grip of economic squalor, misery and human degradation. In promoting the establishment of a new international economic order and further strengthening international peace and security the United Nations system has, over the years, continued to pursue a noble task whose objectives are manifestly enshrined in the very ideals and objectives of the United Nations Charter. Since Member States are solemnly committed to those ideals and objectives, each Member State has a role that it can and must continue to play now. It is imperative that we make positive efforts to perceive our interdependence in a more comprehensive and enlightened perspective, for it is only through such a perception that meaningful recommendations and concrete action-oriented programmes can be evolved, quickly agreed upon and thereafter implemented. \nRegarding the ongoing review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations, Kenya will continue to support initiatives or measures designed to strengthen the efficient functioning of the Organization. We will however resist any attempt to tamper with the fundamental principles and purposes of the Charter. Accordingly, in the implementation of resolution 41/213, care must be taken to ensure strict compliance with the provisions of the Charter.\nAt this forty-second session of the General Assembly, we wish once again to reaffirm our commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and our respect for the rule of law enshrined in various international instruments. Such respect, in our view, constitutes the only guarantee of the continued preservation of the basic rules of conduct between States, the only guarantee of the maintenance of international peace and security.\nI wish to conclude by wishing you, Mr. President, the Secretary-General and all representatives gathered here continued good health and success in our individual and joint pursuit of international peace, security and development.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPlease allow me to congratulate you, Sir, to your unanimous election. We are confident that, with your sensitive understanding of the complexities of the international situation and your considerable diplomatic experience, you will guide our deliberations fairly and wisely in the coming months. I should also like to welcome Ambassador Joseph Reed to the podium and congratulate him on his assumption of the post of Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs. The Secretary-General could have found no better person for the job. Last, but not least, please allow me to place on record our appreciation of the good work done by your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury.\nThis session of the Assembly is being held at a time when profound changes are under way in the basic structures and processes of international politics. A summit meeting between President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev will be held towards the end of the year. The two super-Powers are on the verge of concluding important arms control agreements. At the same time, relations between China and the Soviet Union now include an increasingly important co-operative dimension.\nThese developments do not concern only the three great Powers directly Involved. When these Powers reorder their relationships, the ripples spread to the farthest corners of the International system. None of us can escape their consequences. We must all also adapt to these changes. Readjustment is never easy. Cherished habits of thought. Ingrained patterns of behaviour and comfortably familiar policies must be ruthlessly and dispassionately examined in the light of the new situation and, if necessary, discarded. Human nature being what it is, this is necessarily a painful process. But it has to be done.\nI was reminded of this simple fact by a recent statement made by an important international leader. At a meeting of disarmament experts organized by the United Nations, held in June this year, he said:\n\\\"... we had to review analytically the traditional approaches to, and established notions about, peace and security. In other words, we had to apply new thinking to that major issue of our times. In the process of sorting out. outdated dogmas and stereotypes, we made at least two fundamental conclusions. First, in terms of the supreme interests of survival, the world is one, notwithstanding its diversity. .. Second, the security of any State would be greater If It abandoned the attempts to diminish the security of the other side.\\\"\nI wish to emphasize that last sentence. That statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Alexander Bessmertnykh. If a super-Power recognizes the need for change, no other country should deceive itself with the illusion that it can keep to the well-trodden path. History is littered with the rubble of States that tried to do so.  \nThe United Nations is itself the consequence of a similar period of international readjustment that occurred after the Second World War. It was intended to reorder the manner in which the international system worked and the way in which States dealt with each other. If its purposes and promise have not been entirely fulfilled we should nevertheless ask ourselves what role the United Nations can play in helping the vast majority of its Members adapt to the profound transformations that are now under way. We, the small States of the third world,\nmake up that majority. \nI believe that the United Nations has an important role to play. To dismiss it as irrelevant is easy, cheap, cynical and a serious mistake. Few, if any, of us present here are privy to the private discussions of the great Powers. Few, if any, of us have the ability to influence directly the recalculations of national interests that are occurring as the great Powers slowly but inexorably reorder their relationships. Only in the United Nations can we meet as formal equals. The United Nations, for all its obvious imperfections, is still the only 0rganization that has at least the potential to protect the rights and interests of small States. Great Powers may be able to do without international institutions, but to Namibians and Palestinians fighting for their homelands, to the South Africans battling against the evil system of apartheid and to all oppressed peoples struggling against foreign invasion and occupation only the United Nations offers some hope that their interests will not be cast into oblivion as the great Powers reposition themselves. The United Nations is thus uniquely situated to help the smaller States adapt to changing patterns of international politics. Only in the United Nations are our\ninterests protected\u00b7, and only the United Nations can define issues in a manner that helps to ease the painful process of readjustment. It does so because when the international community speaks through the adoption of United Nations resolutions by overwhelming majorities no State, even if it does not wholly support a particular resolution, should feel threatened. Every State, whatever its particular interest, is also part of that same international community. The United Nations compels States, even against their will, to recognize what is ultimately in their own best interest. It would be a mistake to regard the United Nations merely as a reflection of national interests. The United Nations speaks for all, and in upholding universal principles of law and justice the United Nations transcends the national and specific by speaking also to that irreducible core of common interests that bind us together, whatever else may divide us.\nIt is an axiom that States act in their own interest, but the United Nations acts in the interest of all. No State, however intransigent, however indifferent, therefore, can indefinitely ignore the United Nations. A case in point is an issue of vital importance to my country's region: the issue of Kampuchea. As a study of how the United Nations has influenced the definition of Member States' interests, Kampuchea is an issue of more than parochial significance.\nWhen the United Nations Security Council first met to discuss the invasion and occupation of Kampuchea, in January 1979, Viet Nam at first denied that it had sent any of its forces into Kampuchea. Later it claimed that it had only sent in volunteers. Finally, under pressure from the United Nations, Viet Nam admitted that it had sent its armed forces into Kampuchea, but it insisted that they had entered at the invitation of the regime it had installed in Phnom Penh after the invasion, which was really an attempt to suggest that the cart had pulled the horse into Kampuchea. \nUnited Nations pressure has also changed Viet Nam\u2019s position on the crucial issue of whether a political settlement is necessary in Kampuchea. On 5 January 1980 the Vietnamese Foreign Minister and some of his Indo-Chinese colleagues signed a communiqu\u00e9 which dealt with Kampuchea. He said/ \\\"The situation in Kampuchea is irreversible.\\\" He also affirmed that efforts to \\\"find a political solution for Kampuchea were in vain and useless\\\". Six and a half years later after successive General Assembly resolutions had enjoined his country to agree to a political solution, the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, at a similar meeting, signed a communiqu\u00e9 acknowledging that he had to work with other countries \\\"to reach a political solution on the Kampuchean question\\\". The move from a denial that a problem even exists to an admission that there is a problem that can be solved only by political means is a very significant first step.\nThe United Nations can take credit for this Important first step; but it Is only a first step. For Viet Nam to take the next step of actually commencing negotiations to find a political solution, the United Nations must persuade Viet Nam by continuing to take a firm position on the issue. For a political solution to be durable, it must be just. It must address the common concerns of the parties involved and not merely be a covet under which to impose one State's will over another by duplicitous means.\nThis simple truth was stated with clarity and brevity by Mr. Gorbachev when he\nSaid: \\\"The ultimate wisdom lies in not thinking solely of oneself or, worse still, to the detriment of the other side. All must feel that they have the same degree of security.\\\" We hope that Mr. Gorbachev's friends and allies will share his insight and take his advice. In formulating proposals that embody this principle  the United Nations also has a vital role to play. The resolutions of the General Assembly on the situation in Kampuchea that have been adopted, time and again, by overwhelming majorities sketch out the framework for such a solution. They take into consideration the Interests of all the parties concerned, not least of which are Viet Nam's interests. And because they reflect the voice of the international community, United Nations resolutions should not be regarded as a victory for one State or one party over another but rather as a triumph of our common humanity. There should be no dishonour or disadvantage in complying with United Nations resolutions.\nOne recent proposal which is fully in accordance with the United Nations spirit is that made by my Indonesian colleague, Professor Kusumaatmadja, who has proposed that an informal meeting of all the Kampuchean parties be convened. Such a meeting would take into account the fact that the Kampuchean problem also has to be resolved between the different Khmer factions, a point that Viet Nam has maintained ever since the Kampuchean issue was first considered by the United Nations Security Council in January 1979. But it is obvious that Viet Nam, as the State whose military forces and civilian administrators are in occupation of Kampuchea, holds in its hands the unique ability to determine whether such a meeting among the Khmers would be meaningful or a mere charade. \nProfessor Kusumaatmadja's proposal therefore envisaged that Viet Nam would respond to our consideration in good faith of its interests by participating in the meeting of the Khmers, though not necessarily in the initial stages. Unfortunately, Viet Nam has refused to acknowledge that it holds the key to the solution of the Kampuchean problem and has not agreed to participate in such talks. Instead Viet Nam has tried to distort the nature of the understanding that was reached, it has loudly claimed that some kind of agreement was reached between the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Indo-Chinese States and that the international community could best help by refusing to take a position that would support one side or the other. The bald and simple fact is that Viet Nam has not agreed to participate in any discussion that will lead to the withdrawal of its military forces from Kampuchea and enable Kampuchea to re-emerge as a free and independent nation. \nIt would be a tragedy for the Kampucheans, for the South-East Asians and for the international community if the United Nations did not continue to take a clear and principled stand on the issue. It was the pressure of the United Nations that forced Viet Nam to accept the fact that a Kampuchean problem existed and that it required a political solution. It will also be the continued pressure from the International community that will force Viet Nam to accept a solution based on the principles of the United Nations Charter,\nThe efforts of the international community and the efforts of the South-East Asian States to find a solution are mutually complementary and not mutually exclusive. The ASEAN States will continue with their good faith efforts to find a solution. We will stay in close touch with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who has sent a valuable political signal to Viet Nam by deciding to take leave for a year to make himself available for discussion with any party in order to move towards a solution of the Kampuchean problem. Prince Norodom Sihanouk remains the only Kampuchean leader who is widely respected both inside and outside Kampuchea. No viable solution can be found without Prince Norodom Sihanouk's participation. The international community should urge the Vietnamese leaders to talk direct to Prince Norodom Sihanouk. .\nHistory has demonstrated that all attempts to deny international change must ultimately be futile. Reality has an inconvenient habit of imposing itself even on the most ostrich-like. As the major Powers make the recalculations that will shape the international politics of the next century  our participation in the United Nations helps to ensure that we adapt to the new situation without too long a delay and without too much pain. But even as we acknowledge the necessity of adaptation, we must not lose sight of certain constant and fixed points of reference. The United Nations Charter embodies such points of reference and contains the basic moral principles that it is our duty to cleave to even as we adapt to survive. \nHerein lies the uniqueness of the United Nations; it is a vehicle for steadfastness as well as a vehicle for change; a means of ensuring that the necessary and inevitable adaptations will be purposeful rather than random or cynical. It is for this reason that, despite the inevitability of disappointments along the way, I continue to believe that with the perseverance and dedication of this body, just solutions to the Questions of Kampuchea, the Middle East, South Africa, and the many other troubled regions of the world are still possible. The United Nations is a sophisticated instrument that enables its Members to navigate safely the treacherous shoals of international politics to reach the safe harbour of international order. It remains the duty of us, its Members, to find the will to use the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Government of Honduras I extend to you, Sir, sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. Your personal qualities and your knowledge of this world Organization guarantee wise and successful guidance of the Assembly's work. We should also like to express our appreciation to Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, the representative of Bangladesh, who preceded you in your important functions.\nTo the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, I wish once again to express my Government's great appreciation for his outstanding work in charge of the Organization. The democratic Government of Honduras, presided over by Jos\u00e9 Azcona, constantly reaffirms its commitment to peace, development and democracy.\nIt should be seen as an encouraging sign that in Central America, torn by violence and political radicalisation, ray country is fighting resolutely for political freedom and economic and social well-being. This is so because the Honduran Government has set as its primary objectives improved living standards for the people and the consolidation and development of democracy as a system of life and of Government.\nThese goals are faithfully reflected in the foreign policy of Honduras. Just as domestically, at the governmental and the private levels, we are endeavouring by peaceful means to overcome the obstacles of underdevelopment, internationally, we are endeavouring to resolve our differences with other countries by resorting to the peaceful means of settling disputes contained in international law. President Jos\u00e9 Azcona, in his annual message to the National Congress of the Republic, at the beginning of this year stated the following:\n\\\"I reaffirm to you that peaceful goals are the standards by which our Government operates. Hence we proclaim that dialogue and the means of international law must prevail for settling disputes among nations. This is how we resolved our border disputes with Guatemala and Nicaragua in the past, and that is why at the present time we have placed our trust in the International Court of Justice in its consideration of the border problem that is pending with the Republic of El Salvador.\n\\\"My Government is entirely willing to support any peaceful settlement for the political, ideological and military crisis in Central America. It is for this reason that we have offered and continue to offer full support for negotiations being conducted by the Contadora Group sponsored by Panama, Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico, with its Support Group made up of Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Peru.\\\"\nThe Government of Honduras is convinced that resort to the peaceful means of settling disputes is the beat guarantee for the maintenance of peace and harmony in the international arena.\nMy Government notes with just concern that, rather than diminishing, international crises are increasing, emerging one after the other and lasting longer. The use of violence and force seems to be encouraged by certain states with hegemonistic designs, thus diminishing the goal of peace to a simple balance of power. International tension continues to challenge the ability of the United Nations to give effect to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Failure to resolve pending conflicts and the alarming shift of those conflicts to and polarization of the developing countries are true tests of the machinery for world peace and security. It is therefore necessary to strengthen the United Nations in order to strengthen international peace and security.\nMy Government reaffirms its faith in the world legal order and believes that it provides the best way of putting international standards above the particular interests of each State.\nHonduras notes with concern the lack of progress with regard to disarmament and the reduction of arsenals. The possession of large amounts of nuclear arras, on which the present balance of power - or terror - is based, has not provided security, but rather brought us ever closer to the destruction of mankind.\nTherefore arms limitation cannot be thought of in unilateral terms. It requires verifiable agreements, since in the world in which we live the survival of freedom must no longer be based on the nuclear monopoly or nuclear hegemony of a super-Power.\nGreat-Power confrontation is an unending drama. The nuclear-arms race continues, despite the hundreds of resolutions on disarmament adopted by the General Assembly. However, a ray of hope has recently appeared on the horizon. Just as last session we expressed our satisfaction at the Reykjavik summit, which took place in October 1986, so today we express our satisfaction at encouraging signs regarding world peace. The United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are moving nearer to agreement on the elimination of short-range and medium-range missiles in Europe. \nOther continuing conflicts threaten the system of world peace and security. We reaffirm our conviction that the question of Korea must be resolved peacefully through dialogue and negotiations between South Korea and North Korea. We reiterate that, in accordance with the principle of universality set out in the United Nations Charter, all nations that so desire must be a part of that universality and assume the obligations set forth in the Charter. There must be an end to the legacy of the cold war that persists in the Korean peninsula and in no way contributes to the attainment of international peace and security.\nMy Government supports the General Assembly resolutions on Kampuchea, which call for the withdrawal of all occupying forces and the restoration of the country's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. In this connection, we strongly support the eight-point proposal for a political settlement presented by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.\nThe Government of Honduras condemns the armed occupation of Afghanistan and urges all States to reach a political solution based on the unconditional and total withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan, full respect for Afghanistan's political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the adoption of measures guaranteeing the right of the Afghan people to decide its own future without foreign interference, as well as on the return of Afghan refugees to their homes.\nIn view of the unfortunate events recently experienced by the Government of the Philippines, we express our hope that peace and harmony will return to that country so that it can pursue its development in the framework of freedom, justice and democracy. The persistence of the conflict in the Middle East makes it even more essential to find a lasting solution through the peaceful means of negotiations. Honduras views with satisfaction the efforts of the State of Israel and the Arab Republic of Egypt to promote peace in the region, strengthen the peace treaty between them and resolve outstanding problems. We believe those efforts are important for the prospects of peace with other Arab States.\nThe armed confrontation that has continued for seven years between Iran and Iraq is a very clear example of extreme nationalism compromising world security. That war has not only claimed hundreds of thousands of victims and brought back the use of illegal methods of warfare, but also interfered with freedom of navigation and international maritime trade. My Government hopes that the belligerent States will heed the appeals of the international community for agreement on a peaceful settlement of their conflict.\nThe Government of Honduras takes this opportunity to reiterate its condemnation of the policy of apartheid of the Government of South Africa, which is a clear violation of human rights. Once again the Government of Honduras states its sincere hope that the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, countries with which we have traditionally maintained the best of relations, will settle their differences on the highest level of justice, understanding and peace. The Government of Honduras would be most willing to co-operate - if its efforts might prove useful - in the attainment of a speedy settlement of the dispute. \nOne of the objectives of this Organization is the promotion of its purposes and principles through regional co-operation, which finds its reflection in various kinds of co-operation with other intergovernmental organization. We are pleased that an item has been included in the agenda of the present session relating to co-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of American States. This is the result of an initiative by Honduras, with the support of many other Latin American States. It will surely contribute to the common search for solutions to the many economic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems that beset the international community.\nAnother purpose of the United Nations system is to promote technical co-operation for development/ and that is particularly important for my country. In this regard, the Government of Honduras appreciates the many co-operative efforts being made by organs and bodies within the United Nations system; in particular we appreciate what has been done so effectively in Latin America by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\nMy Government is pleased that the fourth UNDP programme of co-operation for Honduras has been adopted and will support the activities of those organizations in the area of forestry and agriculture/ public enterprises working in this area and technical co-operation among developing countries. The fourth programme will make it possible for Honduras to give attention to environmental problems and the protection of natural resources as a matter of priority.\nWe should like to emphasize that the adoption by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) of the support programme for the new period is important to Honduras. It will make possible the adoption of a number of basic programmes protecting mothers and children in Honduras. We also welcome the design for the new five-year programme covering population activities.\nIn keeping with its humanitarian traditions, since 1979 about 200,000 persons have sought refuge in Honduras. They have been drawn there by a climate of peace and freedom, having fled from political and social violence in their countries. About 47,000 of those refugees have been receiving assistance from the international community - they deserve its recognition - and from other organizations.\nMy country has also received much assistance at the international level from other friendly countries to help refugees. But the flow of refugees continues and will continue until a climate propitious to their return home has been created. The promotion and respect of human rights is one of the primary purposes of the United Nations. However, the international community continues to witness barbaric acts violating human rights, freedoms, man's dignity and fundamental rights. It is therefore urgent that the international community take concerted action and wage a broad campaign against terrorism, which threatens domestic and international peace and can by no means be justified.\nMy Government is convinced that those nations professing faith in human rights have a legal and moral obligation to protect them and to condemn the countries which inexcusably and repeatedly violate them. Once again in the United Nations we shall consider the item entitled \\\"The situation in Central America: threats to international peace and security and peace initiatives\\\", which has already been the subject of a number of General Assembly resolutions. We believe that to carry out a proper analysis of the crisis in Central America it is important to understand its origins and political and social development. It is necessary to understand the colonial, federal and republican backgrounds of Central America which have led to the present economic, social, political and security situation. The accumulation of those events in the history of Central America has led to the social tension and internal struggles besetting the countries of the region today, and now the crisis has come to the periphery of East-West confrontation.\nInternal conflicts in certain countries have led to a massive exodus of refugees, whose repatriation must be undertaken in keeping with the commitments to national reconciliation. This cannot be delayed, lest economic and social problems become more acute. Of late, one of the primary receiving countries of refugees has been Honduras. The persistence of these internal conflicts has caused irreparable harm to economies, productive investments, and the social and security balance in neighbouring countries; armed opposition movements have tried to use border areas as sanctuaries and all too frequently those actions nave led to claims, protests, tensions and even armed raids such as those suffered by Honduras in March and December 1986. Those raids have prompted the Honduran army to expel aggressor forces from our national territory.\nThe arms race is another force disruptive to peace in Central America; it too has led to growing insecurity in the region. The Government of Honduras has insisted that the arms race be halted, that armaments be limited and military forces reduced - all under effective international control. Given the abnormal situation now prevailing in Central America, Honduras has endeavoured to assume a dispassionate and thoughtful position in its relations with neighbouring countries. Our foreign policy has been realistic, forthright and free of undue passion.\nIn January 1987 the countries of Central America were honoured by the visit of the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS) , who met with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the countries of the Contadora and Support Groups. Those distinguished visitors informed the Central American heads of State of their concern at the crisis afflicting Central America. The Honduran Government/ which fully appreciated the visit, expressed its willingness to maintain and consolidate peace by all legal means.\nOn that occasion, the Secretaries-General indicated that their organizations would co-operate in the settlement of internal disputes and accompanying regional tensions. Their offer was greatly appreciated and proved to be an important contribution towards regional normalization.\nWhen the President of Costa Rica proposed a new peace initiative in February 1987, my Government supported it as a suitable and timely method for maintaining peace in Central America through political negotiation. We also recommended that the peace initiative be implemented in two stages - at the national level, in relation to agreements concerning national reconciliation, that is, on a cease-fire, amnesty, democratisation, supervision and control) and at the international level with the participation of the Contadora Group and the Support Group, to seek agreement on the following: the cessation of military assistance to insurgents; the non-use of territory for the launching of acts of aggression against other States; disarmament and the relocation of insurgents; limits on and control and reduction of weapons and military advisers; the arms trade; international verification and control; and co-operation on political, economic and security questions.\nOn 1 August, at the initiative of Honduras, the Foreign Ministers of Central America and the Contadora Group met once again, this time in Tegucigalpa, in order to continue efforts to normalize the situation in the region. We considered the Arias plan, modifications suggested by the Governments and the document entitled \\\"Proposals by Honduras regarding peace initiatives for Central America\\\", which attempted to harmonize the political objectives of democratisation included in the plan with a Honduran recommendation that mediation by the Contadora Group be reactivated so that agreements on problems of security could be reached.\nThat meeting, which represented a milestone in the peace process, culminated in the signing by the Central American Presidents, on 7 August of this year in Guatemala City, of the document entitled \\\"Procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central America\\\". We are pleased that many of the proposals by Honduras regarding peace initiatives in Central America have been included in the Esquipulas II agreement, including that for active mediation by the Contadora Group in security matters.\nThree important meetings have been held regarding execution of the commitments embodied in the Guatemala accord - the first in San Salvador, where an executive committee was set up; the second in Caracas, where the International Committee on Verification and Follow-up was created; and the third in Managua, where a framework for action by both committees was decided.\nThe Executive Committee, composed of the Presidents of Central America and invested with the power to regulate, implement and enforce compliance with the commitments entered into under the Guatemala agreement at the recent meeting in Managua, endeavoured to define principles, guidelines and orientation for the work of the International Committee on Verification and Follow-up, which was assigned the task of enforcing the various commitments entered into by the Governments. Consequently, the Executive Committee will see to it that the International Committee on Verification will have the support and facilities it needs to carry out Its task.\nIndeed, it is up to the Committee on Verification to ensure the simultaneous implementation of the agreements on amnesty, including those on irregular forces and political prisoners, a cease-fire, democratisation, cessation of assistance to insurgent forces and the non-use of territory to carry out acts of aggression against other States.\nThe number and nature of commitments entered into are not the same for all the parties, for these depend on the political and social situation of each country. Some Governments are called upon to implement all the commitments. Others, such as Honduras, which has avoided much of the social unrest affecting its neighbours, have entered into those parts of the agreement that apply specifically to them.\nCentral America, by means of the Executive Committee, now has within its control the process of a return to normalcy in countries suffering from civil war and bilateral and multilateral tension.\nIn order to ensure the success of the process of peace and detente in the region, it is essential that irregular forces fully accept the Guatemala agreement and act in accordance with it. This applies to those forces operating in Nicaragua and El Salvador. After irregular forces publicly accept the agreement, the Governments of Nicaragua and El Salvador must take all necessary action to agree on and implement an effective cease-fire within a constitutional framework.\nAll the Central American countries must ensure that their territory not be used for acts of aggression against other countries, in regard to material aid as well as to moral and propaganda considerations. Again, this is an obligation that must be fulfilled by States members of the International Committee on Verification and Follow-up and by those States expressing an interest in efforts to normalize the situation in Central America.\nThe Central American countries having made an international appeal for the cessation of military assistance to irregular forces and insurgents, we trust that it will be accepted and complied with, in good faith, by all the States involved in that type of activity, including those which have stubbornly denied their involvement despite proof to the contrary. The restoration of the equilibrium of security in Central America depends upon our ability to keep out of the East-West conflict. We must recognize that if the regional crisis were not so complex it would not have taken five years of patient negotiations and the contribution of 13 countries and 2 international organizations, 1 regional and 1 world-wide, to bring about its return to normalcy,\nHonduras is participating in good faith in the process agreed to in Guatemala, a process based on mutual trust, arising from the premise that all Governments will abide by the commitments they have entered into, as agreed.\nThe Central American homeland demands democratic peace. For that reason, we trust that the principles of good faith and mutual trust underlying the Guatemala agreement will be strengthened. That can be done by putting an end to certain international juridical situations that represent an unjustifiable threat to such principles and that are incompatible with certain international treaties provided for in the agreement.\nAn essential part of Esquipulas II is an appeal for the cessation of hostilities. Those Governments of the States that are at present the victims of activities carried out by irregular or insurgent groups have committed themselves to whatever action is necessary to implement a cease-fire within a constitutional framework.\nAn effective cease-fire is essential for the attainment of peace in those countries suffering from civil war. Once the hostilities are over citizens will, as an inevitable result of socio-political realities, return to normal civil life and take an active part in the democratisation of their countries.\nOnce the hostilities are over, refugees will return to their countries of origin and their homes and give their families the fruit of their work, and the quiet home life that is the cement required to build national tranquillity. Once the hostilities are over, the tensions among neighbouring countries produced by such refugee movements will come to an end. Once the hostilities are over, there will no longer be any need for external assistance provided for the purpose of destabilizing Governments.\nThe situation in Central America is quite unlike the situation anywhere else in the world, the crisis there should not be viewed as an international conflict in the sense of hostilities among nations. Its essential characteristic is the existence of long-drawn-out civil wars in the region that have given rise to tensions among Governments. Those civil wars must therefore be brought to an end, for they are a threat to peace and security in the region.\nMay God enlighten the leaders of our countries and the leaders of the irregular forces now involved in those civil wars. May they enter into a patriotic dialogue, and may they reach agreement on an effective cease-fire that will lead to national reconciliation.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMy delegation expresses its warmest congratulations to you, Sir, a worthy representative of the German Democratic Republic - a bastion of peace and socialism in Europe - on your assumption of the presidency of this important forty-second session of the General Assembly.\nWe have all heard with great satisfaction about the positive results of the talks held in Washington between the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, Comrade Eduard Shevardnadze, and the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. George Shultz. The progress made towards an agreement on the banning of medium- and short-range missiles by the United States and the USSR deserves our fervent best wishes. It is the result of the efforts made for many years by the USSR - and especially of the initiatives of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Comrade Mikhail Gorbachev - and the efforts of the peace-loving forces to halt the arms race and eliminate the dangers of nuclear confrontation.\nA long time has passed since the signing of the last disarmament agreement, and we look forward to the early completion of the agreement to which I have just referred, so that it may initiate a process to end the arms race, a process for peace and life.\nThe meeting held in the Federal Republic of Germany between the President of the Council of State and Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, Comrade Erich Honecker, and the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr. Helmut Kohl, constitutes a meaningful expression of a new moment of hope in our international relations and of a desire to initiate a new trend towards dialogue, understanding and co-operation. This is a time for advancing negotiations to solve the conflicts and disputes of recent years, which have created hotbeds of tension jeopardizing the future of mankind.\nSadly, in a few days our America will mark the twentieth anniversary of the death of an illustrious son of our continent, whom the people of Cuba have the fortune of counting as one of their best offspring and from whose legacy of ideas and action we have benefited. I should like to recall the following paragraph of the outstanding statement delivered by Commander Ernesto Che Guevara to the General Assembly at its session 23 years ago: \\\"We realize that today the Assembly is not in a position to demand explanations for ... acts) yet it must be clearly established that the Government of the United States is not the guardian of liberty, but rather that it is perpetuating the exploitation and oppression of many of the world's peoples and of many of its own citizens\\\". (Official Records of the General Assembly, Nineteenth Seas ion> 1299 the plenary meeting, para. 135) That assertion was an expression of its time. The reality is that the trends of the policies of successive United States Administrations - zigzagging but not changing in their essence - have not differed in any way from that definition, which has become even more valid in recent years.\nBetween 1981 and 1985, the present United States Administration managed, at a specific historical juncture, to implement a brutal and aggressive policy aimed at imposing contested imperialist values through the use and threat of force and the obstruction of the negotiation process, thereby preventing progress on disarmament agreements and the solution of regional problems, and with the overt purpose of imposing its military superiority and hegemony over the socialist community.\nReagan, in a unique and exemplary manner worthy of better endeavours, implemented and followed the essence, spirit and letter of the Santa Fe programme. This May 1980 Santa Fe programme undoubtedly represented the philosophy of pillage, the expansion of so-called spheres of influence and the prevalence of force in international relations. The direct reflection of this policy was soon evidenced in the arms race. Between 1980 and 1986 the military budget of the United States doubled. In essence, the Santa Fe document stated that \\\"war and not peace is the rule in international affairs\\\", that \\\"detente is death\\\", and that the United States did not have to struggle to preserve the status quo but, rather, had to struggle to improve its relative position in all spheres of influence.\nReagan, with an apparent halo of success - having obtained barely 26.7 per cent of the votes in the United States - intoxicated by power and the prospect of playing a leading role in history, launched a truly anachronistic and senseless crusade, which was tolerated or supported by his main allies. Important agreements that had been reached as a result of perseverance, consistency and realism in approaching the international situation were denounced or rejected - for example, the significant SALT II agreements. Tensions in international relations increased, thereby adding fuel to the fire of various international conflicts. Reagan proclaimed and exalted his alliance with dictatorial regimes and with the supporters of the most ignoble causes in southern Africa and the Middle East, in Central America and the Caribbean, in the southern part of the American continent. In so doing, he stopped all criticism and condemnation of human-rights violations by his allies, for the purpose of protecting an alliance devoid of principles or decency.\nAnyone who took up arms against the independence of peoples had the support of the United States. Whenever a banner was hoisted in favour of independence and social justice, the United States tried to force it down. Accordingly, it increased its acts of aggression against Nicaragua, its threats against Cuba and its support of the Zionists in the Middle East, as well as its close solidarity with the racists in Pretoria and with the Savimbi and Rename bandits in Angola and Mozambique. It closed ranks with British imperialists in the military occupation of the Malvinas Islands - which jeopardized the credibility of the Rio Treaty - and invaded the tiny island of Grenada, in its best gunboat style. In that period, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the siege of Beirut took place prominent international leaders such as Indira Gandhi and Olof Palme were assassinated; the USSR suffered in a very short time the loss of its top State and Party leaders, Comrade Leonid Brezhnev and his successors, Comrades Andropov and Chernienko. The summit conferences of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of African Unity could not be held as scheduled.\t\\\"\nThe Reagan Administration, Imbued with a spirit of victory, its eyes and ears closed to world realities, tried to demonstrate that \\\"in war there is no substitute for victory\\\", in conformity with Mr. Reagan's view that the mistake of the Viet Nam war was not to have waged it but to have lost it.\nSuch triumphalism met with serious obstacles at the end of 1986, when Reagan suffered major defeats inside and outside the United States which shook his already dubious credibility and his unquestionable power. Early in October he suffered his greatest setback in foreign policy - soon to be more than surpassed - when, respectively, the House of Representatives and the Senate, the latter still with a Republican majority, overruled the presidential veto of economic sanctions against South Africa. That veto was inspired by the fallacy of \\\"constructive engagement\\\", or \\\"silent diplomacy\\\", proclaimed by Reagan. In the November legislative elections, the Democrats regained the majority in the Senate and strengthened their control over the House of Representatives, despite Reagan's personal efforts, his 40,000 kilometres of travel and his visits to 18 States. That significant defeat coincided with huge budget and trade deficits and the forecasts of a forthcoming economic recession, in November the so-called Irangate and Contragate manure bomb  exploded, with brutal virulence. The final act of this tragicomedy has yet to be played out.\nAt the same time, there were major political processes and developments aimed at the relaxation of international tensions and at the opening of a new era of understanding among States - although many of the processes had originated years before, and some had found a sympathetic hearing in the General Assembly.\nLet us recall some of those milestones.\nAddressing the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly in his capacity as Chairman and on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, Commander Fidel Castro presented the all-important demands of the underdeveloped world. He said at that time: \\\"... unequal exchange is ruining and impoverishing our peoples and must cease. Inflation, which is being exported to us, is impoverishing our peoples and must cease. Protectionism impoverishes our peoples and must cease. The existing imbalance in the exploitation of sea resources is abusive and must be abolished. The financial resources received by the developing countries are insufficient and must be increased. Arms expenditures are irrational; they must cease and the funds thus released must be used to finance development. The international monetary system prevailing today is bankrupt and must be replaced. The debts of the least developed countries and of those in a disadvantageous position are burdens which are impossible to bear and to which no solution can be found and they must be cancelled. Indebtedness oppresses the rest of the developing countries economically and must be relieved. The wide economic gap between the developed countries and the countries seeking development, instead of diminishing, is being widened and must be closed ... . (A/34/PV. 31, pp. 42 and 43-45)\nEight years have passed since then. The only thing that has changed is that the unequal exchange is even more unequal) the ruin of our peoples as a result of inflation and protectionism is worsening; the imbalance in the exploitation of the resources of the sea is abusive; the allocation of financial resources to the developing countries is diminishing and is tragically insufficient) the international monetary system remains bankrupt) the debt of the relatively least developed countries has long since gone beyond rationality and simply cannot be paid. In short, the economic gap between developed and developing countries is wider and has grown unbridgeable.\nWhen the Contadora Group was established in January 1983 it was like a wind of hope amidst the imperial storm. Its aim was to contribute to a peaceful, political, negotiated solution to the Central American conflict it was later joined by the Support Group and was recently enhanced by the important Esquipulas II agreements.\nThe seventh summit Conference of Non-Aligned Countries took place in New Delhi in March 1983. That summit conveyed a clear message, and took a firm anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist stand against Zionism, racism and apartheid, in favour of peace and of the peaceful negotiated solution of international disputes, against the arms race and the rule of force, and in support of a new international economic order.\nAlso in March, but March 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev was elected General-Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, He gave the socialist society of that great country new ideas and a realistic and dynamic stand in the present world, with new approaches and methods for the creative application of the Soviet principles of peace, disarmament and coexistence under present conditions.\nVery soon the influence of solid proposals oriented towards disarmament and the establishment of a climate of d\u00e9tente, of international safeguards and security - in other words, a climate of peaceful coexistence - was felt. Among them are the Vladivostok proposals and the August 1985 unilateral moratorium, broadened at the Reykjavik meeting of October 1986 , where Comrade Mikhail Gorbachev proposed, among other important ideas, the working out of a draft agreement aimed at reducing strategic weapons by not less than 50 per cent and eliminating them completely during this century.\nHowever, Reagan's stubbornness in attempting to perpetuate the strategic defence initiative, which includes research and testing in outer space and opens a new era in the arms race, frustrated the possibility of reaching agreement at that epoch-making meeting. But we should not be pessimistic. The Reykjavik meeting proved that, at this crucial time for mankind, dialogue is both possible and necessary and that open, realistic dialogue not aimed at the military superiority of one side over the other may lead to agreement.\nIn June 1986 the International Court of Justice decided in favour of ending military activities against Nicaragua.\nThe Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit conferences resumed. The chairmanship passed from Abdou Diouf of Senegal in 1985, to Denis Sassou-Nguesso of Congo, Chairman for 1986, and recently to Kenneth Kaunda, President of Zambia and current Chairman of that outstanding organization.\nThe eighth summit Conference of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Zimbabwe in September 1986, confirmed the firmness of its principles in the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, against racism, including Zionism, and apartheid. The summit, which took place in a country bordering the racist Pretoria regime, constituted an exceptional expression of the international will to eliminate apartheid and attain the independence of Namibia. It also gave new impetus to the struggle for international peace and security, for the establishment of a new international economic order, for disarmament and for the development of third-world countries.\nSince the Harare summit Conference, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has continued its intense activity, focusing on the issues of greatest Importance and tension, namely the peace message addressed to the General-Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Comrade Gorbachev, by the Heads of State or Government and its delivery to the Government of the United States; the New Delhi meeting of Heads of State or Government of the Africa Fund Committee and its appeal for strengthened support for the struggle of the front-line States and liberation movements in southern Africa) the decision of the extraordinary meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau on the situation in Latin America and the Caribbean, and, most recently, the visit to Nicaragua of the Foreign Minister of Zimbabwe during the meeting of the Contadora and Support Group Foreign Ministers, to reiterate our solidarity in support of a peaceful solution of the Central American conflict and our rejection of the United States aggression and Interference in the region; the solidarity, expressed at the meeting of the Committee of Nine on Palestine, with the struggle of the Palestinian people to exercise their rights and establish an independent State in their homeland, and in favour of the early convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East; and the Brioni meeting of non-aligned Mediterranean States and its appeal for the strengthening of co-operation and peace in the region.\nIn June 1987, at the Extraordinary Ministerial Conference of Non-Aligned Countries on South-South Co-operation, the Pyongyang Declaration and Plan of Action for economic co-operation was signed; simultaneously, at Harare, the Conference of Ministers of Information advocated the establishment of a new information order. On 7 August, the five Central American Presidents signed the epoch-making Esquipulas II agreements with an express will to search for peace in the region. \n\nBetween 1981 and 1986 - as evidence of the rejection by nations of the United States policy of force - the voting pattern of all regional groups in the United Nations showed less coincidence with United States votes. The number of Member States whose votes coincided with those of the United States in more than 60 per cent of the time declined by more than half. That is, only half the countries which voted with the United States more than 60 per cent of the time in 1980 did so in 1986 - and their number was small. Moreover, at the forty-first session only 10 countries voted with the United States more than 60 per cent of the time.\nThe deterioration in the living conditions of the peoples of the third world, the increasing erosion of their economies and the worsening inequalities in the terms of trade in the Western industrialized world continue their galloping course. The international economic situation, particularly that of third-world countries, has become untenable. The low prices of major commodities} the protectionist measures applied by highly industrialized countries  the escalating increase in external debt and interest rates and the curtailment of external financing and the conditionality of lending by the International Monetary Round and the World Bank, including supervision of the domestic policies of recipient countries - all paint a gloomy picture of the prospects of underdeveloped countries.\nMoreover, the spiralling arms race has further aggravated this dramatic economic picture and the prospects for development.\nIn late August and early September, the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development was held. It affirmed the need to seek a solution to such an urgent situation. At the same time the idea that there will be no peace without development is, in Cartesian language, an obvious and inescapable truth. Cuba welcomes the positive results of that Conference, which, though marked by the absence of the United States, which bears principal responsibility for the arms race, nevertheless engaged in a complex, delicate and constructive negotiating process in which recognition of the inevitable link between disarmament and development and of the urgent need to devote resources released by disarmament immediately to development prevailed.\nIn recent years, our peoples have waged a prodigious struggle against the unbearable burden of external debt. Commander Fidel Castro, in particular, has courageously and decisively denounced that situation internationally. He has demonstrated objectively and unquestionably that the external debt is unpayable and that writing it off would not suffice to eliminate the misfortunes of our peoples unless such action was linked to the establishment of a new international economic order and to the necessary relationship between debt and disarmament. \nMany meetings attended by thousands of delegates from the most representative sectors of Latin America and the Caribbean were held in Havana in recent years with the purpose of considering and discussing, with vigour and courage, the external debt problem\u00b7, economists, jurists, workers, students, journalists, women, the military, priests, peasants, statesmen and personalities in the fields of the arts and sciences with profound knowledge of the Latin American reality and actors of the drama our region is enduring participated in those meetings, which were convened in the light of historic inequalities brought about by centuries of imperialist, capitalist and neo-colonialist exploitation.\nAs this brief summary shows, even if a number of particularly relevant events ace necessarily missing, these are times of hope t the seemingly successful drive of the Reagan Administration has come to a halt and fallen back} the fruitful activities of important international organizations have strengthened and a climate of negotiations is felt in Europe, Central America, southern Africa, Afghanistan and South-East Asia. We should do our utmost to keep up this momentum.\nThe United Nations should contribute with all its influence to achieving peace and political solutions to conflicts and disputes among nations. The efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, for contributing to putting an end to the fratricidal war between Iraq and Iran are a good example of this.\nThe world is facing the dilemma of peace and war. We have no right to ignore the outcry of our peoples; we have to prepare ourselves to live in peace. We have to create mechanisms which inspire and ensure confidence among peoples, security among States and peaceful and productive coexistence among nations. We have to lay the foundations for future relations so that the generations of the twenty-first century do not live in shame of their parents' legacy.\nTwenty-five years ago next October, the world was on the verge of a nuclear war. A quarter of a century later, notwithstanding the severe economic blockade imposed upon us by imperialism, notwithstanding all types of aggressions, including attempts against the lives of our leaders, notwithstanding the enormous resources used against Cuba, our revolution has been and will continue to be an unassailable bastion of Latin American dignity, firmness and fortitude.\nWhen the major contributor to the United Nations withholds its contribution and does not fulfil its obligations under the pretext of differences between the executive and legislative powers, it is really attempting to impose its interests on the United Nations, thus impairing the interest of the great majority of the Members of the Organization. In these circumstances, General Assembly resolution 41/213 cannot be implemented. We must demand that the United States cease this niggardly policy.\nThere is no doubt that such a policy of force and blackmail has not succeeded, thanks to the unity and cohesion of dignified and independent countries, which allows us to say that multilateralism - the United Nations - continues to show, with commendable impetus, our positions, our rights and our demands in the pursuit of a world without war, of equality and equitable peace for all.\nWe welcome today the negotiating will expressed by the five Central American Presidents, as reflected in the Esquipulas II Agreements, even in the face of resistance by certain circles in the present United States Administration, which attempt to maintain aggression, blockade and destabilisation against the legitimate Government of Nicaragua.\nCuba considers that the independent attitude of the countries signatories of the Guatemala Agreement is a new event in the history of the region. The huge efforts exerted over the years by the Contadora and Support Groups in pursuit of a Latin American solution to the serious Central American crisis contributed considerably to that.\nWe must pool our efforts and take concrete actions in order to achieve the implementation of those important agreements and be determined to adopt necessary measures for the economic reconstruction of Central American countries. We must continue to support the efforts of the Contadora and Support Groups in favour of peace in Central America.\nNicaragua has the right to live in peace and is entitled to exercise its sovereign right to choose the options it deems most appropriate to satisfy its national needs. We must support those who struggle in favour of liberty and dignity in El Salvador and in every corner of a continent where the ideas of Bolivar, Marti and Juarez are increasingly reaffirmed.\nThe record of these years reaffirms that the unity, firmness and awareness of the problems and of our strength to tackle them successfully is an undeniable fact. Today we may assert that the policy of confrontation is undergoing serious setbacks and we witness certain negotiating trends that, although they are slow, are making progress. This proves that our peoples are able to make their desires for peace prevail.\nWe welcome negotiation efforts, such as the process aimed at achieving the dismantling of medium-range missiles in Europe, and the national reconciliation plan chartered by the Government of Afghanistan and its contacts with the United Nations Secretary-General in the search of a just and equitable solution, which will guarantee peace and security in the area.\nThe Indochina's peoples in South-East Asia are working hard to find formulas leading to a peaceful negotiated process beneficial to the entire region through a flexible and constructive dialogue. We support the policy of national reconciliation formulated by the People's Republic of Kampuchea in the pursuit of peace for all its people; without distinction of class, ideology, ethnicity or religion.\nOn southern Africa, as expressed on 1 August in Havana, Cuba and Angola are in a position to make their common position flexible on the basis of the principles of the November 1984 Platform and its annex, with a view to promoting the constructive aim of a just and honourable agreement which may bring about the independence of Namibia, the security of Angola and peace for all States in southern Africa.\nCuba will maintain its stand of internationalist support and solidarity with the Government of the People's Republic of Angola in accordance with the Agreements signed with the Government of that sister nation. Cuba shall contribute to the maintenance of stability and prevention of any aggression against the People's Republic of Angola and, in an active and effective way, shall work for real peace in the region. Essential for that purpose are the independence of Namibia, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), its sole and legitimate representative, and the definitive elimination of the ignominious apartheid regime.\nWe must redouble our efforts and render our solidarity to the people of South Africa for the total elimination of apartheid) to the people of Puerto Rico for the achievement of their freedom and independence) for the convening of the peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)) and for the solution of the long and bloody conflict regarding the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the establishment of its own state. There will be no solution to the Middle East conflict unless the Palestinian problem is solved, under the leadership of its sole and legitimate representative, the PLO. We should continue to support the just cause of the Lebanese people for its national unity and peace, the security of its people and respect for its territorial integrity and non-aligned status. We support demands for the withdrawal of the Moroccan troops and administration from Western Saharan territory as the essential condition to hold the referendum on the self-determination of the Sahraoui people} for Argentine sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands  for the aspiration of the Comoro Islands to recover sovereignty over Mayotte and for the return of Madagascar's rights over the Malagasy Islands of Glorieuses, Juan de Nova, Europa and Bassas da India. We should provide firm and active support to the people of Cyprus, a non-aligned country struggling to defend its independence, national unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We support initiatives to convene an international conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, which many lead to progress towards a solution to the situation that now endangers its territorial integrity and national existence.\nThe Indian Ocean demands a greater will from the States responsible for its militarization in order that they reverse their nefarious policy. Meanwhile, we must continue to exert efforts for the early realization of the desire to transform the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. Contrary to our long-standing endeavours to demilitarise the Indian Ocean, we witness with shock the spread of military forces in the Persian Gulf, which jeopardize its security and pose a serious threat to security and peace in the area and world-wide. Let us increase our demands for the elimination of all military presence from that sensitive area.\nWe must recall the situation prevailing in the trusteeship of the Pacific Islands, where the Government of the United States in an arbitrary, unilateral and illegal manner has sought to consolidate and perpetuate its colonial presence.\nWe denounce attempts to prevent the independence and sovereignty of so-called Micronesia. We reiterate our categorical support for the legitimate Bolivian demand to recover direct and useful access to the Pacific Ocean, with full sovereignty over that access. We denounce the absence of will on the part of the Chilean regime to continue the negotiations initiated between the two Governments to find a just solution.\nWe demand strict compliance with the 1977 Torrijos-Carter treaty on the Panama Canal, and reject manoeuvres by the Government of the United States to violate it and perpetuate its domination and military presence in the isthmus.\nWe reiterate our firm solidarity with the sisterly Democratic People's Republic of Korea, arduously struggling for the realization of its people's desire for peaceful reunification and the withdrawal of United States occupation troops from the south of the peninsula.\nWe support the position of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea that Korea must not enter the United Nations in the present state of partition, and that entry must wait until it succeeds in reuniting the country. We also support the co-sponsorship of the forthcoming Olympic Games by both States, as an instrument of unity and peace between nations.\nWe advocate a speedy solution of the regrettable conflict between Iran and Iraq, which should never have begun, and which continues to cause irreparable losses to both peoples. We support the redoubling of efforts by the United Nations to find a peaceful solution, just and honourable for both sides, thus ending this fratricidal war, which has been going on now for more than seven years. We are firmly convinced that it is more than ever imperative to co-ordinate our action, our unity and our struggle to impose what we desire: d\u00e9tente, dialogue, peace, and development. \nFrom the very dawn of the Revolution my Government and people, have suffered the harassment, blockade and aggression of a powerful neighbour. We have learned to live with imperialist aggression and pressure. Although that was not our wish, it is the reality we have had to face. We stand for peace and negotiation in international relations, especially in our continent and with our neighbours. We have never practised an aggressive or hostile policy. Our sole \\\"sin\\\" may have been the exercise of the right of our people - enshrined in the United Nations Charter and in any international forum - freely to choose its own system and its own principles of genuine national independence.\nBenito Juarez, an illustrious Latin American leader, said, \\\"Respect for the tight of others is peace.\\\" We regret that the Government of our powerful northern neighbour does not apply this thinking in its international relations.\nWe have resisted, and shall continue to resist. We have seen different administrations come and go, while our Revolution has developed and become stronger, hoping that the good sense, wisdom and genuine tradition of the American people will prevail, and that the need for coexistence will be recognized.\nWe have learned the importance of unity and cohesion in order to resist and overcome. Today, more than ever before, in view of international initiatives seeking paths to negotiation and a new state of relations, we reaffirm our permanent and irrevocable attachment to peace and coexistence.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, I wish first of all to thank you for the opportunity afforded me to make my second address to this body. I bring to you and to the distinguished personalities assembled here fraternal greetings from the Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\nMay I now join the eminent and eloquent speakers who have preceded me and congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the esteemed position you now occupy. Your election to this post is a clear reflection of the high regard in which you are held and of the complete confidence your colleagues place in you, based, most assuredly, on your personal qualities, diplomatic skills and sincere commitment to the high ideals of the Organization, My delegation pledges its fullest co-operation, in every way possible, with your endeavours to carry out your duties during this, the forty-second session of the General Assembly.\nI also express congratulations to the previous President of the General Assembly on his capable handling of the critical issues that commanded the attention of this body during the last session and on his skilful guidance of the deliberations. My delegation cannot emphasize too strongly the importance it attaches to the role of the United Nations, in general, and to the General Assembly in particular, in recommending solutions for the peaceful settlement of international political conflicts, for the improvement of international economic conditions, and for the maintenance of human rights and freedom the world over.\nWe firmly believe in the link established between international peace and security and political and socio-economic development. They are not mutually exclusive. They are interdependent and complementary one to the other. We, as citizens of the world community, are committed to redouble our efforts to preserve global freedom and peaceful coexistence of which we here in this body are the sole arbiters.\nIt is a sad reality, however, that our combined efforts to achieve and preserve lasting peace and freedom are constantly thwarted by adverse national and international economic conditions, regional and localized conflicts, and repeated violations of human rights.\nIndeed, war and the threat of war are issues which constantly demand the attention of the world Organization. However, we are not succeeding in beating the swords raised in anger around the world into ploughshares, as is so clearly set forth as a serious objective by the Organization. Too often we find that the prospect of peace is dangled tantalizingly before a world that is eager for a respite from war - a respite that would give us all an opportunity to build rather than to destroy. Just as often, we find that prospects for peace vanish like a soap-bubble blown into the air.\nMy delegation supports the peace initiative with regard to Iran and Iraq undertaken by the Secretary-General. The world is weary of this seven-year-old war of attrition between Iran and Iraq that has wasted vast amounts of human and natural resources. Recent events in that region clearly demonstrate the risk of the widening of the conflict, and even the possibility of super-Power involvement if the conflict continues, thereby posing \u0430 genuine threat to international peace and security.\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis fervently supports resolution 598 (1987) unanimously adopted by the Security Council in July of this year, the text of which demands an immediate cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. We call upon both combatants to comply with the resolution, and States members of the General Assembly to be prepared to display the political will to exert the diplomatic pressures required to elicit compliance by the belligerents.\nAlso in the Middle East the question of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to a well-defined homeland and to a just and lasting peace is still considered the core of the Middle East conflict. However, this must coexist with the right of the people of Israel to live within secure boundaries. Here, too, strong and persistent action is needed to have all parties adhere to the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly on the issue.\nWith respect to the situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea, my delegation notes with sad regret that these localized occupations are no closer to an end today despite repeated resolutions that call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from these occupied territories. The hopes and aspirations of the people of Afghanistan and of Kampuchea are being sacrificed in the cauldron of these conflicts. I call upon the General Assembly to continue to register its strong support for the liberation of the people of Afghanistan.\nThe United Nations has a special responsibility to support its Members in their efforts to preserve individual sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence, and to denounce and act against those aggressive nations that violate the fundamental rights of other weaker and vulnerable nations. Those among us who value peace must not be dominated by others who readily resort to war. People everywhere, whether they be in the east or the west, in the north or the south, should be free to choose the government which best reflects their political convictions and aspirations. \nOn the question of peace and stability on the American continent, the situation in Central America preoccupies us. My delegation is particularly concerned about the possible implications for the peoples of Central America, Latin America, and the Caribbean that a worsening of the crisis in this area may have. The Caribbean and Latin America need an economic revival, but this revival cannot come in the midst of civil wars and guerrilla activity.\nMy delegation welcomes the peace initiative recently worked out by Government leaders of Central America. It is a peace plan by Central Americans for Central America. It should be given every opportunity to be effective. I call upon all combatants throughout Central America and the Caribbean to observe the cease-fire and then to negotiate in good faith for a lasting peace leading to the realization of true democracy throughout the region.\nAlso in relation to our partner in the Caribbean Community, Belize, my delegation calls for early ratification of the Cartagena Protocol as a contribution to the lowering of tensions in the region. The fact is that the various conflicts throughout the world are being supplied with arms from seemingly inexhaustible sources. This fact, however, receives scant attention from the international community.\nOur attention is focused instead on the prospects for an arms reduction agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, mainly in relation to medium-range nuclear missiles. There is great concern about the danger of nuclear weapons, and this is certainly justified because no corner of the world can be considered safe from the fallout of nuclear explosion. While, however, we seek to prevent this potential calamity, the reality is that every day all over the world destruction of life and property is being wrought by conventional weapons. \nIt is imperative that our forum here at the United Nations spearhead urgent and continuing efforts to achieve genuine and meaningful progress in disarmament to include all weapons, conventional and chemical, as well as nuclear. It is then and only then that we will be able to mobilize fully the resources of rich and poor nations alike to address the serious economic problems which obstruct our attempts at achieving a better quality of life for all.\nArticle 55 of the Charter of the United Nations recognizes that conditions of stability and well-being are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations. In turn, peace and friendly relations among nations are necessary prerequisites to the achievement of steady economic growth worldwide.\nThe world debt problem is yet another deterrent to economic development. It runs counter to the efforts of this body to alleviate the syndrome of poverty and underdevelopment crippling half of the world's population as it currently bedevils all attempts by the developing countries to bring a better quality of life to their people. I share the sentiment that a concrete solution can only be envisioned if the issue is treated as the international crisis that it is.\nThe Assembly has had to concede that the International Development Strategy for the First and Second United Nations Development Decades has remained largely unfulfilled. As we approach the end of the Third Development Decade, the developing countries do not deny the existence of their external debt, nor shun a measure of responsibility for its solution. We realize that the primary responsibility for improving our economies rests upon our shoulders. However, we cannot go it alone in this world where even the super-Powers recognize some level of interdependence- We are buffeted by changing conditions in the world at large, and are at the mercy of conditions over which we have no control. The debt problem can only be addressed in a meaningful way by a process of Worth-South co-operation. My delegation is highly supportive of the approach to this problem outlined here by the Government of Jamaica. This proposal calls for a longer-term structured rescheduling of debt, accompanied by the provision of additional capital resources, so that economic growth is not stultified by the burden of debt servicing, but rather continues in tandem with it.\nThe more affluent countries cannot, nor should they try, to shirk their  responsibility to increase the capital resources available to the developing nations.\nIt is the developed countries which reduce the price that they pay to us for the primary commodities we produce- It is the developed countries which increase the price of the machinery and equipment they sell to us to De used in the production of the same primary commodities, and in other vital development areas.\nThis is the situation in which Saint Kitts and Nevis is placed in relation to its primary export commodity, sugar. The price is severely depressed. Quotas are drastically reduced. But the price of machinery to improve the efficiency of production continues to escalate. The plight of the sugar-producing countries in the Caribbean, and indeed throughout the world, cannot be addressed by platitudes or the current attitude of benign neglect. It requires the urgent serious and sympathetic consideration of the developed countries.\nIt is clear that economic strangulation can and does lead to political instability within and between nations. Many countries find it increasingly difficult to cope with growing social and economic demands in the face of drastic adjustments. Our vigorous efforts need to be complemented by increased international assistance and co-operation. It is not enough to call for structural adjustment. This is not by itself the universal panacea. Indeed, this is already being undertaken in many developing countries. In my own country Saint Kitts and Nevis, we have already embarked on a programme of diversification which expands our agricultural sector, places greater emphasis on tourism development and gives impetus to the growth of light industry, while at the same time employing greater fiscal prudence in the public sector.\nIt is unfortunate that some - I repeat, some - experts from the developed countries have a biased view of structural adjustment. Their interpretation in relation to the developing countries is: increasing taxation on already overburdened people} reducing programmes for social and cultural developments; and cutting back on provision of employment by the public sector.\nFor the developed countries, however, their interpretation of structural adjustment can include: reducing taxes; increasing spending on implements or war; and reducing assistance to developing countries in the grip of structural adjustment.\nThis approach will only further increase the imbalances which exist and widen the gap between the rich and the poor countries. In the final analysis, all of us need to realize that there must be a humane side to structural adjustment. The fiscal and economic measures which are employed nationally, regionally and internationally to improve the abstract indices of growth and development must also address the educational, social, cultural and health needs of people everywhere. The real essence of development is the development of people.\nThe world has risen to many a challenge in the past to provide a better quality of life for people everywhere, and the United Nations has been in the forefront of the struggle. Diseases once the scourge of mankind, like smallpox, tuberculosis and poliomyelitis, have been defeated. Once again we must mobilize; we must defeat malnutrition, poverty, drug abuse and the more recent scourge. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, AIDS, which threaten to destroy the flower of our youth who hold the keys to the future of our nations. The time has come for us to take a more humanitarian look at the world, and to divert more of its resources away from creating and proliferating the means of destruction into providing constructive and effective solutions to the problems of underdevelopment. \nI have so far projected a general view of developing countries. However, it has come to be universally recognized that there is within this broad framework a special category of developing countries whose problems require special consideration. This is the category of island developing countries.\nA number of analytical and descriptive studies, including a study by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), have shown that island developing countries have characteristics distinct from those of developing countries in general. As a result, the type of development strategy regarded as appropriate in general and promoted by the United Nations may in some aspects be inappropriate for these countries in particular. The studies have also highlighted certain specific handicaps facing small island countries and dispelled some myths concerning them.\nOur handicaps are basically derived from the smallness and remoteness of most of us. They include vulnerability to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, to which islands in the Caribbean are particularly vulnerable; special transport problems, which are even more acute in archipelagic countries; highly limited internal markets; lack of natural resources; and heavy dependence on imports.\nThese imports in turn ate financed by a small number of foreign-exchange-earning activities - commodity exports, tourism or emigrant remittances, for example. Given the high per capita cost of building and maintaining the economic and social infrastructure for small and isolated populations, small islands lack the critical mass to provide basic services economically for their populations. However, these services must be provided. People in island communities have as much right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and basic amenities as people in large metropolitan societies. Growing recognition of the conclusions regarding island developing countries is reflected in the five resolutions on island developing countries adopted unanimously by the General Assembly between 1976 and 1982. The international development strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade specifically highlights our problems. Other organizations have also begun to focus on this group. For instance, the Commonwealth Heads of Government endorsed, in 1979, a special programme of action in favour of the smaller Commonwealth countries, and the Lom\u00e9 Conventions make special provisions for these countries.\nHowever, a number of countries and institutions are clearly sceptical about the specificity of island developing countries, and some are against the proliferation of such special categories of developing countries.\nI say to the sceptics that the existence of sovereign island nations is a fact of life. We are real, we exist, we have a voice which is heard and must continue to be heard in international forums, and we are sovereign. We are no figment of anyone's imagination. We are here, and here to stay. I therefore call for urgent, concerted and constructive action to give effect to the resolutions in relation to island developing countries already adopted by the Assembly.\nThe effective functioning of the United Nations in its various dimensions is vital to the resolution of conflicts, the achievement of peace in the world, and the marshalling of the resources of the world for the effective resolution of problems. Here we can come together to heal wounds and facilitate co-operation between nations.\nIt is in this context that we renew our call for North and South Korea to become Members of the United Nations This is not to deny or preclude the goal of reunification of the Korean peninsula. We must, however, address situations as they exist, and not merely as we would wish them to be. Both countries on the Korean peninsula amply satisfy the requirements for membership. Besides, the realities of the existing deadlock dictate the need for the stimulation and maintenance of dialogue between the two sides within such a structured and supportive framework as the United Nations can provide.\nFinally, I turn to the question of human rights, the violation of which is another threat to international peace and security.\nDeveloping countries like Saint Kitts and Nevis are acutely aware of the premium which must be placed on human resources. Our greatest potential lies in our people, and in drawing from them the qualities of patriotism and service which can flourish only in an atmosphere which guarantees the dignity and worth of the human person. Yet, nearly 40 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the right of peoples and nations to self-determination as a prerequisite to the full enjoyment of all fundamental human rights is still being denied.\nNowhere is such violation more flagrant and agonizing than in South Africa, where the evil policy of apartheid is insensitively perpetuated and consolidated. The United Nations has been in the forefront of the opposition to apartheid, and now appears to be growing weary in its efforts to bring an end to its perpetuation. Perhaps this is the design; perhaps the design of Pretoria is continually to confront the international community with arrogant defiance and frustrate it into wearied resignation and silence.\nMy delegation refuses to be lulled into silence on this issue. We will take every opportunity publicly to proclaim our abhorrence for the system of apartheid, because it is inherently evil, and we exhort the international community and the oppressed of South Africa to stand firm in their opposition and struggle. We laud all the countries that have heeded the appeals of the various resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council and have imposed sanctions on South Africa. We are optimistic that if a persevering world unified against apartheid continues to send this signal to Pretoria the stubborn walls of apartheid must eventually crumble. We can accept nothing less than the equality of all men. \nSt. Kitts and Nevis also reaffirms its support for Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the United Nations independence plan for Namibia. The world is so closely knit and interdependent that conflicts or tensions anywhere and of whatever nature affect us all, because we are citizens of one world. We are our brother's keeper, and as brothers we are equal. The United Nations is like a great lens which is made to capture the powerful but diffuse rays of the sun and distil and concentrate them into a unified force directed into any selected focal point. The United Nations can and should attract the diverse energies, resources and creativity of all the nations and concentrate them into a unified powerful force to be focused upon the various problems that beset mankind. I am convinced that in this way effective solutions compatible with the preservation of human dignity can be achieved.\n"

Your unanimous election is both a personal tribute and a token of esteem for the country you represent. I take pleasure also in thanking your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, for the manner in which he guided us during the forty-first session of the General Assembly. In addition we join in thanking the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts. His work and that of his staff and the entire Secretariat are sources of pride to us all. In this regard we commend the addition to his team of Ambassador Joseph V. Reed as Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs. He has a rather large pair of shoes to fill, but all who know him have no doubt that he is equal to the task.\nTaking the floor immediately after Dr. Kenneth Kaunda, President of Zambia and current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, is a great honour and at the same time a great responsibility. It is not easy to follow to the rostrum of this body one so eloquent and so universally admired as is President Kaunda. He looms large in history as a spokesman for those who cherish mankind's highest ideals. Today he has spoken not only for the people of Zambia and the continent of Africa but also for all who believe in the United Nations.\t\nIt is always a great honour and rare privilege to speak before the United Nations General Assembly. Today the honour is greater and the privilege later because of the presence of President Kaunda and his penetrating words. We, like others, applaud his wisdom, his dedication and his sensitivity. We also concur with his vision of a world in which humanity is permitted to blossom to its fullest potential.\nThe ability to communicate through the medium of the spoken or written word, so movingly demonstrated by President Kaunda today, is one of mankind's greatest achievements. Occasionally that ability is taken for granted and neither appreciated nor properly utilized.\nThose few who - because of their economic or military strength - hold in their hands the power of life or death over so many other human beings, often do not feel the need to listen to those of us who do not command vast fortunes powerful armies or large armadas. When they do listen they tend to listen mechanically, with their ears rather than with their hearts. They then frequently fail to heed the poignant messages addressed to them.\nThus, year after year, speaker after speaker walks to this rostrum, stands before the nations of the world and states the case for independence for Namibia, an end to apartheid in South Africa and common decency and justice foe the Palestinians. Speaker after speaker pleads for justice and peace for the people of Central America and South-East Asia. Speaker after speaker calls for an end to the arms race and the recurring nuclear nightmares of small children everywhere. Were these words to be listened to, and heeded, they would be almost magical in what they could achieve.\nWords are like magic. They can transport one to another time, another place, or another dimension. They can express the full range of human experiences and emotions, from charity to greed, from forgiveness to indignation, from humility to arrogance, from hope to despair, from love to hatred. Words can be instruments of enlightenment or revelations of ignorance. Words can stir, inspire and move listeners to action or lull them into indifference, boredom and inactivity.\nWords are capable of opening minas or closing them. They are capable of expanding horizons or restricting them. They can bring us together or drive us further apart. Words are potentially more powerful than any military weapon known to mankind. They have been known to make tyrants tremble and dictatorships decay.\nThat is why some fear the written or spoken word as much as they fear anything. That is why eighteenth and nineteenth century slave holders in the western hemisphere made it \\\"illegal\\\" for the human beings they held in bondage to learn to read and write and forbade them to communicate in their own languages. That is why well past the mid-point of the twentieth century, in even the most developed of countries, some parents have had to struggle to see their children get any semblance of a decent education. That is why the apartheid regime of South Africa has spared no effort to stifle the voices or that country's bravest sons and daughters.\nThat is why in so many lands, large and small, developed and Developing, north and south, east and west, so many generations of courageous human beings have pleaded, petitioned, marched and agitated for the right to be educated and the right to be heard. That is why today we search for words which will, as a renowned Mozambican poet wrote, \u201c'... enter every house like the wind and fail like red hot embers on our people's souls\nWith all that words can do, none can do more than words of candour and sincerity. The late Amilcar Cabrai once encouraged his colleagues, in the African Party for the Independence of Guinea (Bissau) and Cape Verde, to hide nothing from the masses of the people and to tell no lies, claim no easy victories. That admonition is as appropriate to us here, at the United Nations today, as it was 22 years ago to those struggling to bring freedom to two small West African countries.\nTruth is a mighty weapon. It is in fact the greatest weapon possessed by those who would feed the hungry, house the homeless, heal the sick, educate the illiterate, end senseless violence and generally help create a more equitable world.\nIn none of those areas will the international community be able to claim an easy victory; not one of these things will be easy to achieve. Then, again, that which is worth working for, that which is worth struggling for, seldom is easy. We would be guilty of the worst form of naivety were we to suggest otherwise. ,  \nWords alone, no matter how beautiful, are not sufficient to resolve the hard issues on the agenda of the United Nations. If they were, Namibia would be a mil Member of the United Nations, Palestine would be a Member of the United Nations and South Africa would be represented by a legitimate Government and would be seated in this Hall today.\nIf words alone were sufficient/ the questions of Cyprus, Kampuchea and Afghanistan would no longer appear on our agenda. If words alone were sufficient, the peoples of Western Sahara, East Timor and New Caledonia would already have been permitted to assume their rightful places within the community of nations.\nWords, however, no matter how articulate, how truthful, how forceful, now insightful or how well-intended, are never enough. They probably will never be enough. Frederick Douglas, a leader of the anti-slavery movement during the nineteenth century and a great orator, expressed that best when he said:\n\\\"Power concedes nothing without \u0430 demand. It never did and it never will.\nFind out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both.\\\"\nEvery year the General Assembly passes a stream of resolutions. The words of those resolutions, taken together, comprise some of the most noble thoughts and theories known to mankind. What is far less noble is the lack of resolve by some Members of the United Nations when we leave this hall and it is time to implement our collective decisions.\nIt is not enough merely to denounce apartheid. It will not disappear without a struggle. How long and how violent a struggle is up to those who imposed apartheid on South Africa's people and then on Namibia. We, the rest of the world, must in a real sense support those who struggle against apartheid and adopt for ourselves values which differ from the values of those who practise this onerous creed, as well as the values of those who profit from it. The values we embrace should be the values of those who respect the genuine universality of every human being. Those values must be embraced at all times, in all places, and not merely when and where the world happens to be looking or listening.\nSilence, or inaction, in the face of a known evil in one corner of the globe can be taken as acceptance of other evils in other corners of the globe. We, the international community, must be consistent and unremitting foes - no matter the price - of anyone who would assign a second- or third-class status to any person because of his or her race, religion, sex, language or economic status. \nThe essential need to secure and hold the higher ground during any engagement of hostile forces is a well-known axiom of military science. In mankind's moral engagement to determine the future destiny of our planet, we should apply the same axiom and secure and maintain the higher ground.\nNo person held in slavery should aspire to be a slave-holder. No person who has known the bitter taste of discrimination should himself, or herself, discriminate against another. No person who has been victimized should look for others to become his, or her, victim.\nIt pains us deeply to see some former colonies fail to understand the legitimate strivings of others for their own independence. Interruptions in the process of decolonization are even more tragic when the intruding State is itself a former colony which might have helped a neighbour's first tentative steps on the path to reclaiming its own identity. Vanuatu's position on this question is based on what it perceives as what is right and what is wrong, rather than on what others might perceive as either convenient, expedient, safe or a fait accompli.\nThus, it is Vanuatu's hope that the people of Western Sahara, the people of East Timor and others similarly situated will be allowed to realize their dreams also. Their rights are as sacred as those of anyone else represented here today. If there is no room at the inn for them, then very few of us should feel secure about our own places.\nWe are similarly saddened by the tragic spectacle of intercommunal strife which plagues every corner of the earth. There is no need to recite the names, the dates or the places. Everyone is already painfully familiar with them. Much of this intercommunal strife has its roots in a shared colonial history. Some pre-dates colonialism and is the result of antagonisms that go back many centuries. Understanding the roots of a problem should help us to combat it. Unfortunately, demagogues are always willing to exploit and manipulate existing social contradictions for their own selfish ends and carry others down a destructive path. We, the international community, must maintain the higher moral ground. We should address these social contradictions and try to resolve them. How we go about it is the important question. We should let our actions signal to others the type of world we would like to see.\nThe dignity and majesty of the victims of the apartheid regime of South Africa are, we believe, an example for the rest of the world. The African National Council (ANC) and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) have consistently maintained the higher ground by steadfastly refusing to adopt the values of the Pretoria regime. We have great faith in their vision of the future. They struggle for their people and against a system, rather than against fellow human beings. To secure the future of this planet, it rests with all of us to learn from them and stop waging war against each other and against each other's children. It rests with us not to adopt the discredited values of immoral regimes. It rests with us not to act as proxies for others who are only too willing to divide us by seductively whispering in an ear how bad one ethnic group or another is.\nThe tragic war between Iran and Iraq is an example of a conflict which involves a complex web of historical contradictions. Like most other countries, Vanuatu was appalled by the outbreak of this war and is appalled by its continuation, Vanuatu has never taken sides on the antagonisms that exist between these two States and will not do so now} we consider both friends. However, one must ask this; does there come a point beyond which one wages war against a neighbour and begins to wage war against one's own professed values, and one's own people, and the rest of civilization? \nWe do not have-answers to the questions passed by this tragedy. Like so many others, we merely address an appeal to the decency and common sense of both parties to the conflict. We ask them please to try to reason together and arrive at some mutually agreeable formula. Let there be neither victors nor vanquished; let there simply be peace.\nThe war between Iran and Iraq, the loss of life it entails and its economic consequences bring to mind the relevancy of the recently concluded International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. Although the result of the Conference was not completely satisfactory, the consensus that was arrived at was an important step on the path we must all walk together. None of us can walk that or any other road alone. The economic situation faced by developing countries has been discussed at length, we will not at this time expand further on what has already been so adequately said by others similarly situated. However , we cannot help but observe that when developing countries wish to build a railroad, a port facility, an airport, a communications network, schools, health clinics or other parts of a national infrastructure all sorts of financial obstacles are encountered. But, when a developing country wishes to buy weapons, credit can always be arranged. This is true no matter how poor or how small the country, regardless of its other needs, and no matter how ill prepared its military might be to absorb certain equipment. Some seem to confuse the business of selling weapons with the art of diplomacy. For them, the way to win friends and influence people is to market the means of mass destruction. In most instances, the friends that are gained are many times fewer than those that are lost. \nThe recent agreement in principle between the United States and the Soviet Union to dismantle intermediate-range nuclear forces is a positive, although tentative, step. There are, of course, a great many more complex issues to be addressed. Therefore, the proposed upcoming meeting between the leaders of those two countries is another welcome sign. President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev will carry with them the prayers and hopes of the entire world when they meet. The prospect of a productive dialogue between them is a harbinger of a better international climate.\nThe world cannot help but be encouraged by the example of these two great nations learning to live with each other. Certainly Iran and Iraq should be able to find as much common ground as have the United States and the Soviet Union. After years of harsh and bitter fighting, it appears that common ground may now exist in another part of the world. The recently concluded agreement between five Central American Presidents is a positive step worthy of international support. Peace, and the opportunity to pursue justice without fear, may finally be at hand for the people of that troubled region.\nIn this connection, Vanuatu also joins in supporting appeals for the normalization of relations between Belize and Guatemala. Recognition of the national identity, dignity and territorial integrity of all six nations of Central America is an essential element in the promotion of peaceful coexistence and economic development for the people of that region.\nFew areas of the world cry out as much for adherence to the basic values of human decency as does the Middle East, When all is said and done, the fact remains that in that part of the world the fundamental contradiction, the fundamental problem, the fundamental wrong, is the systematic effort to deny the humanity of the Palestinian people. Their homes, their hopes and their futures were sacrificed to establish the State of Israel. \nNow, neighbouring Lebanon faces a doubtful future. Its children's dreams have also been sacrificed. Is there no limit to what the world expects the people of that region to endure? This is a matter that has vexed and plagued the international community for longer than anyone cares to remember. Over the years, there have been a great many heroes and civilians on both sides. Certainly, neither side is pure but, here again, each must reach out to the other. It makes as much sense today to ignore the Palestine Liberation Organization as it did earlier to attempt to deny the existence of the people it represents. This is a problem that the international community helped to create. Thus, it is a matter that we must help to resolve. We can begin by convening the much discussed international conference on the Middle East.\nWilliam Shakespeare once aptly stated that the past is the prologue. We believe that solutions to many of the items on the agenda of the United Nations require that we look to the future rather than be prisoners of the past. Today the United Nations affords mankind an opportunity to avoid many of yesterday's mistakes.\nHowever, like Shakespeare, we believe that truly to comprehend the nature of some of the current problems and the motivation of some of the principal actors on the world stage, we must also have knowledge of the past. In this regard we note regrettably that some, notably the apartheid regime of South Africa, live so far in the past that they are incapable of comprehending the lessons of history.\nSouth Africa's slave-State conditions are not historically unique. In recent years those conditions have been modified in form but not in substance. Thus, South Africa remains fundamentally as uncompromisingly racist as other parts of the world were in the nineteenth century.\nThe changes that have occurred resulted in part from the impact of the rapidly changing world of the twentieth century. However, the most important catalyst has been, and continues to be, the efforts of the people of South Africa who have simply refused to be docile.\nApartheid ranks with slavery, the inhuman excesses of the colonial era, the holocaust of the Second World War era and other acts of genocide, among the most significant crimes ever committed against humanity. Apartheid is not always discussed in the same context as slavery. However, for many reasons we believe it should be. The commercial traffic in human beings known as the trans-Atlantic slave trade, like its lesser known counterpart in the South Pacific, earned universal condemnation for its evil nature and the horror it created. That sinful behaviour cost millions of lives and destroyed entire societies. It wrenched families apart and eventually became the genesis of colonialism. The depth and magnitude of the human suffering caused by the slave trade is incalculable. Similarly, the financial wealth accumulated by an assortment of kidnappers, hijackers, thugs and terrorists - yes, terrorists - as a result of the traffic in human beings can never be calculated. Some may have forgotten. Others, no doubt, would prefer to forget this important page of history.\nWe make this reference today not out of bitterness. There is no rancour in our hearts and no recrimination is intended. We merely wish every nation represented here today to remember and comprehend the past so that we will understand the true context of South Africa, the nature of Humanity's foe in Pretoria and what the international community must do to overcome that for. South Africa has not yet learned the lessons of history. Therefore the rest of the world must strive harder to bring the message of those lessons home to South Africa. We must become better interpreters and instructors of history than we have been to date.\nDespite circumstances and conditions which would test the patience of a saint. Nelson Mandela has maintained the moral higher ground we spoke of earlier. He and his colleagues have taught their gaolers a most important lesson. Indeed, in a sense, he and many of his people are freer than those who placed him in prison and who fearfully stand guard over an entire aroused nation. It is our hope that by the end of this session of the general Assembly all of us will be standing with Mr. Mandela and no one will either apologize for, or protect, his gaolers. Those who traffic in narcotic drugs have much in common with those who now govern South Africa. Both value material wealth over human life and moral decency. Both sell the false dream of a mindless form of existence. Both offer nothing more than modern-day slavery in different forms. Both deserve nothing but the sternest concerted international action to eradicate them from the human experience.\nThe International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking held in Vienna this past June under the able presidency of the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, was an important milestone. Vanuatu is pleased to note the Increasing International realization that not a single region, not a single nation, not a single community, not a single individual is untouched, or immune, from the scourge of drug abuse or the curse of drug traffickers and what they bring with them. However, no nation, not even the richest and most powerful among us, can feel that it is doing enough to address this major challenge to civilization. The evidence of this fact surrounds us, unfortunately, and threatens to drown us all.\nTerrorism also threatens to drown civilization. This is as true of the type of terrorism practised by those who appear at a door in the middle of the night wearing official uniforms, armed with the blessings of a State apparatus and who have perfected techniques of torture, as it is of those individuals who take it upon themselves to kidnap and cruelly traffic in human beings much as slave traders and pirates did in an earlier era. It is also as true of the type of terrorism that holds all of humanity captive to the very real danger posed by nuclear arsenals, as it is of those who commit random acts of violence using more conventional Instruments of death. Terrorism is wrong. It is wrong morally. It is wrong tactically. It is wrong politically. There are not exceptions and no qualifying conditions. One cannot use criminal tactics without becoming a criminal. \nThe values of an organization or a movement are, like the values of an individual, determined by how that organization or movement lives and how it values life - all life. That is true whether the life being valued is that of one who is black, white, brown or yellow; whether it is the life of one who is Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, atheist or agnostic; whether it is the life of one who is gifted or disabled; or whether it is the life of one who is wealthy or one who lives in poverty.\nWe now turn to a subject we wish we did not have to turn to. In the forty-second year of the existence of the United Nations, 27 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, this body should not still have before it the question of Namibia or the question of New Caledonia.\nDespite the obvious obstacles to its independence, there is no longer any question as to whether Namibia's people have the right to their own identity and their own country. Even if South Africa were tomorrow somehow to transfer large numbers of whites into Namibia - many of them military personnel and civil servants - and enough people from neighbouring countries to make the Namibians a minority in their own country, no one would be deceived and question Namibia's right to become an independent nation. South Africa, by its intransigence, has managed to delay the inevitable, but it cannot at this stage rewrite history.\nIn New Caledonia, the administering Power is attempting to defraud the colonized people and deceive the international community through a policy of demographic engineering. Through its deliberate actions in encouraging migration to New Caledonia, it has now succeeded in turning that Territory's people into a minority - although still the largest community numerically - in their own land. The question before us now is, should such actions by a colonial Power be allowed to frustrate the legitimate aspirations of a colonized people and a decision of the United Nations? Common sense and morality, as well as the Charter and many pronouncements of the United Nations, clearly indicate that the answer is\nThe Government of Vanuatu wishes to make it clear once again that it has no quarrel with the Government or people of Prance. It wishes Prance, and the people of that great nation, nothing but continued prosperity and success. These wishes are sincere and earnest. They are not, however, given at the expense of the people of New Caledonia or those of any other territory whose lands and resources may be coveted by a segment of the French population.\nVanuatu is New Caledonia's closest neighbour. It is also a country that has a shared colonial history with that of New Caledonia and an affinity for its people that can perhaps only be understood by other peoples who also have so much in common, Last year we, and other countries of the South Pacific were gratified by the support we received on the question of New Caledonia at the Eighth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held at Harare, Zimbabwe. We are further pleased that today, New Caledonia's colonized people continue to enjoy the support of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in their campaign to regain that which they never surrendered.\nWe were also gratified by the decision taken by the General Assembly last December to place New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Delegations may recall the atmosphere in the General Assembly in the days leading up to that decision and on the particular day the vote was taken. Delegations may also recall the things that were said and the way in which they were said.\nSome were told that New Caledonia was a part of Prance and that this matter had no business being discussed at the United Nations. Some were told that what became resolution 41/41 A was unnecessary because the Committee of 24 was going to consider the question anyway. Some were told that the countries of the South Pacific harboured irrational ill feelings towards France and did not know what they were doing. That last statement was the most incredulous of the many incredulous things that were said.\nLooking back one must wonder, if Prance was so convinced that New Caledonia was a part of France, why it conducted what it termed a referendum on the Territory's future only a few weeks ago. We will not even pose the question how and when New Caledonia became a \\\"part\\\" of France. We will save that question for another day.\nOne must also wonder why if resolution 41/41 A was so unnecessary, France still has not transmitted the information required of it under Article 73e of the Charter. On the basis of the arguments it put forward last year# one might have surmised that France intended to co-operate with the Committee of 24. Instead, the only information that has been forthcoming is the rather inaccurate statement made by the Foreign Minister of France in his address to the Assembly on 23 September 1987. With all due respect to the Foreign Minister, we do not consider a plebiscite organized without due regard for the accepted principles and practices of the United Nations to be a valid act of self-determination. This is particularly true when the colonized people boycott the entire process.\nThe result was predictable, and was predicted. Those who are French chose to remain French. We would have expected nothing else. For the most part, those who are not French did not vote.\nIs France now proposing that similar votes be organized in other areas under occupation? Could such a plebiscite turn the Golan Heights, for example, into part of Israel? By extension of this logic, might we permit South Africa to further its claim to an important part of Namibia through a little demographic engineering? In a somewhat similar vein, are we now prepared to accept France's claim to Mayotte? In the future, will we accept any large country's claim to a smaller, less populous land, simply because its people are overwhelmed numerically and, most important, militarily?\t.\nThis is the way the world operated in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and in the early part of this century before there was a United Nations Is this what we wish to return to? What France is now telling the world flies in the face of logic and United Nations precedent. It is also a radical departure from the currently accepted norm of international behaviour, and a very dangerous departure from the accepted practice of decolonization. Furthermore, we do not agree with the Foreign Minister's statement that conditions in New Caledonia during the plebiscite, \\\"... were calm and beyond dispute\\\" (A/42/PV.8, \u03c1 36). Through the eyes of television cameras, the world saw how \\\"calm\\\" things were in New Caledonia in the weeks leading up to the vote. We are as pleased as anyone that there was not more violence. However, we attribute this to the patience of the Kanak people and the intimidating presence of French military forces, which controlled the colonized population very effectively. The French military did its job very well.\nNow we, the international community, have our own mission to perform. We must continue to follow the principles and practices we established. We must continue to be faithful to our Charter and to our own histories.\nThe Committee of 24 has recommended a draft resolution which does exactly that. It is balanced and moderate in tone. We hope members will lend their support to this draft and thereby remain faithful to the United Nations' own stated values. We merely ask that the United Nations be allowed to play its customary role. What could be more reasonable?\nPrance is an important member of this body. It occupies a permanent seat on the Security Council and in other ways exercises considerable influence within and without the Organization, It should, therefore, be among the first to respect the letter and the spirit of the decisions of the world body. Being fair to those who have been colonized in New Caledonia can only enhance, rather than diminish, the prestige and glory of France.\nWe will continue to make this appeal until it is heard by France with its heart, as well as with its ears. If it is ignored, we will continue until it is heeded. Nothing will dissuade Vanuatu from this cause, other than the Kanak people themselves saying that this is no longer their cause. Vanuatu has no ulterior motive in pressing this case. We have nothing to hide, and nothing to gain, save security in the knowledge that the United Nations is still the Organization that the words of its Charter recite.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nPermit me, Sir, to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly.\nI wish to take this opportunity to express our support for the relentless efforts of the emissary of peace and goodwill, the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.\nIn a world grown cynical of the super-Powers increased arms competition and fearful of the technologies it has unleashed, the people of Israel appreciate the readiness of the United States and the Soviet Union to begin a process of nuclear disarmament. This is not just a technical accord. It is a political dictum: no longer can we find military answers to political problems. What is necessary are political answers to the military menace. The world remains divided. While on the global level the parties seem to edge slowly towards accommodation, on the regional level passion still endure.\nToday, threatening mines in international waterways are symbols not of the modernity of warfare but of its persistence. In our region, mines of extremism lurk just beneath the surface; they may explode when least expected.\nThus, we support the attempt to introduce a durable cease-fire in the Persian Gulf. In the vicinity of the world's most significant source of oil, two flames send dark clouds that obscure the horizon: the flame of fundamentalism launched to overpower moderation, and the flame of belligerency, residue of the Arab-Israeli dispute, seemingly calm, yet hardly extinguished. Each flame may reinforce the other.\nNever before was the menace of extremism so perilous; never before were the moderate forces of the Middle East, on both aides, closer to an understanding than today.\nBoth Arabs and Israelis can be at peace with themselves only if they reach peace with each other.\nFundamentalism threatens moderation. Belligerency requires resources that can help contain extremism.\nArabs are troubled by the thrust of fundamentalism as they struggle with an impossibly expensive arms race and the need to address the just expectations of a rapidly growing population. Israelis are troubled by a demography wrought by war and the need to sustain a defence posture of \\\"the few against the many\\\". That is the heavy toll of the region's flames. They can be further fuelled; they can also be put out. Our actions today can either unleash forces of yet untold destruction, or they can launch us on a course of a new promise. Israel is celebrating its fortieth anniversary; four decades studded by hostility and war. From the memories of the Holocaust we have had to build a new life, as tragic biographies merged into a history of hope. We have returned to the birthplace of our faith, to the cradle of our biblical values. The language of the Prophets now echoes with the joy of children in the mountains and valleys where it began. Deserts were turned into gardens, human talent into industries. No emergency has delayed the growth of the democratic spirit; no war has prevented the construction of a just society and a modern economy.\nThe historical analogy is inspiring: For 40 years our people wandered in the desert before Moses brought them to the promised land. Today again, after 40 years in the wilderness of belligerency, we stand at the gates of a new promise to our children and to the children of our neighbours: to live in understanding despite the differences; to determine their own fate without interference by armed forces triggered by hate.\nCan we offer them a Middle East where the intellectual challenge is man's conquest of nature, free of man's conquest of man? In brief, can we bring peace?\nWe remember the last words of Moses before he parted from his people at the gates of the promised land. We admitted his inability to provide them with adequate clothing and fresh bread, and he offered them the right of choice;\n\\\"I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore, choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live\\\". (Deuteronomy, 30:19)\nI speak with a sense of urgency, as the coming few months may be crucial.\nDuring this brief period we may begin negotiations on one of the most important issues of our day, or miss the ark of hope. This brief period may produce the long-sought-after breakthrough or be absorbed by political paralysis. \nConfidence that was built carefully, almost tacitly, among several parties in the area may evaporate. A coalition for peace held together by fragile links may fall apart with uncertain likelihood of revival.\nPresent crises - in the Persian Gulf or Lebanon - may take unexpected turns; disillusionment with the absence of progress may produce new coalitions of hostility. Thus, in the absence of a vibrant peace process, the political skies may become capricious again, bringing drought to a thirsty region.\nAgainst these prospects of uncertainty stands the unprecedented if vulnerable reality whereby relevant parties to the conflict see a way to begin negotiations. Indeed, two years ago both Arabs and Israelis announced from this podium support for the current initiative for peace. Moreover, since then further progress has been made.\nWe have rekindled our peace with Egypt and intensified the dialogue with its leaders and its people. We have found President Mubarak to be a builder of a better life for his people and of bridges for comprehensive peace in the region.\nAt the cedar groves of the mountains of Ifrane, we met courageous leadership; King Hassan of Morocco calling for peace, aloud, and clearly.\nAcross the Jordan River, rich in history and poor in water, we hear the echo of the voice of King Hussein, an experienced leader who wishes, like us, to bring our peoples out of the darkness of old hostility into the new greenhouses of peace, security and development.\nIn the West Bank and Gaza, we notice an unannounced change. Many Palestinians seem to have concluded that violence leads nowhere, that dialogue should not be postponed. There is a real readiness to negotiate in a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to solve a problem that all of us need, and would like, to solve; the Palestinian problem. \nWe have all matured politically with the repeated failure of attempts to produce peace plans for our region. We have realized that none can be acceptable as a pre-condition of negotiation, for it is the object of negotiation to produce solutions that are otherwise unattainable. Hence, over the past three years efforts have focused on the most promising plan; to begin negotiations without pre-planning their outcome.\nFive months ago those efforts crystallized and found expression in a document worked out with the support of American emissaries, whose tireless and creative efforts should be credited with much of what has been accomplished. That document reflected a meeting of minds, Arab and Jewish, on the basis of eight principles.\nFirst, the goal is peace and direct negotiations are the way to reach it. Second, an international conference is the door to direct negotiations. Once convened it should lead immediately to face-to-face bilateral negotiations. Third, the conference would not impose a settlement or veto agreements reached bilaterally. Fourth, those who would attend the conference must accept Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and renounce terrorism and violence. Fifth, negotiations would be aimed at solving the Palestinian problem in all its aspects. This would be done in negotiations between the Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and the Israeli delegation. Sixth, negotiations would be conducted independently in three bilateral-geographic committees: a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and an Israeli delegation in one\u00b7, a Syrian and an Israeli delegation in another\u00b7, and a Lebanese and an Israeli delegation in the third. All delegations, as well as an Egyptian one, would be invited to participate in a fourth, multilateral, committee. Seventh, whereas the bilateral committees would be engaged in solving the conflicts of the past, the multilateral committee would deal with the charting of opportunities for the region's future. Eighth, the five permanent members of the Security Council would serve as the matchmakers, entrusted with bringing the parties together and legitimising the process whereby the parties would negotiate freely and directly, without uninvited - and occasionally divided - external involvement. This would not be a ceremonial role but an essential one in facilitating negotiations.\nIsrael is United in its search for peace, in our desire to negotiate directly with our neighbours. We differ over how best to move the process forward. The idea of an international conference raises opposition in some Israeli quarters, while others see it as a real opening. The Israeli Cabinet is divided on the issue and has yet to make a decision. Much depends on the nature of the conference. Unless the permanent members of the Security Council respect the current consensus, rather than insisting on their old preferences, the international conference may remain just a slogan.\nWe call upon the Soviet Union to credit us with the same good faith in our efforts towards peace as we credit it within its readiness to make glasnost a way of life. The Soviet Union is not our enemy. It must be aware of our historical and family attachment to our brethren living in its land. We appeal to the new leadership in Moscow to allow the Jewish people to express their identity freely and to reunite with their destiny in the land of their ancestors.\nWe call upon the People's Republic of China, a great country that we respect, not to be timid or one-sided in its support for negotiations.\nTo both Moscow and Beijing we say candidly that diplomatic relations are not the prize for peace but a channel for communication. Those wishing to participate in bringing peace cannot confine their relations to one side in the rivalry alone.\nI should like to address myself to the Palestinian people. The time for recrimination and blame is past. They have brought only violence and terror. Now is the time to turn from violence to dialogue and to travel jointly towards a different destiny. There, your children, like ours, will live in self-respect, exercise self-expression and enjoy freedom and peace. We, who have experienced domination by others, do not wish to dominate others. We, who sought justice and security, do not wish to deny them to others.\nFor the past 40 years our ancient region has become - not by choice - a testing ground for the technology of war. Thousands of human lives, Arab and Jewish, have been tragically lost and billions of dollars have been spent to no avail.\nWe are unable to change the past but we can design a future in which our region will be able to develop into a testing ground for mobilizing science and technology, to offer a new source of growth; a future in which peace attracts economic investment; a future in which resources saved by restraining the arms race are invested in basic and higher education.\nIt is this vision of an alternative future that has given birth to the suggestion that in the wake of the opening of political negotiations an economic conference, without political strings attached, should take place. Such a conference, composed of those having a stake in regional stability and the capacity to contribute to it, could offer a most Imaginative plan for regional development.\nTo those who preach indecision, to those who take shelter in the illusion of a tranquil status quo, we say: this is our moment of choice; decisions of today will determine the fate of our people for decades to come. Our choice is between hatred and dialogue, suspicion and hope. Our choice is between investment in an arms race and investment in the well-being of our people, of our children. Our choice is between extremism and moderation, between fundamentalism and reason. It is our choice to prevent the next war.\nIt is up to us to make the months to come a time for reason.\nI welcome the forthcoming visit of Secretary Shultz to our region as an opportunity to negotiate on the remaining obstacles. I am convinced that there are no conflicts for which there is no hope for solution, only people who have best hope in their search for solutions. I am convinced that the real conflict in the Middle East today is not between Jew and Moslem\u00b7, Arab and Israeli; Palestinian and Zionist. The conflict is between \\\"past-oriented\\\" leadership and \\\"future-oriented\\\" leadership; between those resigned to the fatalism of belligerency and those determined to alter this fate. For the future of our children, for a better tomorrow, we must all stand up to the preachers of war.\nTo the advocates of destruction, United we have to say there are no holy wars, only holy human lives.\nOn the very first day of our independence I learned from my mentor, David Ben-Gurion, who said this time and again, that peace is the highest degree of security\u00b7, and that the moral call is the highest degree of wisdom. I shall remember it forever.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nAllow me, first of all, to extend to you. Sir, my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. My delegation is confident that as a statesman of distinction with well-known qualities of leadership you will guide our deliberations during this session to a successful conclusion. We are confident that this session will continue the good work and even accelerate the momentum and progress generated by the forty-first session.\nKindly permit me also to extend a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, for the efficient and dignified manner in which he presided over the forty-first session - a session that will no doubt be remembered as one of the most crucial of this body.\nI should like, finally, to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his invaluable service to this Organization and his commitment to the peace and security of the world, and the laudable efforts he continues to exert in promoting good will and understanding among all nations.\nWe find ourselves in a momentous period in the history of mankind. The dangers and challenges facing nations, individually and collectively, have been unprecedented in the last quarter in this century. Many of our countries are facing an increasingly critical economic situation as the gap between developed and developing countries continues to widen. Similarly, conflicts, disputes and a general state of instability continue to persist in many parts of the globe. We in the Gambia view these negative trends and developments as seriously endangering international peace and security.\nOnly two years ago  amid the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, the President of the Republic of the Gambia, His Excellency Alhaji Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara, unequivocally reminded us from this very rostrum that, despite the significant achievements of the United Nations in numerous fields of human endeavours, the commemoration was taking place against a background of continuing tragedies in the vast majority of developing countries. Although important strides have been made over the past two years, poverty, hunger, all forms of social injustice and wars continue to threaten the survival of millions of people around the world.\nIt is against this background that I now wish to examine, briefly, some of the economic and political issues which ought to preoccupy the attention of every delegation in this Assembly. I am of course mindful of the fact that most of the speakers who preceded me have brilliantly made detailed analyses of these issues. I shall therefore confine myself to those which need to be constantly emphasized.\nMy delegation notes with regret that the economic situation facing developing countries continues to deteriorate. The difficulties in implementing our development policies, individually and collectively, have been compounded by the continuing bleak international economic climate. This unfavourable climate is brought about by the sharp decline in the terms of trade and high interest rates together with the shortening of maturities and an increasingly heavy debt-servicing burden exacerbated by the sharp decline in the price of primary commodities. The economies of developing countries in general have continued to show negative signs of growth and, in spite of painful sacrifices made in recent years, the per capita Incomes in these countries continue to decline.\nUnderlying these trends is the evidence of the severe strain imposed by the global recession at the turn of the decade. There has also been a significant slow-down of growth in the world economy, with far-reaching consequences on international trade. In the developing countries, incentives for investment and production have sharply eroded in the wake of declining commodity prices and increased protectionism. Faced with these overwhelming odds, developing countries have suffered a serious reversal in their development efforts due to substantial loss of export earnings and mounting indebtedness. My delegation therefore firmly believes that there is need for economic preventive medication and a reassessment of the world economic situation, as it is evident that the present economic crisis works manifest injustice on all developing nations.\nIt will be recalled that the threat of a universal economic catastrophe has compelled both developed and developing countries to focus more attention on the need for close co-operation. Notwithstanding this spontaneous awareness of concerted international action to resolve contemporary global economic problems, the necessary political will is regrettably still far from adequate. Yet the worsening economic crisis, which stems from the persistent denial of the developed countries to satisfy the basic needs of the majority of mankind, constitutes the greatest threat to world peace and security. While we recognize that mankind has the vision and capacity to guarantee the maintenance of world peace and the socio-economic development of all nations, we are more than convinced that narrow self-interest are the main stumbling-block to the realization of these global objectives.\nIt is gratifying to note, however, that at the level of the African continent we have with renewed commitment embarked upon a programme of action for the dual purpose of survival and development. I am referring to the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at the special session on Africa in May of last year.\nMindful of the fact that the socio-economic progress of our continent is primarily our own responsibility, we in the Gambia, like other countries in the developing world, have been pursuing an economic recovery programme. In response to the deteriorating economic situation, in mid-1985 the Government of the Gambia adopted a comprehensive economic recovery programme aimed at laying the basis for sustained economic growth while restoring domestic and external financial equilibrium.\nThe programme aims specifically at achieving an annual growth rate of real domestic product of 3.3 per cent during the period 1986/87-1988/89, while reducing the inflation rate from 35 per cent, on an annual basis, in 1985/86 to below 10 per cent in 1988/89.\nIn the external sector, the programme's main objectives were to build up official foreign exchange reserves, reduce the large stock of external-payment arrears, normalize relations with creditors through rescheduling agreements and the timely servicing of non-schedulable obligations.\nIn pursuit of those objectives, the Government embarked on a strategy aimed both at reducing domestic absorption and promoting growth in output. To curtail inflationary pressures and restore external payments balance, the strategy emphasizes prudent demand management through appropriate fiscal, monetary, exchange-rate, pricing and external-debt policies. To develop the productive sectors, the economic recovery programme aims at promoting private initiative through the provision of appropriate price and other incentives, primarily in agriculture, manufacturing and fisheries. To achieve greater efficiency in public-sector operations, the programme calls for significant reductions in government employment, a reorganization of the civil service, rationalization and divestiture of major public enterprises, and more stringent project selection to improve the productivity of the public sector.\nSignificant progress has been made in implementing the programme, and the Gambia economic and financial performance to date has exceeded the programme's objective in many respects. Real growth in the gross domestic product in 1986/87 is estimated at 6 per cent, compared with the programme target of 3.3 per cent. At the same time, the rate of increase in the consumer price index is about 20 per cent, from 70 per cent in 1985/86. In 1986/87, the external current account, excluding official transfers, widened to about 40 million special drawing rights (SDR) - 34 per cent of the gross domestic product - or SDR 5 million above the programme target. The overall balance of payments, excluding exceptional financing, for which a deficit of SDR 20.4 million was forecast, was virtually in balance. The build-up in gross official foreign reserves plus the reduction in external payments arrears amounted to about SDR 35 million, compared with the initial programme objective of SDR 5.5 million.\nI must confess that it has been a very painful process, in view of the magnitude of the sacrifices made by our people, but we are also consoled by the fact that the results obtained so far have been encouraging.\nIt is a matter of great concern that, despite the efforts being made by our countries, the international community has not been forthcoming in providing increased flow of official development assistance to the continent and has not adequately addressed the urgent need to solve the menacing problem of Africa's indebtedness.  Our efforts to stimulate economic growth and raise the living standards of our peoples are being suffocated by the weight of debt-service obligations. Unless the devastating debt burden and the continued fall in international commodity prices be given urgent attention by the international community, our efforts to revive nr fragile economies will be futile.\nThe external debt crisis has already reached alarming proportions and, as is recognized in General Assembly resolution 41/202, adopted by consensus at the forty-first session, an integrated approach involving creditor and debtor nations, multilateral financial institutions and international private banks is necessary if durable solutions to the debt problem are to be found. The need for an international conference to tackle this problem is becoming even more pressing. The hard fact is that, although debtor countries are willing to repay their debts, they are simply unable to do so in the present economic climate. We therefore urge the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly to take a decision to convene such a conference without any further delay.\nAt this juncture I should like to commend the gestures of some countries like Canada, Great Britain, the Scandinavian countries and the Federal Republic of Germany for having decided to write off the debts of some developing countries or convert loans to grants. I appeal to the entire international donor community to focus greater attention on Africa's indebtedness and help in alleviating this terrible scourge with a view to responding more favourably to our recovery efforts and the plight of our peoples, who are yearning for a better life.\nSince my country falls within the Sahelian zone, which for more than a decade has been suffering from severe drought, I would be failing in my duty if I did not make even a passing but important observation on the need to address the issues of food security, drought control and desertification, as well as water-resources development and management. All those issues are crucial to our recovery efforts. My delegation strongly believes that if drought-stricken countries do not succeed in effectively addressing those problems - of coarse, with the full support of the international community - our objectives of increasing agricultural production and encouraging self-sufficiency in food for the total well-being of our people will elude us.\nMy delegation looks forward with great anticipation to the new round of multilateral trade negotiations agreed upon at Punta del Este, Uruguay, just a year ago. We hope the new round will bring about a significant reversal of present trends in international trade. My delegation is also gratified by the outcome of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the adoption of a Final Act which represents a significant commitment by the international community to address the most critical areas of multilateral trade in the light of the special needs of the least developed countries in Africa.\nWe take note with a large measure of encouragement of the fact that the special needs of African countries have become a major focus of attention at the annual meetings of seven industrialized nations. The recent consensus reached at Venice on Africa's indebtedness and on the need for a substantial increase in the special facility for Africa is most reassuring. It is a source of great hope and encouragement also that the eighth replenishment of the International Development Association has been accorded overwhelming support.\nWe are extremely happy to note that in his statement during the recent annual meeting of the Board of Governors of the World Bank, held in Washington, the Right honourable Nigel Lawson, Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom, stressed the point that special action was required to help the very poorest and most heavily indebted countries, particularly those of sub-Saharan Africa. We hope that this important and timely proposal will be pursued with vigour and a sense of urgency with a view to its adoption by the international donor community. \nThere is no doubt that sustained economic growth and social progress can be achieved in international relations only if everyone recognizes that our mutual interdependence makes it imperative that all nations large and small be able to participate fully in international trade and exchanges, with an underlying commitment to social justice and higher living standards.\nWhile economic questions continue to attract the attention of the vast majority of nations, serious political problems in many parts of the globe still threaten world peace and security. Among these none is more explosive than the issue of apartheid South Africa.\nApartheid is a system we all condemn, with total agreement that it should disappear; yet some of us are not merely concerned, but disturbed, that there is still disagreement as regards the adoption of a common approach to the eradication of apartheid. While we continue to have endless debates, the black majority of South Africa remains trapped in the shadow of the most brutal repression and persecution carried out by the Pretoria regime in blatant disregard of the most fundamental values and ideals on which this Organization was founded. The international community has failed to reach consensus on the comprehensive and far-reaching measures necessary to bring apartheid to an end. But the heroic masses have remained resolute in their struggle to dismantle apartheid, under the dynamic leadership of the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC), even in the face of arbitrary arrests, imprisonment without trial and indiscriminate killing of victims including religious leaders, women and children.\nMy Government strongly and unequivocally condemns the senseless massacre and the continued denial of fundamental freedoms. My delegation will hasten to participate in any substantive discussions and concerted international action to bring apartheid to its inevitable end. In the meantime, we are of the view that the only sensible means left to deal with apartheid South Africa is the imposition of mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.\nWe are also of the opinion that in order to create an atmosphere conducive to peaceful dialogue. Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners languishing in South African gaols must be released immediately and unconditionally. \nMy delegation has read with measured care the speech recently delivered in New York by Mr. George Shultz, Secretary of State of the United States, to the Business Council for International understanding\u00b7 We are of the view that that important statement on the situation in South Africa was positive in both approach and content and that it could therefore form the basis for negotiations among all interested parties in South Africa with the full participation of the ANC and the PAC. I hasten to add that if any proposed solution is to enjoy serious consideration it must have the support of the front-line States and the members of the Security Council.\nMy delegation is saddened too by the situation in neighbouring Namibia, where Pretoria remains intransigent in its defiance of the Security Council. South Africa is clearly on a collision course with disaster, having deliberately frustrated all efforts aimed at a peaceful transition to a multi-racial society. Despite our collective efforts within the framework of the Security Council to exercise authority over the Territory through the adoption of numerous resolutions. South Africa has refused with impunity to obey the Security Council on the question of self-determination and independence for Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). My delegation fully supports the imposition of mandatory sanctions within the framework of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. We are convinced that this is the most viable solution to the Namibian problem.\nWe find it disturbing that South Africa's neighbours, particularly the front-line States, have become hostages to brutal aggression and destabilization by the Pretoria regime. In that regard, my delegation strongly urges the international community to provide those nations the assistance that would guarantee their territorial integrity and independence. The unending saga of the Palestine tragedy touches the hearts of all those who believe in self-determination. My delegation believes that respect for the Palestinian quest for self-determination is a necessary pre-condition for the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. We consider the situation in the occupied Arab territories both appalling and unacceptable. It is therefore in this spirit that we consider that the convening of an international conference on the Middle East under United Nations auspices would be an important step in the search for a lasting settlement of this grave human tragedy. Such a conference can be successful only if the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) participates fully and on an equal footing with the other parties to the conflict.\nThe situation in Lebanon is another unfolding tragedy of immeasurable proportions, and one which violates all established international norms. We believe that the time has come for the people of Lebanon to live up to their national aspiration to sovereignty and territorial integrity. To this end, we call for the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanese territory and demand respect for the territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon.\nThe Gulf war between Iran and Iraq continues to be a major concern of my Government - and indeed of my President, Alhaji Sir Oawda Jawara - as the state of hostilities between the two sides drags into its eighth year and assumes catastrophic new dimensions. As Chairman of the Peace Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the President of the Gambia has, since 1984, been actively engaged in this formidable process of mediation. Recent developments in the region, however, have caused dismay and anxiety in the entire Islamic Ummah, while further seriously endangering world peace and security. We therefore welcome and applaud ongoing initiatives by the Secretary-General to bring that human tragedy to an early settlement. \nWith regard to the situation in South-East Asia, my Government fully supports the efforts being made by the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), and we maintain the view that the military occupation of Kampuchea constitutes a violation of the fundamental principles of international law embodied in the Charter. The occupation also violates the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States and the rights of the Kampuchean peoples to self-determination. The youth of that country have lived the prime of their lives under the spectre of war and repression, and should be allowed the opportunity to determine their own destiny.\nIt is regrettable that after eight years of foreign domination, and in spite of the noble efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative, Mr. Cordovez, a political settlement in Afghanistan has still not been achieved. My delegation is of the view that the only sure way of achieving a quick and amicable solution of the Afghan problem is by the unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops, based on the decision of this Assembly. We therefore urge those responsible for the continuation of hostilities to recognize the rights of the Afghans to exercise self-determination. The problem of Afghanistan is one of foreign occupation, and once the withdrawal of foreign troops is achieved the Afghan people will quickly solve their internal problems, as history has proved time and time again.\nMy delegation would like to place on record our deep appreciation to the Government of Pakistan for its constructive participation in the Geneva proximity talks and the attention given to the millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan.\nThe unification of Korea, and in the mean time the admission of both North and South Korea to the United Nations, is of particular interest to my delegation. We are convinced that dialogue between the two sides with an underlying commitment to the mutual interest of them both will help reduce tension and ultimately bring \u2014to resolution of the problem. \nAlthough it was as long ago as 1948 that the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, almost 40 years later the civil, political, economic and cultural rights of millions of people around the world continue to be denied them. We in the Gambia are of the view that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Commission on Human and People's Rights, which was recently put in place by the summit of African Heads of State and Government, should be an adequate representation of the conscience of all nations. Our responsibilities in the field of human rights transcend the narrow limits of economic self-interest and political expediency. Our task is to uphold and promote the rights of peoples wherever they may be violated, threatened or otherwise compromised.\nMy delegation is of the strong opinion that the time has now come to put an end to the denials of life and liberty and to the inhuman suffering which is the lot of millions of innocent human beings all over the world. We in the Gambia, under the leadership of President Alhaji Sic Dawda Kairaba Jawara, are firmly committed to the protection of and respect for human rights. This is a commitment which is built upon the solid foundation of our domestic laws and which is a major determinant of our foreign policy.\nRespect for fundamental human rights, the corner-stone of Gambian democracy, is also the catalyst of our socio-economic development, for we firmly believe that only in an atmosphere of freedom and security can the individual effectively contribute to the collective good of all. Indeed, the struggle against colonialism, oppression and racism is yet another attempt to raise the level of human dignity.\nThis is the backdrop against which the forty-second session of the General Assembly is being held. It is a period of unprecedented economic uncertainty, in which the gap between rich and poor continues to widen; it is a time of political crises in many parts of the world, when the peace  however fragile, that has prevailed since the founding of the United Nations is seriously threatened. But there is some degree of hope of overcoming these difficulties, since those who genuinely desire peace outnumber the forces of evil. And, because of our collective desire to seek peaceful solutions to the global problems we face, we still have the United Nations, whose machinery can be strengthened and better used, together with our regional organizations, inspired by the quest for development and peace, to translate ideas into action for the common good of humanity. However, I hasten to add that the United Nations can have little concrete impact so long as some members of the international community continue to view the abominable global problems in the narrow perspective of economic, political or strategic self-interest.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI begin by warmly congratulating you, Mr. President, on the well-earned honour done to you in electing you to this lofty post at the forefront of the work of the General Assembly, which is now holding its forty-second session in a climate of great worldwide expectations prompted by the scale of the problems that are of concern to mankind and by the historical dynamics that particularly affect certain parts of the world where ideological, political and military confrontations have attained extremely dangerous, even dramatic, levels.\nPeace is the key to the concerns we all share. The most relevant example in that respect has been set by the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whose tireless devotion to the search for peaceful means of resolving truly difficult conflicts deserves our appreciation and respect. These are sentiments we express with admiration and gratitude.\nPeace is the key to our destiny as a species and as individual nations. Indeed, at this stage in history it is no longer possible to make clear-cut distinctions between mankind as a whole and each of its components, however geographically small they may be.\nFor a long time, although this was not an ideal state of affairs, individuals and peoples were able to live aloof from one another, particularly with respect to more local problems and disputes. Today that is not possible. We cannot talk realistically now even about the East-West conflict or the North-South conflict. The world is so intimately interconnected that it is truer than ever before that \\\" to paraphrase John Donne - when the bell tolls, it tolls for all. However, when the bells, for some commendable reason, ring out in time, then we are entitled to share a legitimate feeling of pleasure.\nIn Central America, after years in which the bells have been tolling for death, fear, injustice and the lack of understanding, we now hear, another sound, one which gives us the firm hope that, if the necessary efforts are made in the appropriate spirit, we shall attain that peace which would mean our survival as free nations. That is what our peoples have been clamouring for. It is what our Governments are endeavouring to attain, on the basis of their faith in authentic participatory, pluralistic and United democracy.\nOn 7 August, the five Presidents of Central America, in an audacious, deliberate and Ear-sighted gesture, signed an agreement that, is historic not merely because of the extremely grave problems it tackles in a profound and effective fashion but also because it represents the first expression since independence was achieved in 1821 - when a similar feat was accomplished - of a United and indivisible commitment that undoubtedly constitutes the embryo of a new sense of Central Americanism. And it is not rhetorical but practical since it will, we hope, result in an indivisible consolidation of our economic, social, cultural and political future.\nThe document to which we refer bears a title that reflects the spirit in which it was conceived - \\\"Procedures for establishing a firm and lasting peace in Central America\\\". The document, known as Esquipulas II, represents a programme for peace - a firm and lasting peace, a real peace. President Duarte, who played a decisive role in shaping the spirit and scope of this document, therefore insists on talking of peace, working for peace and holding dialogues about peace. The greatness of this joint achievement of the peoples and Governments of Central America derives from the fact that we have overcome warlike mentalities - which external ideological forces imposed upon us - and have emerged with a clear concept of peace that incorporates respect, security and mutual trust.\nWe ate not, however, naive. We understand the enormous risks and snares that the eternal enemies of democracy are laying in our path, but we cannot wrap ourselves in obstructionist pessimism. We sincerely want peace, and we are struggling to achieve it, day by day, fulfilling the provisions of Esquipulas II and, within our country, adopting all those measures that would make possible the inclusion of irregular groups in democratic life. This would not breach the constitutional provisions the Salvadoran people have provided for themselves in full freedom and in a climate of sound political life that incorporates respect, guarantees and pluralism.\nPeace is at hand.\nIn El Salvador, we have had to fight off treacherous, systematic and implacable aggression. At first, practically alone, we fought heroically against the territorial onslaughts that threatened, and indeed continue to threaten, our institutional life and the heritage of our people built up over many decades of persistent national endeavour. The world gradually came to recognize the essentially democratic nature of our struggle. Since 1980, we have travelled a hard path strewn with obstacles, and in doing so our people and its legitimate Government have created and strengthened a series of political, economic and social structures, enabling us to ensure that democracy has taken root deep in our soil.\nThat is why subversion in El Salvador has lost its historical reason for being. On 1 June our Government completed an intensive exercise, and in his annual address President Duarte informed the nation of the final, definitive establishment of the institutional framework for consolidating the necessary climate of guarantees that makes possible the involvement of the insurgents in a social and legal framework that is just and truly democratic. That framework is made up of laws that strengthen the rule of law and due process and do not allow for excuses, rejection or challenge.\nThere is no longer a state of emergency. There is a renewed framework of justice which, supplemented by the amnesty law soon to be enacted, meets all aspirations for freedom. Agricultural reform has already been established. There is reliable and secure electoral registration. Elections are scheduled for 1988 to buttress the system and, above all, the people and Government are determined faithfully to attain its objectives. For these reasons, and because of the certainty that it only through internal reform that we can meet the requirements of peace and democracy, we undertook to respect all the commitments of Esquipulas II. And for that reason, and in that sense, the insurgents must irrevocably accept the Esquipulas plan as well and return to democracy and civilian life once and for all.\nThe people of El Salvador have been pioneers of freedom since 5 November 1811, when the first cry for emancipation was uttered in Central America in the city of San Salvador. At the same time, we have been pioneers of unity. In circumstances a thousand times more challenging, destiny has once again placed us in the vanguard of the defence of freedom. We accept that challenge with a sense of responsibility. We are meeting it at great cost but in the certainty that our endeavour will bear fruit not only for our own people but equally for other peoples of the area, to which we feel intimately linked.\nMy Government has had to fight on many fronts - national and international. The tenacity and historic endeavours of the Government, under President Jose Napoleon Duarte, have been reflected in a series of measures and achievements ranging from the struggle for respect for human rights to full freedom of political expression for all the forces included in the peaceful legal process) from a vast programme of economic and social development to benefit society's poorer majority to the promotion of a new sense of citizenship that is demanding and vigilant but at the same time altruistic and imbued with a sense of solidarity from the progressive development of our democratic institutions to the orderly elimination of all remnants of the authoritarianism that had infiltrated various levels of the state and social systems of the country.\nHuman rights and freedom of expression in their fullest sense have been of particular concern to President Duarte. The improvement and strengthening of all policies to safeguard human rights reflect a trend and a commitment in El Salvador, since we consider that enjoyment of and respect for human rights underpin democracy in El Salvador.\nThis enormous endeavour, involving the entice people, sets us face to face with the most serious and urgent challenge of all - that of building peace, and doing so on the only possible scaffolding, that of democracy, because democracy is the key to peace. This is so clear and incontrovertible that it cannot be negotiated, belittled or distorted. \nHence, that dialogue for peace called for by President Duarte for Sunday next, 4 October, in the Apostolic Nunciature of San Salvador, with the insurgent groups, is a dialogue in accordance with Esquipulas II, a dialogue fervently desired by the Salvador an people and supported by all the free peoples of the world. It is a dialogue within the framework of an active, serious, solid and energetic democracy, one that can accommodate all trends of thought, even those of an extreme nature, provided that they respect the rule of law and the universal rules underlying any authentic process of social coexistence.\nThe Government of El Salvador has put all its cards on the table. President Duarte, with the same conviction and with the same care with which, as one of its principal architects, he signed Esquipulas II, will talk with the insurgents, who have explicitly accepted the content and scope of that document. The present context of the dialogue with those groups is clear. They will talk about peace, not war. They will consolidate the democratic process, not destabilize it. That is the spirit and the letter of the document the Central American presidents signed with such hope and such realism. That is the purpose of President Duarte and his Government, and it is fully consistent with the wishes of all Salvador ans.\nPeace is at hand. Within that over-all perspective, and in order to ensure that the commitments set out in Esquipulas II become a reality, my country has, from the outset, sought to ensure that the problems in our region shall be approached in an over-all, simultaneous, multilateral, verifiable and universally accepted fashion.\nSuch an approach must be comprehensive, because to achieve stable, effective agreements it is necessary to take into account not merely the complex roots of the conflict but also its present ramifications. What in the past might have been basically an internal matter has taken on international overtones, and it is impossible to continue to insist upon its original internal nature. \nThe agreements must be simultaneous, for if the comprehensive approach of the document is to be effective, in the light, of the indivisible, global nature of the issues, the agreements must be carried out according to the schedule set by the signatory Governments or, in view of the nature of the measures to be adopted, at a basic, uniform tempo if no specific deadlines are set.\nThe agreements must be multilateral because all the Central American Governments, without exception or pretext, are committed to finding solutions and to fostering commitments in a responsible and sincere spirit.\nThey must be verifiable, because Esquipulas II is a historic agreement of mutual trust, adopted in good faith, setting in motion a process for dismantling in a peaceful and harmonious fashion all the structures and machinery of distrust, suspicion and aggression which the sickly spirit of war has unfortunately nurtured in our region.\nThey must be universally acceptable because the Latin American spirit that inspired the document, enshrined in the Contadora process, and the clear and determined commitment of the five nations that are calling for autonomy and a shared destiny, imply that Esquipulas II must be respected and accepted as a unique and harmonious whole by the international community and, first and foremost, by Latin America. This implies, inter-alia, unqualified acceptance by all of the rejection of violence\u00b7, the discrediting and unacceptability of insurgent groups, which should rather have recourse to amnesty and disarmament' the acceptance of democracy as the sole path towards legitimate power in the region\u00b7, and other natural actions that must be adopted by some countries directly or indirectly involved in the peace plan.\t.\nI should like to express my Government's appreciation for the words of support received from all the Governments of Latin America and the world, which we consider to have been made in the aforementioned spirit. We were recently saddened, nevertheless, to heat one dissident voice that seemed to go counter to our endeavours. I am referring to statements made by Cuba, which, in a broad series of comments, made discordant remarks that seemed to contradict its expressions of support for Esquipulas II, in particular with regard to efforts made by my Government to halt an armed conflict that no longer has any justification. Does Cuba support the clear and unobjectionable joint endeavours of the people and Government of El Salvador, who are obviously struggling for freedom and dignity in that country, out of respect for the humanistic and sacred principles of Bolivar, Marti and Juarez? Or is Cuba continuing its unconditional support - counter to the spirit and Letter of Esquipulas II - for the inhuman terrorists and insurgents still operating in El Salvador, who have brought so much bloodshed and grief to our long-suffering people through their reprehensible acts, their criminal laying of mines and their irrational destruction?\nWe call upon Cuba to respect the sovereign will expressed in the peace agreement, to accept it unconditionally and openly, honestly and comprehensively. We call upon Cuba to stop the exporting of revolutions and to refrain from providing logistic and material support to the insurgents in El Salvador.\nSimilarly, we consider that there must be an adequate international response to the call from the peoples of Central America to the international community to provide the resources that can truly safeguard a firm and lasting peace. Without such assistance and material support in overcoming the social crises that are undeniable components of our conflicts, it will not be possible to realize the ideal of a life of permanent freedom and democracy to which our societies aspire, We are realistic. We knew that the eradication of the underlying causes of the crisis can be achieved only through the elimination of marginalization and underdevelopment, for tomorrow, God willing, we may achieve peace; the following\nday, however, a new and acute source of destabilization could arise \u2013 regional destabilization caused not by the lack of peace or freedom but rooted in the hunger and critical poverty currently afflicting our peoples.\nWe therefore make a fervent appeal to the international community to assist us so that Esquipulas II can become a reality. That document places upon the signatory Governments the following obligations; in the climate of freedom guaranteed by democracy, the Central American countries shall adopt such agreements as will help to speed up development, in order to make their societies more egalitarian and free from misery.\n\\\"The strengthening of democracy entails creating a system of economic and social well-being and justice. To achieve these goals, the Governments shall jointly seek special economic assistance from the international community.\\\" (A/42/521, pp. 7-8) \nPeace is at hand.\nIt was not by happenstance that Central America found itself in the explosive situation that we are today defusing, with the understanding of all the nations of the world. A full-scale plan of international subversion was set in motion to take advantage of our weaknesses, shortcomings and past errors, but that plan failed to take into account two essential factors that made possible the current positive developments in the crisis: The first is the determination of our peoples - who are simple, but endowed with exemplary stoicism and age-old wisdom - to enjoy the benefits and opportunities of freedom, without sophistry or affectation. The second factor is the support of the international community in the attainment of solutions which, safeguarding democracy and the rule of law, will make possible equitable social development for all in our communities, who yearn so for progress and justice.\nThe lesson has been a cruel and painful one, but our hope has remained unshaken: the hope that we shall emerge from this time of trial, which has made us Central Americans fully aware that notwithstanding all the marginal disagreements we are United, not merely in our past, but also in our present and our future.\nWe are pacifists by calling, by loyalty and by experience. In that context of feelings and ideals, the foreign policy of El Salvador has contributed - and contributes increasingly - to the strengthening of regional and international peace and security in all spheres. That policy adheres to the principles and norms governing friendly relations among States.\nAs tangible proof of the principles that guide and define our foreign policy, I am pleased to note the considerable progress made with respect to the peaceful settlement of the border dispute with Honduras, both in terms of the proceedings before the International Court of Justice, to which both countries have turned in a spirit of harmony, and in terms of the technical work of demarcation in the border areas delimited by the 1980 peace treaty. With respect to the Court's proceedings, my Government reaffirms its unequivocal willingness to comply with the Court's decision. That shows the commitment to peace which is the most evident example of the way we wish to see relations among Central American countries develop.\nEl Salvador, like the majority of countries represented here, is sometimes frustrated and concerned to see that many international incidents, far from showing signs of a peaceful solution, seem to be getting worse and more deeply rooted. But I must say that we have faith and hope that the remaining international disputes can be resolved through sincere dialogue aimed at creating conditions conducive to the political understandings necessary for peace.\nEl Salvador knows that the solution to today's problems and conflicts must be approached and achieved in the light of the pre-eminence of political will, tolerance, wisdom and respect. Only in that way can we make secure progress towards true international justice, guaranteeing the well-being and survival of mankind.\nIn that respect we welcome the mediating efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whom we fully support in his arduous task of trying to help resolve the dispute between Iran and Iraq. We appeal to the parties to the dispute to respect the resolutions of the Security Council and, as we in Central America are now doing, to engage in dialogue in a climate of reason in which mutually beneficial agreements can be adopted.\nLikewise, El Salvador, with respect for and in full observance of the norms of international law, considers that the question of Korea must be resolved by peaceful means, through resumed dialogue and negotiations between South Korea and North Korea.\nPeace is at hand.\nIt will be appreciated that El Salvador is a country all of whose energies are devoted to the achievement and maintenance of world and regional peace. If the little word \\\"peace\\\" has been uttered often in this statement it is because, for us, it is not merely a lofty aspiration; it is a spiritual commitment that supports and encourages us even in the worst circumstances. Our country is small, poor and long-suffering, but today it stands at one of the focal points of modern history. We have thus emerged from anonymity to play a leading role in one of the great battles of our time. We know that is a role we must take on with bravery and dignity.\nThe coming 5 November is an important multiple anniversary for Central America: 90 days after the signing of the Esquipulas II agreement, the five basic peace commitments will enter into force simultaneously in the five countries. On 5 November 1811, in the church of La Merced at San Salvador, the first cry for Central American independence was heard.\nThe coincidence on that great day of events associated with independence, pacifism, freedom and nationhood prompts me to invite my fellow Foreign Ministers of the Executive Committee to meet on that date at San Salvador, in keeping with the schedule of meetings, so that we can be first-hand witnesses to the crucial moment and jointly declare to the world the entry into force of these long-awaited agreements, in an act of historic responsibility and political will befitting the occasion. If this takes place, we should thus be able on 7 November to report to our regional organization, the Organization of American States, on the success of this great regional endeavour.  I affirm that we never have evaded and never shall shirk this enormous challenge  in which freedom and democracy are at stake. I am sure that I speak for all Salvadorians when I say to this Assembly - from which we seek a resolution unequivocally supporting Esquipulas II - that El Salvador will continue to work for peace and harmony, with good faith and hope.\nMindful that we have made progress and that peace is at hand, we shall fully and unswervingly implement all the agreements undertaken in Esquipulas II, in the hope that the other countries will do the same, honouring their word and their dignity.\nWe hope our humble contribution will help the free, just and humane world we all want become an increasingly tangible reality for all the peoples of the earth. \n \n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is my pleasure to congratulate the President on his election at this forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. His election reflects the personal esteem he enjoys and reinforces the role of his country in supporting international efforts and strengthening the bonds of international co-operation. I am convinced that his competence will be an effective factor in enabling the General Assembly to conclude its work in the best possible manner. He has always been recognized in United Nations circles as one of its most prominent personalities.\nI should like to take this opportunity also to express to Mr. Humayun Choudhury, the President of the General Assembly at its forty-first session and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, our deep appreciation of his effective role in dealing with the various problems that occurred, including the administrative and financial crisis that faced the United Nations, as well as his role in helping the United Nations to emerge, at the end of that session, stronger in our conscience and in the conscience of the nations of the world.\nIn this respect, I should like to reiterate our appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who worked, and is still working, with sincerity and diligence, to solve the internal problems of the United Nations and guide its international efforts towards the achievement of its basic objectives. He does so with impartiality, objectivity, and a sense of the great responsibility he shoulders, and we support him in his efforts. \nThe foreign policy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a country that embraces the religion of Islam and applies the tolerant Islamic shariah, is implemented on the basis of the principles upon which the United Nations was founded and the noble objectives for which its Charter was promulgated, these being a reaffirmation of what Islamic law stipulates for the conduct of international relations. As the Custodian of the Two Holy Places, King Fahd bin Abdul-Aziz noted, in an address he delivered on the eve of Saudi Arabia's National Day last week, that Islamic belief is an integral doctrine which is based on mercy, compassion, solidarity, brotherhood and mutual respect and is devoid of oppression, deceit and treachery.\nOn this basis, we reaffirm our determination to work in support of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, as they are the proper framework for co-operation between nations and peoples and the effective means for settling conflicts between States.\nThe United Nations has established rules of conduct for relations between nations and States as laid down in the Charter, and its universality has given that framework the force of a legal commitment in all aspects of world concerns. There is no dimension of human endeavour in which the Organization does not forge a constructive role and strive to keep pace with the tremendous scientific, technological and economic strides that have been made in the twentieth century. This development has reduced differences between peoples and bridged the chasm between States. It has narrowed the gaps between communities and opened wide the door to international co-operation, so that the United Nations, through all its agencies, bodies and branches, has become a basic, indispensable element in Saudi Arabia) international affairs, while its fundamental objectives challenge the ability of its Members to give effect to the purposes and principles of the Charter.\nThe basic demand of the peoples of the world today is for peace and stability. The use of war as a means of resolving conflicts is totally rejected. There is no doubt, however, that continued success in this direction must be linked to a commitment by Member States to the letter and spirit of the Charter. Such commitment is the only guarantee of the realization of international peace and security, because it guarantees the establishment of normal, fair and balanced relations among all States, irrespective of their size, location, military strength or political, economic and social regime. Perhaps one of the most formidable challenges confronting the United Nations today concerns the wide gap between commitment to the principles of the Charter and the actual behaviour of States in their international relations, especially those States, such as Israel and South Africa, that persist in aggression, oppression, terrorism and discrimination. Should the Organization fail to take timely, definitive and responsible action, it will jeopardize its credibility and its effectiveness in ensuring the commitment of its Members to the Charter and the purposes and principles it set out therein.\nIn seeking improved co-operation, we should take account of recent experience and consider the obstacles that face the United Nations and hamper the prospects of greater co-operation, which is vital for peace, stability and growth. The countries whose practices violate the Charter must bear the full responsibility for creating those obstacles. Hence, we should consider the means set forth in the Charter for dealing with these violations. \nThe insistence upon aggression, violation of the principles of the Charter and rejection of the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council pose a challenge to the Charter which should prompt us to act firmly to secure compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter. Reluctance to do so indicates an abdication of responsibility and abandonment of one of the most fundamental principles of the Charter. In addition to a substantial series of international violations of and acts of aggression against the rights and freedoms of peoples, we also have before us a long list of economic and social problems that still await wise remedies based on a sense of communal responsibility and a balanced approach to co-operation, matched by a sense of commitment to the moral and legal responsibilities which all of us should respect and fulfil.\nWe face this year, as we have faced for the past 40 years, the question of Palestine and the Middle East and the core of that conflict, the question of Al Quds Al Sharif, which arise from Israeli aggression against Arab lands, the Arab inhabitants of Palestine and other peoples in the neighbouring Arab countries, as well as aggression against the Islamic nations and the Islamic Ultima, especially in Al Quds \u041b1 Sharif, the first kibla and third Holiest Shrine. We do not believe that any problem or issue has become clearer and more evident in all its aspects to the whole world than has the problem of Palestine. There is no problem in which wrong challenges right every day more clearly than in the case of the problem of Palestine. The United Nations has never before faced such a challenge to its will and such an assault upon its Charter as it has faced, and continues to face, through the persistence of Zionist aggression against the Arab people within and outside Palestine. The tragic circumstances and sad situation from which Lebanon is suffering constitute one of the acute consequences of this problem.\nPeace is the demand of all humanity today, peace based on justice, and justice is the foundation of stability and the basis for its continuation. But the objective of peace has become the victim of those that reject it. Israel has spaced no effort to thwart peace initiatives. It has persisted in aggression and its concerted effort to disrupt the possibility of peace. It has become evident that peace can be established in our region only through recognition of the inalienable, legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.\nIsrael's obstinacy and persistent attempts to disrupt peace Initiatives in order to gain time to achieve its objectives and designs will lead only to more trouble and to consequences that will increase the difficulty of solving the problem, with all the consequent risks and dangers. There is no clearer proof of this than Israel's deliberate attempts to put obstacles and difficulties in the path of the efforts aimed at convening an international conference.\nIt is hardly necessary for me to reaffirm here that no attempt to find a solution can be successful unless it includes the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, as a party and a factor in negotiations and dialogue. The Arab countries fulfilled their historical responsibility to ensure peace and made the best offer they could for the establishment of peace and stability in the region when they announced their framework for the peace process In the historic decision in Fez in 1982, which emphasized the Arab consensus on peace based upon justice. In accordance with international law and in compliance with the international will as represented by United Nations resolutions. \nThe war between Iraq and Iran, which has entered its eighth year, has assumed new dimensions which threaten the security of the region and world peace. Developments of recent months carry ominous overtones as to what continued opposition to end the war might lead and in what continued disregard of conventions and international resolutions to put an end to it might result. We call for the termination of this destructive war afflicting the Iraqi and Iranian peoples, not only for the sake and in the interests of all peoples, but also for the sake of the peace and stability of the region and the preservation of the vital interests of the countries of the region. Those who work for its continuation are sacrificing the basic interests of the Iraqi and Iranian peoples and exposing the region and world peace to the gravest dangers.\nIran continues to extend its war with Iraq to non-participants by arrogating to itself the right to attack non-belligerent countries, assault the interests of other countries, and threaten international navigation in the Gulf. This perverted and dangerous logic is the main reason for the instability, extreme tension, and deplorable deterioration of the situation in the Gulf region. If Iran assumes the right to attack countries not parties to the conflict, then it is only natural that each country in the region has the full right to defend itself against aggression.\nThe continuation of the conflict and the threats by which Iran attempts to extend its scope in the Gulf region, going so far as to attack ships of other countries which are not parties to the conflict, and its continuous threats to the freedom of navigation in the Gulf are the cause of the presence of international fleets in the Gulf waters. At their meeting in Tunisia the Arab Foreign Ministers unanimously asked Iran not to make its actions the cause for drawing international conflict to the region but, rather, for establishing peace and security therein. It also called on all peace-loving nations of the world to urge Iran to accept the will of the international community to end its war with Iraq quickly. \nWe take this opportunity to call upon Iran, again, from this international forum, to refrain from acts of aggression and threats against the Arab Gulf countries and to take part in the quest to establish peace and stability in the region \u2014 a responsibility of the countries of the region and the States Members of the United Nations.\nWhile expressing our appreciation for Iraq's position and readiness to halt the war and terminate the conflict in accordance United Nations resolutions, I should also like to reiterate the support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for Security Council resolution 598 (1987) , which provides for the peace and security of the parties to the conflict and regional and international stability. The Arab countries have unanimously supported that resolution and urged the United Nations and the Secretary-General to intensify their endeavours and assume their responsibilities to implement it.\nIt is regrettable that the Iranian response - in the statement delivered by the President of Iran a few days ago - to that resolution and United Nations efforts aimed at putting an end to the war and establishing peace completely closes the door on those attempts and destroys hopes for an end to the tragic and destructive war. This requires that the United Nations take a firm decisive stand by securing the necessary measures to implement the aforementioned resolution, also it requires that the Security Council, in particular, take a decision without delay to implement resolution 598 (1987) which includes the imposition of sanctions against the party that does not implement that resolution in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\nIran was not content just with its war with Iraq - a war which went on to spread disruption and chaos in the region, exposing the area to the risks of foreign intervention and, ultimately, propelling it into an international conflict - but has also threatened the security and stability not only of its Arab neighbours but of those outside the Gulf as well. It has missed no opportunity during the past few years to demonstrate hostility towards those countries. It carried out destructive activities in the State of Kuwait and launched its rockets against fully populated civilian areas. It placed mines in the Gulf waters and helped push the region into a storm of hostility and turmoil. The Iranian regime has become a unique case in rejecting international conventions and violating laws, norms and traditions that guide the international community, as well as deviating from the proper course of diplomatic relations. There is no clearer evidence of that than the Iranian authorities' violation of the sanctity of the Saudi and Kuwaiti embassies in Tehran, their flagrant occupation, plunder and destruction of those premises, and the mistreatment of their staff resulting in the death of a Saudi diplomat.\nIslam is completely alien to such an approach and all those practices. Never since the light of guidance accompanied the Message of the prophet Mohammed - may peace and the blessing of God be upon him - has Islam been a source of extremism and terrorism. This just religion has never been one of intolerance, hate and fanaticism, but one of openness, tolerance and goodwill among all peoples.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has tried during the past eight years to maintain normal relations with Iran in the hope of preserving links and maintaining good-neighbourliness; it has tolerated many acts and provocations against itself and its people. But Iran has missed no opportunity during those years to demonstrate a hostile attitude towards the Kingdom and the Arab Gulf countries.\nIt is regrettable that the President of Iran, from this international rostrum, made allegations against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that he knows, and we know, are untrue, and which evidence has proved false. It is also regrettable that the President of a country with a civilization steeped in the roots of history and whose Muslim population has always been a stronghold Of Islam and a builder of civilization has come to list in this international forum, which represents the world's conscience, a series of falsifications and mischievous accusations in clear defiance of the tolerant principles of Islam and the noble and original ethics of the Iranian people, and in flagrant violation and disregard of the values and norms of Islam. \nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was, and still is, careful to keep the differences between Islamic countries in their proper Islamic context. It has always dealt with these problems guided by the teachings of its just Islamic religion, avoiding demagoguery and vituperation. On that basis, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believes that the complete isolation and unanimous Arab and Islamic condemnation of Iran today is the proper response to such false allegations and practices, because allegation and falsification cannot remove the evidence of the horrendous crime that the Iranian authorities committed in Mecca, in the vicinity of the Holy Mosque of God, during the Holy Month. It is a sacred shrine that represents the Great Islamic Symbol which hearts yearn for. This atrocious crime took place not in the dark or in secret, but under the eyes and ears of millions of Muslims.\nAll the Islamic countries and institutions, organizations and centres - indeed, the whole world community - have condemned these criminal acts by Iran. We hope that the international reaction, and particularly the Islamic reaction, will make the Iranian leaders realize that they cannot convince people by force, terrorism and violence. They can get their message across only by becoming advocates of peace, brotherhood and kindness, the objectives whose core and foundation represent the real message of Islam, inspired by the divine revelation: \\\"Invite (all) to the Way Of thy Lord with wisdom And beautiful preaching}\nAnd argue with them In ways that are best And most gracious:\nFor thy Lord knoweth best.\nWho have strayed from His Path,\nAnd who receive guidance.\\\" (The Holy Koran, XVI: 125)\nWe were optimistic after the last session that there would be a just solution to the problem of Afghanistan. However, it is regrettable that the situation still remains the same. The foreign occupation is still continuing, and the Muslim Afghan people are struggling with all the means at their disposal, sacrificing the blood of their sons in defence of their religion and homeland, and sustaining the most extreme difficulties in order to resist the occupation, demanding withdrawal from their land and the establishment of a governmental system which Is acceptable to them.\nWhile we reaffirm our fullest support for the just struggle of the Mujahidin, we still look forward to a positive response from the Soviet Union, a super-Power, to United Nations decisions, the decisions of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the appeals of the world for a quick withdrawal from Afghanistan, a free and independent country throughout history.\nWhile we support the efforts of the United Nations to arrive at an acceptable solution which can guarantee the return of all the refugees to their homes, non-interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and the preservation of Islamic identity, we still hope that should such a solution become possible, the relations between the two neighbouring countries - the Soviet Union and Afghanistan - will evolve into relations of good-neighbourliness and mutual respect.\nWe also take this opportunity to reiterate our appreciation of the important role played by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the sacrifices being borne by its people in hosting more than 3.5 million Afghan refugees on its soil, despite the economic and security burdens Pakistan is trying to shoulder. We call upon the nations of the world to co-operate with Pakistan in this great effort. \nThe problem of Namibia and the racist policy adopted by South Africa are among the issues that we greatly care about, and they fall within the realm of the responsibilities we share with the African nations. On this basis, we call upon the international community of the United Nations to intensify its efforts to end the era of apartheid and colonialism in that part of the world.\nThe co-operation and alliance between the Zionist regime in Palestine and the Pretoria regime in South Africa, which are united by similar designs and common means and ideas, puts a double responsibility on the United Nations to implement the requirements of its Charter, as well as on Member States to be committed to their obligation to end the era of oppression, apartheid, violation of international conventions and the use of brute force against peaceful peoples.\nSouth Africa's attacks on neighbouring African States will only increase the isolation of this racist regime, and will not save it from the final reckoning which is the ultimate fate of all oppressors. \nWe in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stand by the African States, with which we are linked by the closest historic, religious and geographic ties, in their firm rejection of the policy of South Africa and in demanding full independence for Namibia. We call for firm implementation of the resolutions on an economic and political boycott of the Pretoria regime, until the Pretoria Government adheres to the decisions of the United Nations. We also deplore the close alliance between South Africa and Israel, whether overt or covert, in the economic, nuclear, strategic and political fields.\nEconomic problems are still among the most important obstacles to international understanding, at a time when they should be among the most important bridges for co-operation between nations. It is regrettable that last year was no better than the year before, because, despite the recent attempts in this respect, economic recovery is still facing concrete obstacles, and the international monetary system is still suffering from many problems. The instability of exchange rates is also causing a substantial disruption in the economies of the developing countries in particular. Moreover, the decline in the prices of raw materials in the developing countries, despite the rise in the prices of manufactured products imported by them from industrial countries, is a serious obstacle to their development and to the growth of international trade. The continuation of protectionist trends in some industrial countries is also increasing the difficulties confronting the expansion of international trade.\nOn the other hand, the attempts to activate the negotiations between North and South are also still stumbling. The developing countries are facing increased difficulties in meeting the responsibilities of development, because the fully developed countries have not adequately done their duty to co-operate with them in solving their problems. We all know that a large number of the developing countries inherited their economic burdens and the consequences of economic backwardness from foreign regimes which occupied their land and managed their affairs until their independence, achieved over the past 40 years.\nIn this regard we look forward to a strengthening of the role of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in addressing the problems I have referred to in a manner that enhances the solution of monetary problems and facilitates and frees international trade by removing the impediments and obstacles that have caused the developing countries to suffer, in order to arrive at a fair adjustment between developing nations and the fully developed ones. The collective responsibility for solving these problems should be reaffirmed, to avoid confrontations which we know would ultimately lead to further problems, whether in the economic or the political field.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has always been careful to fulfil its commitments and carry out its obligations within the collective responsibility for the economic stability and development of the world. We hope to continue this, with the co-operation of other countries. We have always called for a revival of North-south negotiations and the exertion of persistent efforts in dealing with the economic problems facing the developing countries.\nThe recent Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development provoked great interest, because the two subjects have a direct bearing upon International peace and security, while both are linked to the development and welfare of nations. We reaffirm that development, by the momentum it creates, and disarmament, with its wide-ranging consequences, are two important and effective factors in ensuring stability; removing the fears and doubts that separate nations and channelling the potential of nations towards ends more beneficial than the acquisition of weapons of slaughter and destruction. If this is to be possible there must be a sense of international responsibility in all countries working towards the elimination of the causes of oppression and tyranny to which we have referred and of the causes of injustice suffered by all peoples vulnerable to occupation and aggression. The diversion of the potential of nations, whether financially stable or not, from military to economic production will increase the possibilities for international co-operation in all its forms.\nAs we start a new year in the calendar of the United Nations, we look forward to a new era of international co-operation in solving the political and social problems that go beyond the narrow confines of each State. We look forward to overcoming the obstacles and difficulties facing international co-operation in the attempts to solve problems and guide the international community to advanced stages of co-operation that will lead to political and economic stability and enable all of us to face the challenges of the future with confidence and optimism.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. I am convinced that your experience and diplomatic skill will help you lead this session to a successful conclusion. I am also pleased to note that you represent a country with which Finland enjoys good and constructive co-operation.\nI wish to express the appreciation of the Finnish Government to your predecessor in the presidency. His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, for the most valuable work he did in presiding over the General Assembly at its forty-first session. The Finnish Government supports the determined efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar, for the benefit of our Organization. In the midst of its difficulties, the Organization has demonstrated the ability to resist the erosion of its authority. But that is not enough; the trend must be reversed. The General Assembly now has a particular responsibility to adopt decisions that will make it possible again for the United Nations to play the unique role its founding fathers had in mind when they drafted the Charter over 40 years ago. In that work, the annual report of the Secretary-General is a welcome harbinger of renewed faith. \nWe all agree that awesome challenges In the areas of security and disarmament and economic and social development as well as human rights call for action. In practice, however, agreement on strategies and concrete measures often remains beyond our reach. Perceiving the national interest in an antagonistic manner is contradictory to collective security. For more than four decades the United Nations has stood at the centre of efforts to accommodate both the legitimate interests of sovereign nations and the requirements of collective security.\nFinally, after years of fear and frustration, a positive change appears to be on the way in big-Power relations. The recent agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union on crisis control, on nuclear-arms reduction and on a summit meeting seem to open a window of opportunity that should be fully utilized. A process leading to a diminished role for nuclear as well as conventional weapons in the maintenance of peace and security is indeed evolving. The momentum should not be neglected. The emerging agreement on intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) is historic because it actually reduces existing nuclear arsenals. Its impact is felt especially in Europe, here progress is needed in the reduction of both nuclear armaments and conventional forces.\nIt is natural for Finland warmly to welcome the intensification of the international dialogue. Pursuing a policy of neutrality, my country does not seek security in military alliances. We emphasize the value of collective action through organized international co-operation. We believe in the United Nations. Nor is it redundant, today, to renew our commitment to the United Nations, to its Charter, its principles and its goals.\nAll nations, big and small, nuclear and non-nuclear alike, share a legitimate interest in and an inescapable responsibility for international peace and security. Here again, this Organization is at the focus of a common endeavour. The Conference on Disarmament, with its broad agenda, offers ample possibility Les for multilateral negotiations on the prevention of the arms race as well as : an extension to new areas.\nIn order to make its own contribution to the multilateral disarmament ,Finland has recently advanced ideas on two areas which also offer opportunities for the United Nations. One area is verification of disarmament agreements; confidence-building is the other.\nOn regional disarmament, Finland speaks against developments that in cui view might upset regional stability in Europe. We emphasize that all military Powers should show responsibility and restraint in the northern parts of Europe. Our well-known initiatives regarding the establishment of a Nordic nuclear-weapon free zone and the benefits of added trust and confidence in the maritime areas in the North relate to that concern. We hope that the favourable developments in Central Europe will not adversely affect the stability on the flanks of Europe.\nThe Stockholm Conference, held within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), adopted last year a significant s t of confidence-building measures. The adoption of those measures marks a step towards greater openness in military matters. We expect more steps to follow as the Conference resumes its work.\nDelegations of 35 states are at present convened in Vienna for the third follow-up meeting of the CSCE. Finland expects concrete results both in the implementation of already agreed provisions and in the form of further commitments. The central dimensions of the CSCE - security and confidence-building, economic co-operation and human contacts - all need to be strengthened. The CSCE process has great potential. This process is not directed against anyone but works for the good of all, both in Europe and elsewhere. \nThe way by which South Africa is governed represents precisely what the United Nations was designed to oppose: insecurity, injustice and discrimination. The United Nations must intensify its efforts designed to bring about the eradication of the inhuman and immoral system of apartheid. Apartheid cannot be reformed: it must be abolished.\nWe have demonstrated our preparedness to carry out concrete measures against apartheid. The Finnish Parliament has enacted a law which forbids all trade between Finland and South Africa. The law entered into force on 1 July this year.\nThe Finnish Government continues to believe that mandatory international sanctions in accordance with Chapter Vii of the United Nations Charter should be imposed on South Africa. Such concerted efforts would pressure South Africa into real change. Together with the other Nordic countries, we continue to work towards that end. A decision on sanctions must be coupled with increased assistance to the front-line States and to the countries of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC). At present a substantial part of Finnish bilateral development assistance is already going to those States.\nThe South African Government also bears full responsibility for the situation in Namibia. The Government of Finland rejects the linkage of the application of resolution 435 (1978) with extraneous matters. We have repeatedly condemned all of South Africa's unilateral actions and dilatory tactics.\nThe situation in the Middle East remains of serious concern to the world community. A just, lasting and comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute can be achieved only through negotiations on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. An international conference could make a major contribution towards that end. Intensive efforts are needed to bring about an agreement on the principles and the mandate of such a conference. I am pleased to see that efforts towards such a conference continue. The war between Iran and Iraq has continued for seven years. Under the leadership of this Organization the international community has intensified its efforts to end this immensely destructive war. The latest reports from the area underline the urgent need to search for the means of terminating the conflict, which, if it continues, may have the potential for detrimental world-wide repercussions.\nCentral America suffers from violence and social instability. After years of effort, all five Governments of the region have now agreed on a plan, including a cease-fire and social reconciliation in the spirit of democracy. Finland believes in regional solutions to regional problems. We welcome the process that the Guatemala agreement represents and are prepared to make our appropriate contribution to its support.\nWhere conflicts beset nations the United Nations must be ready to render its services for the restoration of peace. The development of United Nations peace-keeping has been one of the most successful achievements of this Organization, Finland is particularly honoured by its involvement in these operations for over 30 years.\nPeace-keeping operations should be carried out under a clear mandate from the Security Council, with the full support of its members and on the basis of satisfactory financial arrangements. A clear demonstration by all Member States of their willingness to give full political support to the United Nations peace-keeping efforts and to pay their assessed contributions remains indispensable.\nThe United Nations has agreed on an impressive body of internationally recognized human rights standards. Yet we are daily witnessing violations of human rights in many parts of the world. Perhaps in no area of United Nations activities is the gap between promise and performance more evident than in that of human rights. It is our common responsibility to ensure respect for them.\nThe vulnerable situation of the millions of refugees and displaced persons in different parts of the world calls for action by the international community and by individual countries. Those in need of international protection and assistance must be helped. In this work we rely fully on the goals and objectives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It is our policy to increase out contribution to assist in the alleviation of the world refugee situation.\nThe problems of the world economy are a matter of serious concern. Despite progress in strengthening the prerequisites for global growth, economic development in the industrial countries is slower than anticipated. In the developing countries depressed levels of export earnings, high real interest rates, ever-mounting debt service payments and shrinking inflows of financial resources harass economic performance and weaken development prospects.\nThe avoidance of another recession and the restoration of sustained growth require determined and urgent policy changes in both developed and developing countries. The social costs of the necessary adjustment policies in developing countries ought to be recognized by the international community. We welcome the recent increase in the activities of international financial institutions designed to alleviate their worst effects.\nThe debt problem continues to be an impediment to growth in the developing world, it is a major reason for the further deterioration of the living conditions of the poorest of the poor. The heavy debt burden complicates the readjustment of the economic policies of these countries. Structural adjustment programmes and other efforts to improve domestic resource mobilization, including a more efficient use of investments, are not bringing about instant results because of the debt servicing payments. The problem of debt servicing by the developing countries should be further studied in the global context. When channelling the increased capital assistance, the needs of the most vulnerable countries should be properly addressed.\nAgainst this background, Finland welcomes the positive outcome of the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Its final act must be translated into concrete actions at the national level and in the appropriate organizations.\nThe economic and social situation in Africa will be reviewed at this session of the General Assembly for the first time since the adoption of the United Nations Programme of Action for Africa in May 1986. Finland considers it important for the international community to show determination in the implementation of the Programme. Finland, for its part, has carefully studied its possibilities of promoting the Programme. At the multilateral level, Finland has constantly emphasized the urgency of a more effective response by international organizations and financial Institutions to African economic and social needs. Some 60 per cent of our bilateral aid is now directed to Africa.\nOver-exploitation of natural resources and the consequent deterioration of the environment have altered globally important life-support systems, and the basis for our economic and social development is severely undermined. The threat to our environment has put our very survival at stake. These issues stand out clearly as a major concern on the International political agenda.\nThe World Commission on Environment and Development, led by Mr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of Norway, has analysed these issues in a profound manner. Both the World Commission report and the environmental perspective prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) convey the same message to us: that economic growth and more equitable development are not only necessary but also possible without endangering the natural resource basis. The Government of Finland endorses the recommendations in the environment perspective and the principles In the World Commission report. Sustainable development should be one of the guiding principles in the activities of the United Nations system and of other international organizations.\nIt was Important that last year's extensive debate on the efficiency of the United Nations resulted in a consensus. All organizations should, in fact, periodically submit their activities to close scrutiny. Rather than a singular event, this should be seen as a continuous process, in which viability in substance and efficiency in administration constitute an entity.\nThe United Nations is no exception. A thorough self-analysis should involve a discussion on such modifications as may be deemed necessary. Decisions should follow. The entire process should focus on the strengthening of the operative capabilities of the Organization in the opinion of my Government, the United Nations as an Organization should strive for maximum effectiveness, based on a stable and reliable financial basis. The former cannot be achieved without the latter. A sound financial basis cannot be established unless all Member States demonstrate their willingness to meet their financial obligations. Assessed contributions to the United Nations budget cannot be made conditional on national requirements regarding the Organization's performance.\nThe United Nations is our common mechanism in our striving for common goals. Administrative effectiveness is a necessary, but not an adequate, condition for achieving those goals. Adequate conditions are created only by the willingness of the Member States to make full use of this mechanism.\nLet us make good the commitments and promises we, the Member States, made to this Organization at its commemorative session two years ago. Let us be frank enough to recognize its failures and weaknesses, as well as its strengths. Let us not lose sight of the chances to redress what has been neglected. Let us use our resources wisely for the purposes for which the United Nations was created. In a changing world this Organization must be responsive to the changing needs of mankind, whether they arise from the need for security, economic and social development, or human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, I wish to offer you greetings from the people and Government of Peru and to express my pleasure at the fact that you have been elected to guide the deliberations of the highest forum of the international community. Your dedication to the process of international understanding is the best guarantee of the successful accomplishment of your task. I must also may how much we encourage, how much we appreciate, and how grateful we are to our Secretary-General, whose unanimous re-election is the best tribute the international community can offer to his selfless work for international peace and security.\nWe are living through a dangerous period of deterioration in the international system, a fact which makes it imperative to establish a new rationality and strengthen the machinery available, so that the solutions to the world's great problems may be dealt with properly on the multilateral level. We are particularly concerned at the crisis of the United Nations system in which, above and beyond purely financial and substantive factors, we perceive attempts to weaken the Organization, to compromise its independence and to neutralize its role as a negotiating forum for major international issues.\nAttempts are thus being made to erode multilateralism and thereby deprive the developing countries of the world's decision-making processes. Attempts are being made to do this in such a way that the relevant bodies will not be able to play their proper role, not merely as a group of operational bodies working in co-operation, but as factors of change in the very foundations of the system, and instruments for the attainment of a democratised international order.\nOurs is an Organization with an imbalance, to the detriment of the developing countries. The imbalance is expressed through the veto in the Security Council as well as through financial domination, which has the effect of an additional veto, and through the concentration - an almost hereditary concentration - of the main posts in the Organization in a group of countries.\nTherefore, any reform, far from increasing the inequalities in the United Nations, should, on the contrary, effectively democratise it, resolve its financial problems without political mortgages, and consolidate its functional independence, in order to enable it to achieve its great objectives of peace and development. \n\nWhat is required is a new concept of the United Nations system, one that would enable it to respond to the challenge of structural change experienced by international relations in the post-industrial society; so that it may be able to give direction to the emerging trends and avoid the threat to the third world of the establishment of more serious dependence and the distortion of basic elements of the nation-State.\nFor this purpose it is imperative to bring about a collective process of reflection and diagnosis that will make it possible to determine a new approach to the institutional structure of the international system  to review and revise the now obsolete schemes of the post-war period; and to anticipate the requirements of a new international dynamism.\nWe are living in a period of what promises to be a new stage in the disarmament process. The recent agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union give us encouraging signs, for the first time, of the reversal of the fatal arms race. We are inspired by the hope that the universal conscience in favour of peace and disarmament - which motivated the Harare message of the Heads of State of the non-aligned countries - will in the end triumph over the egocentric visions of security, which still cause many to spend great resources to win an impossible war, instead of making a reality of a peace without victories, based on the full realization and understanding of international social justice.\nLet us trust that this progress will also help to usher in substantial progress in the total banning of nuclear tests, the prevention of the militarization of space, the strengthening of multilateral negotiations with regard to other aspects of disarmament, and the releasing of resources for economic and social development. In the regional and sub regional area, we are persevering in the organization of convergent efforts to promote development through the social reorientation of the resources allocated to defence expenditures, an ongoing process now, which is conducive to the strengthening of regional security, based on a new dynamic of co-operation, Integration and solidarity. We believe that the zones of peace can serve to strengthen international security and help in regional development work. In this area my country is in favour of a zone of peace in the southern Pacific. \n\nAt the centre of this concern is the indissoluble relationship between disarmament and development and its connection with a democratic and fully integrated concept of security. Despite frustrations, the recent International Conference on the subject has offered us a valuable opportunity to clarify concepts and open a debate which, we hope, will soon be universal and sufficiently imaginative to establish appropriate ways and means to make this relationship effective and to promote genuine international co-operation towards renewed and fruitful multilateralism.\nA significant contribution will be made by the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America, which will shortly be Inaugurated in Lima, in accordance with the Assembly's unanimous decision last year. We trust that the Regional Centre will make it possible to mobilize the collective efforts of countries in the region in the area of the interrelationship between disarmament and development and its impact on the conflict-peace relationship.\nIn hosting this new institution, which belongs to all countries of the region, Peru will be unflagging in its efforts to increase the Centre's vitality and effectiveness and urges Member States to give it genuine and unwavering co-operation. On the initiative of Peru and the Group of 77 the General Assembly has for two years now been considering the grave problem of the external debt of developing countries. These considerations have had the following positive results; the adoption of resolution 41/202 and the points agreed on recently in UNCTAD VII. Thus it would appear that everyone agrees on the seriousness of the problem. \nNevertheless, the debt problem is growing daily, owing to the lack of universal agreement on how to implement a valid strategy for its solution. Endeavouring to solve the external-debt crisis through the imposition of adjustments and continuous refinancing is wrong.\nIndeed, the constant process of debt refinancing makes it possible for the creditors to convert devalued loans into new loans with additional interest, thus increasing the principal and servicing. In other words, this refinancing thus establishes a permanent transfer of financial resources to the creditors - that is, perpetual tribute to be paid by the debtor developing countries.\nIn this way the debt expresses an asymmetry that is the product of a power policy that still accepts neither co-responsibility for the debt problem, nor flexibility in recognizing the real value of the debt in order to accede to historical interest rates, nor the real ability to pay of the debtors based on the requirements of their social and economic development.\nAs a consequence, the developing countries are increasingly adopting unilateral measures to reclaim their sovereignty and their peoples' right to development, thus limiting the transfer of resources and rejecting perpetual tribute to international financial profiteers. Thus, in the face of the abuse of the laws of the creditors, the justness of the laws of the debtors is suddenly arising.\nIf the debt burden has succeeded In reversing the logic of international co-operation, stretching the financial system to the limits of its credibility and political viability, the phenomenon of the international drug traffic is now reaching a scope that not only undermine the very essence of states but also add to an already critical international scene a criminal structure of formidable proportions.\nIn this context, it is encouraging to point out the fundamental importance of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, held in Vienna, which marks a new stage in the political treatment of a problem that has deep and complex social, economic and political connotations; the final declaration contains basic principles to which my country subscribes.\nThe decrease in prices of raw materials and the scarcity of resources generated by the debt crisis contrast scandalously with the geometric rise in financial resources destined for drug consumption. Peru considers that the time has come to mobilize the support of consumer countries to make possible a massive flow of financial resources to the producer countries that will enable a radical change to be made in the artificially created production structure created by drug traffic in specific regions of the world. What must be done is to substitute the Incentive of agricultural producers towards a harmful prosperity based on drugs with an effective, profitable type of agricultural activity with guaranteed export markets coming from a new agro-industrial production structure.\nTwo years ago when the General Assembly approved an important resolution on terrorism, the United Nations assumed a unanimous commitment. However, not enough has yet been done to establish international conditions obstructing a climate propitious to terrorist activities. I believe it is urgent to promote a widespread stabilization of open rejection of organizations which, under political or cultural pretexts, would create in developed societies attitudes of tolerance for the proselytising action of agents of groups that impose violence and death on our democracies and work against our peoples' aspirations for freedom and justice. The initiatives put forward to distinguish between terrorism and the legitimate Struggles of liberation movements against colonialism, apartheid and foreign occupation are positive steps which should make it possible for us to move forward 'to this direction with greater determination. \nOne year after the last Summit Conference, in Harare, we observe in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries a new dynamic with respect to the challenge of our times. The non-aligned countries must respond to a fluid international situation with unity and effective actions, incorporating our own perspective and consolidating our Movement as a negotiating force capable of promoting effective solutions to the grave problems of the world.\nIn this context the non-aligned countries are concerned over the intensification of hotbeds of tension - wrongly dubbed \\\"remaining\\\" hotbeds - which should appropriately be considered by the General Assembly.\nMy country is deeply disturbed by the escalation and undue prolongation of t conflict between Iran and Iraq and supports the peace process initiated by the Security Council and the crucial role of the Secretary-General. \nThe problem of southern Africa remains unresolved because of the intransigent of those who oppose our struggle to replace the abhorrent apartheid regime and achieve independence for Namibia - heroic undertakings with which Peru wishes to state its unflagging solidarity.\nWe are encouraged by the progress made recently on the convening of an international conference on the Middle East for a peaceful solution to the problem in keeping with the security requirements of all the parties and with respect for the rights of the Palestinian people. Similarly, we support the Secretary-General's efforts for a negotiated political settlement of the situation in Afghanistan on the basis of the independence, non-alignment and self-determination of that nation.\nOnce more we voice our fraternal support for the just demand of Argentina for the recovery of its sovereign rights over the Malvinas Islands, and we stress the urgency of negotiations to eradicate that vestige of colonialism. With respect to the situation in Central America, Peru has always been convinced that It is possible to find a peaceful solution based on the right of the countries of the sub-region to decide on their own destiny free from any foreign Interference or intervention; and we express our solidarity with Nicaragua in the defence of its sovereignty, Independence, territorial integrity, stability and self-determination. \n The present session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when this situation in Central America is such that there are new prospects for the long-sought peace process to be successful as a result of the initiatives of the Contadora and Support Groups. We are deeply pleased that on 7 August last the Central American Presidents signed a document on procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central America and thus formed an executive commission to make viable the implementation of peace agreements, within which new dynamic the International Verification and follow-up Commission was established.\nWe hail this great step of the Central American Governments which calls for the adoption of a resolution of great historical importance that confirms the broad and unrestricted support of the international community for the peace process agreed on in Guatemala and gives a clear mandate to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to support the implementation of that peace process, and in particular the work of the International Verification and Follow-up Commission.\nLatin America has assumed the challenge of acting boldly in the world, using its rich experience and its own ideas and perceptions to become a factor for change in international relations.\nIn so doing, Latin America is aware of the need to change international economic structures; it identifies with the cause of the poor, deprived countries of the world and their desire to achieve development, which is a right and an international responsibility. In our region itself, we promote schemes for political co-operation and economic integration and further measures to make viable our development and strengthen our potential for working together.\nOur first experience in dialogue, agreement and harmonization in the area of security has been the peace initiatives of the Contadora and Support Groups in the case of Central America. This exercise in solidarity has given rise to an experience in political co-operation known as the Group of Bight, which will find full expression in the meeting of Presidents to be held in Mexico next November.\nThis new framework for political harmonization, established on a solid basis of democracy, flexibility and non-exclusivity, is an attempt to establish the nucleus of a process of co-ordination in the Latin American region which will draw the region together and consolidate its presence in the international system through the innovative work of a new political organization, an economic identity of its own and re-conceptualisation of its collective security.\nSimilarly, of very great importance is the decision adopted in recent days by the member countries of SELA, the Latin American Economic System, to hold annual meetings of Foreign Ministers prior to the sessions of the General Assembly in order to examine, through direct and informal dialogue, the international situation and its repercussions in our region, as well as actions to strengthen the unity and joint actions of Latin America and the Caribbean. Those meetings, oriented around dialogue and political harmonization, give SELA a new dimension and held much promise for regional unity.\nThe crisis of the international system confronts the developing countries with critical situations and conditions in which national efforts to bring the great masses out of centuries of poverty are threatened by interests that want to maintain an unjust and unhealthy status quo.\nPeru, in the midst of historical difficulties that have resulted from its being a third world country - difficulties aggravated by the aggression of terrorism and the extortion of debt - provides an acid test on how democratically to achieve structural transformations conducive to the consolidation of a popular nationalist programme. If the adjustment policies of a discredited financial system have overshadowed negotiations to achieve a new international order, it is today more necessary than ever that the developing countries create an alternative based on growth that includes the redistribution of wealth - that is, a new concept of development.\nIn this important world forum there has been advanced the thesis that the relationship between the role of the State and development is a contradictory one, and the growth experienced in the informal economic sector has been given as an example. The Government of Peru feels that such a contradiction does not exist, especially if the actions of States are oriented precisely towards avoiding the oligarchic and oligopolic concentration of property and production so as to give all citizens, especially the poorest and most marginal, access to the means necessary for fulfilment in the context of a more just, egalitarian and therefore authentically democratic society\u00b7\nIt has also been said that the right to development is simply the right of economic agents to act freely\u00b7 If this assembly of nations has enshrined the right to development as one of the basic rights of the human person and of peoples, it is because as time passes an international structure of domination and exploitation is increasingly frustrating and destroying the capacity of our countries to achieve their national development objectives. Whatever economic or social model is used, the development indicators and the living standards of practically all third world countries have declined to the levels of 20 years ago, which proves the structural and global nature of a crisis that is the consequence of relationships of power and an international economic order that brings down the prices of our raw materials, obstructs the access of our products to markets, favours regressive adjustment measures aimed at ensuring the repayment of unpayable debts under the original terms, and makes international co-operation dependent on the submission and subjection of the developing countries to being tributaries of those who benefit from that unjust order.\nOn the other hand, if those adjustment policies are to be replaced with anti-crisis policies of growth and redistribution, which is what we have done in Peru, a bridge must be built between the needs of the immediate present and long-term requirements in order to achieve a new international economic order. The achievement of a consensus on this approach would sow the seed of new development for the coming century.\nAt this time Peru wishes to express once again its fraternal, militant solidarity with all peoples fighting for freedom, peace and justice and to reaffirm its desire for understanding and international co-operation and its commitment to the principles and purposes of this Organization and its responsibility to build a better, more secure and more just world. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, on behalf of my country, Colombia, one of the oldest and most robust democracies on earth, I wish to congratulate you on the honour conferred on you, which is no more than the recognition due to your eminent personal and intellectual gifts.\nThe Assembly, as it convenes at its forty-second session, is an affirmation once again of the vital importance of coexistence as a binding force among sovereign nations. This league of States in voluntary association has demonstrated that there is a minimum set of common rules for the harmonious regulation of their relations, and that the foundation for such regulation is to be found in international law.\nAmong the concerns being debated by the international community there are three central elements which most urgently demand concerted action. I refer to peace, out overriding aspiration, and hand in hand with it, the concept of human dignity and the need for a just and equitable international order.\nColombia, which was well represented in the League of Nations and is a founding Member of the United Nations, has always endeavoured to model its international policy on these principles, and has striven for the necessary coherence between foreign affairs and domestic policy.\nI wish today to reaffirm before the world Colombia's unwavering commitment to peace. Its armies have never crossed the borders of their homeland except to contribute with their blood to the great work of liberation undertaken by the heroes of the independence of the Americas or, in response to an appeal from this Organization or friendly countries, to help by their presence to preserve peace and democracy. This line of conduct will not change. We shall remain committed to the objective of striving together for prosperity, development and peace. \nWe strongly repudiate the arms race mentality, not only the kind that means rushing headlong towards world confrontation and nuclear annihilation, but also that of some States which, in spite of the enormous economic and social difficulties they face, employ force or coercion in an attempt to advance claims which, if valid, should be settled by means of peaceful solutions based on the rule of law.\nIt is for this reason that my country firmly supports the affirmation by the Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament, and Development of the need to check the unbridled expansion of the arms race, the heavy economic cost of which has to be met by diverting resources that could be used to eliminate the inequalities that undermine the stability of societies. The Assembly should continue to study measures directed towards effective disarmament and the elimination of nuclear weapons, which today jeopardize the very survival of mankind.\nMy country sees an encouraging sign for mankind as a whole in the coming together of the great nuclear Powers and the success that they are achieving in their negotiations, and hopes that the prospects of death and destruction through armed conflict may be averted once and for all.\nWe endorse most firmly and resolutely the solution of disputes by peaceful means, including recourse to conciliation, arbitration and judicial settlement, especially when extremely lengthy direct negotiations fail to result in agreement. The international community may rest assured that Colombia, adhering faithfully to the principles which have guided its international policy, will not resort to force to resolve any differences with other States. \nHappily for the Americas and for world peace, recently there have been signs of hope for a solution to the Central American conflict, following the agreements arrived at in Guatemala by the five Central American Presidents and the establishment of the International Verification and Follow-up Commission, made up of the Foreign Ministers of the Contadora Group, the Support Group and Central America together with the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the Organization of American States. Similarly encouraging are the first steps taken towards devising an emergency plan of technical and economic co-operation for Central America. It is clear that the regional conflict is caused to a large extent by economic and social problems which it is essential that we overcome. The time has come for all the parties concerned, with the vital co-operation of countries having ties or interests in the region, to establish lasting peace.\nMy country, together with the other States of the Contadora Group and the Support Group, will spare no effort to promote this goal, for peace in Central America is also our peace.\nWe welcome the effective work being done by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and his representatives in all those parts of the world where conflicts have arisen, in the diligent fulfilment of the responsibilities for the preservation of international peace and security laid down in the Charter. We hope to be able to continue to rely at all times on the Secretary-General's constant and effective co-operation.\nColombia is a whole-hearted believer in dialogue and wishes the dialogue in the Korean peninsula to be reopened as promptly as possible with a view to bringing about peaceful reunification. We also hope that dialogue will continue to be a useful implement in the negotiations on the question of the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands, in keeping with the spirit of the resolution of which we were a sponsor at the last session of the Assembly.\nThe Government of Colombia is convinced that respect for and the promotion of human rights go beyond mere exercises in rhetoric in international forums. They are a moral obligation borne by all States that must be faithfully fulfilled in all its aspects, ranging from the treatment accorded to minorities settled within a country's own territory to truly authentic freedom of expression.\nIt should be kept in mind that the peoples of the developing world have yet to attain the minimum conditions for well-being; the benefits of health care, proper nutrition, housing, education and employment, as the necessary foundation for individual freedoms. Prevision for these needs, truly the bedrock of democracy, is bound up on the world level with the establishment of a mote just international economic order based on co-operation among States.\nAlthough my country is not as hard-pressed as other sister nations in Latin America by the problem of the repayment of external debt, we should not lose sight of the fact that this is a problem which, if not adequately resolved, will bring social disorder and oppression in its wake. \nColombia has participated with interest in many international forums in discussion of the world financial problem. We particularly welcomed the consensus achieved at the last session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). We hope that the Assembly will make further progress on this matter. Today more than ever before the community of nations is duty-bound to take a joint approach to problems which cannot be tackled otherwise than in a global manner. I am thinking especially of the phenomenon of narcotic drug trafficking, which has exacted a heavy toll in pain and blood from my country. Colombia remains steadfast in its battle against that problem, as it reaffirmed in Vienna at the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.\nThis crusade, affecting as it does the whole of mankind, cannot be an isolated one; nor can it be carried out successfully by a single country or group of countries. Concerted international action is necessary to tackle the problem in its entirety and in its various phases of production, consumption and control of the financial resources stemming from this destructive traffic.\nIn this regard, we recognize the importance of the efforts of the United Nations and, in particular, of the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control.\nAddressing this Assembly a year ago the Colombian Head of State spoke of the urgent need for concerted action to combat the extreme poverty which afflicts vast sections of the earth's population. In response to that appeal, the United Nations Development Programme has been engaged in effective work in Latin America, with the initiation of the regional project designed to foster and provide advisory services for programmes to assist the marginalized sectors of our continent. Many countries of the region are now benefiting from this support. Colombia has resolved to take up as a national priority the challenge of eradicating poverty, while at the same time working for concerted action on the international level to combat this scourge. It has offered to host a regional conference on the question, with the support of the united Nations Development Programme and the participation and backing of the Latin American community, which shares Colombia's anguish over the plight of the marginalized populations.\nColombia looks forward with optimism to the results of the debate in the Assembly on the recommendations contained in the report, entitled \\\"Our Common Future\\\", of the Commission of eminent persons presided over by the Prime Minister of Norway, Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland. It is evident that the future of this earth is closely tied to the success we achieve in confronting the challenges involved in managing the environment.\nMy country hopes that the ideals of harmonious coexistence, human dignity and international co-operation will be reinforced during these deliberations by the political will of the States represented in the Assembly and that the pact among nations may be translated into reality through the establishment of an order of equity and peace for all peoples, based on the full effectiveness of the principles of international law and the lofty values which are the underpinning of the Chatter of our world Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, I offer you sincere congratulations on having been elected to your high office and wish you luck and success in carrying out your responsible task. At the same time I extend my thanks to Foreign Minister Choudhury for his circumspect and successful guidance of the forty-first session of the General Assembly, which ended a few days ago.\nI also take the opportunity cordially to thank the Secretary-General for his untiring endeavours on behalf and in the interest of our Organization. His latest report gives us confidence and a perspective for the future. As in the past, he can count on our unqualified support. The principal task of the United Nations is to maintain and safeguard peace. We begin this session of the General Assembly with hopeful signs of new thinking in West-East relations and in the field of disarmament. Yet the world is still filled with war: war between countries, in which people suffer and die; man waging war on man, for where human rights are violated war is being conducted against man; global terrorism is waging war against order in every form; deadly diseases are waging war on life; mankind is waging war on nature; and what is the hunger and poverty suffered by many nations but the outcome of war on human dignity through man's failure in North and South? \nIn the final analysis, it is always man who threatens man. Our children cannot be blamed for the state of the world, but it is they who suffer most. They expect us to give them a world free from war, free from expulsion, free from fear, free from hunger and disease. Parents all over the world love their children. But ate we in the United Nations really doing enough to protect the rights and the future of our children? We want to leave our children a better world, a world in which human dignity and social justice are guaranteed, in which peace prevails and in which the natural foundations of life are protected and cultivated.\nBut, above all, we must fight against the war inside us as well as that outside us. Peace begins within ourselves; it begins in the mind, with respect for our neighbour and awareness of our responsibility for that neighbour and for all who will come after us.\nWar strategies must be superseded by peace strategies. We want peace in a comprehensive sense. If we fail in our task, none of us will survive. Hence, the crucial task today is to ensure the survival of mankind. Mankind has become a community in pursuit of survival. No one can steal away from our common fate. A nuclear war would destroy us all.\nContaminated rivers, seas and soil, desertification, dying forests - especially tropical forests - and the widening hole in the ozone layer are all problems that affect and concern us all.\nA few weeks ago the world population passed the 5 billion mark. If the present demographic trend continues the world community will number more than 6 billion by the turn of the century. Our children will live to see that day. If we do not act the world's problems will pass beyond our control solely as the result of population growth. Now is the time to set the right course. This is the responsibility of every civilization, every religion, every ideology and every political and social system.\nThe call must be; fight the wars that threaten mankind from all sides. The peace we need is more than the elimination of military conflicts. It implies common responsibility, solidarity and respect for our neighbours. Peace implies making our world human. It implies respecting our natural environment. It implies securing freedom, life and the survival of mankind.\nMany people live in poverty, exposed to hunger, ignorance and disease. The prospects for the third world depress us all. Commodity prices are falling. This means that developing countries must continuously increase production, and this in turn reduces prices still further.\nIn the industrial countries, however, demand is on the wane because markets for certain commodities are satiated and other commodities are increasingly being replaced by new materials. The disintegration of commodity prices is not a temporary market fluctuation  it is a long-term trend. For most developing countries, however, commodities are still the principal - indeed, in many cases, the only - source of income. Thus their one-sided dependence on commodity exports must be reduced. We must help them to turn their raw materials into manufactures and semi-manufactures of their own. But the diversification of an economy takes time. Until that point is reached, ways and means must be sought of improving existing arrangements, as in the case of the European Community's Community model for off-setting shortfalls in export earnings.\nLast year the indebtedness of the third world rose by 9 per cent, to l trillion. In 1986 over 30 per cent, and in some cases nearly 50 per cent of the income of 22 sub-Saharan countries was mortgaged for debt service. The debt problem threatens to explode. It is a threat to the economic, social and political future of many heavily indebted countries, but it also poses a threat to donors. It threatens to undermine the will of North and South to co-operate with one another.\nAll those concerned, whether in the public or the private sector, need to increase their efforts. Every country should be treated according to its special circumstances. But the general principle must be to make debt-servicing reasonably proportionate to a country's productive capacity. It is in the true interest of donors to seek in their negotiations with debtors to solutions that will provide a perspective for the future. Hopelessness will crush the best will in the world.\nSince 1978 the Federal Republic of Germany has remitted 4,2 billion marks of the debt owed it by the poorest countries. I appeal to all donor countries to follow suit, and I appeal to the socialist countries of the North also to provide adequate development aid, at long last.\nProceeding from future-oriented reform programmes and financed by new loans on easy terms, the economies of the debtor countries must be put back on a course of growth. But diversification and investment in growth sectors will be helpful to developing countries only if the industrialized world opens its markets wide to their manufactures and semi-manufactures and adapts its own economic structure to such new conditions. We are prepared to make that adjustment.\nTo restrict the role of the developing countries in the world economy to that of mere suppliers of raw materials and energy would be to deprive them of their prospects for the future. The industrial countries must eliminate import \n\nrestrictions and other barriers to trade. They must stop subsidizing branches of industry that no longer pay their way.\nThey must also reduce agricultural surpluses. The adjustments necessary in the industrial countries are difficult and painful but that can be no reason to keep putting them off. At any rate, exports of weapons are not the solution to these problems. On the contrary, they Increase tensions and the danger of war, and they squander resources that are needed for works of peace. Weapon exports facilitate neither the necessary structural change in the industrial countries nor the process of economic recovery in the developing countries.\nAt its seventh session, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) underscored the special significance of peaceful international trade for development. The final act of that Conference indicates the strategies that need to be pursued with regard to finance and indebtedness and trade and commodities, and with regard to the problems of the land-locked developing countries. Now is the time for action.\nThe industrial countries are undergoing a technological revolution, a revolution that will completely change society. At the moment we have but little idea of the repercussions it will have on the developing countries. Whatever happens, it must not be allowed to divide the world for ever into rich and poor. We cannot allow the great human dream that has inspired all nations, the dream of one just, peaceful and free world, to be outstripped by technological development. On the contrary, science and technology must be the powerhouse for the development of mankind. Only modern science and technology are capable of solving the world's problems of food supply, health, education and energy. Genetic engineering, modern medical research, state-of-the-art information technologies and new forms of energy must be pooled to this end.\nAIDS (acquired immune-deficiency syndrome) is a challenge to the whole of mankind. It threatens all nations. My Government is pleased to note that the gravity of this problem is increasingly recognized by Governments and by international organizations.\nAdvanced technology not only provides opportunities; it also entails risks. Chernobyl has demonstrated to the world that the safety of nuclear power stations is the common responsibility of all countries producing nuclear energy. A progressive human society cannot regard nuclear energy as the ultimate solution to the world's energy problems.\nThe task of eliminating the political, social and moral risks inherent in high technology and science is common to the whole human race.\nGenetic engineering can secure adequate food supplies for many billions of people, but it can also be abused to violate the dignity of man if it is used solely as a means of manipulating man, if it encroaches upon each person's individuality. The United Nations is the forum where the best brains in our countries can establish common ethical standards with which to measure the consequences of technological development.\nThe earth's atmosphere and its high seas are the common property of mankind. They have to be preserved so that the human species can survive. But, like the world's climate, they too are being jeopardized. The Brundtland report has presented a plan for development that is both lasting and environmentally compatible, and it must be taken seriously. The world must be made more acutely aware of these issues and interactions. This is a matter for the United Nations. We should soon consider proclaiming a year of global environmental protection. We should also consider proclaiming the 199Os a decade for the environment to provide the necessary stimulus worldwide.\nEverywhere we face problems which we can only solve together or not at all. We have long since entered an age of global domestic policy in which each one of us is dependent upon everyone else. Thus, the importance of the United Nations grows from year to year. It is our common duty to preserve and develop the world Organization. The gap between the concept of the United Nations and its present indateriali2ation in a world of nation-States is still considerable. We must all learn to find global answers to global problems. The United Nations offers a wide range of instruments for this purpose. The more determined our efforts to reform the world Organization, the more effectively will be able to use those instruments. I wish at this juncture to thank the Secretary-General for his far-sighted approach to this problem.\nMany forms of co-operation can also develop in a smaller framework. Here in lies the special significance of regional organizations. The European Community has shown the world the kind of dynamism for peace that can emanate from regional organizations. For centuries the nation-States of Europe fought one another in wars, which also spread beyond their continent to other parts of the world. Today, war among the 12 members of the European Community is impossible; it is inconceivable.\nThat is the first and most important task of a regional organization: to make sure that war in its region will be impossible. The more nation-States become integrated the better their chances of achieving that aim. That is why my Government strongly supports all efforts to establish peace in crisis areas originating in the region itself. \nWe welcome the signing of the Arias Plan by five Central American countries as a step towards peace and stability in Central America and encourage them on that road. The result of the Guatemala conference is a sign of hope. We give our unqualified support to the nations of Central America in their efforts to secure social justice, to ensure the application of the principles of democracy, to secure independence and to foster peace and co-operation. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany is helping the cause of world peace by encouraging co-operation between the European Community and the regional organizations in Central and South America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\nThe countries of one region can best preserve and develop their cultural identity through joint efforts. The wealth inherent in cultural diversity is the purest source of energy for man's task of safeguarding peace. All nations on earth are, without distinction, civilized nations. Their cultural contribution is indispensable for the creation of a single global society based on justice, peace and freedom. We are serving the cause of peace if we preserve and protect the unmistakable identities of these civilizations. Nations that respect the cultural achievements of other nations cannot be stirred up against one another. Cultural arrogance has time and again been the root cause of catastrophes.\nThus the North-South dialogue, too, needs a cultural dimension. Only if nations start from the basis of their individual culture and cultural exchanges and partnerships with others can they develop the national consciousness that will help solve mankind's common problems.\nRegional organizations in the third world are the best way to ensure that their members are not drawn into the West-East confrontation. This is also the great mission of the Non-Aligned Movement, which is a growing factor of stability in the world. Genuine non-alignment offers third-world countries in particular a great opportunity to preserve their identity and consolidate their Independence.\nWe are all aware of the magnitude of the world's problems. This being so, we know we cannot solve political, social, religious and ideological differences in one gigantic leap. These differences exist and we have to live with them. But that should not stop us, notwithstanding all the differences of principle and ideology, from doing what we can to safeguard world peace now.\nThere is a growing awareness of this. The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), like last year's special session of the General Assembly on Africa, has given encouraging signs that North and South are capable of disregarding positions of principle and concentrating on what is necessary and feasible at the present time.\nWe must now take this opportunity to move forward. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) is an encouraging sign of common responsibility for global peace. The special significance of that resolution lies in its unanimous adoption. It can serve as an example for the settlement of other regional conflicts as well.\nWe strongly support resolution 598 (1987) and the Secretary-General's efforts to establish peace on its basis. That resolution affords Iraq and Iran an opportunity to embark on the road of peace. With Iraq having stated its approval, I urgently appeal to Iran to implement the resolution fully.\nWar has been going on in Afghanistan, too, for nearly eight years now. We expect the Soviet Union to withdraw its forces from that country and put an end to the suffering of the Afghan people. No one apart from the afflicted people of Afghanistan should gain advantage from the Soviet withdrawal. Consequently, the conditions for the genuine independence and non-alignment of the new Afghanistan must be established now.\nWe also call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea so that this country may exercise its right to self-determination. The new, fundamental developments between West and East with their far-reading consequences for world peace have only become possible through both sides opting for co-operation. The clearest manifestation of that willingness are the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union aimed at the global elimination of their intermediate-range nuclear missiles. For the first time, agreements are being made between West and East which not only limit but actually remove arms. This marks a turning-point in history.\nWe Germans greatly encouraged this development and we welcome the result - this great agreement - with relief. It enhances security and stability in Europe. My Government has viewed its role in this process not merely as that of an interested spectator. We have played an active part in achieving this success as a country aware of its responsibility for peace. Through our advocacy of the \\\"double-zero solution\\\" we have paved the way for the world-wide elimination of intermediate-range missiles.\nI endorse the statement Chancellor Kohl made on this subject on 26 August 1987 that, by the time the American and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear forces have been removed as agreed, the German Pershing la systems will also have been phased out.\nThis agreement is still a long way from completely solving the problem of nuclear disarmament, but it represents the first, and thus the crucial, step towards the great objective to which the nuclear Powers committed themselves before the world in the nuclear-test-ban Treaty.\nA process has been set in motion which must be made irreversible. Further steps must, and will, follow. We deem it essential that the United States and the Soviet Union should now concentrate on a drastic reduction of all strategic offensive weapons and in so doing also consider the further application of the Treaty on anti-ballistic missiles (ABM).\nIn the Western Alliance we will move ahead with the preparations for negotiations on nuclear missiles with a range of less than 500 kilometres. We will vigorously pursue the negotiations on conventional stability in Europe. The statements issued by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact afford a good basis for such negotiations. A convention globally banning chemical weapons is overdue. That convention must now be concluded  We cannot permit an ever larger number of countries to manufacture or produce these ghastly weapons of destruction. The best protection against their proliferation is their global elimination and their global prohibition. \nIn our efforts to achieve that aim, we are not facing an insurmountable wall. New thinking that stems from the knowledge that we can only survive with one another, not against one another, governs oar actions more and more\u00b7 Ho nation can have a greater interest in the success of all these negotiations than that of the Germans, for most weapon systems are concentrated in their country - on both sides of the dividing line - so they would be the first to be threatened with extinction\u00b7\nThe agreement on intermediate-range nuclear force\u00a9 will provide the spark the effects of which will be carried well beyond the confines of arms control. Both sides will draw from that agreement the energy and the confidence to extend their co-operation to all fields where such co-operation is currently possible. That will be a major step towards the political objective of Atlantic defensive community, which is to establish solid structures for peace in Europe through co-operation between West and East in all areas and on the basis of a reliable defence capability.\nThe fact that we can cherish this hope today in the result of the discernment and the constructive approach of both sides that had already become clear at the summit meeting of the United States and the Soviet Union in Reykjavik. There, the two super-Powers showed that they are conscious of their responsibility for mankind's survival\u00b7 in this they deserve the support of all peace-loving people. We must not stray from this path. \u00b7The signposts to a better future are not the prejudices and enemy-images of yesterday but the will of nations, the will of every individual, to live in peace and dignity. Only in that manner shall we fulfil our responsibility for the future of mankind.\nThe era that was dominated by hegemonic aspirations, the era in which the world risked being pulled into the vortex of a never-ending arms race, is drawing to a close. This process cannot be stopped} it is paving the way to a better world. In such a\u00b7 world there can no longer be any room for the old enemy-images. If we dismantle our weapons we must also dismantle those enemy-images. On a global scale and in Europe we must create reliable systems for maintaining security on a co-operative basis, as well as mechanisms for the early detection and management of crises. The Federal Republic of Germany will assist in this task in the North Atlantic alliance and in the European Community. We shall do everything in our power to promote the process of European union and to strengthen our alliance, the aim of which is to prevent war.\nOur desire to achieve the union of the twelve European democracies, our desire for co-operation with our Eastern neighbours, is a manifestation of the policy of the Federal Republic of Germany for peace in Europe. We are aware of our responsibility  we shall use all our energy and every opportunity in working for a better Europe, a Europe based on peace.\nThe position of the twelve members of the European Community of international issues and on the Community's internal development was presented by the Danish Foreign Minister two days ago. The Single European Act, which entered into force on 1 July this year, is significant for the international community. The Twelve wish, as is stated in the preamble to the Act, to make together \\\"their own contribution to the preservation of international peace and security in accordance with the undertaking entered into by them within the framework of the United Nations Charter\\\".\nTo that end we intend to establish a common Community foreign policy. \nThe completion of the European internal market, scheduled for 1992, will greatly increase the Community's strength. Significant steps towards a common monetary policy and towards the aim of converging the economic and financial policies of its members will have to follow, as will steps towards the creation of a technological community. That is the road to European union. To our neighbours in the East we extend the hand of wide-ranging co-operation - envisaged in the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security\nand Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) as the course towards the establishment of a peaceful order in Europe. At the CSCE follow-up conference in Vienna we are not merely seeking progress in matters of security: we are also seeking progress on the realization of human rights, on humanitarian issues, on economic exchanges, on the exchange of science and technology, on the exchange of information and culture. West and East can give each other a great deal through co-operation through confrontation they can deprive themselves of progress entirely - they can lose everything. Through co-operation we seek to build confidence, to serve mutual interests and, in a positive sense, to create dependencies that will make peace and co-operation irreversible.\nWe do not want to bleed one another to death through the arms race, nor do we want to cripple anyone economically. The political and military division of Europe is bad enough. We must not divide Europe economically and technologically when there are already gulfs to be filled and walls to be climbed. Our aim is to help achieve genuine progress in all fields. If the Soviet Union opens up to the world it will find a reliable and constructive partner in the Federal Republic of Germany. The Treaty of Moscow affords a basis for such co-operation as well as the necessary perspective. We shall have recourse to that Treaty, aware of the central importance of German-Soviet relations, which have an impact on the situation in the whole of Europe beyond their bilateral relationship.\nIf, after decades of confrontation, it were possible today to reach a turning point in the East-West relationship it would be a mistake of historic dimensions if we were to let the opportunity pass. All must shoulder their responsibility. Twelve years after the signing of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) we can declare: a process has been set in motion leading to a peaceful order in Europe. My country has made substantial contributions towards this goal through its accession to the European Community and the Western defensive alliance and through the unprecedented Franco-German partnership.\nWe have cleared the way for a new West-East relationship by means of the Treaty of Moscow; the Treaty of Warsaw, which established the basis for a new beginning with the Polish People's Republic in the awareness of the special quality of the German-Polish relationship following the vicissitudes of their history; and also through the treaty with Czechoslovakia and the Basic Treaty on Relations with the German Democratic Republic.\nNot only is there no feasible alternative, there is no responsible alternative to this process. We always perceive Europe as a whole; we want to improve the situation in the whole of Europe. We realize that the wheel of history can never be turned back, only forward.\nPart of this perspective for Europe's future is the relationship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the other German State, the German Democratic Republic. Both States are firmly integrated in their respective alliances. But precisely this fact makes it possible for them to campaign in their alliances for co-operation throughout Europe. The differences in their two value-systems are fundamental. Nevertheless the two German States are agreed: never again must war originate on German soil, only peace.\nThere is still disagreement between the two German states as to the future of the German nation. The Federal Republic of Germany remains committed to its aim of working for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will regain its unity through free self-determination.\nThe visit to the Federal Republic of Germany by Mr. Erich Honaker, Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic, demonstrated the intention of both German States to render a major contribution to stability in Europe by improving the quality of their relations and through their efforts to promote disarmament. Through these efforts we are also serving the welfare and interests of the people.\nMr. Honaker's visit revealed not only fundamental differences but also a willingness to co-operate with one another. We Germans, too, must live with the disparities that characterize the world, and above all Europe, even though they affect us more than other nations. But these disparities must not prevent us Members of this great world Organization from meeting our responsibility for peace and the survival of mankind.\nCommon international responsibility also means a common responsibility to combat terrorism, to combat racism and to prevent violations of human rights. Today, now, this must be the great common denominator for all nations who have committed themselves to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The community of nations' are becoming increasingly aware that terrorism is a threat not only to political enemies but also to one's own country. We can confront terrorism only if its perpetrators are unable to find refuge anywhere in the world. But we shall be able to rid ourselves of terrorism for good only if we also remove its causes, and there are many.\nThe Middle East crisis, for instance, may keep on spawning violence. Consequently, peace must at long last be established in Lebanon on the basis of freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Middle East conflict, as we have seen in the course of past years, cannot be settled by force, only by negotiation. We therefore advocate an international conference on the Middle East, which must proceed from Israel's right to exist within recognized and secure borders and from the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people.\nIf terrorism is inimical to any order, racism is the most terrible deprecation of human dignity. A regime that rules in the name of race must be opposed by the conscience of the world in the name of humanity. The Western democracies are a community oriented to common values and based on equal dignity for all. In view of this, we condemn the violation and mockery of human rights in the Republic of South Africa. We call upon the South African Government to create at last the conditions that will enable black and white to meet at the conference table and commence the dialogue that is so urgently needed. Apartheid must be totally eradicated; it is not capable of reform.\nThe state of emergency must be lifted, the political prisoners, first among them Nelson Mandela, must be released unconditionally and the banned organizations of the black majority must be allowed to operate again. If this is done, there is still hope that the violence that is bound to keep on producing yet more violence can be stopped. With regard to Namibia, we demand the application, at long last, of resolution 435 (1978), without any ifs and buts.\nWe condemn violations of human rights wherever they occur. A particularly horrific aberration of State authority is torture. It is not an instrument with which to fight one's political opponents. Least of all it is a means of administering justice. It is the most abhorrent and barbaric manifestation of injustice. By means of the United Nations Convention against torture, the world has taken a big step forward in the development of its political culture. \n\nBy virtue of its Charter, by virtue of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the human rights covenants and its human rights institutions, the United Nations is a citadel and a bulwark of human rights. The exercise of civil, economic and social human rights is essential in the construction of a better world. A high commissioner for human rights and a court of human rights would be able to protect and promote these rights.\nOnly on human tights and the right of self-determination of nations can the universal house of peace be built. They are its foundations. That is why my country reaffirms to everyone before this world Assembly its pledge to respect every nation's right, to self-determination and to defend human rights all over the globe.\nAnd with the same earnestness we pledge ourselves, by dint of our policy of peace at home and abroad aimed at developing peaceful relations with our neighbours and all nations on earth and at making peace with nature, to safeguard life on this planet and the survival of mankind for this and all future generations.\nOnly when there is life is there freedom and human dignity. To preserve it must be the aim of our Organization. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI wish to convey our greetings to Ambassador Florin of the German Democratic Republic and press the hope that his term as President of the General Assembly will be beneficial and positive for the work of our Organization.\nI wish on behalf of my country, to extend to the Secretary-General our deep appreciation for his work and constant dedication to the cause of peace. His work reflects distinction on all Latin Americans.\nThe art of governing, always a difficult task, is especially arduous at the present time. In earlier times, managing and assuring the well-being of immunities lacking expeditious means of communications and dependent to a large extent on their own resources, without a sufficient basis for comparison, was even a formidable undertaking that could bring about discontent and criticism.\nThe advances of civilization, the transformations brought about by science and technology, the accelerating rate of change and life style, and the publicity about goods and services that makes them appear to be easily available, linked with the development of world-wide communications systems, have tended to distort the assessment of the individual and social realities of our peoples. They have urgent, enhanced expectations of progress and well-being which, even though now available only to the few, motivate them all to want to see their expectations realized at the very moment they are perceived.\nThis revolution of expectations, as it has been so rightly called, together with the crisis in moral values, has added to the tasks of governments in meeting the present requirements of their peoples the inescapable obligation to formulate, in accordance with the country's potential, the path, programmes and projects which may enable them to approach the degree of well-being enjoyed by the most developed centres of the world.\nThe responsibility of governing today includes the need to advance development in an internationally comparative context. In policies and actions, it calls for harmonizing the objectives of the more developed communities with the concrete realities and effective potential of the nation being governed.\nThe close interrelationship that now characterizes the life of nations requires more urgently than ever that we become able to regulate our shared existence upon this planet, giving due consideration and respect to our own geographical, political, economic, social, technical, historical and cultural differences. It also requires that we foster a spirit of true unity that will facilitate harmonious progress where equity will prevail over our present and future relations.\nThis Organization, which brings us together, is designed to be the instrument for that profound goal. Its creation and existence respond to one of the most constructive aspirations of nations, and its principles to the common ethical values that should prevail in relations between men and peoples.\nThe complexity of relations in a world vulnerable to confusion and exposed to rival interests and ideologies means that those goals, no matter how lofty, are difficult to realize in a timely and effective way. The greater and the more cherished our aspirations, the more we want to see them promptly realized, and the more we tend to feel frustrated over the slow progress in attaining them.\nThis understandable reaction should not undermine the strength of our determination. Difficulties cannot halt the progress of this integrated process, if difficulties do arise, they should, on the contrary, provide added impetus to rededicating ourselves to achieve our goals. Many have maintained that the efforts of the United Nations have not succeeded in leading to the high objectives that have been established. Certainly it is not difficult to point - as has been done on other occasions in this forum - to the frustrations of the international community at the frequent failure of its deliberations and conclusions to lead to successful results.\nThe world's stage is still the scene of wars, violence, discrimination, fundamental social deprivation, various forms of assault on the life of the individual and the society, scorn for or indifference to the weak and helpless, conquests and disturbing disinformation. Certainly there is no shortage of elements that could give us a feeling of frustration or impotence.\nBut if, at the same time, we consider the sustained and varied efforts relating to conflicts and the prevention of problems that could become insoluble, the benefits obtained in the most diverse technical fields, the agreements on the use of resources and the fact that we can meet to deal in a civilized manner with the anxieties in the world today and the uncertain tomorrow, a negative judgement is not warranted.\nWe are building international understanding, and this in itself is difficult because of the growing complexity of the situation. Perhaps we shall not attain it in a short time, but our most responsible determination consistently to support the effort is more than justified. We shall thus be able to face the future creatively and with a shared effort, and therefore to face future generations with the sense of responsibility that they have a right to require of us. We must leave them an inheritance of peace, understanding and progress, not just problems that we could not or did not decide to resolve. We know that the world is far from having exhausted its potential for well-being. We are aware that we have forged instruments that enable us to work together. We must pursue faithfully the measures already initiated by those who preceded us. We must use and perfect those instruments for the good of mankind and our peoples. We shall not allow temporary problems or crises, no matter how serious, to divert us from this constant and overwhelmingly important objective.\nIf we adhere firmly to that decision, we shall find ways to reform the world society and give it a sense of solidarity in the spirit that His Holiness pope John Paul II has repeatedly urged us to show. We must give force and vigour to the principles that must inspire our relations, seeking peaceful solutions to controversies, respecting the self-determination of peoples, rejecting intervention in the national affairs of sovereign States, respecting international treaties and seeking an international order that benefits all and ensures lasting peace and progress.\nMotivated by these convictions, my country welcomed with particular satisfaction resolution 598 (1987) on the Iran-Iraq war, adopted unanimously by the Security Council on 20 July 1987. The aim of that resolution was to re-establish harmony in the region and bring to an end a confrontation that has brought suffering to two developing nations that need peace. We ate new following with special concern the developments in that area.\nSimilarly, we are following the efforts to achieve disarmament and remove the danger of a nuclear confrontation. We hope that the improved relations between the United States and the Soviet Union will make it possible to arrive at a balanced and just agreement that will remove this factor of uncertainty for mankind.\nSimilarly, we welcome the promising agreements signed in Central America and hope that they will lead to deeds that make a reality of the aspirations on which they are based. We hope, too, that they will benefit the sister nations to which we have been linked by close bonds throughout our history.\nIn view of these positive developments, it is our duty to note with concern that, unfortunately, there are actions that do not fall within that pattern of peace and respect. There are untrammelled acts of support for violence and terrorism which call for the attention of the international community. The phenomenon of terrorism, with its cruelty and the advantage that permits it to act against society anywhere, against any of its members and with anonymity, tends to divide the organized community no matter what its social, economic, cultural or political characteristics.\nThis is a scourge that affects the basic principles and values of mankind, and every possible effort must be made to eradicate it. It is, to say the least, deplorable that there are still terrorist movements that can count on support from Governments that approve of their activities. In order to confront this evil it is necessary, on the basis of a firm, universal decision, to put a strategy into practice in which all civilized countries participate. My country makes this special appeal with the greatest determination, since it is well known that we have been the victim of serious, repeated terrorist acts, and the international community has had proof of foreign interference.\nSimilarly, we must express our concern over the many actions that reflect Intervention in the internal affairs of other nations. International coexistence requires that, together with a sense of unity in progress, we must respect that which is within the exclusive competence of each sovereign nation or State. There must be no intervention in the internal affairs of other nations or interference in the free self-determination of any people. The great Powers have a special, clear responsibility in this field. Balance will be achieved with the ability of each and every nation to mould its own destiny responsibly. Opposing or intervening in their sovereign and free decisions can lead only to undermining the true foundations of this balance and creating situations that do violence to that reality. We must not forget that neither power not wealth constitutes legitimate grounds for assuming the role of an arbiter of international morality or a mentor of the historical processes of another country. \nWe must denounce as unacceptable foreign interference in national plans, in so doing, we are not rejecting the conventional limitations established in respect of human rights. International regulations govern the field of human rights, and we certainly do not reject them. We regard them as relevant so long as they are applied faithfully, without partiality or political prejudice, and so long as they are not involved out of mere convenience.\nHowever, the arbitrary use that has been made of these legal instruments for political purposes has, on many occasions, exceeded agreed international jurisdiction and has thus eroded the principle of non-intervention, in such cases, responsibility does not rest with the great Powers alone.\nIt is therefore essential to refine the human rights system, both substantively and procedurally - the latter with regard to both organic and functional factors. To the degree that the bodies of regulations are refined and duly respected, we shall not only be preserving the principle of non-intervention, but the cause of human rights will thereby gain greater protection.\nIn this regard, we wish again to express our concern that the Middle East continues to be a region in which peace has yet to become a part of the lives of its peoples. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) are designed to provide an effective foundation for the consolidation of peace in that region. In this respect, as we have said here, and as we wish to reiterate, there must be recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including its right to form a sovereign state, and of the need to arrive at just agreements that guarantee the peace and security of all peoples, including that of Israel so that they may live within secure and internationally-recognized boundaries. \nWe are also deeply concerned by the tragedy experienced by the Lebanese people. We have very close links with that country; many sons of Lebanon have found a second homeland in Chile. We express the hope that Lebanon will overcome its problems and that peace and harmony will be restored to that country.\nWe regret to note the absence of progress on the question of Namibian independence. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) provides a just and realistic solution for the Namibian problem that would ensure the self-determination of its people, its territorial integrity and its unity. We support the efforts of the international community and those of the Secretary-General and the Council for Namibia in this regard. But we are concerned at the politicisation of this cause within the Council and the introduction of extraneous matters, which, far from favouring the cause of Namibia, tend to disturb the situation even further.\nWe also deeply regret to note the continuance of the tragedies in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. In Kampuchea, despotic Soviet imperialism, acting through one of its satellites, continues to act with violence and cruelty. The tragic situations of those countries deserve profound and critical thought, and praise is aroused for the courage of those who are resisting the invader and striving to maintain their national identities and achieve freedom.\nThe complexities and difficulties of those situations prompt us to continue to give the Secretary-General all the support he deserves in continuing to pursue his initiatives in Afghanistan and prompt us also to give continued support to Prince Sihanouk in his unwavering efforts on behalf of his people.\nIn Korea, the situation continues to be troublesome. We must emphasize that negotiations between the Korean peoples, without foreign interference, constitute the only viable way to address this problem and find a realistic and peaceful solution. In this regard we recognize the efforts being exerted by the Government of the Republic of Korea. We believe that the presence of the two Koreas in this Organization would facilitate contact between the parties and the finding of a peaceful solution to the problem. We should thus be complying with the principle of the universality of the United Nations, to which we attach great importance.\nTo those disturbing questions we must add the grave problem caused by the imbalance of the economies of the industrialized countries and the absence, thus far, of decisions for structural reform - decisions that should be more than mere simple responses to temporary situations and should restore stability and lead to the disappearance of the uncertainty now prevailing in international trade. Because of its scope and nature, this problem requires multilateral attention that will lead to the improvement of situations that now compromise the development of nations, especially those most in need of development. There have been indications of a spirit of understanding of the needs of the developing countries - for instance, the decision to grant 1 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries to development programmes for the developing countries. But that has not gone beyond a declaration of intention; it is not actually happening.\nWe trust that these problems will eventually be solved because, as is well known, the developing countries are actually sending their creditors, the developed countries, more than they are earning from their exports. And their earnings are already deteriorating because of adverse terms of trade and protectionist initiatives. We must never forget that situations of Imbalance such as this have their limits and, if prolonged in the absence of a planned solution, they may cause incalculable damage to the detriment of everyone.\nBefore concluding, let me add some specific comments about my country, which is going through a historical period of particular importance - a period that, it would appear, the international community does not always wish to understand Chile has demonstrated and maintains the deepest interest in contributing to the activities of the Organization, to the best of its ability. As one of the founding Members of the United Nations, and a faithful participant in its programmes and initiatives, we have spared no effort to co-operate as regards its lofty aims and purposes. For more than 40 consecutive years, we have pursued this consistent line of conduct, emphasizing our respect for the rights of other nations and their sovereign freedoms.\nWe must emphasize the unlimited co-operation my country has given to the special rapporteur on human rights, despite the unacceptable discrimination implied by the exceptional treatment involved. We have acted thus because our principles and values correspond to the essential ethic of our traditions and culture and because we desire understanding and peace. In an eminently constructive fashion and as a contribution to international understanding, my country - unlike others that have not, fortunately, had such experiences - was a victim of an attempt to destroy its sovereignty and its identity, a threat that it was able to overcome thanks to the resolve of its freedom-loving people. In 1973, we began a process of national recovery and of reconstruction of an economy that was falling apart. Despite the world's economic crises, which have seriously affected us, we have brought our economic and social situation to levels that have drawn praise from the most diverse international circles.\nIt also proved necessary for us to undertake the political reconstruction of the country in order to recover and strengthen its freedom. Chile set for itself a programme and a schedule, on a broad juridical basis approved by the people, for overcoming the ills it had suffered and restoring full democracy. Prom that time on, through the sovereign will of the people, we have proceeded to take each of the steps set in advance for carrying out the fixed schedule. Chile is making progress towards the establishment of a modern, solid, stable democracy. Because of its experiences up until 1973 and of the problems of the past, we have had to put forth every possible effort to achieve that objective. It is Chile's intention that its new democracy should be fully consistent with the complete freedom of the Chilean people and that their participation in the fate of their Republic should be expressed not only at the polls but in every aspect of daily life.\nThe socio-economic structure of the country is therefore based on a fundamental preference for private enterprise and respect for property rights. The role of the State has been reduced so that it has now been assigned a subsidiary function, with preferential attention of significant proportions being given to the eradication of extreme poverty. \nI have indicated that the responsibility of government implies the need to plan development in a competitive international context. Today, a whole set of interests are emerging that affect the international community. This is doing away with the traditional inertia and the tight compartments within which nations used to carry on their debates.\nNew concepts of co-operation are emerging, which are leading countries to an awareness of the need to pool their efforts to face these problems. Development and the use of our resources should not be indiscriminate. On the contrary, everything must be done in a responsible fashion for the benefit of the community.\nIn addition to the recent economic and financial problems that have demanded international attention, there are now others such as those resulting from man's own activities affecting his very future and environment. The deterioration of the ozone layer and pollution of the seas are some examples of the challenges man must face if he wishes future generations to continue living on this planet.\nInternational co-operation, the conceptual development of which has been extraordinary in this century, will have to increase greatly if we are to meet the threats that man himself has created.\nWe are facing a new situation, and in that situation the United Nations will play a central role. Its Secretary-General is already warning us about the need to begin thinking of reformulating some instruments of co-operation for that purpose. Their efficiency will be strengthened if there is harmonious agreement to that end.\nIt will be our joint endeavour to embark upon that task for the benefit of all. Let us nurture this rebirth of international co-operation with optimism. We trust that the peace and harmony we shall gain from it will make the task of government an increasingly efficient one for the benefit of our peoples. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, I should like first of all to convey to you the congratulations of the Italian Government on your election. You represent a country which, because of its geographic position, strategic significance and economic weight, is called upon to provide, within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, a major contribution to the existing delicate balances on the European continent. Your personal skill and experience are important guarantees for the Success of our work. I should also like to convey my appreciation to the outgoing President. We carried out his functions at a particularly difficult time for the United Nations and succeeded in ensuring results in the work of the General Assembly to the general satisfaction of all. We deserves our gratitude for his endeavours and our appreciation for his accomplishments.\nFinally, I should like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the considerable efforts he has undertaken - for which we should all be grateful - to put an end to the Iran-Iraq conflict, which represents one of the longest and most destructive tragedies of modern history.\nThe opening of the forty-second session of the General Assembly took place at almost the same time as the announcement of a virtually concluded agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States on the total elimination of intermediate and short-range missiles. For the first time in the history of humanity, massive quantities of armaments - enough to devastate the entire European continent - will be destroyed as a result of negotiations rather than of war. The significance of the agreement in principle to conclude a treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces, however, does not just lie in arms reductions - in its thinning of the forest of missiles that threatens Europe. Its real significance, in my view, lies in the process it will set in motion as well as in the search for new concepts of security which will no longer be based only on the accumulation of arms and which will put an end to the present state of instability, where peace is impossible and war is improbable. It is thus fitting that the United States and the Soviet Union consider this agreement to be an historic event. I would add that this agreement constitutes a turning-point, more because of its future potential than because of what it can achieve in the short term.\nWe must therefore unreservedly praise those men of good will who were the architects of this major achievement for the tenacity they have shown in the search for a middle ground between two concepts of the world and two very different political programmes.\nPresident Reagan, in close consultation with his allies, worked long and hard to translate into deed his long-declared intention to create a world in which the role of nuclear arms would gradually be reduced.\nGeneral-Secretary Gorbachev, for his part, deserves our appreciation for the vitality and openness he has imparted to the foreign policy of the Soviet Union. We has shown considerable courage in recognizing that there is not necessarily a relationship between the historic ambitions of his country and the steady accumulation of offensive weapons. Italy has always worked to encourage the policy of dialogue. My country was the first nation to hail unhesitatingly the achievements resulting from the Reykjavik meeting. We did so because we were convinced that the approach adopted on that occasion was the correct one. Dialogue must be based on strongly held convictions but it must also be marked by the humility needed to renounce intolerance and by trust in the other party's understanding and good faith.\nNo other lesson could be more timely in an era when mistrust is often the main stumbling-block. Let us not forget that in international politics there are # opportunities that might not recur and that history is made by seizing such moments. For the first time, the United States and the Soviet Union seem ready to heed the concern expressed by John Fitzgerald Kennedy when he pointed out that if humanity did not put an end to war, war would put an end to humanity.\nThe meetings that took place in Washington last week are likely to promote the development of the entire spectrum of East-West relations. They will facilitate the establishment of a network of reciprocal interests that will enable the international community more effectively to contain and resolve its crises.\nWe should, of course, refrain from harbouring illusions. We must not think that overt or latent rivalries will disappear, that suspicion regarding the intentions of the other side will suddenly be replaced by complete trust. However, we can expect greater convergence in the search for stability. That is why the importance of the understanding reached by the United States and the Soviet Onion transcends Fast-West relations - it heralds a model of behaviour and collaboration based not on the search for unilateral advantage but, rather, on the conviction that a disadvantage for one party is not necessarily an advantage for the other.\nThis convergence can also be seen in the manner in which the great Powers have confronted the crisis that most concerns us today - the Iran-Iraq conflict - and in the unanimity shown by the Security Council in adopting resolution 598 (1987). \nThe war between Iran and Iran is a very complex phenomenon, whose implications can only he perceived with difficulty since it is a war with both religious and political aspects, it has the potential to alter the balances in the region and to make its consequences felt throughout the Middle East, even transforming the area into a Lebanon of enormous dimensions.\nIt is for this reason that we value highly the peace effort undertaken by the United States and the Soviet Union, Here, again, a convergence has been achieved between the two countries - this time through the exercise of joint responsibility, the framework for which has been provided by United Nations machinery. It will be necessary to bear this in mind at all times in the course of a peace progress that is likely to be difficult. No effort should be spared in safeguarding the process launched by Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and in inducing the interested parties fully and rapidly to implement its provisions,\nSecretary-General Javier P\u00e9rez de Cuellar's mission to Teheran and Baghdad resulted in the gathering of elements capable of providing a basis for future action. I wish to assure the Assembly that Italy, as a member of the Security Council, where it will assume the presidency for the month of October, will do everything possible to ensure that the Secretary-General may be able successfully to implement the mandate entrusted to him.\nI sincerely hope that the intransigence of the two parties and the difficulties in overcoming ill will, hatred and aggravated nationalism will not prevent us from harvesting the fruits of the determined efforts of the Secretary-General and of the wider participation of the international community in this effort to restore normal conditions to the area.\nIn my view, the search for peace in the region between Iran and Iraq revolves around the relationship between a cease-fire and the restoration of normal conditions at the borders between the two countries, on the one hand, and the determination of the responsibility for initiation of the conflict, on the other hand. The problem is difficult but not insoluble, and it is necessary to continue to do everything possible to bring the belligerent parties to Join in the peace process laid down in Security Council resolution 598 (1987).\nFinally, in the event that the efforts of the Secretary-General and our support were to prove unproductive, new measures would become necessary. The very threat of such measures, even before they become a coercive instrument, should constitute a matter for reflection for the nations involved in the conflict.\nThe determination of responsibilities is certainly a complex problem. I believe, however, that it should be possible to distinguish at least two phases in the process which, in conformity with Security Council resolution 598 (1987), should lead to this result. The first phase would be the determination of the party that initiated hostilities. A second phase would be the determination of the underlying and immediate causes at the origin of the conflict, which, in any event, must be removed in order to strengthen the peace process and render it definitive.\nThe decision taken by my Government to send naval units to the Gulf to offer protection to the merchant ships flying the Italian flag does not represent a deviation from this policy, which has as its principal objective the end of this conflict and therefore also the protection of the freedom of navigation in international waters. Our action has the limited goal of protecting well-defined Italian interests with no hostile intentions towards any countries of the area. \nWe have all had bitter experiences with the ability of regional crises to turn into global conflicts. Such experiences should strengthen our common resolve to support the action of the United Nations and its capacity to prevent destabilizing developments in the various regions of the world.\nWe are aware of what abandonment of the principles and instruments of multilateralism meant in terms of destruction and violence in the history of the European continent. For that reason, we strongly believe in the United Nations often unique capacities for action and intervention. The Organization is all the more indispensable in that peace and stability are challenged by groups that are expressions of North-South and East-West rivalries and inspired by divergent ideologies, strategic requirements and economic interests.\nIt was the very awareness that regional crises can unleash global conflicts that strengthened the determination of the Western European countries to unite, together with the countries on the other side of the Atlantic, in a defensive alliance and to initiate among themselves a process of political and economic integration.\nThe history of the 40 years since the end of the Second world War demonstrates how such regional agreements have uniquely contributed to creating, on the one hand, security conditions not otherwise attainable and, on the other, the premises for the development of East-West relations.\nThe search for dialogue and solidarity on regional bases, which corresponds with one of the principles of the United Nations Charter, is making headway in other regions of the world, owing in large part to the example and impetus provided by Europe. We see the movement progressing today, despite great difficulties and widespread inertia, in a region such as Latin America, whose destiny Europeans had for too long considered to be confinement in - to use the expression of Gabriel Garcia Marauez - its \\\"hundred years of solitude\\\". But the recently signed Guatemala City agreement provides an example of vitality and creativity, it is a victory for reason that deserves the support of the community of nations, which it needs in order decisively to assert itself. \nThen there are other conflicts, such as the Arab-Israeli conflict, over which a veil of silence seems to have descended, particularly of late. However, problems are not solved by ignoring them. It is necessary to confront them openly and in a timely manner. It is also necessary to avoid giving the impression that they become matters of concern only when they reach a stage where they directly endanger our own interests.\nI am aware that the path towards an international conference on the Middle East is still long, strewn with obstacles and rendered uncertain by numerous elements yet to be defined. However, I wish strongly to reiterate that it is necessary to overcome paralysing doubts and to avoid turning the Middle East into t yet another forgotten and hopeless conflict, as was until recently the case with the Gulf war. It is necessary to defuse this process that fuels violence and ,,, frustration, because it would be illusory to think that its consequences could be confined to purely local dimensions.\nThe problems of peace that we face are immense. In addition to those I have j. mentioned there remain other unacceptable situations of regional tension; situations dealt with extensively in the statement made yesterday by the current \\\" President of the European Community on behalf of its 12 member States. I do not, therefore, believe it is necessary for me to comment further on those crises. I would only note that one sometimes has the impression that our Governments and the international organizations, including the United Nations, are unable to work out viable solutions to the problems before them.\nThis consideration should not be construed as criticism of the actions of the United Nations or of individual countries. General conviction that, inevitably, not only our State institutions but our societies as a whole, particularly those sectors with the greatest knowledge of the instruments needed to confront current difficulties, must become involved in the search for peace.\nHere I am thinking of the world of science, which we should like to be more open and not divided by ideological barriers, a vehicle for common progress rather than just an arena for competition. The idea of joint nuclear tests raised in the contacts between the two major Powers would be in keeping with that goal.\nAt the meeting held at Erice, Sicily, this summer, Edward Teller recalled the extent to which great discoveries of physics were subjected to secrecy as a consequence first of the Second World War and then of the cold-war climate. That famous scientist warned that in the future it would be necessary to prevent the cloak of secrecy again descending on scientific discoveries.\nScience can respond to all the challenges that are hound to carry increasing weight in the approaching third millennium of our era. It can do so by spreading an awareness that in our time fundamental balances can be achieved by involving science and those who have mastered it. Here I am thinking of meteorological and seismic phenomena and climatic variations, and endeavours such as the protection of the environment and the war against hunger and disease, which can be included in the framework of the larger effort to keep our planet under control.\nOf the evils that afflict our daily lives but can be combated only on a global scale - that is, through the United Nations - the drug problem is, next to terrorism, certainly one of the most alarming. In some countries more than half of all crimes are linked to the use of drugs. Drugs are connected with the Illegal arms traffic, with terrorism and with subversion. According to some calculations global profits from the drug traffic are equivalent to the gross national product of my country. That is one of the reasons the Italian Government has become the main supporter of the United Nations specialized agency entrusted with the struggle against this silent and clandestine scourge that saps the roots of our societies. We also welcomed with great satisfaction the results of the conference held last June at Vienna.\nThe bloody conflict between Iran and Iraq has once again drawn the world's attention to the problem of the transfer of conventional weapons and of their reduction.\nExactly 10 years ago the United States President, Jimmy Carter, drew the General Assembly's attention to the fact that the rate of growth of military spending was increasing at a faster rate in the developing countries than in the more advanced countries, at a time when the cost of equipping a single soldier was 60 times greater than the cost of a child's education. Ten years later this situation has certainly not changed for the better. Indeed, there are countries where it can be said that weapons kill ever before they are used, since they drain resources from economies already on the edge of subsistence. \nAware of this situation, Italy proposed as long ago as 1977 that the possibility be considered of establishing within the framework of the United Nations appropriate machinery to place the conventional arms trade under control. We think that it would be possible to go even further and agree on a code of conduct in this area. In my view, recent developments make our previous proposals particularly timely and we might well put them forward again.\nIt is increasingly evident, as was noted recently at the summit meeting in Venice of the seven most industrialized nations, that peace and prosperity can be pursued only on a global scale. Interdependence makes it necessary not only to ensure co-ordination of the stronger economies but also to follow with close attention the economic development of developing countries.\nThe struggle against underdevelopment is a means of relieving human misery and especially of fighting the terrible scourge of hunger. Solidarity with those who bear a/burden so much greater than ours is also a means of establishing new relationships in a world which increasingly requires the co-operation of all, a world which is constantly becoming smaller, in which no one can remain a spectator of the misfortunes of others, in which on the contrary all must consider themselves members of the same team.\nThis solidarity must also permeate the international economy, although I am well aware that the idea of a single world with common problems and of the interdependence of the regions of the earth gives rise to many objections, to selfishness and to the compromises of the policies of the day. In fact, only with a sense of solidarity will we be able to make steady progress and belie catastrophic visions and predictions.\nIt is the responsibility of all countries, but above all the industrialized ones, to overcome existing economic imbalances. The international community, through its various mechanisms, is trying to resolve the serious challenges within the North-South framework, such as the grave situation of indebtedness of many developing countries, the recurring food crises and the difficulties of access to the markets of the industrialized economies.\nThe economist Arthur Lewis could write in the 1960s that the combined economies of Africa, Asia and Latin America amounted to less than 0.5 per cent of the gross national product of the industrialized countries. The numerous ties that we maintain with the economies of those regions through international trade and because of their external debt show the extent to which such an assessment would no longer be valid today.\nItaly's resources are inevitably limited, but my country is nevertheless determined to make a special contribution to the solution of these problems by intensifying its programmes of development assistance through increasingly effective and diversified instruments of intervention. The massive integration of our programmes of bilateral assistance in the activities of the United Nations in the form of either financial contributions or participation in the Organization's projects is an element of this action which lends greater coherence to our foreign policy as a whole.\nThe difficulties that we will meet should not lead us to indulge in pessimism and inaction because, as I have already said, the most recent evolution of the international political situation requires of us an even greater commitment to the well-being of developing countries. It is a commitment that is in our own interest. Abraham Lincoln said of his country on the eve of its most testing experience that America could not live \\\"half slave and half free\\\". I conclude with that quotation, which applies today to our entire planet. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nFirst of all, Sir, please allow me, on behalf of my Government, to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the office of President of the General Assembly at this session. There can be no doubt that your election is testimony to, and recognition of, your personal devotion to the struggle that is being waged by the international community to realize the rights of peoples to freedom and independence. It is likewise a well deserved tribute to the country you represent so worthily. I should like therefore to take this opportunity to convey to you our best wishes for success in carrying out your task.\nPermit me to take this opportunity also to express my appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Choudhury of Bangladesh, for the outstanding, very wise and skilful way in which he was able to overcome the obstacles to his mandate and to carry out successfully his difficult mission. It would be unpardonable if I were not also to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary-General, for his untiring efforts in the quest for solutions to the many problems still facing mankind and for his devotion to the basic principles of the Organization, despite the limited means available to him and the political and economic circumstances which are so difficult and which characterize today's world.\nAllow me also to congratulate Mr. Reed on his recent nomination to the high post of Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs.\nAt the same time every year, the representatives of most of the nations of the world meet in this same hall to take up the questions that afflict mankind and to try to find lasting solutions to them. Despite this, the spectres of famine, drought, underdevelopment and foreign debt continue to haunt the minds of the leaders of the least developed countries, and these factors, together with the unbridled arms race, particularly in the nuclear sphere, continue to pose a serious threat to international peace and security. Moreover, the arms race remains, we feel, a grave threat to the survival of all of mankind.\nThe Government of the People's Republic of Angola is convinced that a policy of dialogue and harmonization is the only assurance of a genuine policy for reducing conflicts and tensions among nations thus creating a climate of trust conducive not only to the peaceful settlement of disputes but also to disarmament. We therefore welcome the historic meeting between the leaders of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany which took place less than three weeks ago, as well as the agreement of principle reached between the Soviet Union and the United States of America several days ago to sign a treaty on the total elimination of medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe.\nThe problems of development are inseparable from the problem of peace.\nWithout peace there is no stability and without stability there will be no possibility of development. The implementation of the development programmes in our country is inseparable from political and economic stability. This requires solving the so-called regional conflicts which some of our countries have faced either directly or indirectly. In our humble opinion these efforts for peace should be made by the international community as a whole. For that reason the Government of the People's Republic of Angola supports the idea of the creation of a fund for the economic and social development of the developing countries.\nIndeed, the problem of underdevelopment facing most of the third-world countries is widening the gap that already exists between the rich and poor nations and thus constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.\nIn this context, we hail the holding, under the auspices of the United Nations, of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. To be sure, much remains to be done: there are many gaps in the final document and it does not reflect all the hopes of the underdeveloped countries, particularly the hope for the establishment of a development fund for the developing countries. The holding of the Conference and the adoption by consensus of a final document by the Conference, despite the attempts to frustrate it, are, in any case, an important milestone in the efforts we are all making to attain our objectives of peace and security. It marks a beginning and we hope that this trend will continue and increase and that it will yield much more tangible results for the benefit of peace and development.\nMoved as we are by the desire to contribute to the attainment of the objectives of the United Nations Charter, the African countries are sparing no effort to keep our continent free of nuclear weapons. The People's Republic of Angola feels that the proclamation of the southern Atlantic as a zone of peace and co-operation, free of nuclear arms and military pacts, is a sure way to guarantee peaceful co-existence. In this context, the independence of Namibia, on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) , and the elimination of apartheid would also contribute to strengthening international security and co-operation in the region in the mutual interests of the countries of the southern Atlantic region.\nAllow me to express our profound gratitude for the untiring efforts of the international community and of the United Nations to find fair and lasting solutions to the problems of our times. Nevertheless, I cannot fail to express my concern at the fact that there remain many unresolved issues, such as decolonisation, apartheid, famine and drought.\nSince its independence almost 12 years ago the Government of the People's Republic of Angola has followed a policy of non-alignment and peaceful coexistence. This policy is set down in its constitutional law, which establishes, as clearly as possible, its intention to maintain diplomatic relations with all the countries of the world on the basis of mutual respect, sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-aggression and non-interference in the internal affairs of each State, and respect for the norms of international law governing relations among independent States.\nUnfortunately, in the sub-region of southern Africa, a reactionary and anachronistic regime, that of racist South Africa, continues to flout United Nations resolutions and arrogantly carries out, with impunity, acts of subversion and destabilization against the countries of the area, including my own, with the sole purpose of perpetuating its illegal occupation of Namibia and thereby delay the elimination of the odious system of apartheid.\nWe are a people that cherishes peace and justice, but ever since our country achieved independence we have not known a single day of peace. In an undeclared war imposed on it, Angola has been victimized by acts of armed aggression on the part of the racist regime of South Africa. Our people and our Government are thus obliged to make enormous sacrifices for the effects of the war are fraught with heavy consequences in terms of our financial, material and human resources and inevitably undermine the economic and social development of our country.\nIn this unjust war imposed on us by South Africa, women, children and the elderly have no defence, and our basic infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, railroads, hospitals, schools and industrial plants, is not spared; these are indeed the preferred targets of the South African army and its UNITA auxiliary forces.\nThe damage suffered by our country as a result of the atrocities committed by the South African regular army and the UNITA puppets is estimated today at more than $US 12 billion. That figure does not include lost earnings resulting from the fact that our young people are engaged in military service, instead of attending school or working in factories where they would be contributing to increasing production and improving the living standard of our population.\nAfter achieving independence at the cost of great sacrifices our people aspire to life in peace and the reconstruction of their country; they wish to build a strong nation by exploiting the vast natural potential of our soil.\nContrary to what some of the media would have international public opinion believe, there is no civil war in our country, it is in fact a case of foreign invasion of a State Member of the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, part of whose territory remains occupied by the racist South African troops. That is why the People's Republic of Angola continues to demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of South African troops from the southern part of its territory.\nSouth Africa is using Namibia's territory as a springboard for acts of aggression against Angolan territory. Thus South African military bases - where armed bandits and mercenaries are trained and later sent to our territory, and from where South African troops carry out incursions into our territory - are to be found in the north of occupied Namibia.\nIn the face of these facts, and based on the rights recognized under international law and the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter, particularly Article 51 the Government of the People's Republic of Angola has appealed for assistance from friendly countries, in particular Cuba and the Soviet Union - assistance for which we wish once again to express our gratitude.\nNevertheless, aware of the complexity of the situation in southern Africa and in order to remove the impasse created by South Africa and its allies with regard to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) , the Government of the People's Republic of Angola submitted an approach to global negotiations contained in its letter, dated 17 November 1984, addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, by the President of the People's Republic of Angola, Mr. Jose Eduardo Dos Santos.\nDespite this gesture of understanding and goodwill on the part of the Angolan Government, the plan for the independence of Namibia still faces the intransigence of the Government of South Africa and its allies.\nOnce again, in a spirit of co-operation and openness, ray Government very recently proposed to the parties concerned, the general framework for a comprehensive agreement on the settlement of the Namibian question, a solution taking into account not only the legitimate right of the people of Namibia - under the leadership of its sole, genuine representative, the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) - to self-determination and independence, in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1970) , but also the right of the other countries of the region to live in peace and security. The agreement would be signed by the representatives of the Governments of Angola, Cuba and South Africa and of SWAPO, under the auspices of the Security Council or its permanent members.\nMoreover, the recent talks held in Luanda between representatives of the \nAngolan Government and the United States Administration clearly show my Government's constant readiness to seek a solution to the problems of peace and security in southern Africa. It is now up to the regime of South Africa and the United States Administration to accept or reject this new olive branch. If they persist in their obstinacy, history will judge them, for in wanting to link the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) to the withdrawal of the internationalist Cuban troops from Angola the South African regime and its allies are simply invoking a cowardly and fallacious pretext to prevent the independence of Namibia and allow South Africa to continue using its territory as a base for aggression against and the destabilization of the People's Republic of Angola and other States of southern Africa, thus interfering with our efforts for national reconstruction.\nTwenty years have now elapsed since the establishment of the United Nations Council for Namibia. But we must note that implementation of its mandate is being obstructed by the intransigence of the apartheid regime. Such behaviour is possible only because of the support and encouragement that some Western countries continue to give it. In view of the illegal occupation of Namibia by the South African regime, the international community must now adopt firm measures to ensure that international legal order is restored.\nIn South Africa we are witnessing extremely violent confrontations between the power of the white racist minority on the one hand and the oppressed and exploited black people on the other hand. New facts, however, have recently surfaced. Some elements of the white minority are beginning to understand that only a policy of dialogue and harmony can avoid a bloodbath with unforeseeable consequences. Thus, a delegation of white South Africans met with a delegation of the African National Congress (ANC) in Senegal. This is one more proof that many members of the white minority recognize the role of the ANC in the solution of the problem of South Africa. The People's Republic of Angola commends the courageous action of that group of South African citizens who have dared to defy the repressive power of apartheid. We feel that such initiatives open the way to a peaceful solution in South Africa and should be encouraged.\nUnfortunately, despite these positive steps, the present political picture within South Africa remains sombre. The racist regime continues to use oppression as its main weapon against the patriots of South Africa, as was the case in the recent cruel repression of the striking miners, who were seeking fair wages and the satisfaction of their just social claims. This alarming situation in South Africa presents a greater challenge than ever before to the international community, which should without further delay tackle the root causes of these phenomena that are endangering regional and international security and stability. The total elimination of apartheid and the end of the illegal occupation of Namibia must therefore be demanded.\nConsequently, the Government of the People's Republic of Angola believes that comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter should be imposed as a form of pressure on the racist South African Government,\nIt is disquieting to note that despite some encouraging signs the international situation continues to be darkened by the persistence of various other hotbeds of tension.\nOn the African continent the Western Sahara conflict continues to affect the lives of the people of the territory. We believe that the implementation of resolution AHG/104 of the 19th Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) would make a great contribution to the settlement of the conflict. We therefore appeal to the parties concerned to continue the dialogue begun through the intermediary of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Concerning Chad, we hope that peace will be restored in that country in the interest of well-being and social progress of its people.\nThe Middle East, where the State of Israel continues to carry out its aggressive expansionist policies against the Arab people, is another source of serious concern for us. We reaffirm the sacred and inalienable right of the Palestinian people, under the enlightened leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (FLO), to form their own State. We thus support the idea of convening an international conference on the Palestinian problem, with the participation of the PLO, and hope that this session can take the relevant measures to bring this about as rapidly as possible.\nWe advocate respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon and the safeguarding of its independence, and we oppose foreign interference in the internal affairs of that State.\nThe war between Iran and Iraq cannot fail to concern us, too, since it is a war between two non-aligned countries that seriously threatens international peace and security. We hope for an early end to that war.\nWe also note with great concern that the question of East Timor remains deadlocked. We call for a dialogue between Indonesia and Portugal, with the mediation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, to find a just and lasting solution that takes into account the interests and rights of the Maubere people. The situation in the Korean peninsula is also a source of alarm for us. We welcome the initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea concerning the reunification of the great homeland of the Koreans and cannot support the admission of the two parties separately to the great family of the United Nations.\n We welcome with great satisfaction the initiatives of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea with regard to its policy of national reconciliation and are convinced that these will contribute to peace and stability in the region.\nIn Latin America, we welcome the positive results achieved by the Heads of State of the five Central American countries - Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala - at their last meeting and hope that these results will contribute to peace and thereby reduce instances of foreign interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the region.\nWe condemn the policy of intimidation, aggression, blackmail and economic blockade directed against Cuba and advocate the immediate cessation of the occupation of the Guantanamo base.\nWe reaffirm our support for the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence, in accordance with resolution 1514 (XV) and the Declaration adopted by the Eighth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Harare, Zimbabwe, last year.\nThe world economic situation has hardly improved since the last session of the General Assembly, and the economic and financial crisis has become established and taken root in all the developing countries. The growing indebtedness is preventing those countries from carrying out their national recovery plans and becoming, as a result, an additional factor of instability and insecurity.\nThe absence of the political will on the part of some developed countries to respond to the appeals of the international community, the arms race and the political instability created in some regions have helped to make the imbalance already existing in international economic relations even worse. The present structural crisis is also the result of the anachronistic development of the world economic system, which is shown by the fact that some countries are becoming ever richer, while the overwhelming majority of countries are becoming ever poorer and lack the means with which to tackle the problems of under development.\nThe foreign debt is the clearest indicator of the scope and gravity of the world economic crisis. To deal with this, political effort and will are necessary not only on the part of the developing countries, which are at present the most affected, but also and above all on the part of the developed countries.\nThe Government of the People's Republic of Angola continues to advocate the establishment of a new international economic order as an effective tool for overcoming the crisis and restoring balance to international economic relations.\nWith regard to the present financial and monetary system, we feel that our action should be oriented towards its restructuring as quickly as possible so that the developing countries can participate in the taking of decisions and profit as much as possible thereby. Scrupulous respect by the developed countries, for the principles, rules and norms in force in this area would also contribute to avoiding deterioration of the situation and exacerbation of the crisis\nThe proliferation of discriminatory measures imposed by the developed countries in their trade with the developing countries, protectionism and other restrictive measures are resulting in the reduction of the earnings from products exported by the developing countries and a consequent reduction in the resources and funds available for development. However, all these measures required of the developed countries should not prevent the developing countries from themselves taking steps to restructure the management of their economies in such a way as to facilitate the task of those of the rich countries that wish to help them to overcome the crisis. \nMy country has just taken various measures along those lines. In this context, the People's Republic of Angola reaffirms the importance of the ratification by both developed and developing countries of the Integrated Programme for Commodities, dealt with in resolution 93 (IV) of the fourth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD IV) , and its Fund in order to permit its rapid entry into force. We therefore welcome the Soviet Government's decision to subscribe to the Fund.\nIn the context of co-operation, the People's Republic of Angola also reaffirms the role of economic co-operation between developing countries - South-South co-operation - as a means of promoting the rational and effective use of their human, material, financial and technological resources. In this context, co-operation between the States of southern Africa in the framework of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) has already yielded significant results in various sectors, as acknowledged by the regional Heads of State or Government at their last summit meeting in Lusaka.\nHowever, we recognize that much remains to be done. The convening by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) next December of a conference of Heads of State and Government devoted to the foreign debt of the African countries reflects the importance that our countries attach to this problem and the political will to combine their efforts to redress Africa's economic situation.\nIn reviewing all these situations, we have tried to interpret in our own way the problems of peace and development and to express our desire for the progress and well-being of all mankind. In this context, we reaffirm our devotion to the principles of the United Nations and to multilateralism as a whole as an instrument for seeking solutions to the complex problems of a world that is growing more and more interdependent.\nThe struggle continues. Victory is certain.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the Chadian delegation I congratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside over the forty-second session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that under your leadership the session will examine vigorously and effectively the matters on its agenda. You may rest assured of the full co-operation of my delegation during this session. I should also like to express my delegation's gratitude and thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, who conducted the proceedings of the General Assembly at its forty-first session with such skill and tact.\nI wish to take this opportunity also to pay a well deserved tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for the tireless and constant efforts he has made to promote peace and development.\nWe are happy to see a friend of Chad, Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed, occupying the place of the person responsible in the Secretariat for matters relating to the General Assembly. He can count on our support to succeed in his new tasks.\nIn recent years my country, Chad, has experienced particularly difficult situations, which almost put into question its very existence as a State. Not only was there chaos because of the aggression and occupation carried out by Libya, but natural disasters added their calamitous consequences.\nFor a long time Chad's enemies succeeded, through all kinds of tactics, in pitting Chadians one against the other, transforming an international dispute into merely a domestic one. Now that these sordid and dilatory manoeuvres have been exposed thanks to the awareness of all Chadians that they belong to one, single nation, united Chad has come face to face with its true enemy, its neighbour Libya, which because of its territorial greed and its desire for hegemony is occupying and attacking our country.\nLibyan aggression and occupation were unmasked at the beginning of this year through the heroic attacks of Chadian patriots, who destroyed the powerful air and land bases built by Libya on Chadian territory. Faaa, Ouadi, Doum, Faya, Zouar, Ounianga, Bardai, Wour and Aouzou have all become graveyards for the occupier and incontestable proof of its aggression against Chad.\nThe powerful equipment of these air and land bases proves irrefutably that Libya had no intention of leaving Chad. On the contrary, the mass occupation of its townships deep inside internationally recognized borders clearly indicates the diabolical and hegemonistic designs of the Libyan regime.\nThis Libyan aggression against Chad has today been recognized by all States who sincerely love peace, justice and freedom.\nOn the basis of a still-born Franco-Italian agreement, the fascist and racist regime of Tripoli has since 1973 beleaguered the Chadian area of Aouzou, from which it organized armed aggression against the rest of Chadian territory, spreading its occupation over the whole area of Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti - some 550,000 square kilometres.\nIs there any need to remind you that Qadaffi dreams of creating a so-called United States of the Sahel, of which he would be the leader? According to Qaddafi's logic, Chad should serve as a stepping-stone to the achievement of these colonial objectives of another age.\nWhile reserving the right to use any means to recover the occupied territories, Chad is sparing no effort to bring Qaddafi back to his senses by peaceful means. Chad has always loyally co-operated with the Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), set up in Libreville in 1977. This Committee has therefore been studying this conflict for ten years, but because of Libya's arrogant and contemptuous refusal to co-operate in its activities, the\nHoc Committee has to date been unable to take a final decision. Libya's bad faith and dilatory tactics, and its contempt for the Pan-African organization, for the United Nations system and for law in general are now well-established facts.\nThis is proved by the fact that Libya did not attend the meetings of the Committee and of the Sub-Committee of Experts held from 28 to 29 April and 18 to 20 May 1987 at Libreville under resolution AHG/RES.ISB (XXII) of the OAU. By the same token, though explicitly invited by the OAU at its twenty-third summit meeting to take part in a meeting of Heads of State who were members of the Ad Hoc Committee on the dispute between Libya and Chad, Qaddafi did not deign to make the trip to Lusaka on 23 September 1987.\nConfronted with such a contemptuous attitude, the Chadian government thought it necessary to bring this dispute to the General Assembly so that the whole world would be aware of the barbarous actions of the Gaddafi regime. The inclusion of the question of the aggression and occupation of Chad by Libya in the agenda is in keeping with this logic.\nOur action is well founded for day after day Libya is violating the cease-fire requested by the Acting President of the OAU, to which it freely subscribed.\nIndeed, scorning, as usual, the appeal made by the Acting President of the OAU, Libya is obstinately continuing to violate Chadian air space, concentrate its troops on the border and in the area of Aouzou, and engage in massive recruitment of mercenaries of all nationalities, especially Palestinians and Lebanese.\nThis bad faith was evidenced at Lusaka by Libya's refusal to accede to the Ad Hoc Committee's request that it hand over any relevant documentation within a month.\nIn fact, Libya has no documentation to support its claims. It is merely playing for time. Because of all the international agreements between the administering Powers of Chad and Libya and those between independent Libya and Prance, and later between Libya and independent Chad, Aouzou is Chadian territory. We have brought proof of this to the Security Council just as we did before the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU. We defy Libya to do the same.\nWhen a State, like Qaddafi's Libya, defies the entire international community so blatantly, international law and morality demand that it be treated as an outlaw, that it be condemned for its acts and all the ills it causes other States and their peoples. Through me, Chad therefore calls on the international community to assume its responsibility and demand that Libya act in conformity with the law and with the relevant principles set forth in the United Nations Charter and in that of the OACJ, as well as resolution AHG/RES. 16 (I), which enshrines the principle of the intangibility of frontiers inherited from colonial times. For this the international community must demand that Libya immediately and unconditionally withdraw its wild and barbarous hordes from Chadian territory. Moreover, the human and material losses inflicted on Chad by the Libyan regime are immeasurable. It goes without saying that Libya owes Chad compensation for war crimes, and the international community has a moral obligation to demand that Chad be compensated. \nThe war of aggression the Tripoli regime is imposing against Chad has destroyed its entire economic infrastructure and disorganized its administration. The government of the Third Republic has attempted to restore State authority and rehabilitate the economy. The support of the international community has been decisive in implementing the reconstruction programme. In this connection, in November 1982 friendly countries and international organizations, together with the Government of Chad, laid down the main direction for such rehabilitation. In December 19S5 international solidarity was again demonstrated when we passed from the phase of rehabilitation to that of reconstruction and development. Here again, the conference of donor countries held at Geneva enabled Chad to work out a temporary development plan that is now being implemented, and that plan, if totally carried through within the necessary time-limits, would enable Chad to attain its 1978 growth level, which should constitute a solid basis for recovery of the national economy.\nDespite the encouraging results achieved in restoring the economy, many obstacles still remain. Indeed, so long as the production capabilities of other sectors of the economy are not strengthened, the State will remain alone to face the actual needs of Chadian society.\nThe decrease in the price of cotton, Chad's main export, which represents 3 5 per cent of its budgetary resources, has considerably reduced our State's scope of action. The situation is even more serious since the cotton industry, which is the basis of most of our modern production and distribution sector and which is the country's main income-producing element, now has a serious deficit. This crisis has of course influenced the country's overall industrial activities. The budget deficit, which the State is attempting to contain, remains. Taxes on the export of cotton have been suspended, and the State must go deeper into debt to support that industry's restructuring activities. further, drought has gravely affected if not decimated livestock, which represents the other essential element of the national economy. This has brought total poverty to cattle raisers whose sole source of income was cattle breeding.\nThanks to the assistance of certain international bodies the Government is trying to reconstitute herds, but such actions, encouraging as they are, require long-term planning in order to ensure proper health in the herds. In addition, the cattle raisers most affected should receive assistance either to reconstitute their herds or to shift to other productive activities.\nTo problems involving the depletion of budgetary resources we must add the strict minimum the State must provide persons displaced either by Libya's war of aggression or by drought and desertification.\nIn this connection the situation of the populations in the Bokou-Ennedi-Tibesti area deserves the special attention of the international community, and particularly of humanitarian organizations. Those populations, who were forced to flee the Libyan invasion in 1983, abandoning all their property, and who are today attempting to return to their recently liberated townships and villages, are the innocent victims of random bombings and other barbarous actions by the Tripoli regime.\nSuch combined problems further reduce the financial means the State should normally be devoting to improving socio-economic structures. If the agricultural picture of 1986-1987 was relatively good thanks to sufficient rainfall throughout the national territory, the present year will be bad because of the unequal rainfall over time. Further, we are experiencing an increase in locusts and grasshoppers, which are estimated to number 1,400,000 per hectare in certain areas. That situation dangerously compromises the goal of food self-sufficiency set by the Chadian Government. \nAfter the heavy rains at the end of May and beginning of June the situation suddenly worsened throughout the month of July and drought has destroyed first growth in some areas. We are therefore again forced to address an appeal to the international community to express its solidarity once more and to help us to augment our own efforts.\nThe economic recession, which has led the world to the present crisis, is far from over. For the developing countries of Asia, Latin America and Africa, the crisis has serious repercussions that have compelled those countries, lacking in resources as they are, to review their development strategies.\nThus Africa is in the throes of a particularly acute economic crisis exacerbated by the fall in raw-material prices. This situation, marked by a widening in the gap between industrialized and raw-material-exporting countries, was brought to the attention of the international community in 1986. A special session of the United Nations General Assembly was devoted to the critical economic situation in Africa. A year later, we may question the benefits of that session. Although the majority of African countries are embarked on a basic restructuring of their economies, the expected outside assistance has barely begun to trickle in. Together with the natural disasters that have stricken some African countries, efforts at restructuring, if not supported by a sizeable inflow of capital from outside, and especially from the developed countries, will be doomed to futility.\nEvidence of this is the fact that at present the African countries are experiencing greater outflows of capital than they are taking in. It goes without saying that repayment of principal and debt-servicing are in large part responsible for this imbalance that is so seriously affecting the growth policies of African countries. In addition, it would be highly desirable if concrete measures could be taken to find a solution to the debt problem. \nIn addition to the serious economic problems, there are the armed conflicts that are delaying the progress of developing peoples. The conflicts shaking Africa and Asia, as well as Latin America, are also of concern to my delegation.\nWith regard to the Middle East, Chad has always supported the Palestinian cause. At the Islamic summit meeting at Kuwait in January of this year. President Al-Hadj Hissein Habr\u00e9 stated; '\\\"The Republic of Chad is at one with the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people, and we thus support the idea of an international conference to be held under the aegis of the United Nations.\\\"\nHowever, we were astonished to learn that Palestinian brothers have been recruited, at considerable cost, to fight against the people of Chad in Chad'. Are we to understand that our Palestinian brothers have abandoned the liberation struggle of their own country, or are they merely giving in to the temptations of the international mercenary system?\nWe would ask the same question of the Lebanese who have followed suit. Would those Lebanese not be better off striving to protect the unity and independence of their own country?\nIn the Persian Gulf the war between two fraternal countries, Iraq and Iran, is continuing, in spite of the many appeals and efforts at mediation and in spite of Iraq's oft-repeated readiness to enter into dialogue. My delegation unreservedly supports the implementation of Security Council resolution 590 (1987) , unanimously adopted on 20 July 1987.\nThe occupation of Afghanistan has been going on for eight years, in spite of the numerous resolutions of the General Assembly calling for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from that country. Like any foreign occupation, this one has pernicious effects that often drive those concerned into exile. Chad, which has experienced Libyan occupation, can only express its total sympathy to the Afghan people in their struggle for national liberation. Africa remains infected by the odious apartheid system. The minority racist regime of South Africa continues to keep the black majority outside the management of the country's affairs and deprives it of\\\" all rights. That same policy has been extended to Namibia, where the fascist regime of Pretoria defies the United Nations by refusing to put an end to its occupation and apply Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nTo perpetuate its domination, the minority regime spares no effort to destabilize the front-line countries, which are the frequent victims of murderous South African raids conducted under the pretext that fighters from the liberation movements of southern Africa are harboured by those States.\nThe liberation movements and the front-line States can rest assured of the firm support of Chad. My delegation reiterates the frequent appeals to South Africa to cease its incursions into the territories of the front-line States, withdraw unconditionally from Namibia and immediately start to set up a multiracial society in which all communities can participate on an equal basis in the management of the affairs of the State.\nThe people of Democratic Kampuchea has suffered for many years from the horrors of a war of occupation imposed upon it by Viet Nam. My country, which has always supported the efforts of the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and those of the United Nations to ensure respect for the independence and sovereignty of Kampuchea, demands the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all occupation troops to enable the Kampuchean people freely to decide on its fate, under the direction of the legitimate Government, led by His Royal Highness Samdech Norodom Sihanouk.\nWith regard to Central America, we encourage the peaceful initiatives of the Contadora Group and express the hope that the peace plan proposed by Mr. Oscar Arias Sanchez, President of the Republic of Costa Rica, will make it possible finally to find a lasting solution to the problems of the area.\nAs everyone knows, peace has no price. It is, indeed, the fundamental condition of any social and economic progress. However, some States Members of our Organization like to create conflicts and exacerbate them to serve their diabolical plans for domination, well aware that they are violating the United Nations Charter, to which they have committed themselves.\nChad believes in the virtues of dialogue and has never missed an opportunity to show this. It believes that the United Nations must be involved more deeply in the search for solutions to certain so-called regional conflicts. The United Nations would thus be working for peace and in favour of the law, in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter. In expressing the wish that States would act more in conformity with the principles of the Charter, which they accepted by becoming Members of the United Nations, the delegation of Chad reaffirms its full faith in the Organization and expresses the wish that this session will find the solutions so long desired for the problems which are a matter of such deep concern to us.\n: \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates, I am pleased to extend to the President our congratulations on his election to his office at this forty-second session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that with his ability, wisdom and experience he will fulfil his task with great efficiency and distinction.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation and thanks to the outgoing President, Mr. Huroayun Choudhury, for his able leadership and distinguished contributions to the work of the previous session - a session during which the United Nations faced one of its most challenging problems. On this occasion I should like to stress once again our confidence in the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and our deep appreciation of the steps he has undertaken to bolster the Organization, and also of the efforts and initiatives he has put forth to solve existing problems and disputes through peaceful means.\nIn his latest report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General stated from the outset that greater solidarity among nations had been evident in handling serious problems with global implications throughout the past year. We observed: \\\"This can provide a promising basis for broadened multilateral co-operation and increased effectiveness of the United Nations.\\\" (\u041b/42/1, pt2| While we share this hope and this vision with the Secretary-General, we should like to point out that this year has been characterized by international multilateral actions aimed at settling conflicts through diplomacy or through resort to United Nations organs. We therefore urge that this method be reinforced and that it be given more momentum in order that we may achieve what we all yearn for: international peace and security on the basis of justice, and the attainment of the rights of all people without discrimination.\nFar from being new, our call is based on the principles and convictions that guide the foreign policy of our country. Foremost among these is our commitment to the United Nations Charter, our support for the United Nations organs, and our unshakeable belief in the peaceful settlement of conflicts between States.\nOur very nature makes our commitment to the Charter even firmer. Being a small developing country, we believe that adherence to the principles of the Charter by all States, especially those which have special international responsibilities, is the only effective guarantee of our security. Because of our experience as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, we cannot but emphasize the need to strengthen the system of collective security and enhance the role of the United Nations, including use of the Security Council on a more regular basis and resort to it for preventive measures. Moreover, we should make use of the Council as a forum for negotiations on outstanding international problems. The Council should also convene at the highest possible level in order to discuss at length, and with fairness and detachment, the causes underlying the United Nations failure to implement the functions provided for in the Charter. These functions embody the essence of international organization, in that they reflect the desire of the international community to have a world in which equality and justice reign supreme, unhampered by war and armed conflicts.\nThe Iran-Iraq war has entered its eighth year. Far from abating, the war has expanded over the past twelve months or so in a manner that has ramifications not only for the two warring parties but for others also. Military fleets and vessels are as numerous and ubiquitous in the Gulf waters as commercial vessels. If this portends anything, it is the danger that threatens international shipping, and the feeling of fear and tension engendered by the spiralling escalation of the war. The events of the last few days should serve as a stern warning of other battles that may erupt/ with inestimable and uncontrollable results.\nThis tragic development gave rise to lengthy negotiations and to concerted efforts with a view to containing the ongoing war by pursuing a political settlement. Finally, international efforts bore fruit and the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 598 (1987). Jointly with other members, notably the non-aligned States, my country participated in the efforts that led to the adoption of that resolution. Not only is the resolution balanced, but it also takes into account .the legitimate interests of the two parties in the conflict. Like the other members of the Security Council and the world in general, we believe that Security Council resolution 598 (1987) outlines an integrated approach to ending the war and settling all outstanding problems between the two warring parties by peaceful means. Furthermore, the resolution represents a unique, historic opportunity for a peaceful and just settlement of the conflict. We strongly urge everyone to take this opportunity.\nThe Secretary-General's visit to Iran and Iraq, coupled with his tireless efforts and the discussions he had with the two patties, enhanced the hope of a political settlement. Needless to say, we are fully aware of how much needs to be done to achieve the objectives that we all cherish. Although we stress the need for maintaining the unified position of the members of the Security Council, we do not believe that this should be at the expense of the implementation of the resolution. In our view, both are of great importance. My country has always been prepared to contribute to all political efforts to bring about a just and peaceful settlement that will safeguard the legitimate interests of the two parties. We have participated in efforts of this nature through different channels. Our efforts in this direction will continue, because peace is a noble cause.\nWe reject the use of holy shrines for political propaganda, as happened recently in the case of the holy mosque of Mecca Al Mokarama. We also reject the dragging in of parties that have nothing to do with the war, as happened recently with the acts of aggression against our sister State, Kuwait.\nWith regard to the Middle East, to say that the situation there is at a standstill would be an understatement. Indeed, things have gone from bad to worse. The Israeli forces of occupation are still on Arab land. The Palestinian people are still living in forced exile, scattered all over the world and barred from exercising their rights. As far as the tragedy of Palestine is concerned, this year evokes painful memories. Exactly 70 years ago a declaration was made without Palestinian consent. This was the Balfour Declaration, the landmark in the process which led to the emergence of the Zionist State. This year, 40 years have passed since the partition resolution was adopted by the General Assembly. That resolution, which led to the creation of Israel against the backdrop of special international circumstances, was a travesty of law and justice. This year, 1987, also marks the passage of 20 years since Israel completed the usurpation of Palestine and conquered parts of the neighbouring Arab countries.\nWhile we may speak with optimism about the progress achieved this year with regard to international co-operation in the field of the peaceful settlement of conflicts, we can hardly do the same when it comes to the Middle East. All initiatives and attempts to break the stalemate on Middle East problems and the Palestine question have foundered. The prospects of a peaceful and honourable settlement ate as bleak as ever, despite the almost universal consensus on the need to convene an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations, as stipulated in resolution\u00b7 38/58 G, and despite the efforts of the Secretary-General. In the words of the Secretary-General:\n\\\"Unfortunately, it has not yet proved possible to obtain the agreement of all the parties to the principle of an international conference...\\\" (A/42/1, p. 3) We all know who supports the principle of a peace conference and who does not. So far, Israel and its supporters have resorted to stalling tactics and procrastination.\nWe wish to underscore once more the right of the Palestinian people, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, to participate on an equal footing in any effort to find to a just solution of the Middle East conflict. As we all know, the Palestine problem lies at the heart of this conflict and, a priori, a Middle East peace conference should be convened on the basis of this principle.\nIn Lebanon, Israel persists in its defiance of the will of the international community. It still occupies parts of Lebanese territory in violation of numerous United Nations resolutions, including Security Council resolutions 508 (1982) and 509 (1982), which explicitly call on Israel to withdraw forthwith and unconditionally. In addition Israel interferes directly in internal Lebanese affairs and continues its attacks against Lebanese towns and villages by land, sea and air.\nWe salute the heroic struggle of the Lebanese resistance against the forces of Israeli occupation, but at the same time we appeal to our brothers in Lebanon to settle their differences and close their ranks so that Lebanon may regain its strength and ensure its freedom and Independence.\nThe situation in southern Africa and the absence of a peaceful settlement there arouse our utmost concern. The reasons for this stalemate are not hard to pinpoint. The white racist minority Government of South Africa tenaciously holds to its apartheid ideology and practices in an attempt to perpetuate its position of dominance and socio-economic affluence. It deprives Namibia of its independence, and employs its war machine in acts of aggression against the African front-line States.\nWe strongly deplore the system of apartheid of the racist regime in Pretoria, which denies the basic rights of the black majority population, in violation of the principles of the Charter, international law and justice. We also deplore the stalling tactics used by the apartheid regime to prevent the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which provides for Namibia's independence. We oppose with equal vigour the attempts to establish a linkage between the implementation of that resolution and external issues that concern the sovereignty of a neighbouring State, Our support for the noble struggle of the Namibian people, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's\nOrganization (SWAPO), is as firm as ever. Victory, freedom and independence, we believe, are the fruits that the Namibian people will reap. My country strongly condemns the continued acts of aggression, terrorism and destabilization perpetrated by the Pretoria regime against neighbouring African States.\nGuided by the principle which governs our position with regard to South Africa, my country has always endorsed the draft resolutions submitted to the Security Council with a view to the imposition of mandatory economic sanctions against the apartheid regime. This, we believe, is the ideal course of action to force Pretoria to abandon its policy of apartheid.\nThe central principle underlying the establishment of the United Nations is the preservation of international peace and security to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which in the- life-span of one generation had twice inflicted on humanity untold sorrow and pain. That goal will continue to elude us for as long as the arms race persists and the stockpiling of nuclear and conventional weapons continues unabated. It is disarmament on the basis of balanced military reductions that holds the promise of establishing the edifice of peace and preventing war. In view of this, we welcome the recent agreement between the two super-Powers on the elimination of intermediate-range nuclear missiles and consider it to be an important step on the road to disarmament. We sincerely hope that the forthcoming super-Power summit meeting will help to accelerate this process. \t\nIn this regard we wish to encourage once again the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones, in particular in the Middle East, We also reiterate our support for and commitment to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, adopted by the United Nations.\nI have outlined in my opening remarks the principles which guide and regulate our foreign policy with respect to international problems. Among the most important are the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries, the non-use of force or the threat of force and the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means.\nWe therefore call for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan and urge all outside parties not to interfere in the country's internal affairs. The people of Afghanistan should be allowed to choose for themselves the system of government that they desire. We are encouraged by the reports which suggest that the gap between the conflicting parties is narrowing. The same applies to Kampuchea, whose people have long suffered from the aggression and interference of outside Powers,\nIt also applies to the crisis-ridden region of Central America, As far as this region is concerned, we support the regional agreement signed on 7 August 1987 by the Presidents of El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras. That agreement contains the principal elements necessary for achieving a stable and permanent peace in Central America.\nConcerning Korea, we urge the north and the south to settle their differences: through free dialogue unhampered by pressure and pre-conditions. This should defuse the crisis and bring about the unity that the Koreans so earnestly seek. We also hope that the Secretary-General will proceed with his mediation efforts so that the differences between the two parties may be overcome. With regard to Cyprus, we ate saddened by the setback in the attempts to solve this problem. As the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization indicates the state of affairs in Cyprus gives increasing cause for concern ... The possibility of serious confrontations cannot be excluded in the months ahead if present trends continue.\\\" (A/42/1, p. 6)\nWe hope that the Secretary-General will continue his efforts to bring the points of view of the Turkish and Greek communities closer together. The ultimate objective is the achievement of a just, comprehensive and permanent settlement within whose framework security and coexistence will be ensured for the two communities. Such a settlement should also guarantee justice and equal rights for the two communities, as well as the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-aligned status of the Federal Republic of Cyprus.\nOn the international economic horizon the picture is dismal and uncertain. The world economy has slowed down considerably since the first half of the 1980s. Earlier events in 1986 and the first half of 1987 have failed to restore resiliency to the world economy and foster faster, stable growth. Last year's collapse of the price of oil and the steep fall in the value of the United States dollar have not produced the desired results. On the contrary, they have caused concern regarding inflationary expectations and the consequent rise in the interest rates in the industrialized world, weakening further the efforts of the debtor nations to lighten their burdens. Uncertainty over trade deficits in some key industrialized countries have triggered protectionist sentiments, causing anxiety concerning the developing countries' exports. It is important to note here that world prices for primary commodities are at their lowest level in 50 years. As a result, per capita incomes, in the developing countries are at their lowest level in the present decade. \nAt the centre of this bleak picture lie the world economy's three most pressing problems; exchange rate volatility, protectionism and the debts of the developing countries. They are all closely linked. A high degree of uncertainty with regard to these problems has caused a crisis of confidence among investors, leading to a deterioration in the world economic outlook.\nThe present situation inevitably gives rise to the question of the ability of the existing international system to cope with these strains. In view of all this, we believe that the existing economic order is not conducive to balanced and equitable development or to just relations of equality among States.\nWe emphasize that an expansive world economy and sustained economic growth are essential ingredients of the solution of the many complex problems that face the world community. Therefore renewed commitment by all nations and the revival of the North-South dialogue are necessary as the basis for restoring stability to the global economy.\nWe must therefore continue the efforts aimed at restructuring international economic relations on the basis of justice, equality and mutual interest. To this end, the industrial countries must demonstrate a positive attitude and undertake serious negotiations with the developing countries to promote the cause of development. We believe that it is the responsibility of those countries with the greatest influence on the world trade and finance markets to remedy the disarray in the world economy.\nThe solution of world economic problems will require large and often painful changes in the domestic policies of all countries. It is imperative that the major actors in the world economy overcome their preoccupation with domestic problems, internal disputes over trade and macro-economic problems in the common interest of all nations and the world economy in general. The United Nations reflects the hopes and expectations of the peoples of the world for the establishment of a world public order free from wars and confrontations, multilateral or bilateral, and based on the maintenance of peace and security and the realization of justice and equality. In order to achieve these noble goals, the Charter prescribed organs and mechanisms whose functions and achievements depend on solidarity and multilateral co-operation among all States. Several States, especially those with primary responsibilities, have disregarded these facts, which has resulted in a world order that is not in line with the hopes and expectations of those who drafted the Charter. Over the past year signs of a promising means of broadened multilateral coo-operation and the utilization of United Nations machinery has started to emerge. Now that a start has been made to move from the sad realities of the past to the promising signs of the present, we hope that in the future those encouraging signs will be transformed into practical realities, thus making our future brighter and more secure. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish at the outset to extend my personal congratulations, and those of the delegation of Belize to the President on his unanimous election to his high office at the forty-second session of this Assembly.\nWe follow in the footsteps of a great diplomat and friend of Belize, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury of Bangladesh, to whom I express sincere appreciation for his untiring efforts to generate harmony among the representatives of the world during the forty-first session.\nA special word of thanks is also due Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, our esteemed Secretary-General, whose guidance and statesmanship continue to sustain this Organization in its guest for peace in the world.\nAssailed by the criticisms of its detractors and beset by the woes of financial crises, the United Nations system nevertheless continues to articulate the vision of its founders and to provide a moral and practical framework for the ideal of an enlightened world order.\nThe proliferation of new States and the awesome developments in the technologies of destruction have combined to make the management of international relations a far more complex business than the framers of the Charter could ever have imagined. The challenge for the United Nations system has been to keep pace with the requirements of the contemporary era and to become more than a political talking shop and more than a sprawling and soulless bureaucracy.\nIt is one measure of its responsiveness to changing circumstances that the United Nations has latterly been examining its financial arrangements in order to make the Organization more viable and to quiet some of the voices of discontent. My delegation therefore applauds the new consensus mechanism agreed on by the budgetary committee. The arrangements represent a workable compromise which reflects the concerns of the larger contributors while preserving the all-important principle of equality of Member States. \nWe can have no truck with the suggestion that small States should be United in the exercise of their sovereignty by some diminished status in the United Nations system. Such an idea is antediluvian and regressive in the extreme. The notion of sovereign equality and the principle of majority rule are the very foundations of the moral authority of the United Nations system. And the right of developing countries to use their numerical strength to influence the world view expressed by this forum is the essence of an attempt at global democracy.\nNevertheless, it is a truism that every right carries a corresponding responsibility. Accordingly, the equality principle which informs the conceptual basis of our Organization must go hand in hand with the responsibility principle, which ought to underpin our decisions, resolutions and programmes of action.\nThe surest way to erode a right is to abuse it. And it is the perceived abuse of the process of majority rule that has generated the fiercest criticisms of this Organization. If the nay-sayers are to be silenced, the force of numbers - particularly in the General Assembly - must be used in an equitable fashion. The temptation to engage in strident and automatic name-calling must also be resisted so as to preserve pristine the moral force of our pronouncements.\nResponsibility and restraint must once again form the basis of debate and resolution. Then there will be no room for the argument that those Western democracies whose views do not necessarily coincide with those of the third-world majority would do best to turn their backs on us. We will still be an imperfect institution in an uncertain world, but that admission should spur us all into a search for ways to increase the effectiveness of our Organization, not question its fundamental importance as the embodiment of International ideals.\nThe United Nations does succeed in playing a moderating role in world affairs by making use of its global recognition and the public relations strength of its imprimatur or sanction. It is churlish not to concede that the United Nations has at least ensured that we do not return to the long-abandoned days of avowedly Darwinian international politics. As a small country, Belize understands too well the significance of a truly international forum whose collective authority is the ultimate guarantor of the sovereignty, integrity and dignity of small States everywhere.\nWe do not expect the United Nations to provide all the answers or to substitute for those necessary bilateral arrangements which must still be concluded directly between developed and developing nations But we do expect the United Nations generally to advance the interests and ideals of the world community and to endorse, facilitate and aid those national and regional initiatives which sustain the international order.\nOne such regional initiative that lends itself to United Nations approbation and support is the recently concluded Central American peace plan. That accord has emerged within the context of the Contadora initiative but is fashioned by the five States themselves involved in the Central American conflict. The plan has already advanced the peace process in Central America and has generally been hailed as providing the basis for a workable and just resolution to the region's problems.\nIt seems to us in Belize that if the future of Central America were to be left entirely in the hands of Central Americans, the agreements reached at Esquipulas could provide a real blueprint for the pacification of the region. But there are, as always, the complicating realities of geopolitics. \nIndeed, external interests have already intervened to give an East-West dimension to a conflict whose origins are rooted in local conditions. In these circumstances, it is clear to my delegation that all of Latin America needs to speak out in support of what is proposed by the region to solve a conflict in the region. External forces acting on the basis of ideological opportunism should not be allowed to defeat indigenous political will. The process of democratisation in Central America must be worked out in site, and not according to some received wisdom stamped \\\" Made in the metropolis\\\".\nThe initial promise of success of the Central American peace accord owes much to the determination of the leaders and peoples of the isthmus. That such a breakthrough could have occurred signals the possibilities for solutions to other hemispheric crises.\nBelizeans are profoundly concerned that national violence once again threatens to consume the independent Republic of Haiti. We understand the people's determination to participate fully in deciding the future direction of their country, and we are conscious that free and fair elections are the first step along the path to political stability, economic recovery and the reduction of social misery. We therefore urge the Government of Haiti to ensure that the already precarious transition to constitutional rule is not further imperilled.\nA return to democracy Is also imminent in the Caribbean nation of Suriname. Belize applauds that country's decision to allow international observers to be present at the elections set for November. We hope that the current difficulties can be overcome and the time-table set adhered to, so that political power can be handed back to the people as scheduled.\nOf interest to us also is the recent Initiative by Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines towards unification of the eastern Caribbean States. While full consultation with the people of those nations would be essential before any proposal for political union could be implemented, there are obvious advantages to be gained from unity.\nBetter use of regional expertise, a larger market for domestic goods and more effective and less costly representation abroad are all sufficiently important that they should not be countered with automatic and unthinking assertions about the pre-eminence of political independence. In the case of my own Government  we have been encouraged to redouble our efforts to seek an honourable end to the long-standing problem with our neighbouring Central American State of Guatemala. After six years of uninterrupted enjoyment of independent nationhood Belize has forged its own international personality and established itself firmly among the nations of the world. There is no room in the contemplation of our continued existence for the encouragement of the pretension to all or part of our territory by another State.\nWith the passage of time, with the universal acknowledgement of our independent reality and against the background of the democratic transformations emerging in our region, my Government feels that there is now a favourable climate for some degree of normalization to take place in relations between Belize and Guatemala.\nI say this despite the fact that the talks which took place in April of this year between the two countries failed to produce a breakthrough. Indeed, the Republic of Guatemala insisted on the cession o\u00a3 Belizean land as the price for a settlement. Comforted by the continuing support which enlightened nations of the world community give us, Belize totally rejected the Guatemalan position.\nNevertheless, we have agreed to continue talking. Developments have taken place in Guatemala which incline us to feel that the April position was no more than a temporary hiccup in the negotiating process and that the formula can still be found for peaceful and active coexistence between neighbours.\nWe look forward not only to a diplomatic accommodation with Guatemala but also to the economic co-operation that would surely follow. For the preservation and consolidation of political independence fulfil only part of the obligations of sovereign Governments. The guest for national dignity can succeed only when we satisfy the economic needs of our peoples: their need for food, clothing, shelter and jobs.\nFor its part the young nation of Belize has already embarked upon the process of diversification from mono-crop preoccupations. An expanded and export-oriented economic base has been created, and we have widened our commercial relations while narrowing our trade gap. The production of bananas, citrus fruit and cacao has been increased. We have commenced an expansion in tourism, bearing in mind the need to preserve our plural culture and our ecological heritage. We have also continued the balanced exploitation of our forest resources and welcomed a new aquaculture industry, while trying to broaden our maritime fisheries.\nBut even as we attempt to move ahead we come hard upon the realities of an inequitable international economic order. Markets for our products are unstable, commodity prices are low and protectionism has evolved from a device to a policy.\nRecognition of this situation points inevitably to the importance of multilateral co-operation in trade, money and finance and development. The need for strengthening the multilateral process as a means of ameliorating inequities in global economic relations becomes even more imperative when we consider the open advocacy on the part of some donor countries to tie bilateral aid to political conformity.\nBarriers to reciprocal trade need to be broken down, and the developed world must open its markets to the developing countries. Only with guaranteed access for their products and realistic terms of trade can small States hope to meet their obligations and establish growth.\nA new international economic order would also advance the cause of world peace, for it would remove many sources of national and international tension that have as their underlying causes inadequate responses to basic human needs. The spectre of the migration of millions of peoples from their native lands, be It in Africa, Asia or Latin America, crossing into neighbouring territories seeking refuge, strains the Imaginations and resources of the most well-intentioned. Most of our countries are already struggling with the intractable problem of distributing the limited resources available to our natural citizens. But, faced with the greater demands made on those resources by those whose only recourse for survival has been an exodus from their homes, the act of sharing can become almost unbearable.\nConditions must be created to make it an exercisable option for refugees and others deprived of their heritage to return to the land of their birth and fashion their own destiny. Political and economic strategies must be devised to give back the future to those wandering masses.\nIt is therefore pleasing to note that, for all the criticisms faced by the Organization, a large part of United Nations efforts has been directed towards the salvaging of countries from conditions of ignorance, deprivation and homelessness. Expenditures by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Development Programme; the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund have brought measurable advantages to peoples all over the world.\nWhen doubts are cast on the usefulness of this body, many States can point to the improved agricultural techniques' that have led to an increase in national productivity, to the programmes of education, immunization and sanitation that have improved the quality of life for their citizens and to the new skills and technologies that have enabled their policies to function and survive in the global village. Those are the tangible consequences of the United Nations system from which our constituencies benefit.\nEven as we applaud the results of United Nations developmental actions, we bemoan the inefficacy of some of its political pronouncements. In particular we are deeply troubled by the inability of United Nations resolutions to bring any real comfort to the millions of South African blacks suffering under the inhuman yoke of apartheid. The time has surely come for all Member States to agree on the measures necessary to exorcise a Pretoria regime that has forfeited any claim to civilized regard.\nWe appeal particularly to those nations whose conceptions of real-politik have inclined them to treat as less than urgent the misery of the oppressed. We ask that they act now in helping to extirpate the abomination that is apartheid.\nSimilarly, the independence of Namibia has been too long denied. Considerations of linkages cannot be allowed to stand in the way of Namibia' s freedom, self-determination and dignity.\nIn the Middle East few would wish to contemplate the horrors that an expanded war in the Persian Gulf would entail. The Secretary-General's call for a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq must be heeded, and other interests would do well to reduce their military presence as one means of allowing United Nations diplomacy to take hold.\nEvery effort must be made to encourage the process of dialogue in other Middle Eastern affairs. It continues to be our hope that an international peace conference will be able to reconcile the need for a Palestinian homeland with the right of Israel to exist within secure borders.\nThe attention of the General Assembly shall remain focused on Afghanistan so long as the situation in that tragic country continues to create tensions that threaten international peace. Again, we call for the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and for genuine attempts at national reconciliation.\nThe power of self-determination must be conceded to the Afghan people so that the millions who fled their country may soon escape the misery and indignity of refugee life and return to their homeland.\nThe essential ingredient of the solution to the problems in Kampuchea also involves the withdrawal of foreign troops. In accordance with United Nations resolutions we continue to call for a cease-fire and internationally supervised elections as the means to a comprehensive political settlement which allows the Kampuchean people their inalienable right to independence.\nThe divided Korean peninsula must be reunited, and the process of reunification should take place through direct dialogue and negotiations between North and South Korea. It is imperative that the deeply rooted mistrust and hostilities between the two Koreas be replaced with the understanding and goodwill which are surely not beyond the capacity of a people whose culture is 5,000 years old.\nThe fact of worldwide drug abuse and illicit trafficking is no less a danger to international order than the prospect of military confrontation and war. The Secretary-General has stressed the need for a concerted, comprehensive and truly worldwide effort to combat the plague of illegal drugs. My own Government has been nationally militant in the fight against narcotics abuse, and we have also joined in the international United Nations-sponsored efforts aimed at eradicating this menace. Earlier this year we hosted a conference designed to produce more effective strategies for regional co-operation. \nPerhaps the greatest threat facing mankind is the possibility of a nuclear Armageddon. Accordingly, we welcome the recent potential breakthrough in the struggle to curb the nuclear arms race. The agreement in principle concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union will for the first time eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons, and perhaps signals a new era of super-Power co-operation in the long journey towards total nuclear disarmament.\nThe framers of our Chatter, were no unsophisticated people, nor was their vision one of utopian unreality. They conceived a system that combined lofty ideals with functional pragmatism. They devised a mechanism to mediate the competing claims of the just and the strong. They carved a moral landscape out of a barren prospect.\nToday, in a strife-ridden world, the United Nations system remains an assertion of our collective being, an affirmation of our humanity. We need to make the system work. We need to make it work or concede our civilization for ever to an encroaching jungle that promises only impenetrable shadows and darkness at noon.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of our delegation and on our own behalf, we wish to congratulate you. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session. We are confident that under your wise leadership - like that of your able predecessors - the Assembly will live up to its commitment.\nOur profound tribute and gratitude go also to your immediate predecessor, Mr. Humayan Rasheed Choudhury, who led the deliberations of the forty-first session so splendidly last year.\nWe also wish to pay a special and fitting tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his untiring efforts in managing the complicated and difficult affairs of the United Nations, and for his frequent missions of peace to areas of international conflict, which his high office must constantly monitor and try to resolve - and there are still too many areas of conflict for out general safety and comfort.\nThe issues of war have almost imposed themselves on the yearly agenda of this Organization. That is because war is incompatible with man's mission on Earth or even the purpose for which he was created. Today man requires peace more than ever before, as modern technology has refined the instruments of war and increased their capacity to inflict maximum destruction. For man to enjoy the total benefits of peace, the United Nations must be given both the financial and the political means it so greatly requires in order to halt potential conflict situations before they erupt into catastrophes. Only when there is peace can the noble mission of the Organization - to fight the perennial enemies of mankind: hunger, disease, ignorance and homelessness - be realized. The protection and promotion of human rights and the guaranteeing of the dignity of man form the corner-stone of the social, economic and political mission with which the United Nations is charged.\nWe have come to the United Nations General Assembly once again to renew our faith in the noble ideals of the Organization and to reaffirm our commitment to the principles of its Charter. We find it, therefore, fitting for us to call upon those Member States which have consistently violated the goals of the United Nations and its Charter by either deliberately refusing to comply with the Organization's decisions or obstructing its missions for peace to reconsider their position seriously. The result of these violations has been a general perception of the United Nations as an ineffective organization, particularly in the field of international and regional conflicts. The public apathy towards the Organization itself continues unabated, as if it is the fault of the Organization itself and not of the few powerful permanent members of the Security Council that place their national interest above everything else.\nWhere interference with United Nations decisions is minimized, successes have been eminent, particularly in the areas of health, education and other activities carried out by the specialized agencies. The United Nations needs the full financial and political backing of all Member States, particularly in its efforts to promote peace, disarmament and a generally more equitable international order. \nWe are very mindful of the fact that the world political situation has not improved much since two years ago, when we had the honour of coming to the rostrum to address the General Assembly. The tendency to resolve disputes by force still persists; the world political map has been dotted with at least 150 local wars since 1945. These conflicts have claimed millions of lives more than were claimed in the last two world wars - and that about sums up the sorry state of our world today.\nAllow us to put before this body some of the serious afflictions currently facing Lesotho and the southern African region as a whole.\nLesotho is a small country, entirely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa, and - like most small developing countries - still in receipt of much-needed foreign aid. Because of this precarious geographical position, coupled with this dependency on foreign aid, Lesotho - like most small States - is exposed to considerable problems in coining to a forum such as this one and taking the rightful liberty freely to state its case, concerns, plight, and dilemmas, all of which we feel we desperately need to bring to the attention of the Assembly. \nAs we all know, the kind of problems which small nations face in stating their concerns freely should not exist, because one of the basic and fundamental principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter is to provide a platform for the voice of all Member States to be heard and to provide an arena for small nations, especially, to mix and participate with bigger nations free from fear of retaliatory consequences. Despite that basic principle, Lesotho and all other small States are subject to considerable external pressures to conform with the wishes and the interests of those to whom they are supposedly beholden and either say nothing or say only that which will please and is required of them.\nHistory has placed us in a geographical and economic situation such that we are completely surrounded by one country, the Republic of South Africa, a situation that is unique to Lesotho. We have watched from within the political scenario as it has been evolving, from 1910, when there was a call for a national convention to determine the future of that country and the participation of all in its administration, to the present day, when the social, economic, racial and political conflicts have developed into a violent confrontation. As a neighbour of South Africa and a member of the international body of nations, we have witnessed with growing concern and anxiety the developments in that country and the rest of our subregion. A correct political direction in 1910, guaranteeing the accommodation of the majority black South Africans in the aspirations and political dispensations of the day and rejecting colour as a basis for determining man's worth, would have ensured a happy, non-racial South Africa enjoying a healthy economic and political development. That is what could have happened.\nThe current situation is that all the countries of the subregion are engaged in a bitter struggle for a happy and prosperous future for southern Africa. For the States members of the South African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC), it is a struggle to protect their sovereignty and territorial integrity, to build up development strategies that will ensure their sustainable economies, dependent on collective security. It is a struggle whose central causes, whose enormous costs in terms of human misery, human degradation and human life, are often obscured and even distorted by other international interests, concerns and priorities. It is a struggle that is surely one of the most urgent and outstanding moral issues of our time to face the Assembly. Its outcome will have profound consequences, not only for us in southern Africa, but for Africa as a whole. It is a struggle that the international community - if it has the political will, for the capacity is there - could bring to a just and early conclusion, both to shorten the suffering it causes and to prevent the consequences of the alternative, which is protracted, violent struggle wherein the peace and political and economic stability of southern Africa could pass beyond the reach of all of us for many years to come.\nLesotho's geographical position exposes it to peculiar challenges to its national and territorial integrity, to its freedom of action and to its right to seek more self-reliant, self-sustaining development. Those challenges, and their consequences for the rights of small nations as sovereign States, only serve to increase our sense of unity with those who are struggling for the human rights, human dignity and justice that have long since been secured, valued and respected y most of the big, wealthy and powerful nations. In carrying out our obligations under the various international conventions we shall abide strictly by the terms id conditions therein prescribed. We shall, therefore, expect all concerned to >-operate fully with us in their discharge.\nOur sense of commitment, sometimes coupled with frustration in the face of the :elites of Lesotho's position, serves only to commit us more deeply to the cause of the majority in South Africa, our brothers and sisters, our neighbours and friends. Our policies are and will remain one with those embodied in the United Nations Charter, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international covenants on human rights, all of which prohibit racism and all forms of degrading discriminatory systems based on power, wealth and political manipulations. We are also committed to the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement, to the principles that underpin the Freedom Charter and to the African Charter of Human and People's Rights, whose preamble recognizes the duty of all African States to do whatever is in their power to secure the elimination of apartheid and all that it stands for.\nThe costs - in terms of human life, human suffering and human degradation \u2013 of the conflict raging in our region, and the cost of destabilization, far outweigh the costs that would be felt by all of us if apartheid were to be dismantled and abolished immediately. Apart from the inestimable costs in human life, the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference estimated that in the years 1980 to 1984 the destabilization of our economies cost SADCCs member States $US 12,000 million, $US 4,000 million of that total being the result of direct war damage. Those costs continue to rise, outstripping the total amount of foreign aid given to our States. This kind of cost, to nations that desperately need to focus\nall their resources and energies on their economic development for self-reliance and the abolition of poverty, actually prevents any such development, while also undermining our credibility at home and abroad. The extensive economic potential of our region therefore remains undeveloped, and we continue to suffer from both overt and covert economic sanctions and political blackmail.\nToday we appeal to all the members of the Assembly actively and urgently to begin to seek the most effective means of helping all of us in southern Africa to begin to lay the foundations for a happier, new, post-apartheid order based on those principles the Assembly cherishes and has enshrined. We would therefore ask for immediate international support for the SADCC countries through the development of stronger relations and active programmes and strategies intended to lessen unnecessary dependency, to develop SADCC1 s collective security and to promote self-reliant, sustainable economies. If the international community supported such goals while actively deterring all efforts of destabilization against our countries, such support would be yet one more peaceful measure to bring about the desired changes for all of us in the region. For Lesotho, whose economic and political future will depend on its membership in SADCC and the effective help we get through it, it is our only chance to secure the political, economic and national integrity so vital to preserve and strengthen our national identity.\nIn addition to SADCC, there is much to be gained by supporting our commitment to the Non-Aligned Movement. The securing of true peace and freedom from military threats and economic blackmail can only bring genuine political and economic stability to our region. If the basic principles of the Non-Aligned Movement are objectively examined, one concludes that there are no real dangers in alignment with such principles. Africa is looking for its own political and social forms of organization based on a combination of indigenous factors of custom and culture and 41 world values. Whether it is for the present SADCC members or for our brothers id sisters in South Africa and Namibia, a strong human-rights posture by all the members of the Assembly can only enhance the prospects for peaceful transformation n southern Africa as a whole and South Africa in particular.\nAs we stand here today, we humbly appeal to the Assembly to re-examine the issues at stake in the light of the new realities and the new dangers of the present time and to seek to secure the undoubted influence of international pressure to negotiate, now, for a settlement that will bring true peace and genuine security to southern Africa because we may not have such an opportunity for a long time to come. \nWe wish this Assembly to recognize that it is no longer a question of whether apartheid should be dismantled and abolished, for we in southern Africa are talking about how it will be abolished, about when it will be abolished, on whose timetable it will happen, and with what kind of outside involvement and help it will happen. It is therefore vital for all of us in southern Africa that the international community see these realities of our present struggle not in terms of any East-West conflict and not in terms of ideologies or alignments.\nThere is a crucial, central interdependence of all the nations and races in such a resource-rich region as southern Africa. The economic experience and expertise of any one group will always be needed, as will the active partnership and skills of the other groups, in moving towards economic prosperity and stability that can only be to the advantage of all of us. We are all faced with a situation that cannot be compared with the post-colonial era, which involved the departure of one nation or ruler. We have all come to know and accept for many years now that ultimately we shall all have to learn to live together, or we shall perish together. No one will be required to leave, for we all recognize that we need each other; and those in the majority groups hope that those in the minority groups will stay, and not feel threatened or swamped. But such a state of affairs can come about only by means of a common citizenship for all and a universal franchise based on agreed formulas and a carefully worked out system of participation, sharing and representation that safeguards the rights of all.\nThis is no wild dream; it is a vital and urgent necessity, and we seek the active co-operation of the international community to ensure that negotiations on such a transition take place in the very near future. It will not be easy, but it is the only solution if we are to avoid alternatives all too terrible either to contemplate or to allow. Because of our very peculiar and vulnerable situation in the region, Lesotho has to make a special appeal for recognition of its special position and its special political and economic needs\u00b7 We desperately need more specific international help to enable us to achieve a degree of self-reliance - economic and political - in order to lessen our dependence, the degree of which at present renders us most vulnerable and inhibits and distorts our genuine efforts towards strengthening, protecting, and defending our sovereignty and national integrity. We have the will, but at present our means are inadequate, hence our special appeal.\nToday the world is dotted with flash-points of tension and conflict. The peoples of Kampuchea and Afghanistan have for many years now been the victims of war and painful occupation. Lesotho, being a small country that has suffered from war and territorial dispossession in its history, abides strictly by the principle of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. We therefore believe that we stand on higher moral ground when we request the withdrawal of foreign troops from those countries and many others throughout the world so that their peoples can enjoy peace. We request that their sovereignty and non-aligned status be respected by all.\nThe suffering of the Palestinian people and the people of Lebanon has been mg and painful. It is obvious that rhetoric has not brought much comfort to the Palestinian people. The Middle East situation now requires bold and imaginative initiatives by all the parties concerned. These initiatives should be geared towards bringing about an international conference on the Middle East situation in which all the parties to the conflict participate on an equal footing and without pre-conditions. The right of Israel to exist as a sovereign State with recognized and secure borders and the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland of their own and ultimately to independence and sovereignty are essential elements of a lasting and peaceful solution of the Middle East crisis.\nIt would be remiss of us not to express our strong concern about the present situation in the Gulf. The fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq has been allowed to go on for too long, regardless of the cause. Some of us have watched helplessly for years now as two Islamic countries, bound together by traditions of culture, religion and beliefs and Members of the United Nations, have deployed the scarce resources at their disposal to destroy one another.\nThe destruction of economic infrastructure and the disruption of shipping in the area continue unabated. As in all wars today, the outside Powers are deeply involved. Today, the outside Powers seek the imposition by the Security Council of sanctions against Iran. To us the imposition of sanctions is tantamount to a declaration of war on another front.\nWe fully support Security Council resolution 598 (1987) , calling for a cease-fire in this conflict that has caused so much loss of life and destruction of property. We followed with great hope the mission of the Secretary-General to that troubled area. No effort should be spared to bring lasting peace to those two nations, with which my own country enjoys fraternal relations.\nWe have been greatly encouraged by the recent agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on the elimination of medium-range missiles in Western Europe. This significant development should be applauded, for it signifies a thaw in the relations between the two super-Powers and a marked reduction in East-West tension.\nWe can hardly draw any comfort from the state of the world economic situation, especially as it affects developing countries. The most serious setback to economic development in developing countries has been the alarming levels and accelerated rates of net transfers of financial resources from developing to developed countries. The increasing debt crisis of developing countries, which is far from being resolved, remains the most severe strain on economic growth. This, coupled with the performance of world trade, whereby the developed nations are applying restrictive macro-economic and trade policies, has resulted in the most unpromising economic situation for us in the third world.\nThe current international economic situation has been brought about by the economic and financial order of the present day, which is obviously highly unjust. Being among the least developed of the developing countries, Lesotho is committed to the resumption at the earliest possible date of the stalled North-South dialogue. We also believe that meaningful global economic negotiations are bound to lessen international tensions and insecurities. We therefore call upon the developed nations to show a more positive attitude.\nWe are aware that the recent International Conference on the Relationship Between Disarmament and Development has drawn very encouraging and useful conclusions, which we hope will be regarded as such by all concerned. We have always felt that too many valuable resources are being wasted on rearmament and the production of weapons of mass destruction, resources which could be deployed more usefully for socio-economic development in order to lessen the gap between the developed and the developing nations.\n"

        "file_text": "First\tof\tall\tI\twish to congratulate you, Sir, on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. I trust that under your able and skilled guidance this Assembly will succeed in realizing the aspirations of all peace-loving people in the world.\nI should like also to congratulate our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his untiring efforts to promote international peace, security and co-operation. He needs the assistance of all Member States in this difficult and challenging task. I wish to assure him of Tanzania's continued co-operation and support in this noble endeavor.\nDelegates will recall that the last time a President of the United Republic of Tanzania addressed this Assembly was during the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. My predecessor, Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere, then renewed Tanzania's faith in the United Nations. He stressed,\n\\\"In this, my last address to the General Assembly, I have described events and ... needs as we in Tanzania perceive them. My country will not stop saying those things when the new President takes over. For we are a poor and underdeveloped country, and we have no power in the world except the power of speech given by the Assembly - and by our humanity. To be silent when we see danger, to refrain from attacking policies which we see as contrary to the interests of peace and justice, would be to surrender our freedom and our dignity. That we shall never do.\\\" (A/40/PV.13, p. 21)\nSo, as the new President of the United Republic of Tanzania, I thought it would be appropriate for me to come and reaffirm that stand before the international community. My country, which became the 104th member of this Organization in 1961, will continue to use the United Nations rostrum to air its concern for and belief in peace, justice and equality. With goodwill towards all the 159 nations represented here, I wish to renew our faith in the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\nFor the United Nations has always played and will continue to play a key role in its primary responsibility, namely, the maintenance of international peace and security. We acknowledge that the United Nations has its imperfections, but we must also accept the fact that Member States are largely responsible for these shortcomings. The United Nations can only do what its Member States are willing to do; thus the collective security system envisaged under the Charter has not worked because some Member States have refused to implement certain provisions of the Charter. The permanent members of the Security Council in particular have not co-operated very often in resolving conflicts.\nThe majority of the Members of this Organization were not represented at the founding of the United Nations because they were not yet independent at that time. It should not be surprising, therefore, when those newly-independent countries advocate the democratization of this Organization. They do so in order to ensure that their views and interests are fully taken into account in the decision-making process. It is for that reason that they have often called for a fresh look at the\nprincipal organs, especially the Security Council, but that call has often been deliberately misunderstood by those whose vested interests are well entrenched in the United Nations Charter.\nThose countries do not want to accept the fact that the changing international scene and the nearly-universal membership of this Organization require that the United Nations be adjusted in order to accommodate the legitimate interests of its new majority. The detractors of the United Nations have used the demands of this new majority as a pretext for undermining this Organization and the spirit of internationalism. They have often adopted unilateral measures to suit their national interests.\nWe appeal to those countries to reconsider their attitudes towards the United Nations in the interest of global peace. We all agree that there is room for improvement in our Organization. I am sure we can all work together to improve the effectiveness of this Organization. The adoption by consensus at the forty-first session of the General Assembly of resolution 41/213, on the review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations, is an important step towards meeting that objective.\nIn his report to the General Assembly last year the Secretary-General called upon the United Nations\n\\\"to bring to an early end those conflicts which have long brought terrible tragedy to the countries and people directly involved and inhibited the growth of international confidence needed for the resolution of broader global problems\\\".\t\nOne such conflict exists in southern Africa. Apartheid, which has been condemned by this Organization as a crime against humanity, continues to pose a threat to peace and security in southern Africa. The South African regime has resorted to unprecedented violence involving the daylight shooting of\ndemonstrators, mass detentions, including the detention of innocent children, and the vigorous imposition of a murderous state of emergency. In May this year it opened a new chapter in repression following elections involving the white minority only. In the euphoria of his victory Mr. Botha declared his determination to preserve his culture and to break the back of his opponents, especially the African National Congress.\nWhile the racist regime is intensifying its brutality against the black majority in South Africa, it is at the same time trying to deceive the world by making flimsy proposals to reform apartheid. Botha's recent proposals to establish a national statutory council and regional service councils with black representation are purely cosmetic in nature. These proposals cannot end apartheid. They are intended to involve the black people in entrenching apartheid. It is not surprising, therefore, that they have been rejected by the African majority and its liberation movements. I wish to emphasize that apartheid is an evil that cannot be reformed, it must be abolished.\nIn a frantic bid to maintain his minority rule and to direct attention away from his internal crimes, Botha also continues to carry out murderous raids on the front-line and other neighboring States. Every State in the subregion has been attacked:\tBotswana,\tLesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Angola\nhas been invaded by South Africa on many occasions, and parts of its territory have been occupied.\nThe MNR and UNITA bandits continue to operate with impunity in Mozambique and Angola, respectively. The damage caused to these States by the racist regime and the bandits has been estimated at well over US* 10 billion over the past five years. In addition, the front-line States and other neighboring States have been subjected to economic pressure. The aim of the apartheid regime is to intimidate these States so that they end their support for the freedom struggle against minority rule.\nWhat is even more disappointing is that this crime of apartheid is being committed in the twentieth century, before the eyes of the civilized world. ThiB crime against humanity is being fully documented, aired and viewed day after day in international forums and in the living rooms of many homes around the world.\nRepresentations have been made to Governments in all continents, but they seem to\nhave fallen on deaf ears. The world appears completely to have ignored the pleas of the oppressed people of southern Africa. There has been no serious move to stop that blatant crime, let alone punish its perpetrators.\nSurely, generations to come will wonder how our generation could have stood by so passively while such an abominable crime was being committed, in the same way as we wonder how a past generation could have been so passive in the face of Hitler's crimes against the Jews. We urge Member States and the international community as a whole to act decisively and collectively to put an end to this intolerable inhumanity in southern Africa.\nIt is encouraging to note that in many Western European countries and in the United States which have long-standing ties with apartheid South Africa, public opinion is increasingly turning against apartheid. Parliaments, individual legislators, trade unions and women's and youth organizations are exerting pressure on their Governments to take concrete action against apartheid.\nWe were highly encouraged, for example, by the package of sanctions against South Africa which was approved by the United States Congress over a Presidential veto. We hope that Governments in these countries will live up to the expectations of their peoples and to the aspirations of the victims of apartheid.\nI wish to stress that the people of Tanzania - and, indeed, the people of the whole African continent - feel deeply grieved by the plight of the oppressed majority in south Africa and Namibia. We consider our own independence and freedom incomplete so long as there is apartheid in South Africa and brutal colonialism in Namibia. We therefore unreservedly support the right and efforts of the majority populations of these countries to regain their freedom and dignity by every means possible, including, when necessary, armed struggle.\nI am aware that there are countries whose abhorrence of violence restrains\nthem from supporting armed struggles for liberation. It is a position that we find\ndifficult to understand, for we believe that the victim of a violent crime has the right to ward it off violently. Nevertheless, we respect the position of those countries. We hope, however, that they will support the call for the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against South Africa. This is the only peaceful means left by which to end apartheid. Such economic pressure will make the South African regime abandon apartheid. Without it, South Africa will not dismantle apartheid.\nWe recognize that such sanctions will harm South Africa's neighbors and the front-line States. Their imposition must therefore be accompanied by a practical Program to support these States against the effects of sanctions, including those which a desperate apartheid regime will impose on them. Great sacrifices will be required, but they will be alleviated if sanctions are universally applied and seriously enforced.\nI wish to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to those countries which have demonstrated solidarity with the oppressed masses of southern Africa by imposing a variety of sanctions against South Africa, we are especially inspired by the sanctions imposed by the Nordic countries, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and some countries of the European Economic Community (EEC).\nIt is unacceptable that Namibia remain under the illegal occupation of South Africa in spite of the United Nations having terminated the apartheid regime's Mandate 20 years ago. South Africa has shown its total contempt for and complete disregard of the United Nations by refusing to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nWe consider the policy of linking the independence of Namibia to the withdrawal of the Cuban forces in Angola to be fundamentally misconceived and practically flawed. Besides prolonging the agony of the Namibian people under\nSouth Africa's brutal rule, it has sent the regime the message that it has powerful and dependable supporters in its policies of apartheid and destabilization.\nSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978) is the only internationally acceptable basis for a peaceful settlement of the Namibian problem. That resolution, which has the support of all Member States, does not establish any linkage between Namibia's independence and the withdrawal of Cuban forces. We therefore support the Secretary-General's efforts to get the parties concerned to start implementing that resolution. We also reaffirm our total support for the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people in its struggle to free its country from colonial occupation.\nThe United Nations cannot avoid its historical duty and its role in assisting South Africa and Namibia to be free. Time for a peaceful or less violent change is fast running out. Without decisive action by the international community the situation in southern Africa will further deteriorate and lead to increased bloodshed. We have a moral obligation to avert such a situation.\nTanzania is equally distressed by the injustices that are taking place in the Middle East. It is nearly 40 years since the Palestinian people were forcibly evicted from their homeland. For 20 years Israel has illegally occupied Arab territories. We resolutely call for the complete and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from those territories. We reaffirm our support for the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to an independent State under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\nIt is also our sincere hope that a peaceful settlement will be found to the conflict between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic.\nIt is indeed our hope that the people of that Republic will be allowed to determine their own affairs freely and without external interference.\nRegional conflicts where great-Power interests either converge or diverge exist in other parts of the world. We are pleased to note that in Afghanistan and Cyprus the good offices of the Secretary-General have been invoked in order to protect the non-aligned character of those countries.\nIn Kampuchea, we believe that a political settlement involving all the parties should be arrived at without external interference. This would lead to the establishment of a peaceful, independent and non-aligned country. We believe that the eight-point proposal of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and the proposals made by the Association of South-East Asian Nations constitute an important element in such a settlement.\nWe deplore the aggravation of the situation in Central America by external interference. We support the efforts of the Nicaraguan people and Government to defend their sovereignty. The Guatemala proposal, which was agreed upon by the five Central American leaders on 7 August 1987, deserves our wholehearted support.\nWe are equally concerned about the tension in the Korean peninsula. We believe that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the peninsula is an important condition of the stability of the region. A dialog between North and South Korea and the holding of tripartite talks between the two Koreas and the United States should be encouraged.\nTanzania has diplomatic relations with both Iraq and Iran. Our people cherish the most friendly feelings towards the Governments and peoples of those two countries. We renew our appeal to them to find a political settlement to their dispute and to stop the war between them. We urge all great Powers to refrain from taking any measures that would escalate the war and create a more serious threat to regional and global peace. We particularly urge the permanent members of the Security Council to shoulder their collective responsibility and to act in unity in the search for a peaceful settlement of that conflict.\nWe appeal for the exercise of wisdom so that peaceful solutions can be found to all these conflicts. Global peace would be greatly enhanced if all nations would strictly respect the sovereignty and independence of other nations and refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of others. The threat or use of force should never be made a basis for settling disputes. We should all scrupulously observe the norms of international law governing relations between sovereign and independent nations.\nAnother great threat to the survival of mankind is the arms race, particularly in nuclear weapons. Over $US 1 trillion is wasted each year in that senseless\nrace. Resources which could be used for economic and social development are . squandered in a competition which threatens the very survival of mankind.\nSome of us had hoped that the Soviet moratorium on nuclear testing would start a process leading to a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests. Regrettably, the opportunity was lost. Nuclear tests continue to be conducted by all nuclear Powers. As a participant in the six-nation peace initiative, Tanzania renews its appeal to the nuclear Powers, especially the two major ones, to halt nuclear tests and ban the arms race in space. In the name of humanity we appeal for respect for our right to life, which is now threatened by nuclear weapons.\nWe are encouraged by the agreement in principle reached between the United States and the Soviet Union to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. We consider that agreement to be an initial step towards the ultimate objective of general and complete disarmament.\nPeace and poverty cannot coexist. The economic underdevelopment of the third world, therefore, is also a threat to world peace. While only one third of humanity thrives in prosperity, two thirds of mankind are submerged in abject poverty. Hunger, disease and ignorance afflict hundreds of millions of our people. Ironically, this is not because the world lacks the necessary resources to meet the needs of all mankind.\nWe are told by the rich industrialized countries that a fair redistribution of the world's resources can take place only through the virtues of free trade. But we all know very well that the champions of so-called free trade are the very ones that institute strong protectionist measures against the exports of developing countries. As a result of such measures third-world countries are denied access to the markets of the industrialized countries. Prices for their export commodities remain depressed, while the prices of manufactured goods imported from the\nindustrialized countries rise constantly. This has resulted in unfavorable terms\nof trade, severe balance-of-payments deficits and an ever growing debt burden for our countries.\nIt is estimated, for example, that the third world owes the developed countries about $US 1,000 billion. In 1985 alone the developing countries paid $US 115 billion in debt servicing and received only $US 41 billion in new loans.\nIn other words, there was a net outflow of $US 74 billion from the poor South to the rich North. The export earnings of non-oil-producing developing countries also dropped from $US 104 billion in 1980 to $US 87 billion in 1985. This was caused by declining prices of their export commodities. So, in addition to their export earnings, the developing countries had to look for an additional amount of $US 28 billion solely to service their debts. There is an urgent need for the creditors and borrowers to discuss this serious problem with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable solution.\nThe increasing outflow of resources from the poor to the rich through debt servicing and unfavorable terms of trade aggravates the already critical economic situation in the third world. This is a direct result of the existing inequitable world economic system, which only works in favor of the rich industrialized countries. The present system has failed to respond effectively to the development efforts of the developing countries. It is for this reason that the gap between the rich North and the poor South has been widening year after year.\nIt is obvious, therefore, that the success of the development efforts being made by the developing countries, both individually and collectively, through South-South co-operation, will depend to a large extent on the restructuring of the existing world economic system. This is the basis of our pleas for the establishment of the new international economic order.\nWe, the third-world countries, have always demonstrated our willingness to negotiate with our colleagues of the North on this important issue. We feel that there is an urgent need to take concerted measures which will promote the development of the developing countries and establish more equitable relations between the North and the South. Our efforts, however, have often been frustrated by the lack of political will on the part of some developed countries which wish to cling to their privileged position at the expense of the suffering majority.\nWe appeal to those countries to reconsider their position in the interest of justice and prosperity for all mankind. We also believe that the United Nations has a moral obligation to ensure that the struggle for the establishment of a more equitable world order succeeds, so that all mankind can be saved from hunger, starvation and abject poverty.\nWe therefore appeal for the revival and early commencement of the global negotiations aimed at the establishment of the new international economic order.\nThese negotiations should put particular emphasis on structural changes in the field of trade and development and on the removal of trade barriers, especially to the exports of the developing countries. The international financial and monetary system should also be restructured. Such a restructuring should take into account, among other things, the need to provide adequate and predictable development resources to the developing countries in order to accelerate their development. Efforts should be made in particular to achieve as quickly as possible the long agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance to developing countries.\nFor an ailing person the key to recovery is the will and determination to live. This also applies to economic recovery. Africa has demonstrated its will and determination to achieve economic recovery by adopting its Priority Program for Economic Recovery at the 21st summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), in 1985. This Program stresses the need for increased co-operation between African countries. We recognize, however, that the support of the international community is necessary for the implementation of the Program. At the thirteenth special session of this Assembly many donor countries expressed their willingness to assist.\nI should like to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to countries and international organizations, especially the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) , for the assistance they have so far given. We hope that others will make this assistance available as soon as possible.\nI wish to conclude by reiterating Tanzania's faith in the United Nations. We believe that the United Nations has a great potential to maintain international peace and to promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples. It is true that the Organization has had some problems, some of which have sometimes threatened its very existence. But we must not let frustration, cynicism or despair\novercome us. The idealism which gave birth to the United Nations is still relevant and powerful; the principles upon which the Organization was founded remain valid.\nWe must therefore strive to build a strong and stable world order based on the principles of sovereign equality. We must rededicate ourselves to the cause of fostering coexistence, co-operation and interdependence. We must work with one another constructively to make our Organization both the symbol and the platform for the evolution of a system of universal peace and security, a system which will fully take into account and help to promote the interests and aspirations of all countries and peoples.\nI renew Tanzania's pledge to co-operate in meeting the challenge of realizing this noble objective.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation warmly congratulates you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. Our thanks and compliments go to your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, for his outstanding leadership of the forty-first session.\nThe international community is aware of the recent political and constitutional developments which have led to the change of Government in Fiji. The situation is an Internal matter which the people of Fiji must be allowed to resolve in their own way. Interference of any kind from outside will not help in resolving our domestic difficulties, and we urge all Member States to show understanding of our situation.\nLooking back at the international scene over this past year, my Government has been greatly encouraged by the many instances of positive developments, which indicate that, in spite of serious differences, conflicting countries can come to terms with each other. The recent conclusion of the important peace accord between five Central American countries is a case in point. The many trouble-spots which remain must be tackled in the same spirit if they are to disappear from our agenda.\nSadly, the Middle East remains an area of violent turbulence and a source of potential international instability. The Iran-Iraq war is a tragic reminder of the futility of the use of force. The recent initiatives, especially by the Security Council and by the personal involvement of the Secretary-General, to bring an end to that conflict are a welcome development, and we pray for their success. My Government remains committed to the principle of the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland and the right of all States, including Israel, to safe and secure boundaries. \nAs an indication of our willingness to contribute in whatever way we can to the peace process in this region# we have continued to maintain troops within the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as well as in Sinai. However# our participation in the United Nations peace-keeping forces in Lebanon has cost us dearly. Twenty-two of our soldiers have lost their lives in that distant land while our country has been burdened with an escalating debt of over $20 million. This is a very heavy and unfair burden on a small country like Fiji. We urge those States which have withheld their contributions in the past to pay up their arrears and those States still currently withholding them to meet their obligations. We are particularly distressed that the United States# one of the main promoters of UNIFIL# is now the major withholder.\nNothing new can be said to describe the appalling situation in South Africa. There are# however# hopeful signs that some moderate elements within South Africa are attempting to find an honourable way forward# but their voices are still too feeble and need support from outside. The international community must continue to exert all pressure on South Africa to abandon apartheid. South Africa1s stranglehold over Namibia# and its refusal to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978) in continuing defiance of the rest of the world, is a sorry indictment of the impotence of the international community when only a few countries keep supporting that regime.\nOnce more# this General Assembly will review the situation in Kampuchea# Afghanistan and Cyprus. The people of those countries have gone through another year of oppression# violence and intimidation but their spirits remain high# hopeful that justice must soon come their way. We again urge the withdrawal of all foreign forces and a return to respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of those countries. While wars are raging in several parts of the world, new ones must be prevented from erupting elsewhere. For that reason it is a matter of urgency that preventive measures be adopted to defuse tensions in areas like the Korean peninsula. We urge the Governments of both South and North Korea to resume dialogue with a view to resolving their differences by negotiation in order to achieve a peaceful reunification. Pending a just and durable settlement, we support the call for admission of both Koreas to the United Nations and meanwhile urge them to coexist peacefully.\nThe recent peace accord in Central America is a bold initiative by the countries concerned. They should be given every support to help the accord to work. We were pleased to be part of the consensus resolution adopted in this Assembly two days ago.\nUnderlying much of the instability in the world is the unequal distribution of wealth and opportunity. The heavy load of foreign debt now borne by developing countries is being aggravated by the protectionist policies which appear increasingly to be the trend in industrialized countries. The situation has worsened over the past few years, yet those countries with the power and the resources to change the basis of the disparity, refuse or are reluctant to take effective action. The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which was launched with so much optimism recently, seems also to have collided with the unwillingness of some developed countries to open their markets. A way must be found to remove the frustration and vicious circle of poverty and depression from the majority of the world's peoples.\nThe final traces of colonialism are still to be laid to rest in many corners of the world. In our region, while the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands has moved towards self-determination, the same cannot be said for New Caledonia. That neighbour of ours in the South Pacific has just gone through a referendum which was boycotted by most of the Kanak people. In spite of the advice and pleadings to abandon the referendum and establish dialogue with the representatives of the indigenous people so that they too can be part of the political process, France insisted on carrying on. It is sad to see deeper bitterness and racial polarization developing. Our assessment is that a volatile situation exists in this close neighbour and we trust and pray that the principal parties involved will exercise good sense and restraint and work towards finding an acceptable solution to their problems. We trust that the wishes of the indigenous people will remain of priority concern to the French Government.\nThe steady progress being made by other Territories still classified as Non-Self-Governing, under the careful surveillance of the decolonization Committee, is encouraging. Many of these Territories ate in the Pacific. Although it should not need repeating, the people of the Territories concerned must be the ones to decide their future form of government? this should not be chosen for them, nor forced upon them, by over-zealous decolonizers.\nSince the forty-first session of the General Assembly, the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty has come into effect. This has extended the nuclear-free zone beyond the area covered by the earlier Treaties of Tlatelolco and Antarctica and the three together cover nearly one third of the entire earth's surface. We are happy to note that of the nuclear Powers, both the Soviet Union and China have signed the relevant Protocols. Naturally, we are disappointed that the United States, the United Kingdom and France have not seen fit to do so.\nWe renew our plea to the Government of France to discontinue its nuclear testing at Mururoa. We urge France, which is a major Power as well as a permanent member of the Security Council, to heed the concern of the Pacific countries and thereby remove one of the main obstacles to the further promotion and enhancing of the friendly ties and co-operation existing between France and the Pacific countries.\nThe work and recommendations of the Group of 18 has had a salutary effect on the cost and effectiveness of the United Nations bureaucracy. The Secretary-General must be commended for the seriousness and single-mindedness with which he has instituted streamlining and effected economies in administrative structures. Clearly, over the past year what we have seen emerge is a much leaner and, we hope, healthier Secretariat. Yet the tasks before it are certainly no less difficult and complex, so the challenges facing them are daunting. My delegation pays a tribute to the Secretary-General and all his staff for the extraordinary efforts they have made in the service of mankind. This past year has seen enormous pressures falling upon the Secretary-General and his top aides and we congratulate them on their vigour and energy and on their abiding commitment to the ideals of the united family of nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea I have the honour to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the important post of President of the General Assembly at this session. My delegation shares the confidence that the members of this august body have placed in your leadership. Let me assure you of my delegation's full co-operation in the discharge of the high duties entrusted to you.\nI wish to take this opportunity to record my country's appreciation of your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury for a job well done. We were impressed by the manner in which he conducted the work of the General Assembly at its last session.\nMy delegation also commends the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his unwavering efforts in upholding the principles and purposes set forth in the United Nations Charter. His report (A/42/1), which we have studied with great interest, will make an important contribution to our deliberations. My Government's policy of independent commitment to international co-operation includes a firm commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. For all countries, regardless of size, wealth or might, the United Nations is an Organization we all need despite some of the problems and challenges it faces. The United Nations bears the banner of hope for international co-operation based on mutual respect.\nMy delegation views with serious concern the track record of the United Nations Security Council. We believe there is a need to desensitise the role of the Council because, more often than not, it has failed to live up to the high expectations placed on it. The increasing tendency for the Security Council to be used as a forum for East-West power brokerage is most unsatisfactory. My  Government is concerned that the United Nations should be held hostage to such trends. Furthermore we support the calls for an increase in the number of permanent seats in the Security Council. The provisions regarding the veto should also be reviewed in order to fully protect and promote the principles and purposes set forth in the United Nations Charter.\nThe complex issues of South Africa/ Namibia, the Middle East/ Kampuchea/ Afghanistan/ the Korean Peninsula/ the Iran-Iraq conflict/ the situations in Cyprus and Central America all require genuine efforts on the part of all concerned for their resolution.\nIt is evident that some among us are prepared to allow the situation in South Africa to continue/ the struggle for a Palestinian homeland to continue/ and the I ran-Iraq war to continue.\nThe situation in Kampuchea remains unresolved. The narrow self-interest and indifference on the part of some Members of this Organization are deplorable.\nSince the adoption of the historic I960 Declaration on decolonization/ many countries, including my own, have attained independence. The concerns which brought about the 1960 Declaration still exist today. Although the number of colonial territories has decreased/ there are some who still continue to suffer the indignities of colonialism.\nThe United Nations has before it the important task of bringing these situations to an end. The colonialists/ and those who benefit from the outdated legacy of colonialism continue to do so without the slightest sign of a sense of guilt.\nNamibia continues to be subjected to the worst form of colonialism. Its resources are plundered. The overwhelming international support for Namibian independence has not moved South Africa and the other sponsors of colonialism in that territory. When will those who collaborate with South Africa come to realize that their actions and self-serving policies perpetuate South Africa's policy of apartheid?\nWe commend SWAPO for its fine leadership in the struggle for Namibia's independence. We express our solidarity with the people of Namibia and appeal to all to unite in the struggle to achieve the ultimate aim of independence. Whether it be in Namibia, New Caledonia or in any other of the remaining colonial territories, the colonialists and those who collaborate with them advance untenable arguments to defend their interests. Some who ought to know better because they too were victims of colonialism readily subscribe to such absurdities.\nIt is of great concern to my country that the process of decolonization in the Pacific has not been completed. The situation in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, especially that in Palau, causes some degree of uncertainty and apprehension. We urge the Administering Authority to ensure that the termination of the Trusteeship Agreement is achieved as soon as possible, and is consistent with the aspirations of the people of that Territory.\nMay I be permitted, on behalf of my Government, to applaud the members of this august body who demonstrated their solidarity with the people of New Caledonia and said \\\"No\\\" to colonialism during the last session of the General Assembly. Many said \\\"No\\\" to colonialism when they gave their support to General Assembly resolution 41/41 A by which New Caledonia was re-inscribed on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Those who stood up to be counted for the principles they believe in did so despite enormous economic and political pressures.\nIn this day and age there is no defence for colonialism. It is my delegation's hope that those who gave France the benefit of the doubt will now come out in support of self-determination and independence for New Caledonia. The current situation in New Caledonia is one of great uncertainty. France refuses to co-operate with the United Nations, thereby reneging on the responsibilities entrusted to it under the Charter as an Administering Authority. Such disregard for an important responsibility is most regrettable for a country which occupies a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and boasts of its democratic institutions. The people of New Caledonia, particularly the indigenous people, the Kanaks, are determined to secure independence for themselves with the guidance of the United Nations.\nTo ensure a legitimate and genuine act of self-determination, France must address the important issue of franchise. Without doing so, any act of self-determination would be meaningless. The countries members of the South Pacific Forum are as determined as ever to see New Caledonia exercise its right to self-determination and gain independence in accordance with the principles and practices of the United Nations. We ask for no more and no less.\nWe appeal to France to honour its obligations under the United Nations Charter as an administering Power to decolonise New Caledonia in co-operation with the United Nations. France must come to terms with the fact that the independence of New Caledonia is inevitable and that the responsibility for achieving that end peacefully rests with the Administering Authority.\nPapua New Guinea stands firm with the South Pacific Forum countries in our condemnation of the so-called referendum which the French Government staged on 13 September of this year in New Caledonia, an exercise which the Kanak people have rejected outright. The French-sponsored referendum in New Caledonia proved nothing and achieved nothing. It has created more tension in New Caledonia and within the region. The boycott of the referendum by the indigenous people showed the strength of their determination to attain their independence from France. Papua New Guinea's relations with countries and organizations in the South Pacific and South-East Asia are among those we regard to be of primary concern to our country. Papua New Guinea is an active participant in South Pacific affairs through major regional organizations, particularly the South Pacific Forum and its related bodies.\nCountries of the South Pacific have important economic links with the European Economic Community, Japan, the United States of America, Australia and New Zealand. We welcome the contribution these countries make in promoting economic development in our region.\nThe region's relations with other countries in the North Pacific, including China, the Soviet Union and South Korea, are becoming stronger and more diverse. \nThere are changing trends in the Pacific. Our region is gaining more attention from other countries and organizations than in the past. Papua New Guinea highly values its relations with the South Pacific Area and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) . Both organizations play a constructive role in promoting understanding and co-operation among countries within these two regions and beyond. Countries of the South Pacific are keen to promote a stable and peaceful environment that is conducive to economic advancement by all Pacific Island communities.\nWe welcome the constructive involvement of other countries and international organizations in the South Pacific. Their involvement should recognize the special problems of island countries in the Pacific, and their legitimate interests, particularly in advancing economic co-operation.\nMy Government's priority since taking office has been to stimulate economic development in the country and to improve the welfare of our people. Our efforts to achieve results to large a extent depends on conditions in the wider international environment. We are not immune from the influences of the world economy, especially the trend towards restrictive trade, fluctuations in the prices for commodities, and the slowdown in the flow of capital resources from developed countries to developing countries. Efforts to promote the cause of international co-operation are not meaningful unless they address such vital issues which directly bear on the livelihood of our people. \nThe recent important International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development highlights the increasing need to make better use of available resources for the benefit of mankind, and not for destruction. Like other developing countries, we see the need for urgent measures to be taken to improve and liberalize international trading arrangements, particularly with the major trading nations, and to stimulate the flow of capital resources to promote economic development in developing countries. Urgent measures are also required to alleviate the rising debt crisis. \nWe welcome the recent conclusion of the multilateral fisheries agreement between South Pacific countries and the United States of America. It will contribute towards economic development in our region. We also welcome the interest shown by other countries towards the South Pacific. Development assistance arrangements should be for the purpose of contributing to the social and economic development of the South Pacific countries, and not for other reasons or motives.\nAny substantial progress towards arms control and disarmament must necessarily begin with the two super-Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, accompanied by complementary efforts by nuclear-weapon States. Without such undertakings, world disarmament efforts will fall far short of expectations. The initiatives and dialogue now underway between the United States and the Soviet Union on disarmament are encouraging. Like most countries, we are anxious to see progress made in this area, which will lead to concrete results. My Government believes that confidence building and resolution of regional conflicts can contribute greatly to an environment conducive for disarmament.\nThe South Pacific is also not immune from nuclear activities. Countries of the South Pacific have taken a step forward in seeking to prevent nuclear activities in the region. A South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty has been concluded between countries of the region, and nuclear-weapon States have been invited to sign related protocols concerning the operations of the arrangement.\nIn late 198b, a Convention for the protection and development of the natural resources and environment of the South Pacific was concluded, and is now open for signature.\nWe commend the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union for their positive responses in signing the protocols to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty. We call on other nuclear-weapon states to act positively and also sign those protocols. \nDespite these initiatives I have outlined above, one country, France, which is involved in our region, still chooses to defy common regional endeavours, from nuclear testing in Polynesia, together with increased militarization of New Caledonia, and intimidation of the indigenous people, the Kanaks, in New Caledonia, are a great source of tension and insecurity within the South Pacific. Like other countries, Papua New Guinea remains totally opposed to French nuclear testing in Polynesia. We call for an immediate halt to French nuclear testing in the Pacific and for that country to respect the efforts of the countries of the South Pacific to keep the region nuclear free, and for the environment and natural resources of that region to be developed for the benefit of the people of our region.\nWe can only encourage negotiation and conclusion of other nuclear-free zones in other parts of the world. The situation in Kampuchea continues to pose a threat to regional peace and stability. The situation is further exacerbated by the continuing presence of foreign forces in Kampuchea against the wishes of the people of that country. Total withdrawal of foreign troops must take place to enable the people of Kampuchea to choose democratically their own government, without outside interference, subversion or coercion. We appeal to the different political factions in Kampuchea to remain united for the common objective of seeking to regain the sovereign entity of Kampuchea. My Government commends ASEAN for its abiding interest and dedication in trying to promote a peaceful resolution to the problems faced by Kampuchea.\nOn the southern tip of Africa the evils of apartheid continue to take their toll. The Papua New Guinea Government shares the view that a comprehensive system of mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa is the most effective peaceful means available to the international community to bring about an end to apartheid. The world has already witnessed an escalation of violence and bloodshed, of inhuman treatment towards fellow human beings.\nThe problem of South Africa has become a subject of policy experiments and of hollow rhetoric, and thus an end to apartheid remains an urgent and unfulfilled obligation for the international community. Those who are able to help reverse the situation in South Africa continue to find endless excuses and shirk their responsibilities.\nWe appeal to those who have the capacity to influence democratic changes in South Africa to demonstrate the necessary political will, and in solidarity with the international community, dismantle apartheid.\nIn this respect, the Security Council has an urgent task in fulfilling its responsibility to ensure peace and security in South Africa. The Security Council has demonstrated its unity of purpose on the Iran-Iraq conflict j and we expect it to demonstrate a similar spirit in resolving the problems of apartheid in South Africa.\nI have outlined my Government's views on only a number of issues listed on the agenda of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. In so doing, my delegation does not in any way ignore the importance and urgency of other issues before this session. The many complex problems and challenges confronting the international community require genuine efforts and commitment by all States Members of the United Nations in the search for acceptable solutions. Papua New Guinea supports a strengthened United Nations system so that it can fulfil its mandate as well as the high expectations of member countries. My country is committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. \n"

        "file_text": "We\tpay\ta\ntribute to the memory of Ernesto Guevara today, the twentieth anniversary of the sacrifice of his life.\nThe Bible tells us that Cain killed Abel in the first confrontation between members of the human species. Envy and pride took possession of Cain and made him commit this crime. \\\"Am I my brother's keeper?\\\" - that is the way Cain replied to the question put to him at the time.\nThe United Nations came into being at the end of the Second World War with the purpose of avoiding further wars, so that Cains should not kill millions of other Abels, so that all of us on earth would have the duty to be our brothers' keepers.\nBut there have been new wars in various parts of the planet. Millions of us human beings in the developing countries have been and continue to be the victims of such wars. There have been dozens of interventions since 1945 against us, the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Millions of men, women and children have been the victims of these policies.\nThe North, which is trampling underfoot and crushing the South, continues to impose the kind of relationship which suits it best; it staunchly defends an unjust international order, including unequal trade, external debt, protectionist measures, the total closing of markets, and pressures on Governments and organs of multilateral co-operation, disrespect and disregard for the Charter and the bodies of the United Nations and for the international legal order. All that leaves the peoples of the developing countries utterly defenseless.\nIn the midst of such suffering, we welcome and applaud the progress made between the Soviet Union and the United States towards taking steps to ensure disarmament, including the prohibition and then the elimination of nuclear and chemical weapons.\nAs a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, however, we are concerned about wars between brother peoples. We join in the international clamor for the cessation of the war between Iran and Iraq, and we stress the danger of the presence and build-up of foreign military forces in the Gulf.\nAlso as a non-aligned country, we ask ourselves what we are doing and what we can do to prevent the death each year of between 20 million and 25 million children under the age of five from malnutrition and disease - deaths which could easily be prevented, according to the Brandt report. According to the latest statistics- those of 1986 - 14.1 million children aged five died from disease and malnutrition.\nOf these, 250,000 were from the industrialized countries - 1.7 per cent of the total - while 13,850,000 were from the developing countries - 98.3 per cent of the total. Who defends this carnage that has caused the death of more than 1 billion children since the end of the Second World War? Who will put an end once and for all to the murderous policy of apartheid, racism and the daily killings of the inhabitants of South Africa? Who will put an end to oppression in Chile, Paraguay and Haiti? Who is concerned about this? Either the countries of the North and the international community can take concrete action to meet the just demands of those peoples, or they will continue to be faced with the fait accompli of change, popular movements and revolution.\nThe peoples will not wait for permission to struggle, to fight and to triumph. The peoples will give an impetus to their own processes of change, and then there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth by those that never wished to listen to the peoples and were the accomplices of the oppressors.\nThat is the situation of my country, Nicaragua, where, having intervened militarily and assassinated Sandino, the United States installed the Somoza dictatorship. Against that dictatorship set up by the United States, promoted and defended by the United States, armed and financed by the United States, we Nicaraguans fought to win the freedom which had been denied us.\nAt that time the United States was not concerned about freedom in Nicaragua.\nAt that time the United States did not care about the human rights of Nicaraguans. In those days the United States did not care about the lack of justice. The United States was not concerned then about the thousands of prisoners who were thrown into gaol - including myself, who spent seven years in such gaols. No concern was voiced by the leaders of the United States about the gaols in which we Nicaraguans were suffering or about the killings and tortures that were inflicted on us Nicaraguans.  Without asking permission of the United States, and against its policy and will, we overthrew the Somoza dictatorship not only to win our freedom, but also in the hope of establishing a new type of relationship with the United States, one of mutual respect, not relations between slave and master, as had been the case in the Somoza period, but relations between people, between nations, between States. That is what we wanted - that is what we want - respectful relations with the United States. Moreover, we wanted, and want, friendly relations with the United States. But the response of the United States has been to try to wrest from us our hard-won freedom and send Somoza's former guards back to Nicaragua to rule there.\nFor six years and nine months the United States has been trying to sweep away the Nicaraguan revolution, violating ethic and moral principles, international laws and, indeed, the laws of the United States itself.\nThe President of the United States is to blame for over 45,714 human victims in our country and the $2,821 billion loss in our gross domestic product, as a result of the United States policy in Nicaragua. The United States has bled the Nicaraguan people dry and badly damaged the Nicaraguan economy. This policy on the part of the United States has not benefited the people of Nicaragua at all but has come up against the courage, resoluteness, valor and heroism of this people.\nThe policy of setting up a mercenary army was intended to destroy the legitimately constituted Government in Nicaragua, but it has already failed. The United States has reduced its mercenary army in Nicaragua to 6,500 mercenaries, whereas it wanted to have 30,000 by now. Now all it has is 16,000 refugees in Honduras - people who found themselves obliged to leave for Honduras - and a similar number in Costa Rica, and there are 6,500 mercenaries - freedom fighters, as President Reagan calls them - but they are getting fewer in number all the time, because they are dying in combat or accepting the policy of amnesty which has been in effect since January 1985 for anyone wishing to embrace it.\nThe United States policy has failed and President Reagan is running out of time because his second term of office is coming to a close. He has only a few months left now before he has to leave the presidency of the United States# and it was these objective elements# particularly the failure of United States policy in Nicaragua, that led to the Esquipulas Agreement, because# quite frankly, what would have happened if the United States had achieved its objective of destroying the Nicaraguan revolution in a few months# as it suggested to the Governments of Honduras and Costa Rica when it wanted to set up camps there? If it had destroyed the Nicaraguan revolution, as it destroyed the people of Grenada, nothing more would have happened in Central America.\nSome people find their ears hurt when the truth is spoken and they are incapable of listening, but that is their business.\nIt seems to me that the culprits are annoyed. They have committed aggression against us and they have killed our people, but now they are upset when the truth is told to them. It is thanks to this reality, the capacity of the Nicaraguan people for resistance, that: the policy and the mercenary forces of the United States have been defeated; that is what made it possible to sign the Esquipulas II agreements. It is thanks also to the perseverance of the Contadora Group and its Support Group which, in a firm Latin American endeavor, have opposed the interventionist policy of the United States.\nThe Esquipulas II Agreement is a transcendental instrument dictated by the common sense of the Latin American leaders, and it is the fruit of the action of the Contadora Group and the Support Group.\nNicaragua has taken a number of steps in response to the signing of these agreements, so that on 5 November next, the date which marks the end of the 90-day period for the commencement of the implementation process, there will be better conditions for progress to be made in that process - because the end of the 90-day period is not the end of negotiations but rather a point of departure in the negotiation process.\nThe General Assembly yesterday gave its unanimous support to the leaders of Central America who signed the Esquipulas Agreement. Nicaragua thanks the Assembly for this act of solidarity in the name of peace of the General Assembly. We hope that the Government of the United States will comply with that United Nations resolution, and not by just saying it agrees with Esquipulas II; it is our hope that it will respect the Agreement by observing the terms contained in the Agreement of Esquipulas II. So far, the United States Government has given no indication of willingness to respect that Agreement.\nThat was made clear when President Reagan spoke from this very rostrum earlier in this session of the Assembly, when his tone was one of disrespect for the\nEsquipulas II Agreement and disrespect for the leaders of Central America. In the speech he made yesterday before the Organization of American States (OAS),\nPresident Reagan once again showed disrespect for the Central American Presidents and for the Agreement. He endorsed a kind of conduct which has been condemned by the highest court of justice of all. President Reagan's speech yesterday was a violation of the charter of the Organization of American States and the Charter of the United Nations.\nPresident Reagan went to the Organization of American States, as he comes to the United Nations, posing as a great judge of the peoples of the world. Who gave him such power? Who gave the President of the United States such representative status?\nLet me now take up two aspects he mentioned in his statement yesterday before the Organization of American States. Here I have the Esquipulas Agreement, and here are the signatures of the five Central American Presidents:\nPresident Oscar Arias Sanchez, President Jose Napoleon Duarte,\nPresident Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo, President Jose Azcona Hoyos, and myself. Our Eive signatures are right here; President Reagan's is not. If President Reagan wishes to interfere in our negotiating process, let him sign the Esquipulas (Agreement. Then he will be fully entitled to talk about the Agreement as he did before the Organization of American States. We should be delighted if the President of the United States were to subscribe to this Agreement; then we should feel he had the right to discuss these matters, for his signature would be on this Agreement. But to start discussing these things and to make allegations, and to try to impose his will in respect of an Agreement he has not signed - that shows disrespect for those of us who have signed the Agreement, because we are the Leaders of independent sovereign countries. We are not a colony or a neo-colony of :he United States; if we were, the President could feel entitled to come along and\nsay that the Agreement needs such-and-such corrections. That is all wrong. The worst thing is that it seems he has not even read the Agreement. I am sure President Reagan has not even read the Agreement.\nI am saying this because he said that he was going to ask for $US 270 million for the mercenaries and that, depending on how the Agreement was carried out, he would pass the money on to the mercenaries.\nParagraph 5 of the Esquipulas II Agreement states that:\n\\\"The Governments of the five Central American States shall request Governments of the region and Governments from outside the region which are providing either overt or covert military, logistical, financial or propaganda support, in the form of men, weapons, munitions and equipment, to irregular forces or insurrectionist movements to terminate such aid; this is vital if a stable and lasting peace is to be attained in the region.\\\" (A/42/521, p. 6) That is quite clear, then.\n\\\"The above does not cover aid for the repatriation or, failing that, the relocation and necessary assistance with reintegration into normal life of former members of such groups or forces.\\\"\nWhen the President goes before the Organization of American States (OAS) and says he is going to ask for $270 million, and also says he supports the agreements, he is being utterly inconsistent. The agreements clearly state that President Reagan should not provide new funds for the mercenary forces; if he wanted to approve new funds, it would have to be for the relocation or repatriation of people who, for example, accept the amnesty, who lay down their arms and go along with the peace process. That money would have to be given to the United Nations, to the Organization of American States (OAS), or to organizations of the International Verification and Follow-up Commission, so that they could make certain the money was truly spent on relocation and repatriation.\nPresident Reagan says he supports the Esquipulas Agreement and then he makes a proposal which goes contrary to the agreement.\nPresident Reagan also referred to the question of armaments, military manpower, foreign military advisers, and so on. He said the agreement does not take this into account. But on page 7 the Agreement clearly states:\n\\\"Negotiations on security, verification and the control and limitation of weapons:\n\\\"The Governments of the five Central American States, with the Contadora Group acting as mediator, shall continue negotiating on the points outstanding in the draft Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America with regard to security, verification and control.\\\" (A/42/521, p. 7)\nHere, too, we are clearly talking about a willingness to have ail foreign military advisers leave the region - the willingness of the Central American Governments to undertake not to carry out maneuvers with foreign military advisers, not to set up foreign military bases on our respective territories, and our commitment to convert the Central American region into a zone of peace, free from any foreign military presence.\nThese elements are taken into account in Esguipulas II. President Reagan is wrong to say that they are not. It bothers us that the President of the United States should take such a flippant and disrespectful attitude to this Agreement without being familiar with it, without having read and studied the text carefully. We are really bothered by this, because this is the President of an economic and military power of world standing who is, judging by his remarks, taking this rather lightly. This position of the President of the United States is not contributing to peace, and I think it discredits him further. It bothers us, I say, because it demonstrates a clear decision to press ahead with his policy against all odds. Consequently we are obliged to think that his words are the prelude to the continuation and escalation of a policy which does not rule out the use of United States troops.\nLogically, Nicaragua rejects the statement of President Reagan before the OAS. The Government of the United States should not forget that the Nicaraguan people has never turned and run, calling for help. There were several invasions in the last century, but we, the Nicaraguan people, responded to those invasions by fighting and struggling to defend peace. Policies based on force have yielded no results. That must be made quite clear, because when the United States Congress approved the $100 million for the mercenaries, as a consequence of that policy based on force, the very next day the La Prensa was closed in Nicaragua, and a bishop was expelled a few days later, one who advocated and supported the United States policy of intervention.\nThe United States policy of force was what drove us to set up a state of emergency in our country. It hardened the situation in our country, if anything. Had it not been for the agreements of Esquipulas II, Nicaragua would not have been able to take the steps it has taken. It is thanks to it that no censorship is applied to the press, which is circulating freely in ray country. The Catholic radio is broadcasting; a national dialog has been set up; we have decreed a cease-fire and formed a National Commission of Reconciliation, and we have taken other steps.\nWei Nicaraguans can reach an understanding fairly among ourselves. But we believe that, just as a dialog has begun between the Government of El Salvador and the rebels there, the time has come for a dialog to begin between the Government of the United States and Nicaragua. Although there is no symmetry between El Salvador and Nicaragua, there is a precedent:\tbefore Esquipulas II, the\nGovernment of El Salvador had engaged in a dialog with the Salvadorian guerrillas. And there is another precedent:\tbefore Esquipulas II, the Nicaraguan\nGovernment had engaged in a dialog with the Government of the United States, at Manzanillo. Those are the precedents, and they correspond to the different realities of the two situations.\nWe have nothing to gain from talking with the leaders of the counter-revolution, and we shall not engage in a dialog with them. If there is a real desire to take up this matter seriously, the dialog must be between the Government of the United States and the Government of Nicaragua, for at the rate they are going the mercenaries are likely to disappear, thanks also to the fighting spirit of our people and the Nicaraguan Government's amnesty Program. Thus, we can see that the problem is not really the mercenaries because they may disappear, but the United States will continue its policy of aggression against Nicaragua; when it has no mercenaries, it will use its own troops.\nThe problem is the behavior of the United States Government and its attitude towards the Nicaraguan revolution. That attitude was clear in Reagan's pre-election platform, before the mercenaries existed. In that political platform. President Reagan advocated the destruction of the Nicaraguan revolution - and there were then no mercenaries. Thus, the issue is not one of engaging in dialog with the leaders of the mercenaries.\nYet there is indeed a dialog on the ground between the mercenaries who are there, in Nicaragua, and who are taking a beating from our forces, which gives them an opportunity to accept the amnesty. A dialog is therefore already occurring on the ground, in order to promote acceptance of the amnesty. What is the point of talking to the leadership of the contra mercenaries? There is no point, because the entire policy is promoted by the United States Government. As I said, the mercenaries could disappear, but the United States Government would carry on using other methods. If the United States does not alter its policy towards Nicaragua, there could be a military blockade against us; there could be \\\"surgical\\\" strikes; there could be a military invasion. Thus, resumed dialog would be the logical thing. I say \\\"resumed\\\" because there is a precedent: there already has been a dialog between us and the Government of the United States. We received Secretary of State Shultz in Managua, where I spoke with him, and there have been other meetings, at Manzanillo, Mexico - meetings which the United States broke off abruptly.\nIf we have already had a dialog, why do we not sit down again and have another?\nHere in this United Nations forum, I hereby issue an invitation to the President of the United States:\tThirty-five\tdays from 5 November, the United\nStates and Nicaragua should begin an unconditional bilateral dialog with a view to signing agreements providing security for both States and making possible the normalization of their bilateral relations.\nWhy should this take place 35 days from 5 November? The fifth of November is when the implementation of the agreements will begin, and there follows a 30-day period, at the end of which the International Verification and Follow-up Commission is to meet, with the participation of the United Nations, the Organization of American States (QAS) , the Contadora Group, the Support Group and the Central American countries, to analyze progress in the implementation of the agreements, we therefore think it appropriate that the Government of the United States have an opportunity to observe - not interfere with - the implementation of the agreements, ind await the analysis by the International Verification and Follow-up Commission, i dialog could then begin five days later, after the United States has considered .hat analysis. We could take up the dialog where we left it off.\nI hope the President of the United States will not act as his delegation acted today. When President Reagan addressed the Assembly, the delegation of Nicaragua listened to him. We are not afraid of words; we are not afraid of political and ideological debate. A year ago I myself sat in this Hall and listened to President Reagan.\nI hope that President Reagan will not respond to this proposal for bilateral dialog in the same way his delegation responded here in the General Assembly Hall today. President Reagan should not hasten to say no to that proposal; let him reflect. Let him ask himself why United States citizens such as Benjamin Linder and Brian Wilson have shed their own blood to prevent more bloodshed in Nicaragua. Let President Reagan ask himself why the United States National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the leaders of evangelical churches have issued several messages calling on him to end his policy. Let the President of the United States ask himself why Roy Bourgeois, a Catholic priest, has spent several months in a high-security prison in Louisiana. Other Catholic priests too are being gaoled for civil opposition to the United States Government's policy of death against Nicaragua.\nPresident Reagan should not hasten to say no. Before consulting those who give him hot-headed ideas, such as military options, including outright invasion, let him remember that Rambo exists only in the movies.\nIn Viet Nam the result was the death of thousands of Vietnamese and also of more than 40,000 young Americans who were sent over there to die in Viet Nam, young United States citizens who would today be scientists, educators, technicians, clergy, athletes, farmers or doctors.\nThe peoples do not want Rambos; the peoples want men of peace.\nBefore responding to my proposal for a bilateral dialog, we hope that President Reagan will not rush into saying anything. Let him think, and may God enlighten him and help him choose the road to peace and stop harming the people of Nicaragua.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on behalf of the Egyptian delegation and on my own behalf, on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are particularly pleased to see as President a person with renewed skills who comes from a friendly country with which Egypt maintains cordial relations and enjoys mutual understanding.\nIn the same spirit, I avail myself of this opportunity to express our profound thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, for his wise steering of the forty-first session and his invaluable contribution by conducting its proceedings towards the desired objectives. The United Nations, which was born as an expression of humanity's aspirations to peace, security and freedom and whose principles have been beacons on the path to righteousness and justice, still embodies the hopes of many peoples. Forty-two years after its establishment, the United Nations still has a primary role in the maintenance of peace and security and in laying the foundations of relations among States and peoples on the principles of co-operation, solidarity, respect of rights and sovereign equality.\nThe world today is experiencing extremely delicate international conditions, including conflicts which are being exacerbated or are potentially threatening and volatile. Such a state of affairs makes us more supportive of to and more insistent on the need for relations between States to be based on the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We are confident that the United Nations, which has been a principal forum for the maintenance of peace and security since the end of the Second World War, will continue to play its role and confirm its principles, whatever the difficulties or challenges. We believe that peace is indivisible and that security cannot be the monopoly of a few. In the world of today, where interdependence has been enhanced and distances have narrowed, no one can feel secure in isolation from the rest of the international community. At a time when the threat of confrontation between the two super-Powers clouds the entire globe, any progress towards disarmament by them leads to an atmosphere of detente and de-escalation, whose effect extends to several regional conflicts. Therefore, we learned with great interest the news that the two super-Powers had reached agreement in principle on eliminating some types of nuclear weapons. Such enthusiasm on our part results from our firm belief that nuclear weapons constitute the ultimate danger for humanity. Egypt congratulates the two Powers on the success of their efforts in this field, particularly as a ban on such weapons would represent a unique precedent, for it would be the first agreement leading to actual disarmament consistent with the priorities laid down by the international community in that field.\nWe also commend the agreement by the two super-Powers to make urgent and intensified efforts to eliminate intercontinental ballistic missiles, which would ease international tension and decrease the nuclear threat and its grave consequences.\nDisarmament is an all-embracing issue - one of security and politics as well as development. Indeed, it is the issue of the very survival of mankind. It is now a universally acknowledged truth that the use of weapons of mass destruction would leave neither victor nor vanquished. Consequently, persistence in the arms race is insistence on the futile depletion of the energies and resources of peoples to no avail. In this context, the General Assembly resolution on convening the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development was recognition that international security and development are inseparable. It is high time humanity directed its efforts towards construction instead of destruction, development instead of the feverish arms race.\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the efforts made to utilize nuclear energy for peaceful purposes are complementary. Egypt invites the international community to intensify its efforts to persuade the States that have not signed the Treaty accede to it.\nBy the same token, Egypt hopes that the Mediterranean will become a nuclear-weapon-free zone and that the Mediterranean sea will continue to be a transit route for trade and culture and a haven of peace and security. In the same vein, Egypt stresses the importance of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Middle East and Africa. Egypt has consistently called for the achievement of those two objectives and has taken the initiative of submitting specific proposals to this end. it may be appropriate to appeal from this rostrum to the States of the region and the big Powers to adopt positions and take measures conducive to translating those objectives into facts in the near future.\nThe Iraq-Iran war is at present the centre of conflict and a source of danger in the Middle East. This should in no way blind us to the fact that the Palestine question is the core of the conflict in our part of the world. Despite the passage of time or the flare-up of conflicts in the region, it remains the main source of danger and the underlying cause of tension and turbulence. Peace can never be established, nor can it last, as long as the Palestinian people are deprived of their legitimate national rights, foremost among which is their right to self-determination on their national soil.\nEgypt, which has been committed to the Palestinian question ever since it emerged, is no less committed to it today; nor will it ever shirk its responsibility regarding it. Our commitment to the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people is the essence of our endeavours to establish a just and comprehensive peace in our region. We seek to establish peace based on recognition of the legitimate rights of all parties. While the attainment of peace requires that each party make an effort and accept the spirit of settlement and justice, we believe that peace would be an asset to all parties. Conversely, the persistence of tension and conflict is of no benefit to anyone rather, it means loss for everyone.\nThe lapse of 20 years since Israel occupied the Arab territories in 1967 and the continued rejection by the Palestinian people of that occupation confirm the need for the establishment of comprehensive peace based on justice and the restoration of the legitimate rights of those deprived of them, within a framework that ensures mutual security and recognition of the right of all States in the region to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries and of the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory through war.\nHistory and experience teach us that the rights of peoples cannot be waived by proscription or vanish through oblivion. We also know that although force may impose a fait accompli it does not grant security or establish peace, and that justice alone is the way to peace. We also realize that peace requites persistence and resolve, and that we should not lose the possible in pursuit of the impossible. We should seize every available opportunity and each propitious occasion. We should nurture every bud until it bears the fruit of justice, security and peace.\nEgypt has pursued its relentless efforts world-wide so that 19 8 7 may be the year of peace through negotiations between the parties within the context of an international peace conference. These endeavours, supported by the sincere efforts made by other parties, have led to what may be tantamount to an international consensus in support of the idea Of convening an international conference. In this regard, I wish to place on record our appreciation of the support expressed by the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the European Community and the countries of the Nordic Council. That such support contributed greatly to the evolution of this international consensus - so much so that the convening of the international conference has become a real possibility, indeed, the only option, after being only an idea that lacked support.\nIn this context, I wish, in the name of the Arab Republic of Egypt, to commend the Secretary-General for his sincere efforts in exploring the views of the parties concerned and those of the big Powers on the convening of the international peace conference, and for his ideas and suggestions, which have received our full attention and appreciation.\nEgypt realizes that any attempt to impose a fait accompli and maintain the status quo portends serious dangers and grave consequences. There is no alternative but to act seriously and consistently to give an impetus to the peace process. In this respect, I must emphasize the following points.\nFirst, Egypt's commitment to the cause of the Palestinian people and their legitimate national rights is genuine, firm and unswerving. Egypt also reaffirms that the Palestine Liberation Organization (FLO) is the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\nSecondly, Egypt honours and fulfils its international obligations, abides by them and never ignores them.\nThirdly, the international peace conference has become the possible and acceptable formula for the resumption of the peace drive. It is necessary that all efforts are concerted to persuade the parties that reject this idea that the time has come for an attitude in favour of exploring the prospects of a new era, free from strife and war) an era in which peace would reign supreme.\nFourthly, Egypt believes that, to ensure that the international conference is credible and efficient, it should be held under the auspices of the United Nations. Its terms of reference should be Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as well as the rights of the Palestinian people. It should be attended by all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, with due attention to the composition of a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. It should be attended, also, by the five permanent members of the Security Council, in view of their responsibilities regarding international peace and security in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Finally, it should be an effective framework for direct negotiations on all the elements of the Palestinian question and the rights related thereto, and on the Middle East problem, of which the Palestinian question is the essence.\nIn the name of Egypt, I call upon all peace-loving Powers throughout the world, to muster their determination and intensify their efforts with a view to speeding up the attainment of a comprehensive and just settlement of the conflict in the Middle East. The progress made so far towards acceptance of the convening of an international conference may well be an incentive and an impetus for all of us to maintain the momentum and pursue the peace drive to its desired objective. Lebanon has continued to experience regrettable developments in a most peculiar and protracted civil war, in which responsibility has been lost amid successive incidents. Although the Lebanese issue may well be one result of the freeze on the Palestinian question, we call upon all concerned to lift their hands from Lebanon so that the brother people of Lebanon may have the opportunity to heal their wounds, close their ranks and work together for true national reconciliation that will restore peace and security to the country and enable the friendly people of Lebanon to lead a normal life and assume their distinctive Arab and cultural role.\nThe confrontation and conflict afflicting the Gulf region are being exacerbated day by day and further deterioration is threatened. The situation in the Gulf has become a source of grave international tension and causes profound concern to all peace-loving nations yearning for stability. Unfortunately, such a situation is the natural outcome of the Iran-Iraq war, which for the eighth successive year is draining the energies, potential and blood of the two brother peoples. The war has hindered development and progress, claimed almost a million lives from both countries and depleted their great potentialities. Furthermore, its ramifications have spilled over into the whole Gulf region and impeded international navigation through the Gulf.\nEgypt expressed full support for Security Council resolution 598 (1987) immediately after its adoption. We still believe in the imperative need for its implementation as we view the termination of this war as the unique solution to the precarious situation in the Gulf waters and on its shores, a situation which places in jeopardy one of the most important sources of energy in the world. We view the resolution as an integral and comprehensive whole, in keeping with international legitimacy. It should be implemented in its entirety within a reasonable time-frame that would neither detract from its content nor lead to its fragmentation. It would be no exaggeration to say that the implementation of this resolution will be a litmus test of the credibility of international legitimacy and the ability to carry out a decision adopted unanimously by the organ with the highest authority.\nI wish to commend our sister Iraq for its prompt response to the legitimate decisions of the international community. We call on Iran to support this international drive towards a just peace that would give everyone his due and herald an era of peaceful coexistence that would make amends for the material and human losses incurred during the eight years of war. In this regard, I wish to express our support for the efforts being exerted by the United Nations Secretary-General and to invite all parties to give their genuine, effective support to his endeavours and efforts. I also wish to emphasize that we consider the security of our brothers in the Gulf States as part and parcel of Egypt's security\u00b7\nThe international community is at present confronted with a serious phenomenon which brushes aside all values recognized and cherished by the civilized community and threatens its peace and security\u00b7\nThe spate of violence and terrorism does not constitute a material threat to the safety of individuals and peoples as much as it represents a grave ideological trend that makes the use of violence both a means and an end, rejects pluralism of opinions, and bars free dialogue and constructive coexistence.\nRecently, terrorist activities have been rampant and have expanded to encompass locations dear to our heart and, at the same time# sacred places which enjoy sanctity and command the reverence of hundreds of millions of people throughout the world\u00b7 These incidents have indicated that the threat of terrorism is still lurking and that it attacks when an opportunity presents itself\u00b7 It also exceeds all limits when we loosen our grip or when we are beguiled into entertaining good intentions. As the issue of terrorism is included in the agenda of the current session, I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate Egypt's view that it is imperative to tackle the phenomenon of terrorism in all its aspects and guises, its causes and roots should be traced with a view to concluding a comprehensive treaty that would fill the loopholes existing in international instruments which seek to deal with some aspects of this problem\u00b7 Countries that have not acceded to existing agreements should be invited to do so as soon as possible and to incorporate the provisions of these agreements in their domestic legislation, taking due account of the right of peoples and recognized liberation movements to their national struggle for freedom and independence\u00b7\n\nThe principles on which the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries was based are still relevant and valid. The Movement represents a political expression by third world countries of their incessant struggle for freedom and independence. It is also a positive contribution to the maintenance of international peace and the alleviation of tensions. In view of its historical responsibility as one of the founding members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, Egypt finds it imperative to preserve the concepts and principles on which the Movement is based. It also considers it essential to take a firm stand against all claims towards extremism and exaggeration which tend to divert the Movement from its original path and sublime principles. In this regard, we wish to pay a tribute to the non-aligned countries for their enlightened awareness of, their firm commitment to, and their success, in preserving the genuine principles of non-alignment despite pressure and difficulties. Such an attitude was best demonstrated during the summit meetings of non-aligned countries at New Delhi in 1983 and at Harare in 1986,\nIf the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries is the political expression of third world countries, the Group of 77 is an expression of the hopes and aspirations of the developing countries for a more equitable international economic order. It is also an endeavour to confirm and consolidate co-operation and collective self-reliance among developing countries.\nEgypt has an authentic affiliation to the Islamic world. That affiliation is essentially a belief in the message of Islam, which advocates that human beings are equal, that there is no preference for an Arab over a non-Arab or for a black over a white except on the basis of piety, and that there can be no duress in religion or opinion. Islam is a heavenly message of justice and peace; a call for righteousness and benevolence} a mode of freedom and democracy. It is regrettable and disheartening that the Islamic world is turned into a scene of sanguinary strife between some of its States and that it witnesses attempts to distort the image of Islam, flagrantly and untruthfully clothing it in violence and bigotry, as was demonstrated in the recent incidents in Holy Mecca.\nEgypt's return to active participation in the work of the Organization of the Islamic Conference has been a propitious occasion for it to co-ordinate its efforts with those of sister Islamic nations in taking a firm stand against the challenges facing the Islamic world and the dangers to which it is exposed.\nThe deteriorating situation in which our African brothers in southern Africa are living under the yoke of the racist policies of the Pretoria regime, and the persistence of that regime in illegally occupying Namibia in disregard of the aspirations of its people and their right to self-determination and independence, all warrant profound concern and constitute a flagrant defiance of the will of all peace-loving peoples.\nThere is no doubt that the scandalous and shameless endeavours by the South African Government, whether through the so-called constitutional reforms or through resort to aggression and military blackmail against neighbouring African States, are acts of hooliganism, which deserve rejection and condemnation. Guided by its African responsibilities and in evidence of its solidarity with its brotherly Africans, Egypt reiterates that it stands firmly and unwaveringly behind the people of South Africa in their struggle for their human and indigenous right to equality and freedom, it also supports the legitimate struggle of the people of Namibia, under the leadership of their legitimate, authentic representative, the South West Africa People's Organization, until they gain full independence. Egypt also calls for the support of the front-line States against threats and aggression.\nEgypt appeals to the Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities towards the peoples of southern African in order to enable them to lead a dignified life like all other free and independent peoples. The Security Council should make full use of all its powers, including the imposition of sanctions against that inhuman regime.\nIn this regard, I wish to mention the positive development in Western public opinion and in the attitude of Western countries towards the abominable racist policies of the South African Government, an attitude which heightens the isolation of that regime and hastens its downfall.\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, there is no alternative before us but squarely to face the problems that hinder the march of peace, co-operation and development.\nIf we state that the Middle East and southern Africa are hotbeds of bitter struggle between obsolete concepts and forward-looking prospects, we cannot, however, ignore other problems that afflict various regions, such as the problem of Cyprus in the Mediterranean, that of Afghanistan in south-west Asia, Korea in East Asia, Kampuchea in South-East Asia and other problems in Central America.\nAs for Cyprus, there is no alternative to a solution that takes into consideration the inalienable and legitimate rights of all Cypriots on an equal footing in the interest of preserving the unity of the island, its independence, territorial integrity and non-aligned status. As regards Afghanistan, we fully support the efforts of the Secretary-General to arrive at a just settlement of the Afghan problem. Such a settlement of the problem, while respecting Afghanistan's independence, should be based on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from its territory, putting an end to interference in its internal affairs and ensuring its non-alignment. In this context Egypt supports all serious initiatives calling for the early withdrawal of foreign troops and the restoration of peace and stability to the brotherly people of Afghanistan.\nOn Korea, we reaffirm our sympathy with, and support for, the legitimate aspirations of the Koreas for a peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula and the attainment of stability and security in the area. We invite them to engage in a serious dialogue towards that end.\nIn the same spirit, we reiterate that Egypt views respect for Kampuchea's independence as an important element for stability in South-East Asia.\nAs for Central America, Egypt welcomed the agreement reached recently among the States of the region. We also support the efforts of the Contadora Group and Support Groups to achieve peace and stability in Central America. Egypt reiterates its call for respect for good-neighbourliness and for existing frontiers among all the countries of the region} non-interference in their internal affairs\u00b7, preservation of the rights, interests and aspirations of the peoples of the region and refraining from policies of provocation and counter-attempts at polarization. We hope that the recent agreement will culminate in a durable settlement putting an end to tension and enabling the peoples of the region to forge ahead to an era of co-operation and development under the banner of democracy.\nAs the decade of the 1980s draws to a close, it is observed that the accomplishments of the international community in the field of economic relations have been so disappointing that some tend to call it \\\"the lost development decade\\\". The international economic crisis has reached immense proportions. As President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak said in his address before the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UKCTAD), the debt problem \\\"has reached serious proportions that cannot be ignored, threatening grave consequences unless the international community, debtors and creditors alike, take effective action\\\". In addition to the debt problem, there are the issues of deterioration in terms of trade, the fall in commodity prices, reduced official development assistance flows, high interest rates, fluctuations of exchange rates and the net transfer of resources from developing to developed countries.\nThe international economic crisis has placed the developing countries in general, and the African countries in particular, before grave challenges. It has condemned their peoples to live under arduous conditions. We therefore must take serious action in order to cope with those conditions and resolve those problems at the earliest possible time.\nAgainst this bleak picture, there are some indications offering a flicker of hope that logic may be sought and wisdom resorted to in coping with those vital and urgent economic issues. Such indications were demonstrated mainly in the Final Act adopted by consensus at UNCTAD VII voicing the determination of all participating parties, developed and developing alike, to assume their responsibilities and honour their obligations in tackling this crushing crisis. Such an attitude deserves our encouragement, coupled with a reaffirmation by all of us of our obligations as contained in the Final Act of UNCTAD VII.\nThe United Nations was established to maintain peace among nations and preserve their freedom and independence. From the beginning, it realized that the freedom of nations is essentially based on the freedom of individuals. It was equally aware that violation of the freedom of citizens in their own countries was an extension of a policy which was heedless of law and morality in international relations. Thus the International Declaration on Human Rights represented a moral obligation which transcended borders and restrictions and made the protection of man's rights and freedom a preoccupation of the international community and of humanity at large.\nNothing is more outrageous than aggression against human rights which denies the rights of entire peoples, as is the case with regard to the policy of apartheid in South Africa. Another example is the Palestinian people, which have been denied the right to self-determination and whose basic rights are violated under occupation - rights bestowed on them by their Creator and emphasized in various international pacts.\nEgypt has always been in the forefront of countries that advocate respect for human rights and the rights of peoples. Egypt made an outstanding contribution to the formulation of the International Declaration on Human Rights.\nIn the past six years Egypt, under President Mubarak, has made substantial progress in the field of respect for human rights. During this period Egypt ratified six international instruments related to respect for human rights in various spheres, and they have become part of our legal system.\nSince January 1982 Egypt has ratified the following instruments: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid; the Convention against Torture; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the African Charter of Human and People's Rights.\nEgypt's ratification of those instruments was not mere form devoid of content? Hot was it simply an attempt to go along with the wishes of the international community. Rather, it was the reflection of a wide-ranging and profound democratic development experienced by Egypt and enjoyed by its people. The Egyptian political scene is now characterized by pluralism of opinion and freedom of political and intellectual expression under the umbrella of the Constitution and the rule of law that treat the ruler and the ruled on an equal footing, supported by an independent judiciary system that ensures justice and applies the law.\nThe Egyptian people will soon embark cm a new and glorious phase of democratic development when they elect their President through a free public referendum, in a climate of freedom and stability, coupled with their aspirations for development, progress and peace.\nI have dwelt on the great hopes we entertain in our constant pursuit of justice and morality, progress and advancement. I have also spoken of the difficulties and perils hindering out drive. May the rays of hope dissipate feelings of despair and the world leave behind the setting sun of the twentieth century and on solid ground forge ahead in a new spirit to welcome the rising sun of the next century, so that humanity may enjoy an era of peace security, stability and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffTo the representatives of the countries of the world - greetings. Bring to us from your home countries the gifts we can all share, your words of wisdom and your love. I am very happy that we have all arrived here at this gathering of world leaders. \nOn behalf of New Zealand I add my congratulations, sir, to those of the many speakers who have preceded me on your election as President of the forty-second regular session of the General Assembly.\nSeven weeks ago the New Zealand Labour Government was re-elected with an increased majority. The Government was greatly encouraged by that demonstration of support from the people of our country for the policies we have pursued at home and overseas. My address today provides an opportunity for me to reaffirm the commitment of the New Zealand Government and people to the United Nations. That commitment comes from 42 years of membership of the Organization, from active participation in its work and from New Zealand's firm adherence to its ideals.\nIn this spirit of steadfast support for the United Nations I am happy to be able to announce here that the New Zealand Government has recently reviewed its capacity to contribute to United Nations peace-keeping operations. As a result, we have decided to notify the Secretary-General of our willingness to expand our practical contribution to that most important part of the United Nations work. We have participated in United Nations peace-keeping operations in the past. At present, we provide personnel for the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) and we contribute financially to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). In future, we anticipate giving favourable consideration to requests from the Secretary-General for future involvement of New Zealand forces in peace-keeping for the United Nations. In our case, that would probably, for example, take the form of specialist teams from the New Zealand armed forces. Our broad purpose in making this commitment is to demonstrate active, practical support ; for the United Nations role of strengthening and monitoring international peace and security. \nFundamentally the job of the United Nations is to preserve peace. That was why it was founded 42 years ago. That is why it remains so important in the world today\u00b7 And in today's world that means that this Organization must address clearly and critically the overriding threat to international peace and security posed by the global arms race, and in particular the nuclear-arms race.\nNew Zealand's first priority in this Assembly is to work for the achievement of urgent reductions in nuclear weapons. The ultimate goal must be a world rid of nuclear weapons; a world in which no country can claim to have to rely on nuclear weapons as the guarantor of its security.\nNew Zealand has been greatly encouraged by recent developments in relations between the two super-Powers. Along with all other nations we welcomed their decision to agree in principle to scrap an entire class of nuclear weapons - the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) stationed in Europe and Asia. If that agreement in principle is followed, as it must be, by a treaty giving legal force to the political commitments made in Washington, it will mark a turning-point in the arms race. The INF agreement will be the first ever nuclear-arms reduction treaty. It will be testimony to the conviction that security can be maintained with fewer, not more, armaments, and that an increasing number of weapons is not necessary to preserve the peace.\nAn INF agreement will be a welcome first step. But it is only a first step. It must be followed by measures to bring about deep reductions in strategic nuclear weapons, and by measures to prevent an arms race in outer space. Moreover, if progress is to be made on those two fronts, it will be necessary to address as a matter of priority the perceived imbalance in conventional forces and thus to achieve a balance of such forces at significantly reduced levels.\nPresident Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev have themselves pointed the way. At Reykjavik last year they showed that there is no disagreement on the goals that must be achieved: a 50-per-cent reduction in strategic nuclear arsenals and, ultimately, the complete elimination o\u00a3 nuclear weapons. We urge them not to turn away from those objectives, not to turn away from the vision we saw from Reykjavik of a world without nuclear weapons. That vision will not be realized this year, perhaps not even this century. Yet it is an objective in the achievement of which every country in the Assembly has a direct and vital interest.\nThe immediate challenge is to find ways of working towards that goal while at the same time maintaining the security of every State and region.\nNew Zealand has long held that concluding a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is one important way to do that. In the resolutions that we, together with Australia and a number of other countries, have put before the Assembly, we have urged the international community to seize on the central means of putting a brake on the nuclear-arms race. While we have welcomed, therefore, the recent agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union to begin stage-by stage negotiations on nuclear testing, we would nevertheless still urge the participants to see that those negotiations are more closely linked to the objective the Assembly has reiterated for so many years - an end to all nuclear testing by all States in all environments for all time. \nWe will again be putting a resolution on nuclear testing before the First Committee of the Assembly. We will be calling on the Conference on Disarmament to break the impasse which has strangled effective multilateral consideration of this issue for the past five years.\nAnother issue which the multilateral disarmament process has so far failed to address adequately is the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Three years ago my Prime Minister David Lange noted from this rostrum the disquieting indications that the military competition between the two super-Powers might be moving into the new environment of outer space. Developments since that time have done little to allay our concern. New Zealand is unequivocally opposed to the extension of the arms race into outer space. We will be following closely the deliberations at the Conference on Disarmament on this subject next year and at the third special session of this Assembly on disarmament, where it can be expected to receive considerable attention.\nHowever, there have been some notable achievements this year. Progress has been made at the Geneva negotiations on a convention to eliminate chemical weapons - some of the most barbaric instruments of war, the use of which we unequivocally condemn. We look forward to the early completion of that most urgent work. In addition, the successful conclusion o\u00a3 the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which I was privileged to address just over a month ago, should have restored some faith in multilateralism. The consensus achieved at that Conference is all the more significant when considered against the pessimism that marked its preparatory process. It should encourage us as we prepare for the third special session on disarmament next year. \nAs a smaller nation with little power to influence the great nuclear-weapon States, We simply make a plea, an impassioned plea, to our brothers and sisters that have that power. We are now at a historic turning-point in the modern era. Having gone steadily forward in preparation for defence or conflict since men first formed groups and alliances, we have come to the brink. We, most of us, want to turn back. But there are still abroad fears that those whom we have not learned to knew or to trust will keep pressing ahead, that to proceed with disarming will undermine our own security. Learning to trust each other enough, learning to tone down the rhetoric we use against each other/ is now fundamental to the steps we need to take to enable this small, delicate planet and its people to survive.\nThat is why my country is so determined to see progress towards disarmament. The stakes are enormous. While the arms race continues in its nuclear and conventional dimensions, the security of each of us is at risk. New Zealanders do not expect others to act while we do nothing ourselves. Equally, we do not tell others how to resolve the particular security imperatives of their region as they seek to give substance to the principles of the Charter and to the international community's desire for a safer, less militarised world.\nAt home my Government has enacted legislation to ensure that New Zealand remains nuclear free. With our partners in the South Pacific Forum we have made a contribution to the security of our region through the adoption and entry into force of the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty. That Treaty reinforces the non-proliferation undertakings already given by nearly all Forum countries through our adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It gives expression to the unanimous desire of all the independent and self-governing States of our region that our part of the world should not be used as a testing ground for nuclear weapons or a dumping ground for nuclear waste. For the zone established by the Treaty to be truly effective, however, we rely on the nuclear-weapon States to commit themselves unreservedly to respecting its provisions. It is our earnest hope that all five nuclear\u2014weapon States will demonstrate respect for the wishes of South Pacific States by adhering to the protocols to the Treaty. It is our particular hope that France will demonstrate its understanding of the sensitivities of our region, the region in which it seeks to be a partner, by putting an end to its nuclear-testing programme in the South Pacific.\nThe control and reduction of armaments may help to maintain international security. It is the use of arms that destroys it. The Charter accordingly imposes an obligation on all States to settle their differences by negotiation and not to go to war. In the Security Council the Charter created the means by which the United Nations could uphold the rule of law and work for the peaceful settlement of disputes and the ending of conflict. The Council's record is far from unblemished we believe that its performance could be improved if its members could co-operate to settle disputes before the parties turn to conflict and its decisions might be less often disregarded or defied if the policies and actions of the great Powers showed greater respect for the laws they enjoin others to follow.\nNew Zealand welcomes the rare unanimous decision by the Security Council to seek an end to the war between Iran and Iraq. We regret only that the conflict was allowed to continue for seven years before the Council intervened to fulfil the role assigned to it by the Charter. The Secretary-General may be assured of our full support in his patient efforts, on behalf of the Council and with the trust of both parties, to settle the conflict in accordance with resolution 598 (1987). It is to his office, too, that we look for assistance in ending the aggression against the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea, which has continued year after year regardless of the wishes and condemnation of the General Assembly. Political settlements in both countries and the withdrawal of foreign forces from them are long overdue. In Korea, the armed confrontation still continues after more than three decades. The absence of Korean representation is a major gap in the universality of the United Nations. New Zealand shares the widespread view that the two Koreas should be admitted as Members of the United Nations as soon as possible and should pursue their negotiations towards reconciliation and, if possible, national reunification.\nPew situations have preoccupied the United Nations longer than the South African Government's racist practices, its illegal occupation of Namibia and its policies of destabilization in the region. Like those of the Commonwealth Group which last year sought to initiate a dialogue between the Government and genuine representatives of the black community, mediation efforts by the United Nations have come to nothing. The South African Government equates justice with white supremacy and right with the forces at its disposal. Its armies have marched in territories of neighbouring States. Its police have detained both black leaders and children looking for something better than education for a life of subjection. For our part we have given effect to the measures against South Africa recommended by the Commonwealth to impress on the authorities in Pretoria the urgency of dismantling apartheid. But, sadly, I have to say that, in the absence of effective action by more countries or a firm response to the threat by the Security Council, I see little prospect that the South African Government will depart from its determination not to reject apartheid, but to tinker with it, at its own pace and in its own time.\nApartheid is a most brutal manifestation of racism and disregard of human rights. It is not, however, the only such manifestation. We all know too well the many abuses of human rights that occur in various countries represented in this body. The United Nations has done much valuable work in codifying universal standards of respect for human rights. We must ensure that this work continues and that the standards already set are fully respected.\nAbuses of human rights are a direct attack on the integrity of the individual. Terrorism strikes at the integrity of the community. It kills the innocent and cruelly disrupts the normal operations of society. It is also a threat to world peace. An important task at this session will be to build on the achievement of resolution 40/61 and thereby encourage the adoption of practical measures to deal with international terrorism. Another item of importance to New Zealand is that on Antarctica, an issue that has been on the Assembly's agenda since 1983. New Zealand is firmly committed to maintaining the Antarctic Treaty which has preserved the peace and stability of the region to our south over the past 27 years. We hope that the Assembly's deliberations on Antarctica at this session will bring further understanding and support for the Treaty, which any Member of the Organization is free to join.\nEvents in Fiji show that the South Pacific is not immune from turmoil or change. For New Zealand - a close friend and neighbour - these events have been a matter of very great sadness. Since the time of the first coup New Zealand has steadfastly supported the efforts of Fiji's Governor-General to return the country to parliamentary rule\u00b7, we continue to regard him as the legitimate source of authority in Fiji. It follows that New Zealand does not recognize the legality of Colonel Rabuka's self-declared republic. Even at this late stage we hope that the people of Fiji will pull back and insist that their leaders find a just political solution which takes account of the interests of all. New Zealand trusts that the Governor-General will hold fast to the principles of legitimacy which have guided him thus far. We very much hope that no constitution will be adopted that would make Fiji Indians second class citizens in their own country. We want to see Fiji regain its rightful position in the Pacific region and on the wider world stage. Like all its neighbours New Zealand wants to see Fiji strengthened by a reassertion of its traditions of tolerance and good sense, playing an active part in the peaceful development of the South Pacific. Failure to achieve a solution would be a major set-back, not only for Fiji but for the entire South Pacific region.\nFiji's crisis is a recent development. We have, however, been concerned for some time at the dangers inherent in the situation in our closest neighbour New Caledonia if the natural progress of that Territory to self-determination is frustrated. At the initiative of the countries of the South Pacific Forum, the General Assembly last year resolved that New Caledonia was a Non-Self-Governing Territory within the meaning of the United Nations Charter. Forum countries sought to have New Caledonia re-inscribed on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories because of their wish to see a more constructive approach by the administering Power. Present policies serve to exacerbate divisions within the Territory and appear likely to frustrate movement towards independence.\nMy Government believes that France has a continuing role to play in the South Pacific region. But that will require a far-sighted approach to resolving the problems of New Caledonia and a sensitivity to the views and feelings of the peoples of the region. We have watched with genuine regret what has appeared to us to be a policy that does not take sufficient account of long-term concerns and solutions, bringing with it the prospect of more confrontation and division within New Caledonia.\nSince last year's vote, France has promoted a referendum in New Caledonia, an exercise which in our view has not helped the political process there and about which, as we know from the debate which surrounded the passage of the referendum legislation through the French Parliament earlier this year, there are considerable doubts in France itself. A referendum which did not offer the full range of choices prescribed by United Nations practices and guidelines is deficient. It cannot be regarded as a free choice when the administering Power is committed to promoting one particular choice and the forces of government are directed to that end. A process of preparation during which options were not fully presented and were not adequately explained is a further serious deficiency. A period of preparation in which there was only circumscribed dialogue within the Territory and throughout which there was a strong military presence, is no atmosphere for free and impartial consideration of New Caledonia's long-term future. In short, a political consultation that forced a substantial sector of the community to repudiate the very process, is inherently flawed. It is not a valid act of s el f -determination.\nI appeal to the French Government to resume contact with all interested parties in New Caledonia, to accept the offer of dialogue which the South Pacific Forum has made and to involve the United Nations in the political process that is to take place in New Caledonia.\nElsewhere in the South Pacific the United Nations has played a valuable role in the decolonization process as Non-Self-Governing Territories have moved to self-government or to independence in accordance with United Nations principles and practices. For this reason my Government urges strong support for the moderate, principled and constructive resolution on New Caledonia which will be taken up in the Fourth Committee at this session of the Assembly.\nFor the most part the decolonization process in the Pacific has been peaceful and has laid the basis for good regional co-operation. That tradition has been continued this year with the proclamation of the Compacts of Free Association of ' the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. New Zealand welcomes them as new members of the South Pacific Forum. We look forward to increasing contacts with the Micronesian Governments in the years to come and to the fulfilment of the United Nations role in the Trust Territory of the Pacific.\nPolitical security must be reinforced by economic security. Not only in the South Pacific, but throughout the world, the effect of low commodity prices is having a serious effect. Growth in developing countries is expected to average only 4 per cent in 1987, half the average of the 1960s and 1970s. Hardest hit is the agricultural sector which, in low-income developing countries, employs 70 to 80 per cent of the population.\nYet the undisciplined nature of world agricultural trade means that countries with a comparative advantage in agriculture have to compete for markets with subsidized exports that distort prices. The twin spectres of surpluses and starvation are an economic and moral outrage that cannot be allowed to continue  a contradiction which we must find ways to remove.\nAt its seventh session, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development noted that while many countries, developed and developing, are adjusting their economies, much remained to be done to reduce or eliminate \\\"growth retarding distortions and rigidities\\\". The positive forward-thinking spirit that marked that session should guide us in our efforts towards the elimination of trade-distorting measures. Crucial to these efforts are the negotiations currently under way in the Uruguay round. If we really believe in having a healthy international economy, contributing to world peace, we must ensure that these negotiations succeed.\nAs we work to improve the functioning of the system of international relations we must also work to improve the functioning of the institution that underpins so much of the system. Last year's financial crisis made clear that we, the membership, had failed to ensure that this Organization remained responsive to changing demands and circumstances. The financial crisis itself was precipitated by a failure on the part of some of the Members to fulfil their Charter commitments. It served to highlight, however, a more long-standing failure of the collective membership and of the institution to ensure the continuing revitalization of the Organization.\t.\nEvery institution, no matter how noble its goals, needs to undertake from time to time a thorough-going reappraisal of its structures and procedures. In recognition of this need, for instance, my Government is in the process of carrying out a far-reaching reform of the functioning of government in New Zealand. The United Nations is no different. It needs to change with the times.\nFrom the work of the past year a number of studies and reforms are under way. They must be pursued to their conclusion. The financial crisis may have abated to a degree: the need for change has not. One of the areas to which my Government will pay particular attention is the review of management of the United Nations development effort to be undertaken by the Economic and Social Council over the next year. The United Nations and its agencies have a unique role to play in development assistance, particularly in areas such as the establishment of development planning mechanisms and negotiations by Governments with trans national corporations. But such assistance must be appropriate and effective. The special needs of the isolated island developing nations of the South Pacific are often inadequately met by structures and rules which have been set up to cover large continental recipients in other regions. Any decisions taken on the spot in the South Pacific by a more coherent United Nations presence would reflect more truly the South Pacific realities than decisions taken in places such as Geneva, New York or Bangkok. \nI offer those remarks not as the representative of a country that is critical of or disenchanted with the United Nations. Quite the reverse: as 1 said at the beginning, the New Zealand Government and people are firm supporters of the United Nations. We shall remain so. But we would be bad friends of the Organization if we failed to encourage it to change where change is necessary. The process of change is under way. Let us keep up the momentum, and let us get the balance right. I end as I began, drawing on the wisdom of the Maori people of New Zealand. There is a Maori saying which goes,\n\\\"A warrior who works hard at growing food will not fail\\\".\nThat expresses in a nutshell what this Organization is all about. We must be firm in our resolve to retain the peace, but must look also to improving the lot of all our peoples. Getting the balance right is an international imperative.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe should like first of all, Sir, to say how pleased we were to welcome your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that your personal qualifications and professional experience will contribute to proper consideration of the complex issues which the General Assembly must tackle at this session.\nWe also congratulate the President of the last session, Mr. Choudhury, on his invaluable contribution to the work on important issues during his term of office We take pleasure, in particular, in expressing our appreciation of and gratitude for the serious and responsible manner in which he directed delicate negotiation; in difficult circumstances in the life of the United Nations.\nWe reiterate our confidence in the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and thank him for the work he has done and for the prompt, resolute and intelligent action that has characterized his administration. At difficult periods in the life of the Organization, Mr. Perez de Cuellar's efforts to preserve this essential international forum have been truly valuable.\nEvery year since the Republic of Cape Verde became independent we have addressed the General Assembly to express the views of our country and its Government on the international political situation and make our modest but committed contribution to the collective analysis of the questions affecting the community of nations.\nThroughout all these years we have particularly appreciated the achievements of the international community that have contributed to the progress, dignity a 3 well-being of peoples. We have stressed with concern the negative factors and he demonstrations of force still in evidence in international conduct, sacrificing lives on the altar of violence or hunger, destroying homes and hopes and sowing or Increasing injustice, poverty and desolation. We have put forward suggestions and ideas in keeping with the feelings of the overwhelming majority of other countries represented here in an attempt to contribute in some way to the search for joint solutions to the problems that scourge us and hamper the creation of a better, more just world.\nIn spite of some encouraging signs, the international situation continues basically to be as complex as ever\u00b7, certain matters and problems confronting the international community have grown graver. We still see the systematic use or threat of use of force in relations among States and the denial of the fundamental rights of peoples still under the yoke of colonial domination or the victims of racism. Moreover, poverty/ hunger, the deterioration of the environment, desertification and natural disasters and their harmful consequences strike millions of human beings with increasing intensity.\nEvery year crucial and less crucial problems are discussed in depth by distinguished speakers who, on behalf of their respective countries, express here their concern at the current situation, analyse the problems and make recommendations for their rapid and satisfactory solution. The well-being and happiness of mankind constitute the goal put forward by all.\nEveryone agrees that justice, dignity and respect for law are factors to guide the action of States in their task of building a better and more balanced world in which dialogue would replace intolerance, in which co-operation and human solidarity would triumph over narrow-minded nationalism, and in which joint solutions would prevail. But that concern, which is universal among statesmen and politicians the world over, has not been followed up with actions and measures for the effective solution of the global problems of our day. In the final analysis, we are frustrated at our collective inability to resolve effectively the questions affecting the entire international community. That frustration is all the greater because of our knowledge that we now possess the means to resolve these problems.\nRespect for the principles and attainment of the purposes set out in the Charter of the United Nations neatly half a century ago demands the firm and unequivocal commitment of us all to the enlightened humanistic vision of those who, having experienced the harmful and destructive effects of heightened nationalism, decided to lay the foundation of a new era in the history of relations among nations, based on peace, co-operation, justice and dignity for all.\nThe Republic of Cape Verde advocates universal dialogue and solidarity in relations between States, and firmly believes that political resolve and respect for law in international relations can help build the world so long awaited by our peoples. Independence of thought and action, freedom of choice and autonomy in decision-making - in a word, independence - are thus historical requirements.\nIn keeping with that deep conviction, we ate striving at home to promote the development and well-being of our people, at the same time strengthening the climate of peace and trust in which we live.\nIn our region, we highlight among our immediate goals that of contributing to a valid solution to the conflict in southern Africa and that of resolving the economic crisis that is stifling the continent. These are two of the major obstacles to the liberation and progress of Africa.\nIn the United Nations we try to co-operate with all other Member States in the international atmosphere conducive to the preservation and strengthening of international stability and security. In that context, we follow with concern the armed conflicts that continue to sow disarray and desolation in several parts of the world\u00b7, these conflicts are true hindrances to human development and progress. From Central America to Asia, from the Persian Gulf to southern Africa, every day we feel the climate of tension and destruction in those regions. There are other disputes whose persistence harshly punishes the affected populations. For decades, the apartheid system has unquestionably been the greatest cause for instability in Africa. Because of its very nature, its persistence and the widening contradictions within it, that system of ongoing institutionalised violence, maintained at the cost of repression and ignominy, can only render the situation even more explosive. The bloody events of recent years testify to the fact that the apartheid regime has reached the boiling point.\nWe are convinced that the present situation requites fundamental changes, not mere temporary changes or changes rendered obsolete by the internal political situation. Changes of that nature have not broken the resolve of the majority of the population of South Africa in its irreversible and legitimate struggle for dignity, justice and equality. Thus, a just and lasting solution cannot be found until the apartheid system is rooted out, yielding to, another society in which all South Africans will enjoy the same rights and the respect due to every human being, irrespective of social origin or colour. The eradication of apartheid is therefore not only a moral imperative for all mankind, but a political necessity for peace and development throughout, the region.\nThe Pretoria regime is also a threat to the peoples and countries of southern\nAfrica, whose security, stability and well-being continue to be systematically disturbed either through direct military intervention or through the intermediary of armed bands trained, financed and directed by that regime for carrying out obviously terrorist activities such as the recent massacre at Homoine in the People\u2019s Republic of Mozambique\u00b7\nThe enormous damage the war has caused in the front-line countries, especially the People's Republic of Angola and the People's Republic of Mozambique, and the constant manoeuvres of political and military destabilization against those countries by South Africa gravely jeopardize their economic development and seriously damage the progress and social well-being of the affected populations. \nIn this context it is urgent to increase assistance to the front-line countries. We continue to believe that the international community can and must adopt effective measures against the Pretoria regime. It is within this framework that we welcome with optimism the recent proposals by the People's Republic of Angola, which, in their flexibility and scope, demonstrate once again the openness and political will of the Angolan authorities to arrive at a peaceful solution in the region. We reiterate, however, our belief that the international community can and must adopt effective measures against the Pretoria regime for the urgent elimination of the system of apartheid, and thus contribute to a peaceful transition towards a multiracial society and ensure a future of dignity for all the peoples and countries of the region.\nThe situation in Namibia constitutes a hotbed of tension in the southern part of the continent as South Africa persists in its illegal occupation of the Territory despite the repeated condemnations of the international community and the decisions of the United Nations.\nWe believe the Territory's independence must be achieved on an urgent basis through strict implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nIn Chad and in Western Sahara, conflicts persist for which solutions must be found on the basis of dialogue and the relevant decisions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), in this connection we wish to stress the importance of the initiatives undertaken by the OAU's ad hoc committee on the situation in Chad, as well as the joint initiatives of the United Nations Secretary-General and the President of the OAU with a view to a negotiated solution to the conflict in Western Sahara.\nIn the Middle East, the injustice confronting the Palestinian people persists. Those of us who at some time in our history have been victims of colonial violence or of the humiliation of foreign occupation know the real dimensions of the suffering that people has faced over the past four decades. Massacres and mass violations of human rights committed against the people of Palestine, as well as the continued denial of their right to form their own sovereign State, certainly do not promote an atmosphere of peace in the Middle East, a region where political and military stability cannot be achieved without a solution to the Palestinian question.\nIn this context, the international conference on peace in the Middle East, with the presence of all parties concerned, which has been approved by the General Assembly, seems to us an excellent framework for the search for a peaceful solution for the region, Efforts to achieve its convening must therefore be continued.\nIn the Gulf region we are witnessing with concern the armed conflict between the fraternal peoples of Iran and Iraq. That conflict, which has in recent years assumed alarming proportions and caused immense suffering and damage to the population, is now becoming internationalised and is thus seriously endangering peace not only in the region but throughout the world. We reiterate our urgent appeal to the two parties to put an end to their hostilities and to seek a negotiated solution.\nThe recent Security Council resolution on a cease\u2014fire was the result of long and careful thought and awareness of the dangers to the world inherent in the conflict, it is to be hoped that in the serious and highly sensitive situation now prevailing in the region the military forces there will demonstrate restraint. The common sense essential to the establishment of an atmosphere of d\u00e9tente and dialogue must replace force and attempts to use force.\nThe territory of East Timor remains illegally occupied by foreign forces, which denies the Maubere people its legitimate and inalienable right to self-determination and independence. We appeal to the international community and help them in their efforts to establish the conditions necessary for the people of East Timor to exercise its inalienable right to choose its own destiny. The process of decolonisation, one of\nthe important and noble achievements in the annals of our Organization, will not be\ncomplete as long as East Timor and other territories remain under the yoke of foreign occupation.\nWe are following the events in Central America with utmost attention. The violence that has prevailed in the region in recent years has demonstrated the need to take urgent measures to establish a climate conducive to the realization of the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the region to peace and social justice. We greatly appreciate the efforts made by the Heads of State of the region that have led to the adoption of an agreement on the establishment of lasting peace in Central America. We are convinced that if that agreement is implemented by all the parties and respected by all States it will certainly help to bring peace to our Latin American brothers of the region.\nIn South-East Asia, we regret that the initiatives and efforts made thus far have not succeeded as we had hoped, in decreasing tension and bringing about respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all the States of the region, including Kampuchea. It is high time for a solution to be found to the situation in that country. It is time for the Kampuchean people, free of foreign interference and in full freedom, to decide their own destiny.\nWe remain firmly convinced that in Korea dialogue and co-operation between the two parties are prerequisites for the happiness  well-being and progress of the Korean people and the peaceful reunification of their homeland. \nWe are following with great interest diplomatic initiatives towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan. We encourage any solution that respects that country's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity# as well as its non-aligned status, and the right of the Afghan people to choose their destiny without foreign interference and in freedom.\nWhile armed conflicts and tension in international relations still characterize the international political situation/ the deterioration of the economic situation prevailing in many third-world countries seriously endangers the survival and well-being of their peoples.  \nThe foreign debt, which has now reached proportions that have disastrous effects mainly African and Latin American economies, the stagnation in official development aid and investments in the developing countries, and the decline - sometimes staggering - in the prices of raw materials on the international market: all those elements have contributed to the difficult economic situation in those countries.\nFor many years the majority of States have been repeatedly stating that substantive change in international economic relations is the only way to resolve the economic crisis, which has particularly affected the African countries. The economy of the African countries south of the Sahara over the past 10 years has suffered the negative effects of the adverse trends in the terms of trade and the disturbances caused by external factors familiar to everyone. In this context, they have also suffered the negative effects of the increasing difficulty faced by those countries in attracting capital from the industrialized world, as well as the growth of the debt-servicing burden to unbearable proportions.\nThe economic difficulties of the continent now have devastating social impacts. Thus, the decline in food production has caused a great, increase in malnourishment among the peoples.\nIt is in that economic context that Africa has confronted the worst drought of this century. That drought has already cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of persons. The international community has generally recognized that the drought in Africa has caused great hunger. It has reacted by adopting a number of temporary measures but, since they are temporary, they do not meet the development needs. Hence, it is necessary to tackle the problem by structural methods that can reverse the present trends.\nAfrica today is examining all the problems related to its development. This question has been increasingly at the centre of our concerns and thoughts in recent years. The Monrovia Colloquium, the Lagos Summit and the twenty-second Summit Conference of the Organization of African Unity in Addis Ababa, inter alia, have been significant forums for deeper reflection about the problem.\nThere is an ever-increasing awareness among Africans of the need for a new dynamic of regional integration and self-focused development geared towards the realization of the vast potentials of our continent and the constant improvement c the well-being of the African peoples. We are aware that the problems of development are complex, that their solutions are difficult and that the energies and resources required are vast. We are also aware that in the process of the region's development the driving force must basically be the Africans themselves. But they will confront difficulties and their efforts will be seriously compromised if they are not supported by international co-operation and by significant, diversified external assistance. In fact, the ever-increasing interdependence of today's world makes a region's development difficult without the interaction resulting from co-operation with other regions. \nWe are deeply convinced that a peaceful solution to the conflict in Southern Africa would give a new dimension to the legitimate aspirations of the African people in the North and the South of the continent. We are deeply convinced, furthermore, that economic, technical and financial co-operation between a South Africa freed of racism - a democratic South Africa - and the other African countries would enormously benefit the development of the entire region. \nAt a time when hundreds of thousands of human beings are dying of hunger in Africa and in other parts of our planet, we are witnessing a proliferation of weapons which consumes vast human and material resources and threatens the very survival of mankind. The recent Conference on the Relationship Between Disarmament and Development demonstrated the impact on developing countries that the transfer of part of the resources now used for weapons production to development programmes could have. In a world with limited resources, any investment in weapons and similar activities has an impact on disarmament. Progress in that field would release resources that could contribute to the attainment of the economic and social objectives of all countries and to the narrowing of the gap between the developed and the developing countries.\nIn this respect, recent progress in the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union in the nuclear sphere strengthens our hopes. It would be desirable for this important step to be followed by others that could eliminate forever the risk of a nuclear war posed by research on and deployment and accumulation of nuclear weapons.\nThe arms race has contributed to worsening the climate of tension and fostering international conflicts. For peoples that, in one way or another, have been the victims of the destructive force of military conflicts, nothing is more valuable than peace. Peace should be cherished by all, carefully preserved and encouraged at the international level.\nRegional demilitarisation is an important component of the building of peace. In this connection, it should be stressed that the decision taken by the General Assembly last year to declare the South Atlantic a zone of peace and co-operation has had a very positive effect on the strengthening of peace. The preservation of that region from any miniaturization, from the arms race, from the presence of foreign military bases, and from nuclear weapons will no doubt contribute to the well-being, co-operation and progress of the peoples of the region and to the strengthening of international peace.\nOver the past three years the Republic of Cape Verde has in its statements in the general debate emphasized its support for the multilateral process as the privileged tool in the quest for collective solutions to global problems. As we have said earlier in this statement, we are living today in a world that is increasingly interdependent at all levels. That can be seen between rich and poor, small and large, developed and developing countries alike. Recently, however, we have seen a trend among certain sectors towards relying on political, military and economic force in order to draw away from the universal values of multilateralism, in opposition to the views of the majority. Such behaviour, which is without any doubt negative, in a world which claims to be democratic, constitutes regression which can only fuel distrust.\nThe crisis in multilateralism has become clear basically in institutions such as the United Nations which ate the most developed tools in the multilateral process. Some have termed this an institutional crisis, since it has been reflected in a lack of trust in international institutions. The origin of this crisis, it seems to us, resides in a recent trend towards weakening international democratic gatherings. In fact, institutions are what their members want them to be. The strength and effectiveness of institutions depend largely on the strength, trust and effectiveness their members wish to place in them. Negotiations which, last year, led to the adoption of a series of measures and recommendations for the administrative and financial reform of the Organization have highlighted the role the United Nations must play in the world today if we want to live in peace and security. We fervently hope that once the administrative and financial difficulties of the United Nations are overcome, all countries will seriously dedicate themselves to respect for the principles and pursuit of the objectives of the United Nations in the edifying task of building our great family - the human family.\nThe Republic of Cape Verde attaches the utmost importance to the United Nations as a privileged forum where all countries of the world, regardless of their size, the number of their inhabitants, and the level of their development, can together find peaceful solutions to all conflicts, and where all countries, representing the entire human race, can, in complete sovereignty, find collective solutions to global problems.\nWe come from a small country which is virtually barren of material resources and which must, therefore, deal with difficult and complex problems in order to ensure its economic survival and its development. By an accident of nature we are, therefore, in a position to grasp the immense difficulties confronted by most of the countries represented here in the struggle for economic development in order to ensure a more dignified existence for their people.\nOur struggle for development and for the dignity of our peoples is our way of making an important contribution to the age-old struggle of man to overcome physical difficulties and to build a world in which spiritual values reign supreme in human conduct and action. We are involved in a shared endeavour and we, the developing and developed countries, will be able successfully to achieve our task only if we ate united and sincere in our mutual relations.\nWe are living in a century in which scientific and technical accomplishments have increased the powers of man to fulfil his desire to know and master the universe. We fervently hope that before the beginning of the twenty-first century these scientific and technical achievements will be directed above all towards the well-being, progress and happiness of all peoples on earth.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all. Sir, I should like to congratulate you heartily on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. We are sincerely pleased that this great honour has been bestowed upon a representative of a fraternal country, the German Democratic Republic. I wish you every success in carrying out your responsible duties.\nI wish also to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier P\u00e9rez de Cuellar, and to assure him of Czechoslovakia's support in his praiseworthy work on behalf of the United Nations and the entire international community.\nThe general debate thus far has indicated - and I should like to believe - that the current session will make a significant contribution to the solution of the most urgent problems facing us today and that it will help in shaping the concept of a non-violent and nuclear-weapon-free world in which comprehensive security for all mankind would guarantee for everyone in the world the most. That hope is especially justifiable in the light of the agreement in principle between the USSR and the United States of America on the elimination of two classes of nuclear weapons, an agreement of great political and psychological importance. The conclusion of such a treaty, which is so strongly desired by the nations of the world, would lead for the first time in history to the agreed elimination of part of the world's accumulated nuclear arsenals. It would be a great step towards a genuine process of disarmament and would show that improvements are not confined to outlining theoretical programmes but are rather taking a concrete form.\nProspects are opening for reaching further important agreements. The productive results of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe can undoubtedly be counted among the positive developments. An atmosphere of businesslike constructive dialogue prevailed also at the Vienna follow-up meeting of the States signatories of the Helsinki Final Act. Consultations are being held between representatives of countries of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on measures for conventional disarmament from the Atlantic to the Urals. Another positive international development is the contact between representatives of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and of the European Economic Community.\nA valuable contribution to the process of strengthening peace and understanding among peoples and improving the world situation has been made by the New Delhi Six. The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has been undertaking peace-making activities, as was shown clearly by the outcome of its summit conference, held at Harare.\nAll this confirms the emergence of a new thinking on a broad spectrum of issues in international relations. That new thinking is finding its way also into the halls and conference rooms of the United Nations, an organization designed to mould civilized relations among all countries and to harmonize their interests on a new basis.\nWe are convinced that these glimmers of hope derive from real factors. We ate seeing the establishment and strengthening of a broad front of individuals, organizations, parties, governments and States united by their mutual goal of preserving human civilization. The socialist countries are doing their part in this struggle by taking qualitatively new initiatives based specifically on the process of activating the intrinsic potential of socialism and implementing programmes of restructuring. It could not be otherwise, since the ensuring of a lasting peace is an indispensable condition for the attainment of the objectives of restructuring and for the acceleration of social and economic development.\nHowever, we are aware that on the balance sheet of international relations there are still many items on the debit side. The arms race is continuing. New programmes of armament costing billions are being launched. local conflicts persist and threaten to grow into major international crises. Like a scar on the conscience of mankind, mass violations of human rights such as racism and apartheid persist. Crises in the world economy are growing worse. Environmental problems are reaching critical dimensions.\nAll this sets a clear imperative for politicians, who bear a responsibility for the future of their nations: they must do their utmost to avert nuclear disaster, ensure stable peace and jointly resolve the most pressing problems of mankind.\nWe are not far from the date when the first day of a new century and a new millennium will appear on our calendars. We have a unique opportunity to pass this planet on to posterity as a safe and good place to live. That context gives special prominence to the humanistic legacy of the great October socialist revolution, the seventieth anniversary of which will soon be commemorated by mankind. That was an event of extraordinary, epoch-making importance. It introduced into world politics the concept of peaceful coexistence between States with differing social systems. It is of more than symbolic significance that in its very first document, Lenin's decree on peace, the October Revolution rejected armed force as an instrument of foreign policy. \nToday in Czechoslovakia, in the socialist world, a major restructuring of all spheres of social life is under way in the light of those ideas, and the process of deepening socialist democracy is continuing. This is all tied very closely to universal human values, to the need to build and establish relationships of close joint action among States in our interrelated world, where the relationship between the national and the international is changing. It is an appeal to work together and make use of all the possibilities available.\nThe Czechoslovak people have a vital interest in the success of the peace policy. They regard it as a guarantee of their present and their future. In the words of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, Gustav Husak: \\\"We shall contribute to the strengthening of the front of peace, sound reason and realism in the world so as to make the prospects of peace ever safer.\\\"\nThat aim is also being pursued through the initiative concerning the establishment of a comprehensive system of international peace and security introduced in this forum by the socialist countries. It should constitute a set of specific, jointly agreed measures that would primarily provide, to an ever increasing degree, for greater effectiveness and practical reinforcement of the binding power of the fundamental laws of international life as embodied in the United Nations Charter.\nThe reality of a secure world is inseparably tied to its safeguards. The mechanism for this should be the United Nations. This is our understanding of the well-known article by Mikhail S. Gorbachev that was published on the eve of this session. We believe that the suggestions formulated therein will give a strong impetus to the activity of the United Nations and of all States in building and safeguarding comprehensive security. \nWe believe that the creation of security guarantees in the military sphere, the adoption of concrete measures for halting the arms build-up and proceeding to step-by-step disarmament, and the reduction of the military potential of States to reasonable levels are of decisive importance. Such measures would be conducive to the implementation of the programme, vital to mankind, for the elimination of nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction by the year 2000. That programme is realistic because it is based on the need to ensure equal security for all participating countries at all stages of the disarmament process.\nWe are confident that the first genuine breakthrough in the field of nuclear disarmament will be the conclusion and implementation o\u00a3 the treaty on the global elimination of Soviet and United States intermediate-range and operational-tactical nuclear missiles. We have done our best to facilitate that positive move towards real disarmament and. we are ready to continue our efforts in the expectation that other countries directly concerned will proceed in the same spirit.\nThe conclusion of this treaty at a summit meeting should be a historic prologue to the unfolding of a comprehensive process of disarmament in which a 50 per cent reduction of strategic offensive weapons, with consistent observance of the Soviet-United States anti-ballistic-missile Treaty, could be the next step.\nWe welcome the idea of stepping up the work of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament so that it may gradually become a permanent, universal negotiating body on disarmament. In our view it should work on a year-round basis. We feel that it would be appropriate to consider this subject also and to adopt corresponding measures, for instance at the third special session of the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament, to be held next year.\nAnother hopeful sign this year is the development with regard to a convention on the complete prohibition of chemical weapons and the elimination of stockpiles of such weapons. The conclusion of such a convention would also be an event of great importance for all mankind. In this context/ we appreciate the constructive statement of the Soviet Union in Geneva this year that in the negotiations it will proceed on the basis of the legal stipulation of the principle of mandatory inspections upon request and without the right of rejection. We fully endorse that approach and hope that other countries will proceed on the same lines. That position is a demonstration of the readiness of the socialist countries to ensure effective verification of the entire disarmament process in conditions of openness and confidence. In this spirit we want to take an active part in consideration of verification questions in the United Nations as well.\nThe need to resolve the issue of a ban on the testing of nuclear weapons is ever more imperative. We believe that this, too, will be significantly facilitated by the agreed comprehensive phased negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States. We continue to regard it as extraordinarily important to prevent the stationing of weapons in space and agree on a programme of joint practical action in the peaceful uses of outer space. We support the establishment of a system of international verification of the preservation of peace in outer space.\nGlobal security is closely linked with the strengthening of security and the development of peaceful relations, co-operation and confidence in Europe, a continent which, unfortunately, is still burdened with an excessive quantity of nuclear and conventional arsenals. \u2116at is why it is especially necessary to have a policy of d\u00e9tente, that process of consolidating the foundations of the common European house that is proof of the viability of the principle of the coexistence of the two systems. Today, after some vacillation and even stagnation, and doubts having been overcome, the all-European process is again gaining momentum. More pronounced results have been achieved in the political, military, humanitarian and other spheres. \nThe Budapest appeal of the Warsaw Treaty countries to the States members of  the North Atlantic Treaty organisation (SATU) to agree on a substantial reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe remains highly topical. We are encouraged by the fact that the contours of future talks on those important questions, as well as on the development of confidence- and security-building, has begun to emerge in Vienna. We consider that those issues must be dealt with through the point of view of their interrelationship within the framework of the all-European process. An important part of European security and co-operation is the whole complex of mutual economic contacts. In order further to advance such contacts we proposed at the Vienna follow-up meeting the holding of a European economic forum in Prague, at which the whole range of questions relating to development in trade, industrial co-operation, finance and other specific areas would be addressed. \nOf no less importance in our view is the further development of co-operation in humanitarian matters. We are engaged in a constructive solution of these issues in both multilateral negotiations and bilateral relations. The entire humanitarian dimension of the European process, including respect for the political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights, should be considered at the proposed conference  the holding of which in Moscow we fully support. At the same time, it is our assumption that it is necessary to have an all-embracing approach to this subject, an approach that we are consequently pursuing.\nAt the session of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member States held in Berlin this year we called on the countries members of the NATO to engage in joint consultations on military doctrines. We reaffirmed that the Warsaw Treaty States will never, under any conditions, launch military actions against any state or alliance of States unless they themselves become the object of an armed attack, and they also stated that they would never be the first to use nuclear weapons.\nAs a country located along the line of contact between the two military and political groupings, we are very much interested in a supervised withdrawal of nuclear and other offensive weapons from national borders. We have therefore, jointly with the German Democratic Republic, proposed to the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free corridor along the line of contact between the NATO and Warsaw Treaty countries in Central Europe. Similarly, we have put forward a joint initiative for the creation of a chemical-weapon-free zone in the Central European region. This measure could be the first step towards the complete elimination of chemical weapons.\nIt is our view that stability would be strengthened significantly through implementation of the plan of the Government of the Polish People's Republic for a limitation of armaments and for enhancing trust and confidence in Central Europe. We call upon our partners to take a constructive stance on these proposals of ours and thus to engage in the solution of the questions of common security in a spirit of co-responsibility.\nThe ensuring of comprehensive international security is unthinkable without energetic efforts to bring about a just settlement of international disputes and conflicts which, in a number of places, continue to undermine world peace and stability.\nWe are deeply concerned over the dangerous escalation of military tension in the Persian Gulf, which threatens to result in an Internationalisation of the conflict. We fully support the United Nations Secretary-General in his efforts to bring about a termination of the Iraq-Iran war and we call for a consistent implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). The safety of navigation in the Gulf must be provided for by efforts of the international community as a whole.\nWe speak out with all resoluteness in favour of the holding of an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and of other parties directly concerned, Including the Palestine Liberation Organization. The convening of such a conference is gaining ever increasing support. We regard as a key question the consequent exercise of the inalienable right of the Palestinians to self-determination, including the establishment of their own State.\nWe commend the adoption of a peace plan for Central America at a meeting of the presidents of the countries of that region held this year in Guatemala and we appreciate the meritorious activity of the Contadora Group and of the countries supporting it. we value the determined steps taken by the Nicaraguan Government to carry out the decisions adopted. We vehemently condemn the illegal pressure exerted on this country, which is in direct contradiction with the basic norms of international law.\nWe are indignant over the untenable situation in southern Africa. The escalating acts of repression by the ruling racist minority against the native African population, the persisting occupation of Namibia and the overall increase in the aggressiveness of the Pretoria regime are destabilizing factors in international developments. We demand that all those who bear direct or indirect responsibility for the perpetuation of this perilous state of affairs proceed to adopt mandatory and effective sanctions, in harmony with the will of the international community, thus contributing to the eradication of apartheid. We resolutely support the just struggle of the front-line States against South African expansion.\nOur full support is extended to the policy of national reconciliation pursued by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan with increasing co-operation from all national forces. We are convinced that this policy, together with the peace-making mediation of the United Nations, will lead to a just settlement of the existing problems. In parallel, an end must of course be put to outside intervention against this peace process.\nWe welcome the fact that the idea of national consonance and harmony is gaining ground also in Kampuchea. We fully support the recent declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, which shows a realistic move towards genuine reconciliation and should therefore not remain unanswered.\nWe firmly advocate the solution to the problem of Cyprus through the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations, to provide for the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of this non-aligned country. \nDue credit must be given to the constructive proposals made by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with a view to dissolving tensions on the Korean peninsula and achieving the withdrawal of foreign forces and nuclear weapons. The initiative for a reduction of armed forces by both sides and the manifest willingness to take important unilateral steps in that direction is a significant contribution to the achievement of a peaceful reunification of the country.\nA valuable contribution by the United Nations to efforts aimed at a peaceful settlement of disputes is the working out of a draft declaration on the enhancement of the effectiveness of the principle of non-use of force in international relations. We express our desire to see this declaration unanimously adopted by the Assembly at this session.\nA considerable contribution to the attainment of the aims and objectives of our Organization in the field of global security could be made through implementation of a number of regional projects that have been contemplated.\nWorthy of primary attention in this regard are, in our view, the concepts of security, co-operation, confidence, and reduction of armaments in the Asian-Pacific region, the establishment of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, the conversion of the Mediterranean into an area of peaceful co-operation, and the proposal for the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world. Extraordinary interest has been shown in recent days in the important initiative of the Soviet Union to ensure security and co-operation in the northern regions of our planet; Czechoslovakia fully endorses the initiative.\nThe key tasks of achieving comprehensive security are also linked with the need for a basic improvement in international economic relations. Along with the other socialist countries, Czechoslovakia takes an unequivocal stance on these questions. A realistic solution can be found in generating the economic security of every State, of entire continents, and of the whole world within the framework of a comprehensive system of international security. This presupposes, among other things, the adoption of effective measures to break the fetters of massive indebtedness. What is required is the restructuring of the world monetary system, additional easements for the least developed countries, and gradual elimination of protectionism. Briefly, what is needed is the overcoming of backwardness through the dynamism of broad international economic co-operation. \nSimilarly, we consider it necessary to develop further the ideas and conclusions of the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. In their memorandum to the Conference the socialist countries presented an integrated plan for a realistic solution to those questions. We express our appreciation of the contributions made by all the participants to the success of the Conference.\nAs regards the ecological dimension of security we see the underlying solution of the relationship between man and nature in all aspects of human activities, in an improvement in the quality and rational utilization of the environment and of its resources in the interests of individual nations and of people everywhere. This includes measures to prevent abuse of the environment as a result of industrial and agricultural production, the use of preventive measures and early warning systems, and reparations for damages in cases of ecologically dangerous accidents. Sooner or later, ecological security must also encompass elimination of the most hazardous factors that threaten to destroy the conditions for life on our planet, namely, weapons of mass destruction.\nFor our part, we approach the discussion of these problems in all seriousness. As a State situated in the centre of Europe, we are confronted by those problems in an especially urgent manner. We allocate large sums of money for their solution. At the same time, we realize that an overall solution can be reached only if forces are joined within the framework of a global strategy for environmental conservation. We would urge the United Nations to begin to formulate such a strategy without delay. For our part, we are prepared at this session to contribute to such a programme.\nThe endeavour to participate actively in finding constructive solutions to international problems has a long-standing tradition in our country. It emanates from the inherent interests of our people, from the very roots of our socialist society, and from the foreign policy of our country. in these efforts, we proceed from the assumption that the United Nations is an irreplaceable global mechanism for co-operation designed to solve the fundamental questions of our times and to serve as a universal guarantor of peaceful coexistence and comprehensive security. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic will continue to do its best to enhance the prestige of our Organization and make full use of its potential in the interests of peace and the security of nations. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe are once again gathered here in the General Assembly Hall of the United Nations, where so many debates have been heard on the most pressing questions of stability, peace and security in our world.\nWe are interrupted in our daily comforts by extremely grave images of suffering which regularly come to the fore from the four corners of the extended village our world has become, laying bare the desperation of millions of men, women and children who are deprived of the most basic requirements of life or of their legitimate tights as citizens.\nHowever, we must persevere in our faith in the future, which is what brings us h ere together. We must continue and intensify our actions in order to fashion our world to reflect the hopes of all peoples, which are still counting on the capacity of our Organization to lead them towards a future of peace, dignity and prosperity.\nI should like to say that my country is very much aware of our responsibilities once again to share in and promote the spirit of dialogue and harmony which imbues the work of this Assembly. Togo is unswervingly devoted to the noble ideals of the United Nations. Hence I am very pleased to bring you, Mr. President, and all the delegations present here the fraternal greetings and message of peace and solidarity of the people and the Government of Togo, as well as of His Excellency General Gnassingbe Eyadema, President and founder of the Rally of the Togolese People and President of our Republic.\nI am especially happy to express to you, Mr. President, the heartfelt congratulations of the Togolese delegation on your resounding election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. Your competence and proven reputation as a skilful diplomat, as well as the sincere devotion of your country, the German Democratic Republic, to the ideals of international peace and co-operation made you a natural choice for this post. We are sure that as a result of this choice our work will be carried out harmoniously and successfully.\nMay I also congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Choudhury of Bangladesh, on the skill with which he led the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly and ensured its full success.\nI should like, through the Secretary-General, to hail the entire United Nations system for its prominent role in favour of peace, security and international development. We take comfort in seeing Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar once again carrying out his functions with his well-known devotion and calm determination. We should like to congratulate him on his timely and wise initiatives to give our Organization renewed energy capable of enhancing its credibility and effectiveness. In this regard the Togolese Government is following with deep interest his mediation efforts to resolve conflict situations.\nMy delegation is particularly happy to find Ambassador Reed at your side, Mr. President, for he has gained the confidence and friendship of us all. We wish him full success in his new high functions.\nIt has been unanimously agreed on the occasion of the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of our Organization that the United Nations remains the only world institution where there are discussions which, as repetitive as they may seem, awaken the conscience of world leaders on the choices that must be made and the urgent solutions that must be reached. It is that indispensable role of the United Nations which is the reason for our being here to seek solutions to the problems besetting the world. Indeed, it is very disturbing to note that, despite oft-repeated professions of faith in our declarations - which particularly characterized the last session devoted to the International Year of Peace - the world is hardly in better shape. Peace remains precarious. The obstacles in the way of negotiation and understanding among peoples are increasing, thus fomenting conflicts of all kinds.\nIn the face of turbulence that at times shakes our faith in the future, the United Nations, because of its presence and permanence, is the embodiment of the triumph of reason over force, of intelligence over passions.\nBut there is still a long way to go before reason can triumph over brute force in South Africa, where at the cost of much blood and untenable violence the majority of the population is kept under total domination by the white minority. The hopes raised last year by the great wave of protests against apartheid have waned today, given Pretoria's blind obstinacy. Africa for its part will never give up its struggle for dignity and freedom. Indeed, how can we allow a system to persist on part of our continent where the most basic civil rights are flouted because of skin colour. How can Africa, as declared by the President of the Togolese Republic, General Gnassingbe Eyadema,\n\\\"resign itself to an unjust situation of oppression such as that now prevailing in this region, where a regime unworthy of mankind and our times and contrary to any and all morality, is maintained through unspeakable violence against a population whose only crime is the colour of its skin.\\\" Par from giving up their inhuman system the defenders of this absurd concept of political society are stiffening their intransigence. The state of emergency declared last year to silence the protests and revolts is still in force, to the great misery of the black population. It is time that Pretoria unconditionally give up once and for all its infamous system of apartheid. This is a requirement of history. All peoples have a common destiny of freedom, and no form of oppression, whatever its violence and its duration, can halt their unstoppable march towards dignity. This is a lesson which is often forgotten, but which remains eternally valid.\nMore than ever it is important for the international community to increase pressure by all available means. That is why, in order to support the resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council must adopt against South Africa the comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter, The Togolese Government reaffirms its full support for liberation movements, in particular, the African National Congress (ANC), whose constant willingness to engage in dialogue has been proved. We pay tribute to Nelson Mandela, symbol of the determination of the black people to fight humiliation and to refuse to yield to despair. Namibia is still being occupied in violation of international law and United Nations resolutions, despite our proclamations and our warnings. The rigours imposed by apartheid and its excesses are still being suffered there. Pretoria is brazenly increasing the obstacles to implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (197\u0398), which prescribes the unconditional independence of the Territory. In specifically and abusively linking the withdrawal of its troops from Namibia to the withdrawal of the Cuban forces from Angola, the racist regime is resorting to diversion and scorning our resolutions in order to stalemate negotiations and perpetuate its illegal occupation of the Territory. The international community and the United Nations should use all means that could help bring South Africa to accept speedy implementation of resolution 435 (1978). For its part, Togo takes this opportunity to renew its firm support for the heroic struggle of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the sole, authentic representative of the Namibian people.\nWe must do everything possible to halt the aggressions being arbitrarily unleashed against the civilian populations of the front-line countries, which are courageously serving as ramparts against injustice and racism. The Togolese Government hails the determination of the leaders and peoples of the front-line States who are opposing the violence and provocations of the South African army and the rebels taking orders from Pretoria.\nThe situation in Chad is a legitimate subject of concern for us all. Twenty years of fratricidal war have exhausted that country and its fraternal people, who aspire to peace in union with their sons and families, with the integrity of their territory restored. Our country hails the desire for national reconciliation which has been affirmed there. Unity among all the people of Chad is indispensable in order to rebuild and guarantee the independence of their country, which should then at last be able to devote itself to the essential tasks of development. \nWe are pleased to note that the parties to the conflict support the proposal of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for a cease-fire so that this dispute between them over the Aouzou Strip can be settled peacefully and definitively.\nIn order to prevent a further deterioration of the situation, on 17 September last the political bureau of the Assembly of the Togolese people urged the parties to the conflict to abstain from the use of force and advocated the following three-point plan for the peaceful solution of the dispute: first, an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of all forces involved from the Aouzou Strip; secondly, dispatch into the field of a neutral intermediary force, whose composition would be determined by the two parties involved, and whose mission it would be to ensure respect for the cease-fire) and, finally, acceptance by both parties of arbitration by the International Court of Justice.\nIn Western Sahara, the parties to the conflict have still not achieved a satisfactory agreement on the question of self-determination. We must continue to encourage all those who are trying to reconcile the various positions Involved, We hope that intransigence will give way to greater flexibility so that an agreement can be brought about as quickly as possible in accordance with resolution 104 of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and General Assembly resolution 4 0/50. We hail the unceasing efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Acting President of the OAU to find a just and equitable solution to this conflict.\nThe war between Iraq and Iran is assuming unexpected dimensions that are greatly disturbing the entire international community. Indeed, recent developments in that conflict and the excessive concentration of military might in the small Gulf area indeed justify our fears. Indeed, all States that are truly aware of the gravity of the situation that has thus been brought about have greeted with relief the Security Council resolution directing Iraq and Iran to put an end to the hostilities, and we hope that that decision, which followed upon many appeals to the two belligerents, will be implemented so that the confrontation can be brought to an end in the interests of all. In this regard, the hopes raised by the recent peace missions of the Secretary-General to Iran and Iraq must not be disappointed.\nLebanon is living through a situation of open and permanent warfare whose origins go far back in time. The Lebanese nation is slowly crumbling as a result of the cruel and implacable war, which is constantly escaping control and reason. No one can be indifferent to the Lebanese tragedy. The violence it is engendering poses a real threat to stability in the Middle East. We invite the parties to renew their dialogue so that they may achieve an agreement that would make it possible for that country to return to peace and stability. Peace should be the basic objective in dealing with this acute conflict, which has pitted Israel against the Arab countries for many years now. At the centre of this conflict there remains the painful Palestinian problem. My country supports the idea of an international conference that would bring together, under the auspices of the United Nations, all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). \u00a1Such a conference should find appropriate solutions to the problems facing the countries of the region.\nThis year we again have on our agenda the painful problem of Kampuchea. My country has on several occasions expressed its position on the foreign domination to which that country is subjected. We feel that nothing justifies the occupation of a country by forces foreign to it. The eight-point proposal of the Tripartite Coalition led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk is conducive to making possible an agreement between the parties to the conflict. The United Nations should continue to support the Government of Democratic Kampuchea, and the Government of Togo wishes here and now to reaffirm its firm support for the people of Democratic Kampuchea in their struggle for territorial integrity and independence. \nAfghanistan, also, is a victim of the occupation of its territory by foreign troops, and that has forced its people to engage in armed resistance and exodus from the country. Togo hails the decision on the withdrawal of foreign troops and desires its effective implementation so that that country may be freed and its people may have the government of their choice free of foreign interference.\nThe Korean war ended with the division into two parts of Korean territory. Today the Korean people, whose common destiny springs from geography, culture and thousands of years of shared history, is suffering as a result of that division. The international community should not be indifferent to that tragedy. It should support the three-point plan of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, implementation of which would culminate in the constitution of a Democratic Federal Republic of Korea, in which each of the two Koreas would have the regime of its choice pending final reunification. At the end of that process, Korea could be admitted to the United Nations as a single, United national entity. Any other solution would serve to perpetuate the present arbitrary division of the country. That is why we urge the international community and the United Nations to support the efforts to ensure reunification of the Korean homeland.\nIn Central America hope is being reborn following the .agreement signed last August in Guatemala City by the five principal States of the region to bring about peace in that region. We hope that the parties concerned and all other interested parties will abstain from any measures that could disturb effective implementation of that agreement. My country would like to pay a tribute to President Arias Sanchez and to hail the exceptional contribution of Costa Rica as well as that of the Contadora group of countries to the restoration of peace in Central America.\nThe persistence of these zones of tension make the vital need for world disarmament all the clearer to US, The accumulation of arms in the world maintains and increases the climate of distrust and suspicion which incites States to engage in the arms race. Only effective and complete disarmament will make it possible for all nations to live in peace. This objective requires the courage and objectivity of us all. The United Nations should therefore strengthen its powers of dissuasion and promote peaceful behaviour and a peaceful spirit among peoples and Governments. Individually and collectively, our States should work towards this objective. \nOur world is today at a crossroads and it must choose between continuing to arm and continuously endangering the human species and proceeding to general and complete disarmament, which would release new resources that could be used to improve the living conditions of our peoples.\nThere is thus a real link between disarmament and development. The evidence for that link was clearly emphasized at the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which has just concluded its work. We hope that the efforts made in this connection will be pursued relentlessly, making it possible to determine the precise means by which resources released by disarmament will be reallocated to programmes for the economic, social and cultural development of our peoples.\nIt is encouraging that since last year significant progress has been made in the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on nuclear disarmament. While we pay a tribute to those two great Powers for their courage, tenacity and sense of responsibility, we must say that their efforts should be increased and continued unceasingly and extended to all types of conventional, strategic and other weapons. We extend our warm congratulations to the Soviet Union and the United States for the important agreement on medium-range missiles which they have just concluded.\nIt is the duty of all States, large or small, to participate in our Organization's efforts to bring about disarmament. That is why Togo is pleased to have on its soil the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa. My country has already concretely demonstrated its support for the Centre and will continue to support it to the best of its ability.\n\nTerrorism in its present manifestations is a permanent danger to peace and a constant threat to the foundations of the political organization of our societies. My country, Togo, twice the victim, in 1985 and in September 1986, of mindless, blind terrorism, feels that this is a scourge with which the international community must deal with all the vigilance and determination that it demands.\nIn addition to the political problems which assail it, our world is also experiencing a tragic economic situation. Today the peoples' growth and development should be an objective of and a responsibility shared by all States. And here, as elsewhere, our ability to find appropriate solutions to the problems born of profound imbalances in international economic relations depends upon our understanding and our co-operation.\nIt should be no surprise that I am beginning my statement on this subject with the critical economic situation in Africa, which is of the greatest possible concern to the Governments and peoples of the continent. This is- not the time to go at great length into Africa's economic situation; we have discussed that thoroughly, particularly during the special session which our Organization devoted to consideration of the question last year. However, I should like to recall that Africa is today the poorest continent on our planet. It accounts for the greatest number of least developed countries, and is exposed to such serious natural calamities as drought and desertification. Finally, it is a continent confronted by a continuing decrease in its export earnings and a considerable foreign debt the repayment of which heavily mortgages its development prospects. Africa has made enormous sacrifices to extricate itself from this tragic situation. It has begun structural adjustment programmes whose implementation has forced it to abandon many development projects. Many African countries have adopted economic recovery measures which had a considerable effect on the standard of living of their populations. \nHowever, those efforts have not attracted the support expected of the international community. In particular, the international community has not fulfilled its commitment to mobilize additional resources within the framework of the United Nations Programme for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa, adopted last year, in these conditions, it will soon be impossible for the African countries to make the additional sacrifices without seriously compromising social peace, stability and domestic security. That is why my country appeals urgently to the International community to respect its commitments and substantially increase its assistance to the African continent to enable it to overcome its difficulties with regard to economic and social development.\nThe analysis of the present economic situation in Africa naturally leads us to consider the more general problem of the Indebtedness of the developing countries, and in particular that of the reduction of the prices of raw materials and, consequently, the deterioration in the terms of trade. These are questions which are inextricably linked and whose solution Is a challenge to our Imagination, innovative capacity and collective intelligence. It is a challenge that we must meet.\nTo this end, the Organization of African unity (OAU) decided to devote a special session towards the end of this year to consideration of this question, which urgently requires solution. To reach such a solution it is clearly necessary to deal directly with the structural causes of indebtedness and especially with the factors that compromise the ability of the debtor countries to repay: namely, the erratic fluctuations in currency rates and increases in interest rates. These are undoubtedly some of the factors that explain the irresistible growth of debt despite the praiseworthy efforts of developing countries to honour their commitments. \nIt is urgently necessary that effective measures be taken to alleviate countries' debt burden. In a spirit of responsibility and solidarity, agreements between debtors and creditors must lead to the revision of agreements and the application of Interest rates and repayment arrangements under very easy conditions. The pure, and simple cancellation of debts to which some creditor countries have kindly agreed is an Important step in the right direction. We wish once again to express our great gratitude to those countries for their gesture of solidarity and understanding.\nIt is necessary also that developed countries do everything they can to achieve or even exceed as soon as possible the objective of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance. In the case of the least developed countries, this assistance should be increased to 1.5 per cent of the gross national product, or doubled, in accordance with the New Substantial Programme of Action for the 1980s. Official development assistance should not only increase In volume, but should be accompanied by favourable conditions, in particular symbolic Interest rates and sufficiently lengthy periods of grace and repayment.\nAs regards the international economic environment, the recent Initiatives and studies undertaken by the international community have not been In keeping with the situation. This is true of the results of the summit meeting of the seven most industrialized countries held this year in Venice. Those countries expressed their desire to contribute to bringing about more balanced relations and greater solidarity between the industrialized countries and the third world, but the Venice conclusions did not respond to the expectations of the developing countries. This is also true, with regard to the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), held last July in Geneva, of which we had legitimate hopes. However, UNCTAD VII was not able to attack International economic problems with the necessary courage and political will. A difficult compromise was achieved on the items considered, but the many instances of reticence shown by some developed countries with regard to measures for restructuring the world economy constitute a source of major concern for the developing countries.\nNevertheless, we reaffirm that UNCTAD, despite its present difficulties, should continue to be an organ of special importance for consideration, negotiation and decision in the area of international economic co-operation. In South-South co-operation, geographical distance should not be an insurmountable obstacle to the intensification of economic exchanges between developing countries. That has been reaffirmed twice this year - by the ministerial conference on economic co-operation between non-aligned countries, held at Pyongyang, and at the meeting on Africa's economic recovery, held at Abuja, the new capital of Nigeria. In this regard we roust evaluate all of the economic potential of the developing countries in order to benefit from the ways in which they complement one another.\nIn so doing, we shall improve our opportunities further to develop fruitful relations capable of increasing our collective autonomy. Within this framework we should encourage attempts at economic integration being made in Latin America, Asia and Africa. In Africa, in particular, our countries are making sustained efforts, in implementation of the Lagos Plan of Action adopted in 1980 by the Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) , to draw their resources together and integrate their economies within sub regional organizations, pending the conclusion of the process of setting up a vast common market covering the continent.\nThe United Nations was created because twice in one generation the whole world was shaken by a murderous, devastating war. Ending violence, maintaining and strengthening peace, and promoting economic and social development were the main goals that the founding fathers set for the Organization. All Member States, big and small, must make their contribution to the realization of those noble objectives and to the strengthening of the Organization. Let them, in a spirit of close solidarity, join their forces to struggle against the real and growing threats to their collective well-being and unite to establish a new world order in which all will derive the energy, and see the need, for building together a world more in accordance with the deep aspirations of the peoples to peace and justice. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I first of all congratulate Ambassador Florin most warmly on his unanimous election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly, The delegation of Burma believes that the deliberations at this session will prove constructive and fruitful under his able guidance, I take this opportunity also to pay a sincere tribute to Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury for his most valuable contribution to the work of the Assembly at the preceding session.\nThe regular sessions of the General Assembly have always afforded us a very welcome opportunity to look at the years that have gone by and to look ahead, into the future. During past years, and particularly since the last World War, the winds of change have swept all over the world. We have seen the collapse of colonial empires and the birth of newly independent States. Science and technology - the essential key to modern progress and prosperity - have marched apace with all the attendant developments, both positive and negative, in our international environment. The world's population has been multiplying, and we have witnessed the rising tide of expectations among people throughout the world for such fundamental rights as equality and dignity, sovereignty and independence, peace and security and, above all, economic and social well-being.\nIt is perfectly fitting that the United Nations Charter opens with the solemn vow \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind ...\\\" and \\\"to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\\\". The provisions of the Charter thus continue to reflect the constantly changing mood and aspirations of present-day human society and the circumstances of our time. This surely is proof of the continuing validity of the Charter principles, which constitute the foundation of our Organization.\nNo aspects of human life have been spared the impact and influence of the forces generated by the constantly changing circumstances of the international environment. Consequently, the history of the post-war years is particularly one of an endless and extremely difficult process of great human endeavours to adjust and readjust to the rapidly changing needs of the time. The United Nations has indeed played a very necessary, an essential role in charting our challenging path towards a more secure and prosperous world. Notwithstanding that fact, the international scene has been clouded by tensions, instability and uncertainties which are very much in evidence wherever we look - in the political and social spheres, in trade and commerce, in transport and communications, and so on.\nThis brings us to the question of international peace and security. The collective security system envisaged in the Chatter is based on the recognition that, by and large, the maintenance of international peace and security depends on the big Powers which have, together or individually, the capability to make or mar its prospects. It was on the basis of that very recognition that the founding fathers of the United Nations saw to it that a special status of permanent membership was conferred upon the big Five in the Security Council, the supreme body in matters of war and peace. Indeed, the grim reality of today is also the continued dominance of the super-Powers in international relations.\nUnfortunately, the harmony that marked the relationship between the big Powers when the Charter was being hammered out in San Francisco and before, diminished rapidly after the conclusion of the Second World War. Meanwhile, the problems that confront our Organization have increased many fold, broadened in scope and become increasingly complex. Any effort to promote peace and security in any part of the world can be restricted by sheer indifference or greatly enhanced by the support of the big Powers. A certain degree of understanding between them is essential before we can hope to gain tangible results in any peace-making process.\nThe foremost issue of international concern is the prevention of a war in which nuclear weapons will be used. This is a common danger that all countries face and no national security policy can protect States from that threat, for the dynamics of a nuclear war know no sanctuary. In past wars it was possible to destroy a village, a town or even a country. Now, nuclear weapons threaten all mankind in its planetary dimension. So long as nuclear weapons exist there can be no guarantee that they will not be used and we cannot dismiss the possibility of an outbreak of nuclear war due to accident, miscalculation or failure of communication. World peace and security cannot endure indefinitely in conditions in which the spiralling of the arms race, particularly the nuclear arms race, continues without respite. The attainment of general disarmament and the elimination of nuclear weapons are issues of paramount importance not only to the major Powers but to all other countries of the world.\nThe United Nations came into existence a few short weeks only before the age of nuclear weapons and the implications of the nuclear age were not fully anticipated when the Charter was constituted. However, the collective security envisaged therein, born of the realization of the Second World War, requires that nations settle their differences by peaceful means without resource to arms, and is to be realized through disarmament.\nFrom all accounts the bilateral process of disarmament negotiations has not only been intensified but also accelerated recently. In our view, these are steps in the right direction worthy of universal acclaim and we are encouraged by the present course of developments.\nThe situation in the Middle East and its implications for international peace and security continue to be of concern to the United Nations. The international community has reiterated year after year that the success of the continuing search for peace in the Middle East lies in the solution of the Palestine problem. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) remain valid as embodying the principles for a just and comprehensive settlement. These, indeed, are essential prerequisites for a peaceful solution. Moreover, central to the solution of the problem is recognition of the right of all States in the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to regain their national rights, including the right to sovereignty and independence.\nThe viable option towards the path to peace lies in a negotiated settlement among all the parties concerned. That is why the idea that has once again been gaining ground of the convening of an international peace conference and the need for the Security Council to take initiatives on this matter is indeed a positive development.\nLebanon is still tottering under the impact of external encroachment upon its sovereignty and independence. The two major Powers in the region, Iran and Iraq  have been fiercely locked in armed hostilities. The situation in the entire region of the Middle East is really ominous. Unless timely action can be taken to bring them under control there is a very real danger of the hostilities spilling over to other areas, thereby engulfing all the countries in the region. The delegation of Burma highly commends the ongoing efforts of the Secretary-General with a view to bringing about a process of negotiation in the spirit of the Charter and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.\nThe Assembly continues to witness a situation in South Africa in which there is no sign of improvement as the country's regime continues, by the perpetuation of the system of apartheid, to deny the majority its rights as a people. The illegal occupation of Namibia by the South African regime continues to deprive the people of that country of their independence, and its acts of aggression against and territorial violations of neighbouring countries pose a continuing threat to the peace and stability of the region. South Africa shows no inclination to begin the process of peaceful dialogue. The international community has condemned apartheid with one voice and the need has been recognized for a concerted course of action by the United Nations consistent with Chapter VII of the Charter, to exercise pressure in a peaceful way so that the South African regime may abandon its present policies and practices.\nNearly a decade has passed since, as a result of foreign intervention and occupation, the peoples of Kampuchea and Afghanistan were deprived of their independence and the right of self-determination. The restoration of their rights has been consistently on the agenda of the United Nations. Moreover, the peoples of those two countries have suffered much, and that has given a humanitarian dimension to the problem. Although the situations are somewhat similar in their basic character, they arose out of particular developments and circumstances in the region and their solution lies in resolving the problems of each country within the regional context. The similarity is that the solutions to the problems would require the complete withdrawal of foreign forces and a negotiated settlement of a comprehensive character between the parties concerned. Despite the complexity of the issues, the United Nations General Assembly has, year after year \u0159 adopted resolutions, with the support of the vast majority, embodying the principles and modalities for a just and negotiated settlement.\nBurma has consistently supported the General Assembly resolutions on Kampuchea and Afghanistan since it believes that peaceful settlements on the basis of those resolutions would create the conditions for the restoration of the right to national sovereignty and self-determination of these two peoples.\nWith regard to the situation in Kampuchea, the implications for regional peace and stability are of particular concern. We believe that the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Kampuchean people would create conditions favourable to the mutual trust and understanding which are essential for the realization of regional co-operation on peace and development. At the same time a solution to the conflict in Afghanistan would also create conditions for peace within the region, which in turn would enhance the prospects for the solution of international issues with global dimensions.\nThe performance of the world economy has been sluggish for some time. Two years ago, three major factors - namely, the fall in the price of oil, the value of the dollar and interest rates - gave rise to some hopes for more vigorous growth in 1986 and 1987. The general assessment now is that these hopes did not materialize in 1986 and that the prospects for 1987 are also far from bright. Developing countries generally rely on their export of primary commodities to earn the precious hard currency for financing their investment projects and essential imports. The dramatic decline in the prices of primary commodities started some 10 years ago and has continued without much interruption. They have subsequently fallen even faster. This situation is true for most primary commodities, agriculture and forest products and minerals and metals alike. On the other hand, the developing countries have to pay ever higher prices for the import of manufactured goods from developed industrialized countries. These factors naturally set in motion a chain reaction of adverse effects for all developing countries in terms of their capacity to save, to import and to invest, thereby creating grave difficulties in their balance of payments and terms of trade and necessitating resort to more and more borrowing abroad.\nThis is how the developing countries come to be overburdened with an immense volume of international debt and debt-servicing needs, which has the effect of dissipating the most energetic efforts of the developing countries in their search for a viable economy, which proves elusive. Over-indebtedness and an increasingly deteriorating balance of payments and trade cannot be expected to be confined to any country or group of countries or to any sector or sectors of the world's economy. They cannot but be pervasive and far-reaching in effect. This has indeed been evident in the difficulties encountered world-wide by both developing and developed countries, and also in the recent upheavals caused to the international banking and financial institutions.\nAt this points to only one conclusion if we are to overcome the present economic difficulties - be they trade and aid, money and finance or development - all Member States must work together in a spirit of co-operation in order to explore ways and means for the effective reversal of the current trend and place the world on the path of sustained and balanced growth.\nLast year the United Nations faced a crisis in its history which ostensibly was financial in nature but the root cause of which apparently went deeper. Out of such difficulties arose an opportunity for the United Nations to improve its administrative and financial efficiency, which led to a decision on a broad range of measures. My delegation believes that the agreement is the first essential step in the implementation of the measures necessary to improve the structural and financial efficiency of the United Nations. It was without doubt due to a spirit of accommodation on all sides that consensus prevailed on such a broad and complex issue. The decisions reached go far beyond organizational reforms. It can be said that they constitute a commitment on the part of all Members to the view that a viable and effective United Nations is needed if it is to serve the noble purpose for which it was intended. Such a commitment requires that Member States fulfil their financial obligations under the Charter. The decision last year to reform the United Nations system was a step in the long-term effort in which we all should persevere. What is essentially necessary is a spirit of accommodation and co-operation which should continue to prevail for the effective implementation of that reform.\nThe delegation of Burma fully sympathizes with the Secretary-General, who must lead the Organization at this critical phase. We wish him all success in his tireless efforts to bring about the requisite consensus and spirit of mutual accommodation with a view to resolving the current problems. The delegation of Burma hopes that the deliberations of the current session will go a long way to infuse renewed vigour into the work of the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I join other delegations in congratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its forty-second session. I am fully confident that the experience and wisdom which is yours will enable you to guide us efficiently throughout the months of challenging work that lie before us. My friend and colleague Mr\u00b7 Ellemann-Jensen, Foreign Minister of Denmark, addressed the Assembly earlier this week, expressing the views of the Twelve members of the European Community on some major international problems we are faced with in the world today. The Netherlands fully shares the views he expressed on that occasion.\nWith satisfaction we note a distinct improvement of the international climate. As a number of speakers before roe have done, we warmly welcome the agreement in principle reached last week in Washington by Secretary of State Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze on the complete elimination of longer and shorter-range intermediate nuclear forces. This significant outcome augurs well not only for relations between East and West but for the entire world community.\nIn this Organization a better appreciation by Member States of the limits and possibilities of international co-operation is emerging. Between North and South there seems to be a growing willingness to listen to each other and to strive for mutual accommodation and practical progress, as was recently evident at the Seventh Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). We observe a new sense of realism or - as some might prefer to call it - of pragmatic idealism. This gives us the feeling that we are gradually leaving behind the days of polarization, I hope that this will prove to be a lasting trend.\nProspects for increasing the relevance of the United Nations therefore appear favourable\u00b7 As was rightly stressed in a recent thought-provoking report by the United Nations Association of the United States of America, the United Nations needs, within the framework of the Charter, \\\"a sharper definition of goals, a more effective deployment of means and a revitalized mandate\\\". After all, one of the main problems confronting this Organization has been its vague and often over-ambitious programmes together with limited possibilities for their implementation. Therefore, I whole-heartedly agree with the Secretary-General when he states in his annual report that pragmatism and vision can go together and that \\\"... a vision without the definition of realistic means of approaching it can lead to disillusionment and cynicism\\\". (P/42/1, p. 17) . \nIt is striking to see how the United Nations is reasserting the role envisaged for it in the Charter, both with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security and with regard to issues resulting from growing interdependence. On each of those two areas I wish to share some thoughts with the Assembly.\nThe Security Council has been entrusted in the Charter with the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. On the one hand we fully recognize the value of regional arrangements and initiatives for the prevention and control of conflict in various parts of the world. A recent example is the agreement signed early in August in Guatemala City during the summit conference on Central America, an agreement warmly welcomed by the Kingdom of the Netherlands. We hope that its implementation will receive support and encouragement from all quarters. On the other hand we observe that the United Nations has become a key protagonist in the search for viable solutions for the Iran-Iraq war, the occupation of Afghanistan, the Arab-Israeli conflict and the very difficult situations in Lebanon, the Western Sahara, Cyprus, Kampuchea and southern Africa. This clearly indicates the useful role of this universal Organization, in particular through the active involvement of the Security Council and the Secretary-General.\nThe adoption by consensus of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) testified to this and marked a spirit of harmony amongst the members of the Security Council almost unthinkable two years ago. But the momentum thus created will have to be sustained. The resolution should be implemented immediately and fully. The parties involved may be expected to exercise due restraint so as to avoid escalation and expansion of the conflict. We pledge our support for the tireless efforts of Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar to terminate this tragic conflict. There are no doubt valid reasons for raising the question of the origins of the war and of culpability. However, that in no way alters the clear injunction contained in the resolution that hostilities must cease. Insisting on the termination of the war, which has caused so much human suffering and material devastation, cannot be considered as taking sides in the conflict. We want to maintain good relations with both parties. Our insistence follows from the obligation in the Charter to respect the authority of the Security Council.\nFor centuries, freedom of navigation in international waters has been one of the basic principles of international law. Already in the seventeenth century a distinguished Dutch scholar, politician and diplomat, Hugo Grotius, applied his formidable intellectual talents to this legal principle pertaining to the high seas in his treatise Mare liberum. For the Netherlands, as a traditionally sea-faring nation, freedom of navigation is fundamental. It should be respected also in the waters of the Gulf. In our opinion the United Nations and its Member States should ensure that this now universally accepted principle is upheld. The Netherlands has made it clear that it would like to see the United Nations assume responsibility for the protection of international shipping in the Gulf and that my country would be prepared to contribute to a United Nations operation to that effect if one were to be undertaken. In the meantime, as the threat to the freedom of navigation persists, the Netherlands, after consulting with its partners in the Western European Union, has decided to participate in efforts to keep the waters of the Gulf free of mines, which we feel is to the benefit of all, but such efforts should in no way be considered as a substitute for early and full implementation of resolution 598 (1987).\nThe efforts of the United Nations to end the war between Iran and Iraq have once again illustrated the need for an improved mechanism for fact-finding. That could greatly contribute to strengthening the role of the Secretary-General in the dispatch of his responsibilities with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security. We consider it highly desirable that the Secretary-General be provided with adequate means to increase the early-warning capacity of the Organization.\nWe warmly welcome his endeavours and those of his Special Representative to bring to an end the continuing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The invasion of that country was brought about within a period of not more than one week. After almost eight years the time has come for a speedy and unconditional withdrawal of all Soviet troops as a prerequisite of a lasting and peaceful settlement.\nKampuchea, too, still suffers under foreign occupation. We never closed our eyes to the atrocities committed in that country in the past, but they do not in any way justify the continuing occupation of that country by Vietnamese troops.\nComing back to the so-welcome improvement in the East-West climate, the quest for new approaches in the Soviet Union and in the East European countries is creating prospects for a more fruitful dialogue. We should make full use of the opportunities which now appear to present themselves.\nAfter years of virtual stalemate in the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, concrete results are now at last within reach. The agreement in principle, which I mentioned earlier, to conclude a treaty on longer- and shorter-range intermediate nuclear forces opens the way for what may well be a breakthrough of historic dimensions. This will be the first time in the nuclear era that an entire category of nuclear weapons, including some of the most modern ones, is to be abolished. We equally hope that an early agreement in this area will have a positive effect on efforts to limit strategic weapons, thus paving the way foe the 50 per cent cuts already agreed on in principle between the United States and the Soviet Union. Parallel with such substantial deductions in nuclear weapons, it should be possible to reduce nuclear testing so as to move step by step in the direction of a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. We welcome the decision of the United States and the Soviet Union to resume negotiations on that vital issue.\nThese developments, un-thought of even a year ago, show that hope and realism do not exclude each other. Realism is necessary in other areas also. The further one progresses along the road towards reductions in nuclear weapons the more urgent it becomes to address the conventional imbalance in Europe. Here, too, stability is needed, which means eliminating asymmetries and reducing the risk of surprise attack. For that reason the 16 countries of the North Atlantic Alliance have put forward proposals for new negotiations aimed at a stable conventional balance at a lower level in the area from the Atlantic Ocean to the Urals.\nWhile it is obvious that certain categories of weapons can best be dealt with in a bilateral or regional context, others require a global and multilateral approach. Chemical weapons are a case in point. A ban on chemical weapons appears high on the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament, and quite rightly so. The urgency of achieving such a ban is underlined by the actual and potential proliferation of those weapons. My country will continue to play an active part in the negotiations in Geneva, where intricate verification issues remain to be solved. Looking at the ongoing arms control and disarmament efforts in general we also note a quantum leap as a result of the growing acceptance of the need for effective verification, including on-site inspection. Here, too, we see a long period of stalemate giving way to a more constructive approach.\nWe hope that the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament will concentrate on achieving practical progress and avoid the grand, maybe somewhat over ambitious, designs favoured in the past.\nArms control agreements are essential for better East-West relations. But other elements are equally important. Genuine detente in Europe will, indeed, not materialize without greater respect for human rights in countries where these rights have long been neglected. The Helsinki Final Act, signed by 35 nations, clearly states that respect for human rights: \\\"is an essential factor for the peace, justice and well being necessary to ensure the development of friendly relations and co-operation among ... all States\\\".\nAccordingly, the follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) currently taking place in Vienna is addressing not only the military aspects of security but also human rights and contacts between people across dividing lines.. In Vienna my Government, together with its partners has proposed a consultative mechanism aimed at improving observance of universally accepted and recognized human rights. We deem it important that participating European countries can meet whenever one of them is seriously concerned about compliance and considers consultations necessary.\nRespect for human rights is a universal principle to be applied everywhere in the world. We highly value the United Nations contribution to the cause of human rights. It is out strong belief that the universal nature of these tights transcends the boundaries of national sovereignty  in our view, concern about violations can never be seen as interference in domestic affairs. Universally accepted human rights pertain by their very nature to every individual, no matter where that individual lives. Their validity is unaffected by political, socio-economic and cultural diversity. That very diversity in fact increases the need for common standards.\nThe setting of common standards, of course, is what the United Nations and its Members have brought about. But this is, we feel, not enough. The Netherlands will, therefore, do its utmost to help strengthen mechanisms for their implementation. In this connection, I wish to mention in particular the unique system of rapporteurs of the Human Rights Commission. Moreover, we would hope that the current financial constraints of the United Nations will not diminish the effectiveness of its human rights programmes. New budget cuts in these programmes should be avoided.\nWhile dwelling on respect for human rights, let me say in conclusion that human rights and democracy cannot be seen in isolation from each other. We are therefore happy to see the restoration of democracy in certain countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as in the Philippines. We should do whatever we can to ensure that democracy becomes firmly implanted in those countries and that these examples become an inspiration for others.\nThe attention of the world community remains focused on the situation in southern Africa. Namibia's independence is long overdue. No justification can be found to postpone the day that the Namibian people can take their future into their own hands. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) should be implemented.\nIn South Africa, every day that passes without clear signs of fundamental change adds to the feeling of frustration, despair and bitterness of those discriminated against. This does not mean  in our opinion, that we can afford to give up our hopes for a new South Africa. Change will prove inevitable, but will the course of change be marked by violence and bloodshed, or by negotiations made possible by bold initiatives which will have to create the necessary confidence that is now lacking? What has become of the South African Government's earlier expressed preparedness to embark upon a broad-based dialogue involving the representatives of all sectors of the South African people? How can this ever sound credible with Nelson Mandela and his fellow companions still in prison and prominent political groupings remaining banned?\nPolitical and economic pressure by the international community remains indispensable as long as political freedom remains the privilege of the dominating minority. But our call for justice and our deep felt abhorrence towards the system of apartheid should not be confined to condemnation, political pressure and sanctions alone.\nShould we not equally try to reflect on what comes after apartheid? How can a society be brought about in which all South Africans, irrespective of their race, creed or political convictions, can live in peace and harmony and enjoy equal rights? Obviously it is up to the South Africans themselves to determine the exact shape of the new constitutional order, and it is not for the outside world to present a blueprint. But we can try to encourage and facilitate a national dialogue between South Africans. And we feel that the formulation of a number of generally accepted principles may prove helpful in this respect.\nWhat is at stake in these negotiations is not only the removal of apartheid but also its replacement by a constitutional order which embodies the basic principles of freedom and pluralistic democracy and which takes into account the diversity of the South African people. Clearly, the legitimate political aspirations of the majority should be met. But is it not also tight to consider what steps should be taken to ensure that every South African can look to the future with confidence and a feeling that he will have a say in decisions which Affect him? It seems worthwhile to recall here that in paragraph 56 of its report the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group spoke about the need for \\\"adequate and appropriate safeguards and guarantees for minorities\\\" and for a \\\"genuine approach to power-sharing'. One can think of a number of principles which seem fundamental to a just and lasting solution, such as suffrage for all, a geographically United South Africa, a democratic and pluralistic political system with adequate minority participation, respect for human rights, protection of minorities and the rule of law, guaranteed by an independent judiciary. Such principles are closely interrelated and therefore mutually reinforcing.\nThe raison d'etre of the United Nations does not lie only in the issues of peace, security and human rights that I have just referred to. The challenges posed by global interdependence are equally of concern to the Organization. Life on our planet is fragile and threatened by many dangers. Many developing countries are particularly vulnerable confronted as they are with an accumulation of problems, such as growing population, excessive debt and a deteriorating resource base. As is so aptly expressed in the title of the report by the Brundtland Commission, what is at stake is indeed \\\"Our Common Future\\\".\nThe United Nations has always played a leading role in promoting awareness of global issues. Experience has shown that there are many areas in which the Organization can act as a catalyst in dealing with such problems. Action on AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), the spread of narcotics, natural disasters : and threats to the environment can all benefit, from a really international approach. Terrorism and its toll of innocent victims cannot be condoned by the world community. It should be unequivocally condemned by all nations, whatever its motives.\nWe applaud the outcome of the United Nations International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, held earlier this year in Vienna, which was made possible by what we see as a spirit of co-operation demonstrated by all participants. The role of the United Nations in promoting development is of particular importance. The Netherlands has always advocated better co-ordination of activities within the United Nations system and strongly supports the United Nations Development Programme. In 1988 ray country will again provide approximately 1 per cent of its gross national product, a percentage amounting to more than \u00cdUS 2 billion, as official development assistance. A special effort will be made in a number of countries in Central America and the Andean region, which can also help reinforce the process of democratization.\nAnother essential role of the United Nations is in furthering the rule of law. The existing international legal framework ought to be strengthened. We should like to see more disputes submitted to the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. Our common endeavours to promote development of international law have not remained without success. The law of the sea is a case in point. We hope that the recently concluded agreement on overlapping sea-bed mining claims will contribute to the establishment of a universally acceptable deep-sea-bed mining regime under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We agree with the Secretary-General on the significance of that agreement, which was based on a realistic assessment of common interests and in the conclusion of which my country actively participated.\nIn today's interdependent world it is our common interest and our common responsibility to make this Organization work. One of the prerequisites for achieving this is respect for the principle of universality. This means that the Organization should be open to all States. We therefore hope that the Republic of Korea will shortly be represented in this forum. But more than universality alone is necessary to make the United Nations work, we feel encouraged to see a growing tendency towards reform in the United Nations. In the economic and social fields a start has been made on increasing the Organization's efficiency. Interesting proposals have been made in the relevant special commission of the Economic and Social Council. These efforts should not, however, be made dependent on the solution of the financial crisis of the Organization. An efficient United Nations is an end in itself; it should be vigorously pursued, regardless of the Organization's financial situation.\nMay I make one final remark. It has been said that in matters of foreign policy there are two kinds of problems; those which solve themselves and those for which there is no solution. The United Nations has proved this to be wrong. In quite a few cases it has brought about solutions where none seemed possible. It has succeeded in bringing about solutions where the parties involved saw no way out. I am convinced that the United Nations is an indispensable tool for forging unity where the parties are apart. The Netherlands is determined to remain actively engaged in our common endeavours to this end.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt had been the intention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Hayden, to be present at this session of the General Assembly for his general debate statement. It is evidence of the Australian Government's deep attachment to the United Nations and the principles which underlie the Organization that Mr. Hayden has presented each Australian general debate statement since his appointment in 1983. On this occasion, however, events in our own region compelled Mr. Hayden to return home from New York. The statement I shall now make is the statement Mr. Hayden would have delivered if it had been possible for him to attend this session.\nLet me first extend to Mr. Peter Florin my congratulations on his assumption the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. At the same time I should like to express Australia's warm appreciation to the outgoing President and representative of a fellow Commonwealth country, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh.\nAs Australia prepares to commemorate the 200 years which have passed since the first European settlement in 1788, a feeling of celebration is naturally enough developing in my country But there is also occurring in Australia a new degree o analysis of the developments that have brought Australia to its present condition and the reasons for them. As a result, more Australians are becoming more clear about the real meaning of their past and their future.\nAustralia's relative advantages in the production and export of raw materials served us well in colonial times and have continued to be the mainstay of our exports until the present. The sharp decline in the terms of trade for primary commodities \u2014 something we share with many developing countries - has/ however  made it clear to us that we need to diversify our export base without neglecting our traditional strengths.\nAt the same time we are finding that our past policies which created a sheltered and protected environment for manufactured goods and services, have poorly prepared those sectors of our economy for competition in world markets. We are now addressing seriously the task of structural adjustment, which is needed to put our economy on a more mature footing.\nOur bicentenary particularly reminds Australians of the extent of the disruption suffered by the original inhabitants of our country, the Aboriginal people, now a minority in the land. Australia, in other words, is at an especially important point in its development, seeking to understand the reality of its past and preparing for the realities of its future. Our economic and industrial structures are undergoing fundamental out necessary reform.\nAustralians are going through an equally stressful process towards a proper understanding of the effect of their history on their Aboriginal compatriots. That demands great change - in such matters as land rights, protection of cultural systems and heritage and economic development. It is a difficult, complex process, often frustrating, always demanding unusual understanding and new attitudes of mind. So, in their bicentenary year, Australians are going through a period both of celebration and of deep reflection. I mention this because the process gives Australians a better appreciation of many of the issues that are preoccupying the world community; because we all have a significant stake in seeing these issues dealt with effectively, expeditiously and fairly.\nWith such a perspective, two issues are clearly of immediate importance and pressing concern; one is our failure to agree on systematic, effective and just ways to solve the problem of international debt; the other is the distortion of world markets and the resultant hardship to innocent bystanders caused by the trade policies of the major economies.\nThe two issues are connected, not least in that they both threaten grave consequences for all - industrial nations and developing nations. North and South alike. In this context I commend Ambassador Yeutter's comment to members of the United States Congress last February, \\\"Would that our grandchildren were to understand what we are doing to them.\\\"\nPresent international economic conditions reflect the difficult economic circumstances in both rich and poor countries. The latest world development report of the World Bank points out some of the dangers in the international economy and mentions the need for the wealthier countries to face more squarely the damage that their domestic policies are causing the developing countries. It is therefore time to ask whether or not the paralysis in economic policy-making is becoming so serious that the world economy is on the verge of sliding into an era of stagnation and protectionism.\nThe Baker plan set out the framework for the resolution of the international debt crisis. It was an attempt to forge an international consensus in which the different parties would all contribute to a solution and they would all gain from co-operation. Unfortunately, the plan in our view is not working, mainly because the richer parties have not been pulling their weight. Not only have the wealthier countries failed to tackle fiscal and trading imbalances, but private international banks have also failed to support the Baker plan. As a result, there is really no effective world plan to solve the continuing international debt crisis.\nAlthough the Baker plan has in essence failed, its three original elements remain the key to the solution of the world economic crisis. These elements are, first, that heavily indebted developing countries need to formulate and implement structural adjustment plans at home, in particular by curbing excessive Government spending and promoting exports in an endeavour to service their international debts; secondly, creditor nations in turn would need to support structural adjustments in the developing countries through such institutions as the World Bank, by increasing resources flows to the heavily indebted countries thirdly, private international banks would also be expected to support such a plan.\nIt is important, however, to resist the notion that the first step to a solution is to allocate blame to one side or another. The great task is to find a solution that does not, on the one hand, destabilize the international financial system or, on the other hand, increase the severity of the social and political burdens which the debt crisis imposes on the people of less developed nations.\nIn this, each side to the issue has a great responsibility. Debtor nations should not undermine the financial system by walking away from their obligations. Creditor nations cannot insist on debt repayment pressed to the point that it destroys the human and other resources of debtor nations. Each side must therefore recognize the validity of the other's point of view. \nA solution should be approached by seeking, not only to maximize the advantage of all concerned, but also to ensure that the broad economic interdependence between nations is recognized. Neither party can be seen in isolation, important interdependences must be considered, including the responsibilities of the debtor countries, the creditor countries, the private banks and the multilateral agencies. It is in the long-term interest of all parties to co-operate in overcoming these grave and continuing economic difficulties.\nIn the long term the solution also demands some form of broad structure that would help to invest resources intelligently and would establish, in advance, ways in which debt could be repaid more effectively, more systematically and more fairly. This requires a more supportive external economic environment, which must include adequate external financing in support of macroeconomic and structural policies in debtor countries, efforts by surplus industrial countries to maintain the maximum rate of growth they can afford, continued reductions in international interest rates, and action by the major industrialized countries to reduce protectionism, including protectionism in agriculture.\nIn addition to these points, another critical ingredient should be a co-ordinated economic adjustment by the major economies: a managed mixture of monetary and fiscal change and reduced trade protection along the lines emphasized at various economic summits. The alternative to such managed adjustment is the chaos which will result when the market enforces its own adjustment to the detriment of both culpable participants and innocent bystanders alike. This is an essential point: the policies driving towards this conclusion are not only endangering the interests of developing countries; they also threaten the interests of the developed countries.\nThe dangers to the world economy are equally serious from trade protectionism, which is such a feature of the current world trading environment. The World Bank has warned of the results of the resurgence of protection in the form of non-tariff barriers to trade in manufactures. This policy will undermine the integrity of the system of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT') even further and will impede the exports of less developed countries, which in turn will aggravate their debt problem.\nUnfair trade in agricultural products is especially serious. Indeed, it is potentially ruinous. The Tokyo Summit offered not much more than a bare acknowledgement of the problem almost 18 months ago although it was the first time that the major economies admitted that there was a problem and that it needed their joint attention. Their perception of it has changed significantly since then. The change has been noticeable at such developments as the GATT meeting at Punta del Este a year ago, at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Ministerial Council in Paris last May, and at the Venice Summit last June. Indeed, the Venice Summit made an important commitment towards reforming agricultural trade by calling on all involved to refrain from actions which \\\"by further stimulating production of agricultural commodities in surplus, increasing protection or destabilizing world markets\\\" (ft/42/344, para. 20) would damage trade relations. \nThis increase in consciousness of the problem over only 18 months has been an important and, in the Australian Government's view a hopeful, development in that it injects urgency into finding ways to solve a problem which is contributing significantly to uncertainty and disorder in the global economic system.\nDistortions in global agricultural trade caused by barriers to market access and subsidization policies of the major economies have seriously affected Australia, among other efficient and competitive producers. They have raised a huge impediment to the efforts of the Australian Government towards recovery from our economic difficulties of the early 1980s. Australia, therefore, attaches high priority to the Uruguay round of multilateral negotiations on agriculture. Australia's concern led it to joining 13 other non-subsidizing exporters in the Cairns Group of fair traders in agriculture in August last year. That group played an important role at Punta del Este in the successful campaign to include agriculture in the negotiating mandate and for the mandate to encompass negotiation of rules for all measures affecting market access and export competition.\nThese negotiations on agriculture will be a major test of the commitment of GATT members to an open, market-oriented trading system. The GATT rules and disciplines which have overseen world trade for the last 40 years have never been extended to cover agricultural products in a comparable way to their coverage of manufactures. This failure has been a major problem in the current world economic environment.\nAustralia put a proposal to the European Management Forum at Davos in January of this year to help solve problems in world trade in agriculture. Our proposal underlined the need to reassert the role of comparative advantage in shaping world trade in agriculture and to restore the link between market signals and production trends. Our proposal aimed progressively to reduce the gap which exists between world and domestic prices in many countries, and it called for the careful management of stocks to restore order in world markets. Acceptance of such an approach would produce a world order in agricultural trade in which comparative advantage and market signals are once more the major influences. But it cannot be emphasized too strongly that the most important and necessary ingredient in programmes to alleviate the crisis in agricultural trade is immediate action by the major agricultural subsidizers to eliminate all agricultural subsidies.\nAs with international debt, a solution will emerge, one way or another, to the problems caused by unfair trading. What is not so clear is whether it will be a benign solution or a disorderly one; whether it will be a planned solution by well-informed and well-intentioned policymakers; or a chaotic one forced on recalcitrant governments by market forces driven by uncertainty and frustration. If markets enforce their own solutions to the problems of international debt and unfair trading, there will be instability in foreign exchange rates and on commodity exchanges, debtor default, world recession and world tension, or even worse.\nWith such serious prospects threatening us all, some blunt truths need to be expressed to those who have the capacity to find and enforce sensible solutions. Unfair trading is in essence an extremely unfriendly act - even a hostile one. One should not be surprised, therefore, if its victims react accordingly.\nSecondly, if developed economies' policies, particularly protectionist policies, impoverish their customers, they themselves will suffer the consequences of reduced export prospects and restricted world trade. Finally, when unfair trading reduces the capacity of countries like Australia to promote political and social stability through aid programmes, one should not be surprised if donor countries like Australia, find themselves forced to reduce these aid programmes. \nThis threat of economic and political instability adds weight and urgency to the third great imperative facing the world community; control of armaments, to which I now turn. Australia argued at the recent Conference on disarmament and development that security is a wider concept than a definition in purely military terms would allow. In our view, security has important economic and social, as well as military, dimensions.\nDisarmament and development may not be tied together in an exclusive relationship; the abolition of arms may not lead automatically to the abolition of our economic problems. But it is a fact that military spending does take up a disproportionate share of global resources: this has been estimated to be 20 times the amount disbursed through official development assistance. Arms imports, to take another example, are responsible for roughly one-quarter of the debt burden of the nations of the South.\nWhile Australia believes that effective and lasting disarmament should lead to larger and more predictable flows of assistance to less developed countries, we also believe that the economic benefits of the implementation of a wider concept of security will be of greater importance to all countries.\nThe other obvious, major reason for the urgency in dealing with the arms race, particularly the nuclear-arms race, is the destruction that it threatens. Australia warmly welcomes the prospect that the United States and the Soviet Union will reach an intermediate nuclear forces (INF) agreement, and particularly we welcome their decision to eliminate ground-based intermediate-range missiles in the Asian region as well.\nIf this agreement is reached, three critically important principles will have been accepted. One is that it will be the first agreement which not only reduces but also entirely eliminates a whole class of modern, front-line nuclear arsenals. It will also give concrete expression to the principle that security cannot be achieved by a build-up in weapons alone. And it will bear witness to the idea that security can be enhanced by balanced and verifiable arms reduction and disarmament assures. \nRegrettably, the chances of an agreement to reduce the levels of strategic nuclear arms have not advanced far since the Reykjavik Summit last year. Discussions in the defence and space components of the negotiations between the super-Powers have also not yet achieved a breakthrough. In the strong belief that the issue is not the preserve only of the nuclear Powers, Australia has been an energetic participant in efforts by the international community to achieve nuclear-arms control and disarmament. We have urged the leaders of both the United States and the Soviet Union not to miss the opportunity apparently before them now o reach accord on all the topics under negotiation. Further progress on the issue f strategic arms would be greatly facilitated by agreements also to eliminate chemical weapons and to control conventional weapons. \nIn a specific field to which Australia has devoted special attention, our resolution with New Zealand last year on the urgent need for a comprehensive test-ban treaty attracted the highest support of any of the draft resolutions submitted to the Assembly on the issue of nuclear testing. We are co-operating again this year with New Zealand and our other traditional co-sponsors to produce draft resolution which reflects a practical, non-declaratory approach to a treat which we hope will receive very wide support.\nWe have also taken steps towards the development of an international system monitoring network so that the necessary verification measures will be ready for test-ban treaty. And we have made special efforts to contribute to the international effort to eliminate chemical weapons, efforts which appear to be close to fruition,\nAustralians share with other peoples good reasons for this active interest this issue: that is, the extra dimension of danger which unconstrained armament add to developments which are already unstable.\nI refer in this context, to the Middle East dispute, the war between Iraq and Iran, the deteriorating situation in southern Africa and the divisions between North and South Koreans. Australia continues to support the principle that the international community has a major role in resolving such disputes.\nWe especially support the Security Council and the Secretary-General in the efforts to end the Iraq-Iran conflict. We support the proposal that the United Nations should contribute to reconciling North and South Korea by admitting both Members of the Organization. Both North and South Korea have, for example, recently acceded to the Antarctic Treaty.\nWe profoundly regret that the Government of South Africa continues to turn back on the sincere demands of the world community for genuine dialogue and peaceful change in that troubled country, that it continues to reject the legitimate aspirations of the majority black population to political rights. The actions of the international community in adopting economic and other measures against South Africa are welcomed by Australia, which understands the growing anger and frustration of African countries in the face of continuing South African intransigence.\nAustralia also continues to be concerned by the plight of the Kampuchean people and disappointed at the lack of movement towards a political settlement during the past eight years. We hope that the increased level of activity in recent months represents real elements of flexibility among the parties and that it might free the way to the start of talks and lead to an end to foreign occupation of Kampuchea and to the self-determination of its people. There are also some encouraging signs of progress in Central America.\nAustralians have a particularly compelling reason for their energetic interest in the arms issue, to which I have just referred. The region in which we live is feeling ever more strongly the pressures exerted by the clash of ideology, distortions in the world economy, the legacy of colonialism and the rivalry between the super-Powers. Our immediate neighbourhood is mercifully relatively free of the immediate military effects of these pressures. With our island neighbours, we are concerned to ensure that the South Pacific remains peaceful. This is why we are committed to the principle that the South Pacific and the Antarctic continent remain nuclear-free under the arrangements established for these zones. We believe that the disarmament provisions of the Antarctic Treaty, which ensure that the territory of Antarctica is used only for peaceful purposes and the obligations that the Treaty carries for the effective management of the Antarctic in support of the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, continue to be in the best interests of all peoples.\nThat is also the reason for the concern felt by Australia and its island neighbours for a viable, peaceful political solution in New Caledonia. We believe that the people of New Caledonia should have been given a wider range of options in the recent referendum and that this referendum should have been conducted in a manner consistent with the established United Nations principles of decolonization. We trust, nevertheless, that a peaceful transition to a truly multiracial independence will take place in New Caledonia and that the situation there will not be allowed to threaten the stability of the region. This is of course a matter to which the United Nations Special Committee of 24 has been devoting its attention, in which process we are interested.\nAustralia also shares with its South Pacific neighbours concern over the destructive effects of the protectionist commodity policies of major economies. Small primary producers with fragile economies tend to be the first to feel the effects of these policies and the last to recover from them. The South Pacific is a region with many examples of this distressing reality. In such circumstances, the prospects of preserving its peaceful nature depend not only on fair and rational solutions to the problems of unfair trading and colonialism, but also on a realistic resolution of the arms issue. Peace in the South Pacific, after all, is connected closely with developments in the North Pacific, where there is a concentration of military forces second only to that in Europe, Australia has suggested that there would be advantage in the United States and the Soviet Union initiating dialogue on their respective security perceptions and concerns in the North Pacific area. We hope that this will lead in time to the development of greater confidence and security, mutually between the super-Powers, but also among the countries of the region. Australia offers this suggestion, once again making the point that efforts to defuse the nuclear-arms issue should not be confined to those most immediately involved. Arms-control and disarmament questions ate the legitimate concern of the whole international community.\nFor this reason, I wish to conclude this statement by suggesting ways in which this Organization can improve its capacity to act for the international community. I do so as a representative of a country which gives way to no other country in this Hall in its support for the United Nations.\nThe fact is that many countries are showing a lack of confidence in the United Nations. Worse, this lack of confidence is most obvious in those countries which contribute most to the finances of the United Nations. The lesson should not be lost on us. Several factors are working to erode the credibility of this Organization. Secretariats have grown in size. Their salaries and other emoluments sometimes outstrip those enjoyed by ministers and civil servants in the countries which fund them. Committees, commissions and special conferences have proliferated, giving the United Nations the reputation in some quarters of being an ineffective talking shop.\nDr. Herbert Evatt, as Australia's Minister for External Affairs, played a notable part in the founding of the United Nations As early as 1947 he asked the General Assembly to consider whether United Nations machinery was translating into life and reality its economic and social pledges. He referred then to the risk of the United Nations becoming \\\"all harness and no horse\\\". It is essential that that question be considered anew. The Special Commission established by the Economic and Social Council provides an opportunity for Member States to examine the nature of the horse and to ensure that the harness is as effective and as light as possible. In particular, the Australian Government urges Member States to use the Special Commission to review the 280 or so bodies which have grown over the years, with a view to avoiding duplication, abolishing some bodies and amalgamating the functions of others, while preserving the machinery which works well.\nAustralia wishes to emphasize the point that while the cost of international organizations continues to grow at an alarming rate, many Member States, including Australia itself, face serious budgetary and adjustment problems which limit their capacity to meet such costs. Our taxpayers' enthusiasm for the burden of funding the United Nations will be strained while the impression persists that the Organization is escaping the economic discipline they and their Governments are facing.\nIn areas where the United Nations has shown its effectiveness, Australia has this year raised its contributions to programmes it considers have priority. I mention, for example, assistance to the United Nations Development Programme, Palestinian refugees, population programmes, control of drug abuse, the environment and international health concerns. Our contributions in these areas have been increased. But the resources Australia can provide to the United Nations are not without limit. So long as the costs to us of multilateralism continue to rise so steeply, we will have to make difficult choices; whether or not, for example, we should consider membership of all United Nations agencies.\nWe make that point forcefully because it is centrally important to the continued effectiveness of this Organization's capacity and even to its future, make the point in the interests of the United Nations as well as of Australians. Equally forcefully, Australia emphasizes that this in no way suggests any diminution of our commitment to United Nations ideals which, after 40 years, is as profound as ever. Mr, Evatt told the General Assembly 40 years ago that the Australian Government regarded the support of the United Nations as a cardinal principle in its foreign policy. Firm support for the multilateral system and for an effective United Nations is still a central feature of the Australian Government's foreign policy.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like first to thank all the speakers who have, from this rostrum, expressed their concern over and commitment to Lebanon. 1 hope that this heightened attention on the part of our friends in the world community will be a harbinger of a new resolve to reverse the course of war and destruction in our land.\nMr. President, allow me to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. Your election is a recognition by the world community of your personal qualities and of the role your country plays in world affairs. I wish you success in your new responsibilities.\nI also take this opportunity to thank your predecessor for the leadership role he played in the past year and for the achievements of the General Assembly und r his presidency.\nThe Lebanese delegation has studied with great interest the comprehensive annual report submitted by the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. His analysis of the state of the world, and particularly of the Middle East, deserves the recognition of all who are concerned with the fate of peace. I wish also express special thanks to the Secretary-General and to his able assistants for their continued efforts to implement the Security Council resolutions on Lebanon. The performance of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the commitment of the contributing countries are of the utmost importance for peace in Lebanon and for international security in the whole Middle East.\nThis is my third appearance before the General Assembly. Five years ago, a month after my election as President of Lebanon, I came here with \\\"a message of confidence\\\" (A/37/PV.35, p. 2-5). I was hoping that my country would be allowed to engage in what I then described as a \\\"daring adventure of peace and reconstruction4 (A/3 7/PV. 35f p. 2-5). After so many years of war, I then felt I could tell the General Assembly, on behalf of all Lebanese United as we were in a \\\"sharpened national consensus\\\" (A/37/FV.35, p. 2-5), of our determination to end the bloodshed, destruction, and despair that wracked our country. \nToday, I stand here to admit, with candour and sorrow, that our dedication to the cause of peace was, alas, frustrated by superior forces. The Lebanese authorities were overpowered by an ugly war which caused more innocent victims among the civilian population than in the ranks of fighters.\nFor centuries past Lebanon had been the example of peaceful coexistence between religions, races and cultures which formed a pluralistic, yet harmonious, society devoted to the ideals of liberty and peace. Caught in the cycle of violence that engulfs the Middle East, we ask ourselves today whether those who set out to destroy Lebanon did not, ultimately, intend to destroy the Lebanese experiment and its achievements in the fields of human and political understanding. Lebanon was made to appear doomed to remain a breeding ground for war, anarchy and terror. In a country that itself had become a hostage, citizens of friendly nations were deprived of their liberty and sometimes of their lives.\u00b7 These innocent individuals were used as pawns in a diplomacy of terror, their lives traded cynically as punishment or reward.\nOur suffering was made worse by the assassination of Prime Minister Rashid Karame, a great statesman and a man of peace. He was brutally murdered in diabolic plot reminiscent of the assassination of my predecessor and brother, President Bashir Gemayel. To add to our woes, the resilience of the civilian population is now impaired by an economic crisis which is destroying the very fabric of our society. For the first time, Lebanon is haunted by the spectre of famine.\nI remain determined, as I was five years ago, to pursue Lebanon's struggle for peace and the preservation of our territorial integrity, national sovereignty, unity and independence.\nThese are days for realism. In this spirit I say that what is at stake is not only Lebanon's very existence as a State, but also the ability of the United Nations to prevent the disintegration of a Member State. The history of this Organization's founding is well known. It was established precisely to prevent the destruction of members of the world community. It was founded explicitly because, in the aftermath of the Second World War, all of us recognized that, peace and security ate indivisible. It is of this indivisibility of peace that I wish to speak to the Assembly today.\nAllow me to be more specific.\nIt is no secret that a number of Middle East wars are waged both in Lebanon and across its borders through an intricate game of surrogates and proxies. These wars have caused invasions, physical destruction and the dismemberment of Lebanon.\nYear after year, the world community has heard us maintain that peace in Lebanon should not, and cannot, wait for the settlement of every conflict in the Middle East. Today it is imperative to go further and say that peace in the Middle East can begin only with peace in Lebanon. Unless we restore law and order in Lebanon, there cannot and will not be peace anywhere in the region.\nWe are fully aware of what is at stake in the Middle East, from the Mediterranean to the Gulf. We know of the many courageous efforts to initiate peace processes. We are also aware of the numerous resolutions adopted by this Assembly year after year. We have subscribed to all of them In the interest of peace, justice and international security. But we firmly believe that the United Nations must approach the Middle East conflicts as a whole - not just one particular aspect of the Middle East question, but all of them together. Peace in the Middle East is indivisible. Peace cannot survive in one place while a war is under way in another. Nor can we allow ourselves the illusion that containing conflicts on the borders of nations is synonymous with resolving them. Lebanon, again, is the typical and most tragic illustration of what I mean. Truce agreements and bilateral peace accords with Israel cannot solve the Palestinian problem so long as the fate of the Palestinians living in Lebanon has not been equitably determined. Similarly, Iran's war in Lebanon must be addressed and immediately resolved in order to attain peace in the Gulf.\nAt this point I should like to reiterate my support for an international conference to solve the Middle East question. The agenda of the conference as well as its structure should be treated as a matter of extreme urgency. Lebanon insists on being a full partner at the conference, because Lebanon has major problems to discuss in defence of its interests. For, much as we trust the international community, and particularly the Security Council, we face very high stakes. We fear that regional considerations, from which we have suffered so much over the years, might lead us to pay, for others, the price of peace. For boo long we have been paying the price of wars not of our making. Lebanon is neither negotiable nor dispensable.\nPending the convening of that Conference, Lebanon finds itself compelled to resort once again to the Security Council. Our goal is to seek implementation of the many resolutions adopted since 1978.\nWe are referring in particular to resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) of June 1978. Those resolutions mandated the creation of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with the objective of confirming the withdrawal of Israel and establishing an area of peace and security in southern Lebanon. Furthermore, resolution 426 (1978) called for the reinstatement of the 1949 General Armistice Agreement, There should no longer be any pretext for not implementing it since the Cairo agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLC) has now been officially abrogated. Thus there is no longer any ground to oppose the United Nations overseeing security arrangements on the Lebanese-Israeli frontier, such arrangements, entrusted to a reinforced UNIFIL, would undoubtedly be a credible guarantee of the needed stability.\nAs this Assembly knows, UNIFIL s mandate has been redefined, in resolutions 498 (1981) and 501 (1982). A timetable for Israeli withdrawals and a joint programme of activities between UNIFIL and the Lebanese Government was called for in resolution 488 (1981) in order to promote the restoration of its effective authority up to the internationally recognized boundaries.\nOther resolutions must be referred to, in particular resolution 436 (1978) of October 1978, which called upon \\\"all those involved in hostilities in Lebanon to put an end to acts of violence and observe scrupulously an immediate and effective cease-fire and cessation of hostilities so that internal peace and national reconciliation may be restored based on the preservation of Lebanese unity, territorial integrity, independence and national sovereignty\\\".\nFinally resolutions 508 (1982) and 5\u00fc9 (1982) of June 1982, as well as resolution 520 (1982), demanded: \\\"strict respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon through the Lebanese Army throughout Lebanon\u201d (Security Council resolution 520 (1982). In due course the Security Council might have to meet and devise the necessary ways and means to implement the relevant resolutions. The objective must be to ensure the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon and enable the Lebanese army and the internal security forces to operate exclusively throughout Lebanon, with the assistance of UNIFIL in accordance with its terms of reference.\nThe failure to implement United Nations resolutions has prompted the Lebanese to resist with force continued occupation. The General Assembly has itself recognized this right. Yet we have not despaired and shall not despair of securing withdrawals by appealing to international legitimacy.\nThe 13 years of war that we have survived have demonstrated beyond question that there is no substitute for or alternative to the role of legitimate and accepted institutions. Hence our determination to support our appeal to international legitimacy with a consolidated internal consensus of constitutional legitimacy.\nIndeed, all past attempts to bypass the legitimate forces and seek internal and external security arrangements with illegal militias have ended in tragic failures. External powers have come up against the same realities in Lebanon.\nTheir attempts to deal with forces outside the recognized legal institutions of the State have not only resulted in similar failures but compounded their problem.\nThe agony of State power, of sovereignty unable to exercise full authority, is coming to an end. People are increasingly disenchanted with the divisive sectarian forces which have brought Lebanon to the threshold of partition or annexation. A credible central Government, even if challenged by various partitionists and their foreign inspirers, remains the only rallying point for the vast majority of the Lebanese, whatever their religious community.\nIn this, my last year in office, I am determined to bring to conclusion a constitutional reform which should reunite the Lebanese and enable us all to save our country, secure our independence and exercise our national sovereignty.\nI am calling on the international community, and in particular on the great Powers, to help Lebanon disentangle itself from violent interplay amongst the combatants. In so doing we would take the essential step, in conjunction with the international conference, towards Middle East peace. My appeal to the international community is as much in the Interest of regional peace as it is in the interest of Lebanon.\nIf my call is not heeded, let me tell the Assembly where Lebanon is heading. It is on its way towards an economic disaster the first phase of which we are already experiencing. The next phase is likely to be a violent upheaval that will transform not only our liberal economic system, but also the democratic political system on which it is based. When this happens many of the solutions that now seem appropriate will become obsolete. Extremism of all sorts will grow in that fertile ground of despair and the spirit of moderation will be extinguished.\nThe demands for sectarian partition, which now exist as contingent facts in time of war, will increase, creating havoc in the existing State system of the Middle East.\nAnarchy, unchecked by the hope of order and stability, will encourage terrorism and lead to more kidnapping, more hostage-taking, more alienation from rational policies and a wider chasm between the Middle East and the rest of the world.\nI have not undertaken this exposition merely to define the problem. I am here today to identify a course of action that we must undertake together. I am not making our crisis international;  it is already international, because it is regional. I am trying to define the problem, contain it and bring it to an end.\nThis course of action begins with a programme of organic and structural reforms which will be initiated through the constitutional process. Thus we shall be responding to the ever-growing conviction that no solution to the crisis can or should be sought outside the constitutional process of a democratic system.\nA reformed constitution must enable the various Lebanese communities to fulfil an effective and extensive partnership in government. Executive power, exercised through the Council of Ministers, must be genuinely representative of the aspirations of one and all. The changes and needs of the Lebanese society as it has evolved must be accommodated in a manner that will shield us against external exploitation in our domestic affairs. Through a rigorous redefinition of powers and power-sharing any possibilities of hegemony by any group over others should be eliminated.\nAlthough the war was not started by the demand for reforms, I am convinced that it will not end without them. A new Government entrusted with this mission will be formed. That Government will have to disarm the militias and direct strengthened and restructured armed forces to extend legal authority over the land\nIt is Lebanon's historic mission and a geopolitical imperative that the dialogue between Islam and Christianity should be restored and intensified in our land and among our people, for in Lebanon, and Lebanon alone, this dialogue assume its existential dimension, an interaction within the society that will serve the cause of international understanding.\nIslam is today at an important crossroads. Islam should not be viewed exclusively in terms of so-called Islamic fundamentalism, expressing itself in violence. There is a rebirth of Islam which cannot be understood from the outside abstractly; it cannot be approached with fear or flattery, but only through full partnership in life, culture and government, it is Lebanon's destiny to meet this challenge. Our survival and world peace will depend on the success of the response.\nOur principal partner in this approach should be Syria, with which relations have often been strained since our emergence as independent states. But there is no reason for the problems between our two countries to continue. Out relations should be normalized. Lebanon is an independent sovereign country, part of the Arab world} and Syria is our closest neighbour in the Arab community. Consequently, relations between Lebanon and Syria should be not only normal but distinctive and characterized by friendship and co-operation, as befits neighbours everywhere. It is in the best interests of both Lebanon and Syria to restore that positive relationship as soon as possible.\nThe principles for an agreement between Lebanon and Syria have been set.\nWithin the parameters of its sovereignty and independence, Lebanon is ready to go a long way to establish the closest relations with Syria. In saying that, I have the deepest interests of both Lebanon and Syria at heart.\nSyria's military presence in Lebanon since 1976 has extended to over 60 per cent of our territory. This has given Syria overwhelming influence in Lebanon, which has not served the better interests of either country. Through its policy of alliances with Lebanese parties and personalities Syria has generated friendships but also enmities. Although regionally and internationally Syria is perceived as a vital actor in Lebanese affairs, it has been established that there cannot be a Syrian solution to the Lebanese question. But I hasten to add that there is no solution to the Lebanese question without Syria.\nSpecific covenants and treaties govern inter\u2014Arab relations; Lebanon and Syria must see to it that they are respected to the letter, particularly in matters of mutual security and strategic interests. The withdrawal of the Syrian Army from Lebanon should and will take place in the context of those covenants.\nNew relationships should be developed with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)\u00b7 A new Lebanon cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of old, Lebanon will not tolerate on its territory an armed group of any kind. Only the legitimate organs of the State or organized forces operating in Lebanon at the request of the Lebanese Government will be permitted to carry arms. Lebanon is prepared to grant the PLO a presence on its soil for the peaceful promotion of the cause of the Palestinian people, to which Lebanon is committed. In the context of the Arab League, Lebanon will co-ordinate policies relating to the rights of the Palestinian people. Such policies, however, should not violate law and order in our country, nor lead to Palestinian implantation in Lebanon. Vigorous work requiring close co-ordination will have to be undertaken both to repair the damage done to Lebanese-Palestinian relations and to create new and enduring ties.\nFinally, the unlearned lessons of the Palestinians must not be ignored by others. Iran must be militarily disentangled from Lebanon. Iran's image in the region and in the world has not been enhanced by its policies in Lebanon or by the acts of violence undertaken by its followers in my country. Indeed, Iran's actions and continued rejection of Security Council resolution 425 (1978) and other Security Council resolutions will further endanger the Lebanese in the south.\nAll Iranians who are in Lebanon by virtue of Iran's self-bestowed military- ideological commitment and without the permission of the Lebanese Government should leave as soon as possible. Yet, Iran has important religious, cultural and commercial links with Lebanon; those links can be encouraged and strengthened by agreement between the two countries, in accordance with the established norms of co-operation among independent and peaceful States.\nIf I have digressed into what appears to be strictly internal affairs it is because, as I stated earlier, peace in Lebanon can be attained only by an encounter between the national and the international\u00b7\nThe Lebanese were not free to choose between war and peace. If international peace and security are to be protected against the consequences of continued chaos, violence and terror in Lebanon, the world community must secure for the Lebanese the freedom to choose. I should also like to repeat my firm conviction that peace in the Middle East is indivisible and that peace in Lebanon must be the beginning and not the end.\nTo those, be they friend or foe, who envision that the withering away of Lebanon is a solution to their problems, let me say this: the disappearance or dismemberment of Lebanon will create more problems, more tragedies, and greater violence, in years past my country was proud to be a haven for peace, a link between cultures. Now it has become a haven for terror; a link between wars.\nBut it remains my country, and no sacrifice is too great in its defence.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the Sierra Leone delegation I  should like, Sir to extend warm congratulations to you on your election to the presidency o\u00a3 the General Assembly at its forty-second session. Your unanimous election to that high office is in recognition of your distinguished record as a statesman and your long experience in diplomacy\u00b7 I wish to assure you of my delegation's fullest co-operation in the discharge of your awesome duties.\nMay I also avail myself of this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor for the admirable manner in which he conducted the deliberations of the forty-first session.\t\nI take this opportunity to express my delegations appreciation to the Secretary-General for the lucid and comprehensive report he has presented on the work of the Organization since the last session, vie are deeply heartened that the Organization is gradually becoming the object of a \\\"greater commonality of views\\\" among its Members, scarcely a year after its very existence was in jeopardy.\nThe renewed interest in multilateralism this development represents calls for deep reflection, since it entails complex processes at work, requiring skilled management on the part of the Secretary-General and the Secretariat. My Government is encouraged that the Secretary-General has risen sufficiently to this challenge by fearlessly pointing out flaws in the structure of the Organization and repudiating inappropriate conduct by Members, regardless of their size or influence.\nIn this regard we note with approval the critical view he has cast on the current structure of the Economic and Social Council and the reforms he has proposed, especially the call to upgrade representation in that Council at the ministerial level, as well as the need to establish a small planning staff for development which could consider integrated approaches to development-related problems, taking account of the capacity of the system as a whole. The Secretary-General's efforts represent only one facet of what we require to ensure the viability and efficiency of our Organization. But firm commitment to the provisions of the Charter is the other, and perhaps the most crucial, element in ensuring our Organization's effectiveness. It is therefore a matter of great regret to us that Member States have often undermined the credibility of the United Nations for purely short-term political objectives, or sometimes through wilful neglect.\nThe relevance of the United Nations as an instrument for the peaceful existence and orderly development of every nation no longer requires justification. Suffice it to say here that history is replete with instances of even weaker nations denying peace and orderly progress to greater nations in an unmanaged international environment. Thus it would be a serious mistake for any Member State to view its commitment to the United Nations as an altruistic gesture subject to its whims, rather than as a sacred duty dictated by an enlightened perception of its self-interest.\nSince the previous session, developments in the security, economic and social conditions in many parts of the world have given us more cause for despair than hope.\nAs we observe the progress of negotiations towards the reaching of a historic agreement on disarmament between the super-Powers, our excitement is tempered by the knowledge that extensive testing of weapons capability is simultaneously taking place, and enormous resources are being devoted to the perfection of other means of mutual destruction. Therefore, as we acknowledge this remarkable disarmament effort between the super-Powers, we expect that the entire international community will perceive the true significance of this event as a major step in the urgent pursuit of more global and comprehensive arms control and disarmament agreements and as part of a greater security enterprise whose success also requires the peaceful resolution of regional and internal conflicts as well as the achievement of acceptable economic and social conditions in all nations.\nWe believe that it would be naive for anyone to assume that islands of peace and security could be created and sustained in a world awash in tension and fed by racial prejudice, religious intolerance/ economic injustice and, above all, hegemonistic aspirations. That is why we have been tireless in calling on all nations to be resolute and noncompromising in demanding majority rule in South Africa and self-determination in Namibia. We have also constantly advocated that equal resolution be applied in the search for just settlements of the disputes in the Middle East, Kampuchea, Central America, Afghanistan, the Western Sahara and Chad.\nThe Secretary-General has warned that a human tragedy of overwhelming proportions is imminent in South Africa unless, of course, timely action is taken to prevent it. The delegation of Sierra Leone has had occasion in this Assembly and elsewhere to offer its views on the kind of actions it considers appropriate for the international community to adopt to stave off this impending tragedy. We have no wish whatsoever to repeat those views here except, of course, to remind those who continue to oppose the imposition of comprehensive sanctions against the racist South African regime that they are endangering the very interests that they seek to protect by undermining the only viable instrument of gentle pressure against South Africa and making the violent destruction of that regime inevitable.\nIn the absence of the apartheid regime\u2019s readiness to negotiate a democratic and peaceful transition to majority rule in South Africa, and because of the reliance by that regime on the use of naked force against the majority black population to perpetuate its illegal existence, it becomes absolutely absurd for anyone to claim to be on the side of freedom and justice in South Africa and at the same time to repudiate the use of effective pressure against South Africa either in the form of sanctions or in the threat or use of military coercion.\nWhile we detest, as a matter of principle, the use of force for the achievement of political objectives as much as any other State Member of this Organization, we would not hide behind that principle to camouflage the abandonment of our sacred duty under the Charter to help eliminate from the face of the earth the barbarism, immorality and conflict all of which apartheid so visibly embodies.\nVery few of us need reminding that any system such as apartheid, which continues to subsist on a daily diet of imprisonment, torture and murder of black children as young as seven years of age, the indiscriminate massacre of dispossessed, defenceless and innocent members of its community, as well as citizens of neighbouring States, offers very few options for redress. This becomes a classic case of what the late President Kennedy referred to, with characteristic eloquence and perceptiveness, when he said: \\\"Those who make peaceful evolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.\\\" That is the assessment of the situation in South Africa which those who directly carry its burden have now reached, as expressed by the African National Congress (ANC) leader, Mr. Oliver Tambo, who said;\n\\\"Nobody should demand of us that we seek change by non-violent means when we are denied all constitutional possibilities to redress the grievances of the majority\\\"\nWe believe that the international community has the chance to avert the human tragedy in South Africa if it heeds the advice of the Secretary-General and takes timely action, for if by neglect or by cynicism we allow the tragedy to occur, the consequences may turn out not to be as bearable to some of us as we might have assumed.\nThere is ample evidence that apartheid is crumbling. Both the spiritual and the intellectual underpinnings of apartheid suffered severe assault recently when the White Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa, the body that formulated the theological justification for that system, declared that scriptural rationales for enforced racial separation were an error that should now be rejected. Also recently, the University of Stellenbosch, the erstwhile intellectual powerhouse of apartheid, became a centre of opposition to that system.\nLet us realize that these events did not occur by accident or in a vacuum, but as a result of the intense and consistent political, economic and military pressures which the international community has exerted on South Africa in recent years.\nIt is therefore logical that we keep up the pressures that brought these changes about, not only to achieve the eventual dismantling of apartheid but also to accelerate the process for the independence of Namibia. In this context we recognize and commend, among other things, the efforts that have brought about massive disinvestments in South Africa, the activities of trade unions and church organizations, in and outside of South Africa, the resolution of the freedom fighters, as well as the fortitude of the front-line States in southern Africa.\nThe war between Iran and Iraq represents a tragedy of enormous proportions which the international community should do everything to end. The role of the United Nations in the pursuit of this objective is crucial, and we endorse the long-standing preoccupation of the Secretary-General with efforts to find a lasting solution to the conflict, culminating in his recent visit to Iran and Iraq.\nWe believe that Member States of this Organization can, in their individual capacities, make significant contributions to the peace process by helping to create the general climate of trust and urgency without which the current cloud of suspicion which pervades the atmosphere cannot be dissipated, and without which there will be a prolongation of hostilities. We note with interest and satisfaction the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and appeal to the Secretary-General and all Members of this Organization to help create the conditions suitable for the implementation of that resolution.\nThe revival of the idea of an international peace conference on the Middle East, and the current wide international support which that idea enjoys, is of great interest to my delegation. We have followed closely the progress of the Secretary-General's efforts to mobilize a consensus on the procedural aspects of the conference among the parties concerned, and we observe with deep disappointment that it has not yet been possible to obtain the agreement of some of the parties to the idea of convening an international conference.\nOur confidence in the resilience of the Secretary-General and in the goodwill of Members of this Organization encourages us, however, to hope that the existing obstacles will be overcome before long. At the same time we expect that the enormous suffering which the Palestinian people endure because of Israel's brutal activities in the occupied territories will continue to incense the conscience of Members of this institution and elicit sufficient resistance to Israel's designs to perpetuate its occupation.\nWe see a total absence of moral strength and logic in a policy which seeks to preserve the rights of one people to a homeland and security by assaulting the same rights and the security of another people. What we have noted, as a result of this policy, is greater suffering and insecurity in the region and a greater threat to the stability of the international system as a whole. It is therefore in the interest of every member of the international community to work sincerely for the speedy resolution of the Middle East conflict; failure to do so would simply raise the cost for all and leave everyone much worse off.\nMany in this Hall will recall that not so many years ago Viet Nam was fighting to defend principles which it held dearly, and for which it received the sympathy and support of many nations. Today, however, it continues to deny the people of Kampuchea what Viet Nam itself claimed to have fought for so vigorously during those years. The paradox of yesterday's victim and tomorrow's oppressor always furnishes constant amazement.\nLast year, my delegation welcomed the eight-point peace plan put forward by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea to resolve the situation in that country. We expected the practical approach offered by that plan to secure a positive response from Viet Nam# if only as a measure of indicating the latter1 s peaceful intentions. At this stage we believe that Viet Nam has only two options: to demonstrate a genuine intention to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea and allow the people of that country to set up their own form of government, or to continue to prove unfaithful to its Charter obligations and to incense the international community. \nThe Korean peninsula has remained an area of constant tension since the end of hostilities three decades ago. We believe that for the establishment of a durable peace in the region, both North and South Korea, whose membership of this Organization is a logical step, should implement proposals for the revival o\u00a3 high-level talks between them. Those talks should continue to be direct and devoid of extraneous issues which undermine trust and confidence.\nRecent developments in Central America, culminating in the signing of the Guatemala Agreement, the Arias Plan, have rightly aroused considerable optimism about the chances of durable peace in the region.\nWe trust that all peace-loving nations will contribute sincerely towards the realization of our collective wish for the peace and prosperity of the Central American peoples.\nAlthough some progress towards a resolution of the Afghanistan situation seems to have occurred, notably the reported agreement on the monitoring of foreign troop withdrawal, the failure of the contending parties to agree on a date for the withdrawal of foreign troops continues to cause many delegations some anxiety.\nWhile not wishing to minimize the significance of the perceptible narrowing down of the difference in the various positions over the date for troop withdrawal achieved at the recent proximity talks in Geneva under the supervision of the special United Nations representative, Mr. Diego Cordovez, we submit that so far there exists no cause for celebration; the danger that the Afghanistan situation poses to international peace and security remains as potent today as it has ever been. The continuing stalemate in Western Sahara is causing tremendous human suffering and economic devastation in the occupied territory, and countries in the region, particularly Algeria, are having to cope with huge refugee problems. The valuable assistance offered by the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in mitigating those refugee problems is highly commendable.\nWhile Sierra Leone continues to recognize the legitimate right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination, we appeal to all the parties concerned to co-operate with the Secretary-General in his effort to bring about the implementation of all relevant resolutions adopted by the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations, with specific regard to General Assembly resolution 40/50.\nThe various reports on the status of the world economy are again unanimous this year in expressing pessimism about prospects for the economic well-being of the world, both in the short and medium terms. Each year, for over half a decade now, we have had to listen in this Assembly to gloomy forecasts for the world economy, and at the end of every session we have left here assuring ourselves that we have done enough to dispel the gloom after adopting resolutions and promising too.\nThe progress we seem to achieve each time never proves to be adequate, as we not only continue to have the same set of problems but their magnitude has even tended to multiply. This has been happening particularly in the case of the development crisis, of which the debt problem is an integral part, under which most of the developing countries have been labouring for almost a decade now.\nThe various manifestations of this crisis and its impact on the peoples of the developing world have for many years been a subject of extensive analyses and recommendations by academics, policy makers and development experts both in the United Nations and elsewhere.  The general climate of slow or negative growth that currently prevails in the affected countries is causing further deterioration in the commodities of life which have already reached record lows. Efforts to reverse this trend, especially in Africa, have encountered severe countervailing forces in the international environment, notably contracting capital flows, currency instability, falling commodity prices, rising protectionism and agricultural subsidies in industrial countries, and above all a crushing debt burden.\nFor example, it has been established that borrowing countries now transfer huge net capital to creditor countries in the industrialized world: $107 billion from 1983 to 1986 and an estimated $27 billion in 1987 for the major borrowing countries alone; African countries have lost over $19 billion so far this year in falling commodity prices; the effect of the European agricultural subsidies is said to be equivalent to a 124 per cent tariff on wheat and a 226 per cent tariff on sugar; and the third world's total external debt increased from $729 billion in 1981 to over a trillion dollars this year.\nIn the face of these paralysing obstacles, pleas for understanding to the rest of the international community often elicit paternalistic responses at best, and derision at worst. Where an offer of assistance has been given, it has often been conditional on the implementation of economic policies that paid little attention to structural differentiations in the developing countries.\nThus the rigid enforcement of structural adjustment policies which always insist on import restriction and unregulated internal economic libetal\u00cd2ation - wholesale removal of subsidies, massive devaluations, auctioning off of public enterprises - has merely accelerated the decimation of the structural foundations of the target economies, spawning grotesque social and political problems in the process. It is most refreshing to note the recent signs of a rethink regarding structural adjustment policies in their original cast \u2014 \\\"structural adjustment with growth\\\", which is the new version embodying this evolution in thought, explicitly acknowledges, among other things, the necessity not only for greater external assistance to those developing countries undertaking adjustment but also for the protection of vulnerable groups in society during the adjustment process.\nConsolidation of the commitment by the industrialized countries which this development portends will definitely enhance the effectiveness of developing countries' efforts as they grapple with their economic problems.\nIn this regard we note with deep appreciation the impressive actions already taken by the Secretary-General, international financial and development Institutions, as well as individual Governments and non-governmental organizations, to facilitate the successful implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery. However, we renew our call for a fresh approach to the debt problem which is currently of very urgent concern. Sierra Leone acknowledges the value of multi-year re-scheduling, longer maturities on new loans and capitalization of interest but, as we have already pointed out, total third-world obligations, instead of being reduced, have increased to a record level in 19\u00d67 under these policies. What we need are policies that actually reduce the debt burden. Such policies would require the active intervention of Governments in creditor countries as well as international financial and development institutions.\nWe have an enduring vision that because of its inherent dynamism the international system requires a new economic and political order that distributes, fairly, responsibilities and benefits to all nations, and not an order that can be artfully manipulated to \\\"benefit a few greatly, some not at all, and dramatically increase the cost for all.\\\" \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI should like first to extend my sincere felicitations to Mr. Peter Florin on his unanimous election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. His outstanding ability and statesmanship will serve to guide our deliberations most efficiently and effectively. May I also record my delegation's appreciation of the successful and productive presidency of Mr. Humayun Choudhury, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, at the forty-first session of the General Assembly.\nThis annual assembly provides yet another occasion for Member States to focus attention on the challenges and opportunities confronting the international community, in the weeks ahead we shall deliberate on the many burning and pressing issues which make up the contemporary world - issues which demand the attention of our Organization, It is the fervent hope of my delegation that in the often frenzied atmosphere of speech-making and lobbying we shall not lose sight of the fact that the ever growing number of issues before this body demand solution. We are here because we believe in the role of the United Nations as the highest and broadest forum for deliberating upon the affairs of the international community, indeed upon the affairs of mankind, and for the construction of international peace and development.\nThere can be no illusion about the fact that peace, freedom, social justice and economic progress and development are of fundamental importance to the United Nations. It is true that in many parts of the world confrontations still persist, controversial issues remain unresolved and suffering continues. It is true that the sovereignty of nations, small nations in particular, continues to be violated. It is equally true that a large part of mankind is living in poverty, in dire need of food, shelter, medical care and basic education. Hence, the Organization must not be regarded as the special preserve of some patties or be manipulated by others.\nLet me state categorically that Malaysia firmly believes in the United Nations and its efficacy in dealing with the expanding contemporary world. Despite the challenges that confront and threaten us, the world is a better place today than it would have been without the United Nations. Today mankind is able to anticipate the future with a degree of optimism.\t  \nMalaysia has given substance to the belief that contemporary international problems should be resolved through the United Nations. In recent years, the international community has been alarmed by the dramatic rise and impact of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking on societies throughout the world. It was obvious that it was only through effective international action that the problem could be eradicated. For this reason, Malaysia strongly supported the initiative Secretary-General's initiative that led to the convening of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Vienna last June. Our commitment found expression in the fact that our Prime Minister, Dato Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, presided over the Conference. We are pleased with the results of the Conference, which provided the political will and laid down the framework for combating the drug menace. We urge societies everywhere and at all levels to make every possible effort to put that framework and political will into effect.\nIn Vienna, the Conference agreed to declare an International Day against Drug Abuse and requested the Assembly to choose an appropriate date. It seems to us that 26 June, the day the Conference adopted its Declaration, would be appropriate. It would remain us of our pledge to express the political will needed to sustain the fight against the drug menace. The Assembly must also, at this session, take practical measures for implementation of the guidelines contained in the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline (CMO). Increased contributions must be provided to enhance the effective work done by the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control. Particular benefits can be derived through the convening of drug-related international and regional seminars, training programmes and the vital exchanges of information. The Division of Narcotic Drugs can be made the central depository for all information on drug-related activities and methodologies and such information should made readily available to Member States. \nSimilarly, we are concerned over developments in Antarctica and their impact on the interests and concerns of society as a whole. In our view, and in that of many like-minded countries, the Antarctic Treaty does not adequately address those interests and concerns. We have brought the issue before the United Nations, convinced that it is the right place for dealing with the matter in a constructive manner. We are not unaware of the fact that the existing Treaty does contain some provisions that are conducive to international co-operation and regional peace. We must be satisfied that the interests of mankind are not disregarded in those instances. Despite what has been said about our motives in bringing the matter before this body, I should like to state emphatically that it is still our hope that through dialogue and consultations with the parties to the Treaty we shall eventually succeed in arriving at a consensus for an Antarctic Treaty system that would be universally accepted as representing the interests of mankind. The United Nations must of course have a role to play in that exercise.\nOur Organization continues to be faced with many cases of failure to adhere to the basic principles of the Charter and to United Nations resolutions. In Kampuchea, Vietnamese forces continue to defy General Assembly resolutions calling for their withdrawal and for the restoration of the right of self-determination to the people of that country. As long as this defiance of United Nations resolutions persists the peace and stability of the region of South-East Asia will be threatened. In spite of the inherent threat posed by the occupation of Kampuchea by Viet Nam, the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have consistently encouraged a comprehensive and lasting political solution to the Kampuchean problem, in conformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. In this respect, we are grateful that the Secretary-General and his Special Representative are taking an active interest in the matter.\nI am sure that it has not escaped the notice of most delegations that following recent developments there has been a flurry of notes circulated as United Nations documents. If, for some, the circulation of those notes has confused rather than clarified the Issue, we are not surprised. There has been no hesitation on the part of Viet Nam to confuse the international community. Viet Nam and all the parties concerned should persist in the search for a political solution. In this context, the recent initiative taken by the Foreign Minister of Indonesia is a step forward. The proposal is for a meeting of certain persons in their individual capacities with a view to effecting the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces, and for national reconciliation. This would help to bring about a lasting settlement.\nLet me state the basic issues again: first, Viet Nam usurped the sovereignty of a small neighbouring State\u00b7, secondly, with the help of 150,000 of its troops, Viet Nam installed a puppet regime whose legitimacy has been consistently rejected by the international community through successive resolutions of the United Nations. General Assembly and the survival of that regime continues to be dependent on the presence of Vietnamese forces; thirdly, successive United Nations resolutions have called for the withdrawal of those forces, the restoration of Kampuchean sovereignty, and a comprehensive and lasting political solution; and fourthly the Kampucheans have suffered needlessly for far too long. Masses of innocent people are displaced from their homes and forced to seek refuge and relief in Thailand.\nThe ASEAN countries stand firmly behind the resolutions of the General Assembly, and we urge Viet Nam to enter into a genuine and constructive dialogue with the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea under the presidency of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Only on this basis, we feel, can a comprehensive and lasting political solution be reached in consonance with the Charter of the United Nations. There is the other question of refugees from Viet Nam itself. The ASEAN countries are still facing a continuing flow of refugees from Viet Nam as a result of Viet Nam's failure fully to implement an orderly departure programme. It is imperative that Viet Nam address this problem urgently.\nAfghanistan is another instance where the sovereignty of a small nation has been violated and trampled upon. We continue to follow with interest the mediation efforts conducted under the auspices of the Secretary-General's Special Representative, and remain concerned that while those efforts are going on Afghanistan continues to be ravaged by repression, resulting in the deaths of many Afghans, while millions more are forced to live as refugees. A political solution is contingent upon the early withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, recognition of the right of the refugees to return to their homeland and the restoration of Afghanistan's sovereignty. We call on the Soviet Union to demonstrate the necessary good faith and flexibility so that the process initiated by the Secretary-General can be successfully concluded and there can be self-determination in Afghanistan.\nSome of the major threats to international peace and security, such as the situation in the Middle East, the question of Palestine and the apartheid policy of South Africa, have for a very long time remained resistant to solutions. These questions cannot be resolved as long as the major Powers, in particular, refuse to act decisively and in accordance with United Nations decisions.\nIn the Middle East, Israel has not ceased its aggression against the Arab peoples; it has not given up the Arab territories that it occupies; nor has it accepted the reality of the Palestinian people as a nation or respected the inalienable rights of the Palestinians, which include the tight to their homeland. Israel has continued to pursue aggressive and expansionist policies, with total disregard of the norms of international conduct. Encouraged by the stand of certain Powers, Israel continues to choose the option of brute strength, military might and terrorism, while rejecting peaceful solutions. The attitude of Israel and its supporters has severely constrained the ability of the United Nations \u042c act effectively. Malaysia cannot ignore the fact that these are severe transgressions of the Charter.\nMalaysia strongly supports the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East, with the participation of all parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people, in order to find a comprehensive solution to the problem. This just and reasonable approach has been supported consistently by the General Assembly.\t,\nIn southern Africa, despite the condemnation of virtually all the Member States of the United Nations, the racist minority regime of South Africa persists in its policy of apartheid. The time is long past for merely debating this issue. What is required now is decisive action against Pretoria in the form of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter. Some major nations with vested interests in South Africa remain opposed to mandatory sanctions on the ground that sanctions would be ineffective and create hardship for blame South Africans and the front-line States. We reject this argument because the same countries have not been loath to apply sanctions when it has suited the interests.\nIn any case, if those countries are truly concerned about the repercussions of sanctions, there are practical measures which can be taken to alleviate the effects of sanctions for black South Africans and the front-line States. For instance, the Non-Aligned Movement has established a Fund for Southern Africa for this very purpose. We therefore urge the major Powers concerned to act decisively so that the evil system of apartheid may be terminated.\nIt is also incumbent on the international community - in particular the permanent members of the Security Council - to restore the inalienable rights of the Namibian people, on the basis of Security Council resolution 43 5 (197 8) . We reject any linkage of the Namibia question to extraneous issues. In this connection, Malaysia reiterates its firm support for the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in its struggle for justice and freedom for the people of Namibia.\nIf this Organization is to serve mankind effectively, Member States must able by the fundamental principles of the Charter. They have the obligation to have recourse to peaceful means for the settlement of disputes. Yet we are witness to the Iran-Iraq conflict, now in its eighth year. Thousands have been sacrificed j cities have been ravaged\u00b7, chemical weapons have been used\u00b7, and vast economic resources which could otherwise have been used for constructive purposes have been wasted. Whatever the final outcome of the conflict may be, it is clear that no side will emerge the victory both sides will inherit the destructive results of the war and the consequences of lost resources and lost opportunities.\nThe world had hoped that with the unanimous adoption last July of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) some positive result would ensue for the termination of the conflict. Instead, what is occurring is a heightening of tension as the conflict escalates and the warships of several nations converge in the area. Each major actor appears to be putting conflicting national and strategic interests before the objectives of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). Yet we note the unanimity in the adoption of that resolution. Malaysia totally supports the Secretary-General's efforts to secure application of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and we appeal to the two belligerents to be responsive to him and to stop the carnage and insanity of the conflict,\nMalaysia has consistently advocated the principle that regional countries have a primary duty in the resolution of regional problems through dialogue and consultation. We firmly believe in regionalism as a basis for developing strong neighbourly relations in the interest of peace and stability. That is the foundation of our co-operation in ASEAN, which has contributed to progress and a growing sense of confidence in the region. We believe that this confidence is crucial in our effort to address current challenges and in forging peace and stability in the area. ASEAN has recently commemorated its twentieth anniversary and is currently preparing for a third summit further to enhance co-operation between Member States and make the Association stronger in the coming decades. We are happy to note that a similar trend is emerging in Central America, where a peace plan was signed last August in Guatemala. That plan received the support of the Contadora and the Support Groups, I would like to express the hope that this trend will enable the peoples of Central America to attain justice, to defend their freedom and independence and to concentrate on development free from super-Power rivalries.\nIn North-East Asia, Malaysia urges the resumption of bilateral dialogue between the Governments of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for normalization of relations which would reduce tension in the Korean peninsula. It is hoped that through earnest efforts common ground can be found. Malaysia stands ready to support initiatives of either patty that are directed to achieving enduring peace and security in that region.\nMalaysia hopes that the discussions between the various interested parties conducted through the auspices of the International Olympic Council will bring about positive results and help pave the way for the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to interact in other areas of their relations.\nFor decades the international community has been staggered by the arms race. For many years the United Nations has been addressing this vital and complex question, in the final analysis, while the nuclear-armed States, especially the two super-Powers, are primarily responsible to effect real change, all nations must also contribute by working against nuclear proliferation and being supportive of the disarmament process. A stop must be put to this insane race, not merely because of its implications with respect to the survival of mankind but also because, in the stand-off, huge amounts continue to be spent which could otherwise be channelled into more constructive pursuits. We are encouraged by the United States and the Soviet negotiators closing the ground on an agreement covering medium and short-range nuclear missiles. The two super-Powers must enter into serious negotiations on strategic weapons and a nuclear test ban. It is hoped that these negotiations will pave the way for agreements covering the whole range of nuclear disarmament. In this context the recommendations of the recently concluded International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development will provide some impetus for change in the flow of resources from armament to economic and social development at both the national and international levels.\nThe security and well-being of the peoples of the world cannot be separated from social and economic development. In fact, the United Nations has an equally pivotal role to play in this regard. For the past few years the international community has had to grapple with the growing international debt problem, continuing recessionary trends in commodity prices, major problems in food and agriculture and, in general, international trade. Protectionist measures are on the rise and are being manifested in new legislation and trade restrictive actions in developed countries.\nIt is difficult to envisage any progress in the international trading environment, unless the developed countries themselves believe in the need to maintain a more liberal and open international trade system and give favourable and differential treatment to developing countries. It is to the interest of all to adopt steps to roll bade protectionism and resuscitate international trade. It is for this reason that Malaysia sees a significance in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations.\nThe seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII) concluded recently with a consensus agreement. We are encouraged by this result as it manifests a common desire of States to consult together on major economic problems confronting the world today. We are particularly pleased that all the obligations for the establishment of the Common Fund have been fulfilled. Malaysia would wish to see the Common Fund activated to strengthen trade as well as research and development in commodities. We stand ready to participate positively in bringing equilibrium back to commodity prices.\nThe international economic trends of the 1980s have convinced us that the pressing economic problems confronting the international economy cannot be resolved in isolation by a particular group of countries, be they developed or developing. Malaysia firmly believes that multilateral co-operation provides an effective means to overcome these problems. We cannot ignore the fact that the world economy is characterized by the high concentration of decision-making power among a few developed countries. Indeed, no country or bloc of countries should claim the wisdom to prescribe cures for what ails the global economy. The close interdependence of the global economy has time and again proved resistant to such selective prescription. Developing and developed countries must honestly acknowledge this simple reality and work together. The best way is to enter into global negotiations. We appeal to those few countries that still have reservations to show goodwill and magnanimity.\nMalaysia also believes that meaningful co-operation need not be confined between the developed and the developing countries. Substantial gains are in store for South-South co-operation - that is, between and among the developing countries themselves. Arguably, while most developing countries share somewhat similar levels of development and are competitive in their efforts, there remains among them, this is not true of developing countries. This provides opportunities for meaningful and mutually beneficial co-operation among the developing countries themselves. Malaysia has been a prime mover in the call for accelerated South-South co-operation\u00b7 We welcome the establishment of the South Commission headed by Mr. Julius Nyerere former President of Tanzania, and look forward to the early commencement of work by the Commission and its recommendations for specific projects for South-South co-operation.\nIn recent years some institutions of multilateralism have been under increasing attacks by a few - bringing in vogue the description that there is now a retreat from multilateralism\\\". However the \\\"retreat\\\" has not brought about solutions to the many problems confronting the international community. On the contrary, it has exacerbated these problems. To our minds, the attainment of a stable and secure world must be accomplished through a genuine search for solutions - through meaningful multilateral co-operation. \nWhile we accept that there are various areas of institutional imperfection in the United Nations, as well as in other international forums, the answer to that problem lies neither in being oblivious to those weaknesses nor in ignoring or denigrating the United Nations and the process of multilateralism in general. To begin with we should search objectively for a solution to the financial crisis that has beset the Organization. Some momentum towards alleviating that financial crisis was achieved during the forty-first session of the General Assembly with the adoption by consensus of a resolution that laid down the basis for further efforts. It must be emphasized, however, that we should not run away from our common responsibility regarding the proper functioning of the Organization. It is to be hoped that our deliberations on this important issue during the current session will be directed primarily towards ensuring the financial stability of the United Nations.\nWe cannot overstate the importance of the interests and concerns of mankind that require attention by the United Nations nor the crucial role that the Organization can play in achieving world peace, progress and harmony in the next millennium. We must renew our commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter, which represent the collective will and wisdom of our founding fathers and which, remain more than ever relevant to the resolution of the problems of mankind and of the contemporary world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a pleasure for me to congratulate you. Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. I note and appreciate that your country was one of the many countries that spoke to welcome Brunei Darussalam when it was admitted to the Organization in 1984. I am confident that with your wisdom and experience you will be able to guide this session to a successful conclusion. Our congratulations go also to your predecessor, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, on his excellent work as President of the General Assembly at its forty-first session.\nTo the Secretary-General my delegation would like to express its appreciation for his unceasing efforts, patience and devotion - qualities which are an example to us all.\nTwelve months have passed since the last session of the General assembly.\nThere has been no improvement in the world situation, although a few events in the past year have given us some ray of hope for the future - hope for a better world, \u0430 more peaceful world.\nThe General Assembly declared 1986 the International Year of Peace. That near has ended with no sign of the conflict of the 1980s diminishing. For example, the senseless and appallingly bloody war between Iran and Iraq continues unabated. It is a source of great concern to their neighbours, and the escalating attacks by both sides on shipping in the Gulf can have very grave political consequences. It must now be apparent to both parties that this conflict can be resolved only by negotiation. Brunei Darussalam therefore welcomes Security Council resolution 598 (1987) . We also call upon both sides to co-operate with the Secretary-General and assist him by complying with the Council's call for an immediate cease-fire.\nWhen discussing the political situation in the Middle East, we need to consider the wider issue of the Arab-Israel conflict. The main problem of this conflict remains the Palestine question. My delegation feels that an international conference, which has been proposed, would be useful in bringing all parties concerned to the negotiating table. However, the stand taken by some parties, notably Israel, has prevented any progress towards the convening of such a conference. In our view, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and it should therefore be at the conference to negotiate on their behalf.\nIn the African continent, the immediate problem is still the apartheid policy of South Africa. Numerous debates and resolutions adopted by the Assembly condemning this unjust and evil policy have been ignored by South Africa. My delegation is convinced that more concrete and effective actions must be taken. Pressure must be exerted on the Pretoria regime to change its policy, and it is the moral obligation of the international community to see that this policy is dismantled. Brunei Darussalam also denounced South Africa's continued occupation of Namibia. We call on South Africa to withdraw its troops from Namibia so that free elections can be conducted to determine the Territory's future.\nIn Afghanistan, the Afghan people are still being denied their inalienable rights. Foreign forces are still occupying their land, driving them from their homes to live as refugees in Iran and Pakistan. We urge the immediate implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the withdrawal of foreign troops. We fully support the Secretary-General's efforts to resolve this conflict.\nIn our own region of South-East Asia, the problem of Kampuchea is still with us. The Vietnamese forces of occupation are now in their ninth year in Kampuchea. Meanwhile, the resistance fighters of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, under the leadership of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, continue their fight to free their land from foreign occupation. The overwhelming support given by the international community has strengthened their determination to continue their struggle and they have already made significant progress, not only in regaining their territory but also in winning the hearts and minds of the people.\nPeace in South-East Asia can be achieved only if the Kampuchean problem is resolved. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has put forward many proposals, the latest or which is the convening of a \\\"cocktail party\\\". It is our hope that this will encourage a process of dialogue that can open the way to negotiations on a solution to the problem of Kampuchea. Viet Nam, however, has chosen to reject that proposal. Viet Nam should realize that this problem can be resolved only by peaceful means. We urge Viet Nam to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea and work out a peace settlement within the framework of the eight-point proposal put forward by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea.\nTurning to the situation in the Korean peninsula, my delegation welcomes the recent statement and initiatives of the Republic of Korea proposing a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We believe that this will lead to \u0430 lessening of tension and further enhance the prospect of peace and stability in South-East Asia. We also wish to reiterate our support for the admission of the Republic of Korea as a Member of the United Nations, if it so desires, in conformity with the principle of universality of the United Nations.\nI have highlighted some of the problems that confront us. There are many others. The most important of these, which continues to dominate the international political scene, is the question of the elimination of nuclear weapons. The world would be a better and safer place in which to live if those in possession of these highly dangerous weapons could agree to their elimination. There are already enough destructive weapons in this world without nuclear weapons. Brunei Darussalam therefore welcomes the agreement in principle on the elimination of medium-range nuclear weapons between the United States of America and the Soviet Union.\nIt is the role of the United Nations to promote international peace and security. Let us give the United Nations a chance to succeed. Let us all express our political commitment to the United Nations by continuing to give it the financial support it needs to maintain its operations and by honouring the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly. If we have the will and determination to create a peaceful world, I am sure that we shall be successful. The price of failure is too great for all of us. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me much pleasure. Comrade President, to extend to you hearty congratulations on your election to preside over the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session and to wish you every success.\nWe appreciate the judicious work of the President of the General Assembly at its forty-first session I wish good health and energy to the Secretary-General, Mr\u00b7 Javier Perez de Cuellar, in his responsible post. We very much appreciate that during his visit to the German Democratic Republic last June we had fruitful talks serving the purposes of the United Nations\u00b7\nThe forty-second session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when ever more people have come to realize that the conventional posture of States on the political, economic and military issues and their own old habits of dealing with the environment and nature are no longer adequate to guarantee the survival of human civilization.\nWith the world's population now exceeding 5 billion, there is growing evidence that in this age of nuclear weapons and high technology the politics of the arms race and confrontation and the pursuit of selfish interests are bound to multiply and in the end dangerously aggravate the numerous conflicts and crises that already exist in the world. The risks of such policies are becoming increasingly incalculable. This fact alarms peoples on all continents and stirs all those who feel responsible for the fate of humanity to search for alternatives.\nTo assure the future of mankind it is necessary, first and foremost, to avert a nuclear inferno, to agree immediately on a world-wide halt to the arms race, to lead purposefully that halt to a comprehensively controlled process of reduction c forces and armaments; to refrain from militarising outer space; to forgo the deployment of arms and forces in places where there are means to settle peaceful existing conflict; and to promote coexistence among States and peoples and arrange for their co-operation with a view to solving the global issues facing mankind, such as the preservation of the foundations of life on this planet, the eradication of underdevelopment, hunger and disease, and the elimination of living conditions that are incompatible with human dignity.\nSeven decades ago, immediately after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the young Soviet State addressed its Decree of Peace to the world. Amidst the conflagration of the First World War that call was something entirely new, unusual and unique, giving fresh vigour to the yearning for peace. Since those times, the safeguarding of peace and the transition to disarmament have become the main concern of world politics. Chiefly owing to the initiatives taken by the socialist countries, the non-aligned States, the Group of Six and, last but not least, thanks to the activities of the United Nations and the vigorous action of the world-wide peace movement, there is growing awareness that peace in our time can no longer be achieved by arming against each other, but can be ensured only with each other. To give fresh dynamism to the efforts in favour of a secure peace, arms limitation and disarmament requires common sense and realism. To that end all States must live up to their responsibility.\nAt their Berlin summit held last May the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty submitted a comprehensive programme of disarmament which also provides for measures for strict verification and confidence building. That programme is based on the analysis of what is necessary and feasible to build a lasting peace with ever fewer weapons; and it is the logical conclusion from the common Soviet-American perception \\\"that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought; that any war between the Soviet Union and the United States of America, whether nuclear or conventional, must be prevented. \nThat is what, we recall. General Secretary Gorbachev and President Reagan stated as a result of their meeting at Geneva in November 1985. It is in this context that the German Democratic Republic appreciates the efforts made and the results achieved in the Soviet-American talks at the foreign-minister level which ended last week and went a long way to bringing the world closer to genuine nuclear disarmament. Pursuant to its objective to secure peace with ever fewer weapons, the German Democratic Republic has used all its possibilities, and will continue to do so, to contribute to bringing about a double-zero solution without ifs and buts.\nIn the view of the German Democratic Republic, the agreed conclusion and the\nimplementation of an accord between the USSR and the United States of America on the global elimination of their intermediate-range and shorter range missiles permit a start on disarmament proper. Some day historians will certainly describe that step as a turning-point in international and State-to-State relations. It therefore deserves absolute priority and every support. It is only too understandable that now there is a resolute call for the signing and implementing of the accords, because it is common knowledge that, regrettably, there are forces willing to foil this.\nAlong parallel lines, efforts must be intensified to reduce drastically the number of offensive strategic weapons whilst strengthening the anti-ballistic missile Treaty regime and preventing an arms race in outer space. This would also benefit the further strengthening of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). At the same time it is imperative to bring about a world-wide prohibition of chemical weapons and a general and complete ban on nuclear-weapon tests.\nThreatening potentials and \\\"nuclear deterrence are not only incompatible with a reasonable code of conduct consistent without nuclear and space area; they are also a highly dangerous anachronism. The strategy of so-called nuclear deterrence by no means creates a greater measure of security, but is rather a stumbling-block to rapid progress on nuclear disarmament. An alternative has been offered by the document on their military doctrine the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty adopted at their Berlin summit. That entirely defensive doctrine is fully consistent with the principles embodied in the United Nations Charter concerning the non-threat or non-use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State. The allied socialist States declare: that they will never in any circumstances initiate military action against any State or alliance of States unless they are themselves the target of an armed attack\u00b7, that they will never be the first to employ nuclear weapons; that they have no territorial claims on any other State, either in Europe or outside Europe and that they do not view any State or any people as their enemy.\nThe States parties to the Warsaw Treaty have proposed to the member States of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that they enter into consultations on their respective military doctrines. That, too, could open up a way which would lead finally to a non-offensive capacity on both sides. Military imbalances that have emerged regarding any kind of weapon must be reduced through disarmament by the side that has the advantage over the other, in order to restore the balance at a lower level. That would be better, and less costly, than to stick to the principle of counter-deployment, which in the end has always sent the arms race spiralling upwards.\nFor the socialist States, verification of all agreements on arms limitation and disarmament is indispensable. What they want is verification without loopholes that includes necessary on-site inspections. The German Democratic Republic, situated as it is in the heart of Europe, has been working above all for a lessening of military confrontation and the strengthening of security on the European continent, since any conflict at the divide between the two most powerful military alliances with the highest concentration of destructive potential would be fatal for humanity as a whole. Security must be strengthened there through global and regional efforts. Yet we do not wait for global solutions. Together with the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, the German Democratic Republic has put forward proposals aimed at the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free corridor and a chemical-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. Their implementation would not hamper but facilitate global solutions. Likewise, we attach great importance to the proposal made by the highest representative of the Polish People's Republic, Wojciech Jaruzelski.\nThe translation of these initiatives into reality would constitute at the same time a direct contribution to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process, which plays an indisputably essential role in promoting confidence and co-operation in Europe - a role that is increasing, as borne out by the follow-up meeting in Vienna. The German Democratic Republic is working for the successful conclusion of that meeting.\nOver the years the Helsinki Final Act, that code of peaceful coexistence, has become a solid foundation for State-to-State co-operation in Europe. It was that positive regional experience from the CSCE process that encouraged the socialist States to submit their proposal to create a comprehensive system of international peace and security. We would expect the current session of the General Assembly to build on the exchange of views already begun, to which General Secretary Gorbachev's article of last week made an impressive contribution, and to lead it towards an intensive dialogue about such a system that would include political, military, economic, humanitarian and ecological aspects. That would be in accordance with the mandate which the world Organization must fulfil by virtue of its Charter.\nFor every people peace begins on its own doorstep. For this reason, and because of a well-understood historical responsibility, the overriding issue of a secure peace in our time was the central theme of the visit that Erich Honaker, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic, paid to the Federal Republic of Germany recently. As the leading representative of the German Democratic Republic stated at the end of his visit:\n\\\"The results and agreements reached are a success for the policy of common sense and realism, they benefit the people and peace.\\\"\nThe most important result of that visit, which is certainly of concern and interest to all States and peoples, was the agreement, as underlined in the joint declaration\n\\\"that the relations between the two States must remain a stabilizing factor for constructive East-West relations. It should generate positive impulses for peaceful co-operation and dialogue in Europe and beyond.\\\"\nThat remains possible provided the two sides - as they have agreed - proceed strictly from realities, show political will, reason and realism, and continue to normalize their intergovernmental relations. That is the only way to honour the obligation undertaken by the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic f Germany to do everything to ensure that never again will war, but only and always will peace, emanate from German soil - an obligation that the two German States have reaffirmed.\nThat visit has rightly met with a remarkable international response, as its realization reflects the general growing awareness that today one cannot any lone \u03c4 have peace for oneself alone and that it is no longer the quantity or quality of weapons that is decisive in ensuring peace, but only the quality of the policies pursued.\nThe visit of the Head of State of the German Democratic Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany illustrated that constructive political dialogue is possible and can indeed be fruitful even when international conditions are complex. Dialogue remains an indispensable tool for mutual understanding and in the search for specific ways to reduce confrontation.\nOur policy of good-neighbourliness does not leave out Berlin (West). It is based on the quadripartite agreement and thus on the strict observance of the legitimate rights and interests of all concerned.\nThe dangers to world peace arising from seats of tension and conflict are a matter of great concern, since the faintest spark could engender a world-wide flare-up. The German Democratic Republic holds that any dispute or conflict should be brought up and settled at the negotiating table, that is peacefully, through dialogue, with all participants on an equal footing, and on the basis of strict respect for the United Nations Charter. The German Democratic Republic appreciates the relevant efforts made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on behalf of the Security Council. We would expressly encourage him to persist in them. Resolution 598 (1987) of the Security Council is a good basis for the peaceful settlement of the conflict between Iran and Iraq, We endorse the appeal addressed to all States to refrain from any act which might lead to an extension to other regions or to an internationalisation of that conflict. Any show of military strength is incompatible with that aim, as it is bound to exacerbate tensions in the Gulf, The draft declaration entitled \\\"Enhancement of the effectiveness of the principle of non-use of force in international relations drawn up by the Special Committee, should be adopted at an early date and, above all translated into practical measures.\nThe Middle East conflict remains, now as before, unsettled and the Palestinian people continues to be denied the establishment of an independent and sovereign State; yet there is a growing response to the proposal to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East in which all interested parties would participate, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Direct arrangements by the United Nations Security Council for a negotiating mechanism could bring such a conference nearer. This approach could pave the way to a lasting peace for all States of the region.\nThe German Democratic Republic believes that the implementation by all parties of the Central American peace plan signed in Guatemala on 7 August is an appropriate means of settling the conflicts in Central America peacefully and putting an end to the overt and covert war against Nicaragua\u00b7\nThe German Democratic Republic welcomes the initiatives taken by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union for a political settlement of the situation that has developed in the region. The process of national reconciliation which the Afghan Government has initiated must no longer be affected by foreign interference.\nWorld public opinion is deeply disturbed about the increased brutality and aggressiveness to which the South African regime of apartheid resorts vis-\u00e0-vis the country's black population and the neighbouring States. The peoples in southern Africa demand self-determination and the eradication of racism and apartheid , which means peace at home and a peaceful environment. It is time now that the United Nations plan for the granting of independence to Namibia be implemented.\nThe German Democratic Republic supports the insistence of the summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity on the imposition by the United Nations Security Council of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the regime of dyed-in-the-wool racists in South Africa.\nA representative international conference on Cyprus, to be held within the framework of the United Nations, is, as before, necessary for the settlement of the Cyprus question. The presence of foreign troops on the island Impedes the search for solutions that might be acceptable to all sides.\nThe German Democratic Republic follows with sympathy the dialogue that is developing between the three States of Indo-China and the States of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and hopes that it will be a success.\nThe German Democratic Republic expressly supports the demand for the establishment of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, in keeping with its foreign policy of welcoming and promoting all regional initiatives for zones of peace, security and co-operation.\nWith regard to the lessening of tensions on the Korean peninsula, the German Democratic Republic supports the pertinent constructive proposals put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. \nPeace and disarmament, social objectives and the elimination of underdevelopment ate today more closely intertwined than ever before. This, too, was underlined in the document entitled \\\"On the elimination of underdevelopment and the establishment of a new international economic order\\\" adopted by the States patties to the Warsaw Treaty at their Berlin summit in May 1987. Is it not alarming to note that every minute 28 children die of hunger and avoidable diseases while in the same span of time - as was the case in 1986 - $US 1.7 million is spent on armaments? The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development held recently furnished ample proof that the continued arms race is the main reason why fewer and fewer funds are provided to alleviate the situation of more and more people who ate socially disadvantaged.\nWe are satisfied to note that the outcome of that Conference has made it abundantly clear that disarmament is the first prerequisite of development. As the Soviet Foreign Minister has convincingly pointed out, the developing countries' indebtedness has an increasingly negative impact on international relations. At their Berlin summit the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty called for a global and just settlement of that problem.\nThe United Nations is an appropriate body to promote the democratization of international economic relations. The German Democratic Republic advocates agreement on mutually acceptable principles which would ensure a predictable operation of the world economy. That is precisely the aim of the initiative proposed by the socialist States to draw up a concept of international economic security. \nThe German Democratic Republic stands for Increased co-operation among States for the implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is guided by the precept that the fundamental human right is, above all, the right to live in peace.\nThe German Democratic Republic promotes the enjoyment of human rights and speaks out firmly against the gross and mass violations of human rights by the practice of apartheid, racial and social discrimination, genocide and fascism.\nThis world Organization has a multitude of issues to resolve that are crucial for the existence and survival of humanity. It is invaluable as a forum for dialogue, negotiation and co-operation. In saying this we do not overlook the fact that its effectiveness and that of all its bodies, the strengthening of its role and authority, the enhancement of its effectiveness, the binding character of its resolutions as well as the implementation of its decisions depend on the co-ordinated co-operation of all its Member States. If that co-operation is lacking, the strength of the United Nations is bound to be limited. Let me assure this Assembly that the German Democratic Republic will do all it can to help carry out the tasks that face this world Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, it is a marvellous feeling, one of deep gratification, to be able to address so illustrious a successor as you. For me to hand over the gavel to a person of such experience was both a pleasure and a privilege. Your election is a manifestation of the high esteem in which you are held. This recognition is most appropriate in view of your many contributions to the cause of peace, progress and multilateral co-operation. It is an honour well earned. May I offer you the assurance of my delegation's complete co-operation in the discharge of your onerous functions.\nBangladesh is deeply appreciative of the significant contribution being made by our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, to the effectiveness of the world body. His reappointment to a further term was a most well-deserved tribute to his dedication and commitment to the United Nations and its lofty ideals. He has earned the gratitude and respect of the international community by his humane attitude and deep understanding of global problems. We assure him of our continued full support and co-operation. I am positive the new Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs, Mr. Joseph Verner Reed, a capable diplomat of charming disposition, and his staff will be to you. Sir, a perennial source of support when you need it.\nThe United Nations - a product of our relentless search for peace, security and development in our times and a symbol of our desire to banish forever the pangs of poverty, hunger, war and illiteracy - is a sturdy monument to the values of human civilization. The hundred million people of Bangladesh, under the bold and dynamic leadership of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, believe that to be so. Our unflinching and abiding commitment to this Organization is based on that belief. We are happy to see signs of the restoration of global confidence in this institution. We trust that the worst is over for the \\\"last hope of mankind\\\" and that the years ahead will bring in newer assurances for the effective functioning of the United Nations system.\nBangladesh has been playing an active, constructive and purposeful role in the international arena despite the many and varied constraints it confronts. Our activities in this sphere are guided by basic foreign policy objectives; first, to consolidate and safeguard our independence and sovereignty, secondly, to develop friendly bilateral, regional and international co-operation) and, thirdly, to co-operate with the global community in promoting the cause of peace, freedom and development. In pursuing these objectives, we adhere strictly and with scrupulous respect to the principles of sovereign equality of all nations, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, peaceful settlement of all disputes, and the tight of every nation to determine its own social, economic and political system.\nThose are the principles upon which our policies are based. Those are the values that determine our external expression.\nIt is because of the United Nations that the world community today gives high priority to the cause of development, which in its simplest form means improving the quality of life of all people in the world, particularly those in developing countries such as our country. The United Nations has been actively involved in the process of our development since the very beginning of our nationhood. The responsiveness of the United Nations system to the needs of a country such as Bangladesh has been proved time and time again. Members are aware that my country has recently been in the grip of a devastating and unprecedented flood. Many lives have been lost and hundreds of thousands of people have been rendered homeless. Standing crops were washed away. We are grateful to the United Nations system, its agencies and the international community for a timely response with support and succour. Perhaps it is time we devised a method whereby our contemporary capabilities could be marshalled to predict and control human sufferings from such natural calamities. In this connection may I draw the attention of the General Assembly to the resolution it adopted in 1985 on \\\"long-term and effective solution of the problems caused by natural disasters in Bangladesh\\\" (resolution 40/231). It is important that the international community give serious thought to the main focus of that resolution by the United Nations system to consider a long-term and effective solution of this problem. We look forward to the guidance of the Secretary-General in this regard.\nCopies of the text of my statement are being distributed, wherein representatives will find the rest of what I wish to say. Mindful as I am of the financial constraints of this august body, and of the valuable time of representatives, I should like to conclude at this point. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt is a great honour for me to extend to Mr. Florin of the German Democratic Republic, on behalf of His Excellency, General Andre Kolingba, President of the Republic, Head of State and founding President of the Central African Democratic Assembly, the warm congratulations of the delegation of the Central African Republic on his election to the presidency of the (General Assembly at its forty-second session. His personal qualities, his ability, and his great experience will ensure the success of the session.\nI also take this opportunity to extend to his predecessor, Mr. Huraayun Rasneed Choudhury, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, the thanks of my delegation for the very able manner in which he discharged his duties.\nTo the Secretary-General of our Organization I confirm the support of the Central African Government for his steady efforts to ensure a greater role for the United Nations in the search for peace, security and international co-operation.\nLastly, on behalf of my delegation, I should like to congratulate Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed on his appointment as Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs.\nIt is two years now since our critical, rigorous and perceptive analysis of the 40 years of existence of the United Nations, The hope born of the \\\"new pragmatism\\\" which was cited by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization, and which offers\n\\\"... a promising basis for broadened multilateral co-operation and increased effectiveness of the United Nations\\\" (A/42/1, p.2), must not conceal the fact that our system is still in a state of crisis. It is a crisis because of the chasm between the aspirations of most peoples for a new world order and the ability of the system to make a real contribution towards solving the problems that arise from those aspirations. \nIt is a crisis as regards collective security, specifically as regards the maintenance of collective peace and security, for the structures of the United Nations are not always able to operate in accordance with the Charter, for obvious reasons.\nAccordingly, the changes the world is undergoing today make the revitalization of the United Nations imperative since its credibility depends on an effective and vigilant system that can promote good management of international co-operation.. \nPolitical will and deep-reaching structural reforms adapted to the current context of international relations could indeed enable the United Nations to emerge from the crisis and fulfil its mission as set forth in the Charter.\nFor some time now the United Nations system has found a new vitality in resolutely committing itself to organizing multilateral aid for development and, above all/ providing a framework for major negotiations on the future of international economic co-operation. The United Nations would like to be accepted to a greater extent as playing the principal role in the search for this new world order to which all States legitimately aspire.\nIn this context the work of bodies such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is decisive.\nThis aspect of the Organization's work, while it has been properly identified only very recently, has nevertheless led to a short increase of confidence in the United Nations on the part of third world countries, in particular African countries, whose overall situation worsens routinely from one session to another.\nIn this century of extraordinary scientific progress and unprecedented accumulation of wealth in the northern hemisphere there are still countries desperately seeking the means of survival. Yet we note that despite that harsh reality it is still difficult to arrive at a consensus on what solution should be provided.\nAfrica's economic situation was described without any window dressing by the African States themselves at the recent special session of the United Nations on the critical economic situation in Africa just a year ago. A United Nations Programme of Action for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa 1986-1990 was then adopted. The assessment that is to be made will enable us to see how far we have gone in applying that Programme, for whose implementation we are all responsible, for, after all, we made a solemn commitment to ensure this.\nThe Central African Republic, while it was establishing the bases for the new Central African society, whose Constitution describes the outlines of our system, has for the last six years been undertaking an extensive, thorough going reform at the social and economic level. The action taken has involved tremendous sacrifices on the part of the Central African people and, although to varying degrees, it has been possible to attain the development objectives sought by the Government, primarily food self-sufficiency.\nHowever, the Government's work cannot be strengthened, broadened and developed unless there is a propitious international environment. The fall in world prices of commodities, including coffee, cotton and wood, which are the bases of the Central African Republic's economy, will simply cancel out the work done by our Government if a concrete and resolute International dimension is not provided as well.\nAn improvement in the world commodity prices combined with an increase in aid and the granting of loans on favourable terms should make it possible for the Central African Republic to see its work crowned with success.\nThe round table on the Central African Republic held last June in Geneva, at which General Andr\u00e9 Kolingba, President of the Republic and Head of. State, himself participated, was not only part of the framework for strengthening the economic and financial recovery that has since been undertaken, but also an opportunity to reassure the immensity of the work done. \nThe interest demonstrated by various friendly countries and some financial institutions give ground for our Government to be cautiously optimistic and we hope that there will be greater participation in the economic take-off of our country.\nI should like to extend my Government's thanks to the current and future partners of the Central African Republic, which, fully respecting the principle of the sovereign equality of States and reciprocity, have provided and will provide assistance towards our development.\nOn a broader scale and on the same lines, African countries have long since become aware that real progress in development requires that their peoples be assured at least a minimum, above all, of food. Therefore agriculture is still our top priority, but the development of agriculture involves vast efforts in the spheres of education, training, health and an adequate mobilizing infrastructure, It is therefore essential that the African countries have access to credit and, ideally benefit from a major transfer of financial resources for this purpose. It goes without saying that in the search for the means to promote agriculture the stabilization of the prices of commodities, the basis of our economy, and an increase in those prices are of paramount importance.\nOur situation can never improve unless there is a real solution to the question of the foreign debt of African countries. This is essential to the recovery of the African economy, which is itself vital to the health of the world economy. In any event, one thing is clear: the foreign debt of African States is now well beyond the ability of their economies to repay.\nThe sustained attention given by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to this problem and the fact that one of its sessions will be especially devoted to it bear witness to this. \nWhile General Andr\u00e9 Kolingba, President of the Republic and Head of State, restated to the partners of the Central African Republic at the round table in Geneva the intention of the Government to honour all obligations entered into by the Central African Republic regarding its creditors, he added:\n\\\"It is, however, clear that our resolve is limited by our resources, which in turn depend on the authorities you represent.\\\"\nThis is why the Central African Republic wishes to join those who, since the Quebec Summit, both elsewhere and in this Hall, have paid well-deserved tributes to Canada, which has decided to cancel not only the debts of the French-speaking countries of Africa but also, at the forthcoming meeting in Vancouver, those of the Commonwealth countries.\nThis remarkable and exemplary action reminds us of the action taken by the Federal Republic of Germany, to which the Central African Republic extended its thanks when it cancelled our debts earlier.\nBut, as was emphasized by the Secretary-General in his report to the forty-first session, we face a human problem and a human solution must be found to it so that beyond new individual attitudes there may be a concerted approach at the intergovernmental level.\nThe search for solutions to the serious economic problems of the day is possible only if there is an atmosphere of trust in relations between States. But the lack of trust, the division of the world and fear result in the spiralling arras race, involving the use of enormous resources for purposes that go well beyond the requirements of national security. This trend has become an end in itself, even though the Powers already have the means to destroy the entire human race.\nThe arms race is thus a real threat to international peace and security and is certainly an obstacle to development, because major resources are devoted to it when they could have been used for development. This point was made recently at the Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development which, incidentally, emphasized the close interdependence between disarmament, development and security. Therefore, everything must be done to ensure the achievement of general and complete disarmament. But the primary condition remains the easing of tension in relations between the Powers that have committed themselves to the arms race, and here I mean primarily the two super-Powers.\nThe agreement concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union on reducing medium-range missiles can, above and beyond the principle that it establishes, be regarded as opening up the path towards that easing of tension.\nThis is something that my delegation welcomes. We ardently hope that at the third special session of the United Nations on Disarmament the international community can establish the outlines of the strategy to bring about disarmament.\nHowever, while the strengthening of relations of trust between States has to be ensured through effective disarmament, a balance requires respect for the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination, as also the principles of the equal sovereignty of States and non-interference in their internal affairs. It is failure to respect those principles that leads to continuing hotbeds of tension throughout the world.\nThe African land of Namibia must become independent without any preconditions whatsoever under the leadership of its authentic representative, the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). The Security Council must shoulder its responsibilities and demonstrate political will to ensure the implementation of its plan for that Territory.\nIn their daily struggle to build a new society, the majority of the South African people must participate in the management of the affairs in their country. To that end, it is essential to dismantle the abhorrent system of apartheid. That is a precondition for the restoration of peace in South Africa and, hence in southern Africa as a whole. The international community must continue to mobilize its efforts to that end.\nWhile the resolve with which Chad, a neighbouring fraternal country, has endeavoured to defend its sovereignty - in other words, its right to survive \u2014 has been commensurate with the threat facing it, my delegation still believes in the virtues of a negotiated solution to the Chad-Libyan border dispute, and we welcome the action taken by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity on this question, which indeed represents an effort to seek a definitive settlement of the dispute.\nThe Central African Republic believes that such a settlement should make it possible to re-establish the territorial integrity of Chad, which is essential for the legal Government of the Republic of Chad to continue the work of national reconstruction in which it has been engaged. We thus appeal to the interested parties not only strictly to comply with the Lusaka recommendations, but also, as they have undertaken to do, to co-operate sincerely in those efforts. Other members of the international community should be involved in them if they truly hold dear peace and the rule of law, so that peace can at last return to that area.\nIt cannot be repeated often enough that the situation in the Middle East requires that account be taken of the interests of the Palestinian people, and particularly of their right to a homeland, so that a settlement may be arrived at that would put an end to the sufferings that have been imposed upon them. My delegation, while confirming the right of the State of Israel to existence, would again state that it is only through the convening of an international conference on the Middle East, involving all the interested parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, that a real contribution can be made to the search for a settlement.\nThe fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq has caused tremendous loss of life and there is a clear danger of the situation becoming internationalised. Given the breach of peace in that region, only a bold initiative along the lines of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) can provide a just and lasting solution to the conflict. My delegation, which greatly appreciates Iraq's constant willingness to seek such a solution, which can be seen from its acceptance of that resolution, calls upon the other party to abide by it. We also call upon other States to refrain from any action that could worsen the situation.\nThe use of occupation as a means of crushing the soul of a people is contrary to the principle of freedom held dear by the United Nations. That is why Democratic Kampuchea must at last be enabled to exercise all the attributes of its sovereignty in accordance with United Nations principles. The principle of freedom must also be observed in the case of Afghanistan so that its people may begin the procedure of democratisation, which they so ardently desire. The right to decide their own destiny in all freedom must be recognized. Accordingly, foreign troops must be withdrawn from Democratic Kampuchea and from Afghanistan.\nThe situation in the Korean peninsula is still a matter of concern, in view of the threat to peace in the region. In this connection, my delegation believes that the principle of peaceful reunification must be observed and that at the same time direct dialogue, without outside interference, should be resumed between the two parties. This does not exclude the possibility that in the meantime they may, together or separately, request admission to membership in the United nations, in whose system they already participate.\nIn Central America, the cause of peace has finally triumphed in the form of the Agreement recently arrived at among the five States of the region on the procedures to be followed to bring about a stable and lasting peace in that part of the world. My delegation welcomes this, and trusts that the international community will make its contribution to promote a positive outcome.\nAbove and beyond these major challenges, the basic characteristic of this century remains the desire of the peoples for peace. After all, the Charter that brings us all together begins with the solemn commitment of the peoples of the United Nations to establish the necessary conditions for the advent of peace. It is thus up to the Member States that represent those peoples to contribute, in action and through sustained and consistent political will, to the emergence of new international relations marked by justice and equity.\nThey certainly have the political will to do so; that is evident from the many dialogues - which have often been difficult, incidentally - that have taken place in dealing with many issues of great importance involving the question of security and international economic co-operation. For the Central African Republic  this political will must be expressed by giving the United Nations a greater role in managing international co-operation within the framework of efforts to bring about the new international order,\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe choice of you, Sir, at the beginning of this session to assume the important duties of President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session is a tribute not only to you as an experienced, well-informed diplomat, with qualities and merits recognized by all, but also to your country, the German Democratic Republic, whose aspirations and central position in Europe mark it out for the path of international peace and co-operation. It is a country with which Congo has excellent friendly relations. I am pleased to offer you. Sir, the warmest congratulations of the Congolese delegation and to express our particular pleasure at seeing you preside over the work of this session. It goes without saying that my delegation will spare neither time nor effort in helping you discharge your important mandate.\nI wish also on behalf of the Congolese delegation to thank and pay a tribute to your Illustrious predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, for the ability and dedication with which he presided over the previous session.\nTo the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, I present the greetings of the Congolese Government and its thanks for his co-operation and his kindness to us when Colonel Denis Sassou-Nguesso was Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Indeed, thanks to the good understanding between them, co-operation between this world Organization and the Pan-African Organization increased in quality and effectiveness, to the benefit of our common goals.\nLastly, I wish to take this opportunity to welcome the appointment of Mr. Joseph Reed as Assistant Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs. His dynamism and ability will, I am sure, be a real asset to the Assembly and the Secretariat.\nThis forty-second session is beginning in an explosive and depressing international atmosphere - explosive because of an increase in hotbeds of tension depressing because for most countries of the third world the economic crisis persists; inasmuch as the reorientation of economic policies and the specific measures taken have responded only partially to the need to check the disease.\nThe state of affairs that I have described illustrates disturbingly and irrefutably how meeting mankind's most immediate aspirations, particularly the aspirations for peace and security, demands a greater political will, a pooling of all possible efforts and energies, to ensure a stable strengthening of the Ideals of the Charter of the United Nations and the promotion of their practical Influence on the conduct of nations.\nIn that regard, I wish to share with the representatives of the international community present today some thoughts that Inspired the people and Government of the People's Republic of the Congo in the light of lessons learned from the carrying out by our country and its President, His Excellency Denis Sassou-Nguesso, of an important mandate at the head of the OAU.\nAs President Denis Sassou-Nguesso has reaffirmed, the United Nations remains the irreplaceable, universal framework, which the world will always need, for assessing, identifying and settling problems involving coexistence on our planet - hence, the need constantly to have recourse to the United Nations and to make the principles of the Charter and the rule of law the mandatory basis for all action that may have international consequences.\nTherefore, the financial crisis facing the United Nations is above all a crisis of confidence. The uncertainty to which it gives rise is merely a reflection of a posture that does not take into account the march of history, one that wishes to replace multilateralism by a bilateral - even unilateral - approach to the regulation of international affairs. Today the frontiers of peace, security and development can be measured only in the constantly growing dimensions of mutual understanding and the extent of implementation of the principles of justice and equity in international relations. We also have to take into consideration the extent and diversity of the various Individual experiences and situations, outside of models imposed by force, intolerance and threats.\nWe are therefore concerned with the situation in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and, in particular, Africa, because of the crises which have crystallized in Namibia and South Africa and the critical economic situation in Africa as a whole. We know that the United Nations has studied these problems, but we fear that they may simply become part of the litany intoned at international conferences.\nCentral America is one of the areas of most acute tension in the world. At the eighth Summit Conference of non-aligned countries, last year in Harare the Heads of State and Government \\\"condemned the escalation of aggression, military attacks and other actions against Nicaragua's sovereignty, political Independence, territorial integrity ...\\\" (A/41/697, p. 104) or that of other States of the region. In this context, it is more than ever necessary to stress that it is incumbent on all of us to follow with interest and to support the Contadora Group and the Support Group, in view of the praiseworthy efforts that they have been making recently to promote peace.\nAs we know, these efforts led to the adoption last August in Guatemala City of a peace plan which was accepted by all the parties concerned. In many respects it offers a real chance of resolving the misunderstandings that exist or might exist between States in the subregion. We trust that all other States will refrain from actions that might interfere with this peace process. In South-East Asia, regarding Kampuchea, we venture to hope that the agreement signed on 29 July 1987 between the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, representing the countries of Indo-China, and the Indonesian Foreign Minister, representing the member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), will be mutually respected, in the interests of the peoples of that part of Asia.\nToday, all observers agree that there is some evolution in the situation in Afghanistan and that the various parties concerned seem to agree on a fair number of issues. Naturally, therefore, we support the efforts of the Secretary-General with a view to the settlement of the problem in the Interests of the Afghan people as a whole.\nIn the Korean peninsula the concentration of large armed forces along the military demarcation line clearly constitutes a threat to peace and security. In order to ease the tensions and help to speed up the peaceful reunification of the peninsula, a number of initiatives have been taken to reduce the armed forces there. The response to those initiatives and others and the interest evinced throughout the world are encouraging signs of good will favourable to the restoration of peace and security in that area, and thus worthy of the attention of this Assembly.\nContinuing tension and insecurity are features of the situation in the Middle East, which continues to be a matter of concern to the international community. For several years now the General Assembly has been seized of the Middle East crisis without there being any glimmer of a real settlement.\nAs was reaffirmed by the General Assembly in its resolution 41/162 A, adopted on 4 December 1986: \\\"a Just and comprehensive settlement of the situation in the Middle East cannot be achieved without the participation on an equal footing of all the parties to the conflict, including the Palestine Liberation Organization ...\u201d The international community's support for the convening of a conference on peace in the Middle East gives ground for great hope, in our opinion. We trust that all interested parties will refrain from imposing pre-conditions that might delay the convening of such a conference and that they will be able to take up the substantive problem, namely, peace in the Middle East and self-determination for the Palestinian people.\nThe Iran-Iraq war and the tense situation in the Gulf have had disastrous consequences to date for the people themselves and for the economies of the two warring parties, seriously threatening international security. In associating ourselves with the initiatives recently taken by the Security Council, through the adoption of resolution 598 (1987), Congo appeals to the two parties to end the conflict. We support the diplomatic activity of the Secretary-General in this connection, and call on all States to refrain from any interference or action that might hamper the efforts under way, pursuant to paragraph 5 of Security Council resolution 598 (1987).\nAs for Chad, a neighbour and brother of Congo, we note with satisfaction the progress made in the process of national reconciliation. However, there remain other problems.\nThe Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity (OA\u016a) , which is meeting now in Lusaka, Zambia, under the presidency of El Had j Omar Bongo, President of the Republic of Gabon, is trying to settle the Chad-Libya border dispute. We firmly support those mediation efforts, in which Congo has always been actively involved.\nToday, by general agreement, the question of Western Sahara seems to be at a deadlock. This is particularly deplorable in that we know - because we were closely involved in this - that the Chairman of the OAU and the Secretary\u2014General of the United Nations have made intensive efforts to bring about a lasting solution. The active co-operation of all the parties concerned remains indispensable to the success of the joint actions of the OAU and the United Nations, as set forth in the relevant resolutions adopted by those two Organizations.\nAfrica is being eaten away by the gangrene of apartheid, one of the moat shocking anachronisms of our century. Despite many appeals and threats, most of the people of South Africa continue to live in a permanent state of siege; Nelson Mandela is still in prison and along with him are many political prisoners who have been arbitrarily detained. The destabilization of the front-line States has not stopped.\nUntil the apartheid system is dismantled - a system which has been declared here to be \\\"a crime against humanity\\\" - there are no grounds for south Africa's joining the ranks of free Africa or of the international community. Thus, we shall continue to call for decisive measures against the Pretoria regime as demanded by the South African tragedy and the growing impatience of the international community.\nOn 10 November 1986 the General Assembly adopted resolution 41/35 B, reaffirming its support for the struggle of the people of South Africa and condemning the activities of trans national corporations and financial institutions that have continued to co-operate with that country.\nSouth Africa, which incidentally is tranquilly building up a military force which is a threat to the peace and security of the continent, has continued for eight years to reject with impunity the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which was designed to facilitate Namibia's accession to Independence. To preserve the credibility of the United Nations, the Security Council  which last July adopted an important decision on the question of the Gulf war, indicating in particular that there was a possibility of recourse to Chapter VII of the Charter, will, we feel sure, be consistent in its actions and consider tackling the same firm attitude with regard to South Africa to ensure the application of a decision that was adopted unanimously and whose application is therefore mandatory. I refer to resolution 435 (1978), paced with this situation, Africa has outlined new approaches, committed more resources, mobilized further energies. The success of the Africa Fund is but one illustration, judging by the significant contributions made to it from the Congo - 200 million CPA francs - and from Africa and elsewhere for a total of $US 110 million as of 25 May 1987.\nj\nBrazzaville, the capital of the Congo, this year hosted historic meetings for the continent, including, inter-alia, an international symposium in May 1987 on the topic \\\"Writers condemn apartheid\\\", in which 400 representatives from various countries and international organizations participated; and the First Congress of Scientists in Africa, held from 25 to 30 June 1987, which, in the view of the scientists themselves, was a great success.\nAt the end of that Congress, a non-governmental organization called Pan African Union of Science and Technology was founded, with Brazzaville as its headquarters, the Congolese Government is donating a large building and a grant of 50 million CFA francs - that is $US 150,000 - for the new organization.\nIn addition, the Organization of African Unity has declared 30 June African Scientific Renaissance Day to be observed yearly.\nThus for the first time in Africa the awareness and creativity of scientists and researchers has been called upon so as to benefit from their contribution to the liberation and advancement of the continent.\nAs President Denis Sassou-Nguesso said here last year,\n\\\"Africa is aware of the vital nature of what is at stake, namely, mastery of both sciences and adopted techniques ... which are the real key to tomorrow's world. Africa does not wish to and cannot fail in that under taking.\\\" (A/41/PV. 17> p\u00bf 17) \nWhen in the first half of this year President Denis Sassou-Nguesso visited various capitals of the world - after having visited North Africa last year - he was able to gauge the degree of understanding and mobilization of public opinion in those countries and the positions of their Governments vis-\u00e0-vis Africa. There were some signs of hope which deserved to be reflected in the efforts and mobilization of the African countries. That this is what we wanted to see real commitments by Africa's partners in implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African economic recovery.\nThe best we can say today is that several International agencies have already taken certain measures aimed at starting the implementation of the Programme of Action; similarly, recently at Venice the summit meeting of the seven most industrialized Western Powers recognized the need to increase official development aid to Africa as well as the particularly distressing situation of Africa's debt.\nIn any event, a global assessment of the implementation of the Programme will take place only next year. However, we wish here once again to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, whose interim report indicates the efforts he has made towards the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for Africa.\nIn dealing with questions of survival and development in Africa, we are getting into an area where there is a very deeply felt common concern on the part of all developing countries, as was demonstrated last July at UNCTAD VII.\nIndeed, for a decade now - if not longer - most developing countries have adopted reform and readjustment policies whose effects have turned out to be as uncertain as the situations they were designed to correct.\nIllusions about what could be achieved from the sacrifices undertaken by the poor peoples have been commensurate with the uncertainty in which the international climate is floundering. Split between the virtues of callous selfishness and professions of faith in a liberalism that would bring salvation, many developed countries have in fact been busy destroying their own reference system instead of giving it the credibility to which they invite the developing countries.\nHence, instead of market laws, we have protectionism, overpricing of manufactured goods and quasi-dogmatic under-pricing of commodities. What is more, repayment of debt is seen as the sacred duty of the debtor country, under pain of the harshest economic sanctions regardless of ability to pay.\nOn the other hand, there is extreme distrust of the idea of reorganizing the machinery of international trade and the transfer of resources, at a time when the exchange rates of the main currencies are out of control and interest rates are indeed at extremely high levels.\nDebates at UNCTAD VII once again revealed these shortcomings of the international economic system. The matter of the entry into force of the agreement on establishing the Common Fund for commodities, which had been so often been postponed, alone reflects the reality of the tragedy of those countries - and their region - whose resources basically come from the sale of commodities.\nLike most developing countries, the People's Republic of the Congo now finds itself faced with all these problems, aggravated as they are by trends which are hardly propitious to promoting growth in the developing countries. However, co-operation between my country and international agencies, on the one hand, and with other partners at the bilateral level, on the other, has never been ambiguous, for loyalty and mutual interest of the partners have always been the basic elements of that co-operation.\nIt is essential that these elements be preserved; there is nothing more absurd  an seeing countries that are rigorously and in good faith applying adjustment policies being at times forced into a kind of rebellion against the basically unfair rules of the game,\nA few weeks ago in New York the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development was convened. It had the merit of highlighting the incalculable risks in the uncurbed use of resources for death rather than for life.\nThe Congolese delegation welcomes the adoption by consensus of the Final Document by that Conference. Of course the document did not live up to everyone's hopes, nor did it meet all concerns. It covers up the concerns that were hardly concealed in originally polarized positions, some of which were brought closer only at the cost of numerous concessions, that even at times sacrificed the very objectives of the Conference. But the very contents of the document must be characterized as a highly political act because, far from simply limiting itself to historical reality, the document establishes the basis for a process which must be continued and strengthened with real political will so as to achieve the objectives of disarmament and development as set forth in the Charter.\nThat consensus, together with the Final Act of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), constitutes an act of faith in multilateralism as an instrument on which international co-operation must be based.\nIt is in the same spirit that we must hail the agreement in principle arrived at just a few days ago between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on medium- and short-range missiles. We venture to hope that that opening will strengthen the current trend towards the objective of disarmament.\nIn a world which in the final analysis is governed by imperatives as questionable as those of the manufacture and sale of increasingly costly weapons to countries daily engulfed and consumed by emotion and distrust  there is very little margin for peace and security. But this pessimism in no way implies despair. Our presence here at the United Nations is, after all, testimony to the resurgence of which the human spirit is always capable.\nIt is for us all, the men and women of today, who are building our own future, to try to build a new world - and it is to that that the People's Republic of the Congo, for its part, has decided fully to commit itself.\n"

        "file_name": "CYP_42_1987.txt",
        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt is with great pleasure. Sit, that I extend to you my warmest congratulations on your election to the high office of the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. The confidence shown in you by this body is a tribute by the international community to you personally, as well as to your country, with which Cyprus maintains close and friendly relations. I have no doubt that, with your experience and skill, you will guide the deliberations of this session to a successful conclusion.\nI also wish to congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Choudhury, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, on the impeccable manner in which he discharged his difficult task as President of the forty-first session, honouring both his country and the Asian region in general. We also express our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts on behalf of the United Nations.\nThe opening of this year's session coincided with a historic development. The conclusion of the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union for the elimination of medium- and short-range missiles is of paramount importance not only as far as relations between the two super-Powers are concerned but also for humanity as a whole. \nThis development has naturally given rise to well-founded optimism regarding the future of mankind. One can of course validly argue that the danger of a nuclear catastrophe has not yet been completely and definitely eliminated. Yet, the recent agreement in Washington is a specific and substantive step in that direction. It also provides concrete evidence of the political will of the United States and the Soviet Union to world together, despite the great difficulties that still exist owing to the divergence of their views on many issues, foe the purpose of gradually reducing and finally eliminating the very real clanger that is facing humanity's very existence and survival, especially since the beginning of the nuclear arms race.\nWe hope and trust that the agreement concluded in principle in Washington will soon be finalized, signed and implemented and that it will be followed by other agreements in the field of nuclear disarmament. We do not underestimate the difficulties with regard to some specific aspects of nuclear disarmament, but we strongly believe that certain additional steps could easily be taken that would on the one hand strengthen mutual confidence, which is still greatly needed, and on the other enhance the process towards the goal of complete nuclear disarmament. While efforts to tackle the more difficult aspects must continue in a sustained manner, steps such as the complete banning of nuclear tests and the effective tackling of the issue of chemical weapons should be taken without further delay.\nContinued progress in the field of nuclear disarmament, extremely important in itself, will also enable the two super-Powers steadily to improve their relations and will facilitate the promotion of close co-operation between them in dealing with other problems, whether global or regional, the solution of which must be sought with urgency and determination. It is indeed hoped and expected that, parallel to the dialogue for nuclear disarmament and disarmament in general, concerted efforts will be made by the two super-Powers to address as a matter of urgency the other problems as well. We do not suggest that the two super-Powers have the right to apply to these problems solutions of their own choice/ but we are realistic enough to acknowledge the fact that they are in a position to influence developments and contribute decisively to the solution of these problems. The common denominator cannot of course be other than the principles of the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations.\nIn other words, we believe that the United Nations can become effective only if the permanent members of the Security Council, and particularly the two super-Powers, decide to make it effective through joint action. The obvious answer to the question how this can be achieved is through agreement by the super-Powers and all the other members, particularly the other permanent members, of the Security Council to stand firmly by the Council's decisions and act together resolutely for their strict implementation in all cases, without distinction, irrespective of whom those decisions affect, thus abandoning the tendency to adopt double standards, as has so far been the case. This is the only possible way to make the Security Council effective, and it is the only possible way to solve most of the problems that still confront the world.\nYear after year in this forum we all speak of the imperative necessity to turn the United Nations into an effective instrument for peace and security in the world, as envisaged by its founding Members and as provided for in its Charter. Most of us, year after year, speak in this Hall of the imperative necessity to establish a comprehensive system of International security through the existing mechanisms and procedures provided for by the Charter. It is now more pressing than ever before to begin meaningful and result-oriented deliberations to achieve this purpose, which is also closely related to ongoing efforts in the field of disarmament, as well as to the tackling and settlement of other global and regional problems. When we speak of the necessity to continue a dialogue and the process towards disarmament, when we speak of the necessity to establish in practice a comprehensive system of international security, when we speak of the necessity to tackle effectively and solve all other global and regional problems, we strongly maintain that those efforts should be parallel, because, owing to their interrelationship, any progress in one field will automatically increase the prospects for further progress in the others.\nIt is indeed encouraging and heartening that today we look to the future with full optimism and confidence. We hope that as time goes by that optimism and confidence will increase and be consolidated. Mankind needs to see some more tangible achievements to make it feel secure about its future. It is in this spirit that we look forward to more positive results within the framework of the dialogue between the two super-Powers, and it is in the same spirit that we expect more such results from the forthcoming meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev, beyond the signing of the agreement already concluded in principle a few days ago in Washington. We sincerely wish both of them every success.\nIn underlining and stressing the paramount importance of the role of the super-Powers in relation to all international problems, it has not been my intention to minimize or underestimate the role and the significant contribution of all the other countries that comprise the membership of the United Nations. On the contrary, we must not stand aside or wash our hands of problems, leaving everything to the super-Powers. Nor can such an attitude facilitate the efforts of the super-powers themselves. The entire membership of the United Nations has important and heavy responsibilities to discharge. In fact, the improvement in the international climate as a result of the rapprochement between the super-Powers has increased the possibilities for all Members of the United Nations, whether big or small, individually and collectively, to contribute more substantively and meaningfully to the achievement of our common goals and objectives. This, I must stress once again, is not limited to any specific country or group of countries alone. It is not limited to the allies of the two super-Powers, as it is not limited to other groups of countries, such as the European Economic Community which, owing to its strength and influence, has no doubt a special role to play. It is not limited to the permanent members of the Security Council or to the members of the Security Council as a whole. Collective efforts on the part of all regional organizations are also important. Important initiatives, such as the initiative of the Six - Greece, Sweden, Argentina, Mexico, India and Tanzania - must continue with more determination in the light of recent developments. The contribution of all is needed much more than ever before.\nIn this connection, I would like to stress the importance I attach to the role of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, to which most of us in this Assembly belong. The Movement has, since its establishment, played a positive and constructive role in world affairs, utilizing the great moral force it represents. The prospects have now increased for the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to play an even greater and more effective role. I would like to reiterate today what I stressed at the last summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at Harare, that we must now concentrate on how to increase the effectiveness of our Movement. I pledge that Cyprus, despite its small size and strength and in spite of the constraints imposed on it by its particular problem, will work hard for this objective. We will co-operate with all others in the Movement in order to arrive at concrete conclusions that can be taken up at the next full ministerial conference of the Movement, which will take place on 5 September next year, and which we will have the honour to host in Cyprus. I personally attach great importance to that meeting and we must all world together for its success.\nI have already expressed my conviction that the new climate created as a result of the agreement reached recently in Washington, and which has improved the relations between the two super-Powers, will foster conditions conducive to the search for solutions to other major international problems and regional crises.\nOne of these problems, of world-wide interest and concern, is the prevailing economic situation. This manifests itself as a structural crisis and, in turn, urgently points to the need for increasing multilateral co-operation in seeking solutions to the various aspects of the problem. The gap between North and South is ever present. Furthermore, the external debt crisis continues to be one of the most serious obstacles to the progress and genuine sovereignty of many developing countries,\nA, new international economic order is of the utmost importance in itself and the efforts towards establishing it must continue in a sustained manner, the interrelationship between this target and the final overall objective of lasting peace and security in the world being borne always in mind. In this respect, the interrelationship between disarmament and development must also be stressed. This was reaffirmed and underlined by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development and it is clear that further steps are needed to translate the unanimous conclusions of the Conference into concrete actions for the benefit of all countries and peoples.\nThe new climate should also be utilized for tackling, as a matter of urgency, the various regional problems that continue to pose a serious threat to peace and security. There can be no doubt that to achieve solutions to these problems there must be more than ever before be common action and co-operation among nations, in this respect, the role of the permanent members of the Security Council and, in particular, that of the two super-Powers is of paramount importance. And there is no other way of successfully dealing with these problems except by abiding strictly by the principles and purposes of the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations and by ensuring their respect and implementation.\nThe principles enshrined in the Charter and embodied in regional instruments, such as the Helsinki Final Act - the non-use of force or threat of the use of force, non-interference and non-intervention, equal rights and self-determination of peoples, as well as basic human rights and fundamental freedoms - are still being flagrantly violated in different parts of the world, thus protracting dangerous and explosive situations and contributing to the breakdown of legal order and security in the respective regions.\nIt should no longer be tolerated that millions of people in the world suffer daily from gross violations of their human rights, despite the existence of internationally accepted legal instruments. Such instruments, concluded during the United Nations era, embody the moral conscience of mankind and represent the humanitarian standards that should guide the behaviour of all members of the International community in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nYet, the abhorrent policy of apartheid is still a grim reality in South Africa. The international community has so far been unable to put an end to this crime, which is being perpetrated against the very conscience of mankind and which constitutes a challenge to the authority of the United Nations. Condemnations have been voiced from all parts of the world, but concrete actions, expressly provided for in the Charter, remain un-adopted owing to the lack of unanimity among the permanent members of the Security Council. It is to be hoped that as a result of the new spirit that has recently emerged to play an effective and decisive role in solving problems f the Security Council and, in particular, its permanent members, will find a way to reach agreement on specific action in conformity with the Charter that will finally put an end to the intolerable situation in South Africa.\nThe situation in South Africa is one of those cases which I had in mind when, earlier in my statement, I spoke of the need to do away with the ill concept of double standards. This clearly relates both to obstacles to the adoption of resolutions by the Security Council in certain cases, and in other cases to the non-implementation of resolutions adopted, sometimes unanimously. A glaring example of the latter is the situation in Namibia, a problem that could easily be solved if the pertinent resolutions of the Security Council were to be strictly implemented. And again, it is the primary responsibility of the permanent members of the Security Council to see to it that this is done.\nIn the Middle East, the Palestine people, led by the Palestine Liberation Organization, continues to struggle for its inalienable rights. Despite the adoption of so many resolutions by the United Nations, the Palestinian people are still being denied its inalienable rights, including the right to establish their own independent State. It is again high time for the permanent members of the Security Council and, as in all other cases, the super-Powers in particular to take the political decision to work together for the resolution of this problem, which lies at the heart of the entire Middle East problem and which continues to present a real threat to international peace and security. Let those who have the power to resolve the problem reflect on the bloodshed and misery inflicted on the peoples of the countries involved, including Lebanon, where the situation has reached the dimensions of a real tragedy threatening the territorial integrity and unity of that friendly country. With regard to the situation in the Middle East, we fully support the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization. \nAs for Central America, we welcome and support the agreement reached recently in Guatemala among the Presidents of the countries of the region. We also fully support the efforts of the Contadora and Support Groups in seeking permanent peace and stability in this troubled region. But again it must be stressed1 that if that is to be achieved, the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States in the area and of non-intervention and non-interference, provided for in the Charter, should be strictly observed.\nMuch has already been said in this Assembly regarding the war between Iran and Iraq and the explosive situation in the Gulf. We must all render our support to the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his efforts in this respect and we hope and trust that the involvement of the Security Council will lead the way to the restoration of peace and security in the area.\t.\nIn referring to pertinent resolutions of the Security Council, regarding various issues some speakers from this rostrum stressed the mandatory nature of the resolutions of the Security Council. They went even further to remind representatives of the relevant provisions of the Charter providing for specific measures in case of anyone's failure to comply with those resolutions. I could not think of a more appropriate way to commence my remarks with regard to the Cyprus problem. It is exactly because the resolutions of the United Nations in general and of the Security Council in particular have been completely ignored by Turkey, that the Cyprus problem still remains unresolved. And it is because Turkey does not feel the need to respect these resolutions that it has yet to abandon its expansionist and partitionist designs against Cyprus. It is high time for Turkey to be reminded in a convincing manner of the mandatory nature of the Security Council resolutions and of the relevant provisions of the Charter in case of failure to conform with those resolutions.\nThirteen years have gone by since the invasion and occupation of 37 per cent of our territory by Turkey. A number of resolutions and decisions of the United Nations demanded the withdrawal of the occupation troops, respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus, the return of the refugees to their homes under conditions of safety, the cessation of the destruction of the cultural heritage of Cyprus by Turkey, the restitution of human rights to all Cypriots, the speedy tracing of the missing persons, and the reversal of all actions aimed at the secession of the occupied part and consolidation of the division. Contrary to the demands of the international community, the Cyprus problem has not yet been solved and Turkey continues to pursue the same expansionist and partitionist policy, contemptuously ignoring the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations.\nOn our part, we did whatever we could to facilitate a solution by offering a series of very serious concessions \u2014 concessions that I do not believe any Government of any other country represented in this Assembly would have offered in similar circumstances. Yet the Cyprus problem has not been solved. We have known from the beginning, and we have been trying hard to point out everywhere f that the Cyprus problem is not primarily a constitutional one. It is basically a problem of invasion and occupation, of foreign intervention, of colonization of the occupied part by settlers from Turkey and of an attempt to destroy the culture and civilization of the country for the first time in its history of thousands of years. It is a problem of flagrant violation by Turkey of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Cypriot people. It is a problem of expansionism on the part of a strong neighbour - perhaps, as might be proved, not only at the expense of Cyprus but also at the expense of Greece and possibly other countries in the area. It is a problem arising from the attempts to impose upon us a solution that would enhance those expansionist designs. It is high time for the Cyprus problem to be tackled at its root through the promotion and implementation of the provisions of the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, which contain all the necessary elements for solving the basic aspects of the Cyprus problem.\nThere has been a tendency, in the light of the difficulties created by the intransigence of Turkey, either to avoid or to postpone the tackling of the substance of the Cyprus problem. I believe all will agree with me that no problem can be solved by avoiding or postponing the tackling of its substance. The method of avoiding the real issue has not worked. It could not have worked in any case, nor is it fair and realistic to rely for a solution on the weakness of one side and consequently exert pressure on that side instead of pressuring the country that is acting contrary to the principles set forth in the Charter and to the resolutions of the United Nations. \nThose who can help to find a solution to the Cyprus problem and are in a position to play a significant role in this respect must not limit their interest to determining when the Cyprus problem will be solved but should concentrate rather on how the Cyprus problem should be solved. The time factor is of course important, but far more important is the substance of the solution. Not only must the solution be based on the principles and provisions of the Charter and on the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations, but also it must not be the starting-point for a new Cyprus crisis in the future, worse perhaps than any previous one, with serious consequences beyond Cyprus that may threaten peace and security in the area. This is why the basic aspects of the Cyprus problem and prerequisites of its solution - namely the absolute necessity of the withdrawal of Turkish troops and colonist settlers from Cyprus, the safeguarding in practice of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all the Cypriot people and the ensuring of effective international guarantees for the security and future of the country - must be tackled as a matter of priority, otherwise the present unjust and dangerous situation will continue, to the detriment of Cyprus and its people as a whole, irrespective of ethnic origin. In addition, no one should underestimate the potential danger involved in the perpetuation of the current situation nor should anyone be misled by the fact that there has been no bloodshed for some time.\nWe strongly and sincerely believe that if the basic aspects of the Cyprus problem are settled it will not be at all difficult to reach an overall solution, of the kind that will ensure lasting peace in Cyprus. It is in this spirit that we shall continue in good faith to co-operate with the Secretary-General. And it is in the same spirit that we have proposed the holding of an international conference to deal with the international aspects of the Cyprus problem. \nWhen we speak of an international conference we mean in essence a conference of the members of the Security Council for the purpose of promoting the implementation of their own resolutions. The reason we are asking for the convening of an international conference - and I say this in reply to those who object to this proposal - is not to make it easier for any of the big Powers to gain points or advantages/ but because we consider it a realistic approach that would strengthen the role and efforts of both the Security Council and the Secretary-General. I suppose it is for the same reason that there is now such wide agreement on the holding of an international conference on the Middle East situation.\nI should like now to refer specifically to the presence in Cyprus of the Turkish occupation troops, whose number has risen to about 35,000, and to the colonist settlers from Turkey, whose number is now estimated at about 65,000. Incidentally, when I speak of the colonist settlers, I must say - and I know that representatives have heard of this - that the Turkish Government has often described them as seasonal workers: 65,000 \\\"seasonal workers\\\", who have formed their own political party on which the present illegal regime depends; \\\"seasonal workers\\\" to whom the land and property of those uprooted from their homes has been distributed; \\\"seasonal workers\\\" who have illegally been given citizenship by the illegal regime. But such lies are not unprecedented in the case of Turkey. I would remind representatives that Turkey described the invasion in 1974, 13 years ago, as \\\"a limited police operation\\\".\nIn addition to the increase in the number of the Turkish occupation troops, there has been a continuous and considerable strengthening of those troops in tetras of military equipment, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and all this despite repeated United Nations resolutions. \nTurkey is a strong Power and Cyprus is a very small, weak country. The geographic proximity is such that realistically, it means that Cyprus will always live in dangerous conditions. Yet we have offered - and I renewed that offer yesterday during my meeting with the Secretary-General - to dismantle our own defences and dissolve our own National Guard, if all Turkish troops and other personnel, including the settlers from Turkey, are withdrawn from Cyprus, so that he Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots can settle their internal problems in conditions of peace, without foreign interference\u00b7 Part of my proposal is also the establishment of an international peace force under United Nations auspices, whose imposition and terms of reference would be agreed and endorsed by the Security Council, for the purpose of strengthening the sense of security internally. It goes without saying that, together with the withdrawal of the Turkish troops and settlers, the so-called Turkish Cypriot army must also be dismantled and 3issolved\u00b7 In fact, ray proposal means the total demilitarisation of the Republic 3f Cyprus, with the exception of the international peace force envisaged in my proposal and a reasonably small mixed local police force.\nIt is of course obvious that in such circumstances sufficient international guarantees must be ensured to protect Cyprus from any outside danger or threat. I urge not only the Secretary-General but all members of the Security Council and of the General Assembly to study this proposal carefully and contribute positively to its adoption and implementation\u00b7 If Turkey decides to abandon its expansionist designs, no one can see any reason why this practical, pacific, realistic and far-reaching proposal cannot be accepted. This proposal will not only contribute decisively to an overall and lasting solution of the Cyprus problem but also remove a potential threat to peace and security in that dangerous and sensitive area of the world. A similar proposal has been put forward by the Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Andreas Papandreou, in which, inter alia, he states Greece's readiness to bear a significant part of the financial cost of the international peace force envisaged in the proposal. Cyprus too, despite its limited possibilities, is ready to contribute substantially to meeting the cost.\nAnother request to the Secretary-General which I renewed in the course of our meeting yesterday relates to the specific issue of the city of Varosha. I asked the Secretary-General once again to demand that the occupying Power, Turkey, hand over the city of Varosha to the United Nations for resettlement by its rightful inhabitants, in compliance with the specific provision contained in the Security Council's mandatory resolution 550 (1984). Such a move would improve the climate and constitute a first step in the right direction.\nDuring my meeting yesterday with the Secretary-General I also expressed to him my deep anxiety and concern at the fact that despite our efforts and goodwill no progress has yet been made to ascertain the fate of missing persons and urged him to take all the additional steps necessary to tackle without any further delay this purely humanitarian problem. It is inconceivable that Turkey should be permitted to continue to behave in such a negative manner on such an obviously humanitarian issue. Likewise, I stressed once again the need for the protection of those in the enclave of the occupied area of Cyprus and for renewed efforts to implement the relevant agreement reached in Vienna in 1975, which has been systematically violated - like all the other agreements - by the Turkish side.\nThe Cyprus problem is not a dispute between East and West. Yet, I strongly believe that co-operation between the super-Powers, as in the case of other regional problems, as long as that co-operation is based on the United Nations Charter and resolutions, will contribute decisively to a just, viable and workable solution to the Cyprus problem that will ensure lasting peace, freedom, justice and happiness for all the inhabitants of our small country, irrespective of ethnic origin, as well as to peace and security in the area.\nWe hope and trust that the General Assembly - which has been requested to consider the Cyprus problem once again after an interlude of four years marked not only by a lack of any substantive progress but also by a series of new provocative acts by Turkey - will help us in our endeavours, which, after all, are aimed at objectives that are in complete accord with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. But let me stress once again that we do not have the right, nor are we prepared, to abandon those objectives, on the attainment of which the very survival of our people and of Cyprus as an independent and free country entirely depends.\nIt is high time for the international community as a whole, and in particular those that are in the best position to help, to make Turkey feel the need to abandon its expansionist and partitionist designs against Cyprus. It is high time for Turkey to be made to feel that it cannot continue to ignore and disregard the provisions of the United Nations Charter and resolutions. It is high time for Turkey to be made to understand and realize the mandatory and binding nature of Security Council resolutions It is high time for Turkey to be made to feel the need to abide by the rules of international law.\nWe are entering a new era in which it would be unthinkable to permit anyone, irrespective of who it might be, to upset, undermine and sabotage the efforts to achieve peace, security and justice in any part of the world. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt is with great pleasure that I congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. It is an expression of esteem for your country. We wish you luck and success in carrying out your important task. I also wish to convey my sincere thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Humayum Rasheed Choudhury, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, for the leadership that he showed on so many occasions during the forty-first session of the General Assembly.\nLet me, further pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. P\u00e9rez de Cuellar, for his untiring efforts to promote peace and international co-operation. We thank him for his dedicated work to improve the effectiveness of our Organization.\nIn the Charter of the United Nations our solemn obligation \\\"to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\\\" is enshrined as a matter of utmost importance. Thus, already in its preamble, the United Nations Charter reflects mankind's basic aspiration for personal liberty and economic prosperity, safeguarded by a network of social security.\nOne of the most important tasks with which the international community is confronted is the elaboration of concepts of disarmament that are both ambitious and realistic. Multilateral disarmament negotiations are a necessary complement: to the negotiations between the most powerful States.\nAssessment of the result of the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development might vary from State to State. Austria agrees with the conclusion reached by the Conference that disarmament and development are among the priority concerns of the international community and are pillars on which enduring international peace and security must be built.\nThe recent agreement in principle reached by the Foreign Ministers of the United States and the Soviet Union on the complete elimination of intermediate-range nuclear forces augurs well not only for the relations between East and West but for the entire world community.\nWe welcome this agreement as a first step in the right direction. If it is to lead to more stability, it will have to be followed by substantial reductions in conventional armaments and by the total elimination of chemical weapons. We also regard the early conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty as a vital measure to inhibit the further vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons. \nA few days ago the fourth negotiating session of the follow-up meeting to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) was opened in Vienna. The Conference has thus entered the decisive stage.\nThe Conference must now transform the more than 150 proposals into a concluding document which contributes to the full implementation of the Helsinki commitments and serves as a blueprint for a renewed and genuine European detente policy.\nWe expect substantive progress in removing the barriers which, contrary to the Final Act of Helsinki, still inhibit contacts, communication and the free flow of information between the people of East and West. Only when people in all participating States enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedoms, only if they can come together and communicate freely, will we have achieved our goal; a genuine and lasting European peace order.\nIn spite of positive tendencies in some important areas of international co-operation, multiple crises and armed conflicts remain unsolved.\nThe war between Iraq and Iran has caused immense suffering. Yet the fighting goes on unabated in defiance of numerous calls to end hostilities. The unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) expresses clearly the demand of the world community for an immediate cease-fire. Austria fully associates itself with that resolution. The efforts of the Secretary-General to bring about a just and honourable end to this war deserve our full support. The Austrian Government considers his role in this regard to be of particular relevance. We join those who have called on both parties to show the greatest flexibility in the search for a negotiated solution of the conflict.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to pose one of the most serious threats to global peace and security. We note with satisfaction that the idea of convening an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations is gaining increased international support. We consider the following elements essential to a solution of the Middle East conflict:\nObservance of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which still provide the most widely accepted basis for a solution; withdrawal from occupied territories; respect for the right of all States to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries; and recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people and participation by its representative, the PLO, in the entire negotiating process.\nWe remain deeply concerned about the continuing occupation of Afghanistan and the violation of its sovereignty. The tremendous suffering of the Afghan population, whether inside the country or in refugee camps, must not be forgotten. We have taken note of certain steps of the recent policy of national reconciliation, as well as the invitation of the Special Rapporteur, Mr. Brnacora, on the question of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Afghanistan. These first signs should be followed by more decisive measures leading to a full and free exercise of the right to self-determination of the Afghan people as a whole.\nThe foreign occupation of Kampuchea is also a cause for continuous and serious concern for my country. Recently a number of diplomatic moves have been undertaken with a view to breaking the present deadlock. Austria has followed these developments with keen interest. We will carefully examine all ideas and proposals aimed at promoting a peaceful solution with a view to identifying possible Austrian contributions.\nI sincerely hope that a negotiated political settlement, which should be based on the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the International Conference on Kampuchea and which has to be acceptable to all sides, can be reached and that the suffering of the Kampuchean people can come, at long last, to an end. Austria calls upon all parties concerned to demonstrate the necessary political will to overcome remaining obstacles in order to engage in a genuine process of negotiation.\nCentral America has been a hotbed of tension for a number of years, we welcome the signing of the Arias Plan by five Central American countries as a useful step towards peace and stability in this region, Austria supports this regional plan for peace and democracy, based on respect for human rights, Internal political dialogue, national reconciliation and non-intervention. Only pluralistic democratic societies closely co-operating in the spirit of good-neighbourliness can successfully address the underlying social and economic problems of the region. There is an historic chance for the nations of Central America. This chance must be seized.\nAustria remains fully committed to the cause of freedom and dignity for the people of southern Africa, Austria strongly rejects and firmly condemns apartheid, a policy that negates the very foundation of civilization: dignity of roan. We are convinced that only the eradication of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic, United and non-racist society, based on the free exercise of universal suffrage, can lead to a peaceful solution of the deeply rooted problems of South Africa and bring peace to the whole region. This means, of course, also the realization of independence for Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) .\nAustria started to contribute actively to the aims of the United Nations immediately after being admitted as a Member State in 1955. In his first statement: before this Organization, the then Austrian Foreign Minister, Leopold Pigi stated that: Neutrality would keep us free from military alliances and that intensive co-operation in the framework of the international community of nations, with all means at our disposal, would contribute to maintain international peace.\nIn practice these guiding principles represent the corner-stone of our permanent neutrality and at the same time the expression of our active participation in international co-operation based on the principles of the United Nations Charter.\nOne of the most respected applications of these principles are the peace-keeping operations. Peace-keeping operations have proved to be an effective instrument for the stabilization of dangerous conflicts, a service to which Austria contributes in the interest of the international community as a whole. Since 1964 well over 20,000 Austrian soldiers have served in United Nations peace-keeping operations. At present more than 850 Austrian soldiers are serving on the Golan Heights, in Cyprus and at various locations in the Middle East. I am pleased to be able to inform the General Assembly that the Austrian Government has only recently decided to respond favourably to a request by the Secretary-General to Increase its contingent in the United Nations Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus (UNPICYP) by another 100 soldiers at the end of October.\nTroop contributors to UNPICYP are bearing a heavy and disproportionate financial burden. I hope very much that the proposal of the Secretary-General for a partial solution of this problem, namely the financing of UNPICYP through assessed contributions, will be accepted by the members of the Security Council at the earliest possible date. Pending such a decision, we appeal to all Member States to increase their voluntary contributions to this Important peace-keeping operation. Developing and strengthening contacts and co-operation with all its neighbouring countries regardless of their political system is a central element of Austria's foreign policy. Close ties, not only between governments but also between individuals, are the beet guarantee for fruitful and stable relations. Austria therefore continues to diversify co-operation with all neighbouring countries regardless of their political system.\nAllow me to add a few words on our relations with Italy. The good and friendly  relations with this important neighbouring country were developed even further in recent years. This has been fully confirmed to me at an unofficial meeting by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Giulio Andreotti in June 1987, I should like to stress that in this context the question of South Tyrol is of special importance. In 1960 and 1961 the General Assembly adopted resolutions which, in 1969, led to an agreement between Austria and Italy on a new framework for the autonomy of South Tyrol. Notwithstanding the important progress realized since then, some essential provisions of the autonomy measures have yet to be implemented. This holds true especially for a centrepiece of autonomy, the use of the German language in court as well as before police and administrative authorities. We regret that, in spite of a basic agreement reached in May 1983 between representatives of the Italian Government and the German-speaking minority, and in spite of a political compromise arrived at in September 1986, this very important provision has not yet been enacted.\nAustria shares the ongoing and justified concern of the population of South Tyrol. We believe that any further delay in the implementation of the Autonomy Statute agreed on in 1969 carries the danger of increasing radical tendencies and ethnic tensions in South Tyrol, as has been reflected in recent election results. We hold that it is high time for a speedy completion of the implementation of the Autonomy Statute in order fully to implement the rights of the ethnic minorities and to guarantee that the ethnic groups in South Tyrol live together peacefully.\nThe world economic situation in recent years has been characterized by a continuing debt burden for many developing countries, increasing protectionist tendencies, a decline in real-commodity prices and slow growth in general, although a number of countries have achieved remarkable performances. On the other hand, several of the poorest countries suffered further losses in their per capita income.\nThe present weak international economic environment hardly promotes innovative and liberal tendencies, but, rather, protectionism and structural immobility. Multilateral economic co-operation is thus endangered by bilateralist forces or unilateral action. Last year a successful special session of the General Assembly devoted to the economic crisis in Africa  the first ever to focus on problems of a whole continent, adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  Determined efforts to speed up that Programme are essential to alleviate the economic plight of many sub\u2014Saharan African countries.\nEven after the encouraging results of the special session on Africa and the successful launching of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, there was still widespread doubt and scepticism about the outcome of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). However, the adoption by consensus of the final act of UNCTAD VII within an atmosphere of pragmatism and constructive co-operation heralds a major achievement.\nEconomic progress is not an end in itself. It has to serve the individual. Improving the quality of life and allowing man the pursuit of happiness is not only a matter of growth rates. It is equally important to solve our pressing environmental problems.\nSerious incidents and shocking research results have induced growing public awareness that the ongoing degradation of our environment affects all nations. International co-operation to counteract this danger is urgently called for.\nThe depletion of the ozone layer poses an increasing threat of global climatic change. Austria has taken a leading role in endeavours to achieve international countermeasures in this regard. The early entry into force of the Vienna convention on the protection of the ozone layer and the further development of international environmental law must be pursued with high priority.\nNuclear radiation, like other forms of pollution, does not stop at national borders. Therefore, Austria firmly believes that the legitimate interests of countries that could be affected by the trans boundary effects of the use of nuclei energy have to be taken into account. Accordingly, Austria attributes particular importance to the conclusion of bilateral agreements with all its neighbouring countries in this field. We recognize the achievements in the process of multilateral codification realized within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Austria none the less advocates the elaboration of additional international rules in such areas as State liability and binding international safety standards for nuclear-power plants.\nSome environmental problems, like long-range trans boundary air pollution, can be successfully addressed on a regional level. For my region, the Economic Commission for Europe (\u0415\u0421\u0415) has become the most important framework in that respect. Austria, together with countries from different regional groups, has submitted proposals in the context of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) with a view to enlarging and deepening the relevant activities of the \u0415\u0421\u0415.\t'\nMy country highly values the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, under the chairmanship of Norway's Prime Minister Brundtland. It is indeed impossible to separate environmental aspects from economic and development issues. We agree with the Commission's conclusion that, if we do not succeed in embarking on a policy of sustainable development, we do in fact erode the basis for our common future. The tragic effects of deforestation prove that once nature's balance is distorted the vicious circle can be broken only with difficulty.\nDevelopment strategies - and, indeed, any economic policy - have to take duly into account all possible environmental implications. The ecological dimensions have to be considered on an equal footing with strictly economic factors, from the formulation to the evaluation of every single project.\nThe Charter of the United Nations contains the obligation of all States to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. \nSocial policy must be among out central concerns during the coming decades. Clear policy guidelines will have to be established and the solution of economic and development problems seen in close relation to social policies and social welfare. Social progress, the advancement of women, questions relating to youth, the elderly or disabled, control of crime and drug abuse are among the most urgent topics in the area of social concern.\nThe International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking held in June at Vienna constitutes a very promising start to combating drug abuse and solving related social and economic questions in a constructive and coherent manner. A well-co-ordinated follow-up on national and international levels, as well as within the United Nations system, is of utmost importance. The Interregional Consultations on Developmental Social Welfare Policies and identified priorities for strengthening co-operation in social welfare\nidentified procedures to facilitate international co-operation in the Lamentation of norms in this area. We welcome the growing awareness of global social dimensions in the international community.\nRecognizing the increasing importance of strengthening and consolidating the role of the United Nations in the social field, the Secretary-General has taken measures to concentrate all major activities on questions of broad social policy social development, including the co-ordination of illicit-drug control, within the United Nations offices in Vienna. We warmly welcome this Liaison in the light of the recommendations of the Group of High-Level governmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Functioning of the United Nations.\nIn his annual report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General has identified a \\\"growing commonality factor in international affairs\\\". (A/42/1, p.2)\nMy colleague the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany, Genscher, has spoken in this context of \\\"an age of global domestic policy\\\". \u00cd2/PV.10, p.47)\nThe recognition of the increased level of interdependence in all fields calls an improved capacity of the Organization to assure an efficient collective response to emerging world issues.\nA reform process is thus not only necessary to improve the organizational response and global management capacity, but also to restore full confidence in the United Nations. The reform process has started; the Secretary-General has taken the first steps. But reform is an ongoing and continuous process, for which the Member States and the leadership o\u00a3 the individual organizations of the United Nations system are equally responsible.\nWe are encouraged by the fact that so far we have been able to proceed on the basis of consensus, a path that should be vigorously pursued in the interests of the Organization.\nWe welcome in this regard the proposal of the Secretary-General to revitalize the Economic and Social Council, to enable it to fulfil its original mandate. The proposal that the \\\"Council might become, in practice, a Council of Ministers foe Economic and Social Affairs\\\" with authority to give \\\"greater strength and coherence to the system as a whole\\\" (\u0100/42/1, p.15) is of great validity. We believe, however, that adequate organizational arrangements and preparations will have to be made to guarantee the maximum effectiveness of such high level meetings.\nAustria equally welcomes contributions to the reform process from the outside. In this regard, the recent study by a panel of eminent personalities on United Nations reform, sponsored by the Ford Foundation and the United Nations Association of the United States, deserves our full attention. That and similar research work testify to the general growing interest and commitment to a strong United Nations.\nTwo years ago, in the context of International Youth Year, Austria launched an initiative to promote youth employment. We called it \\\"HOPE '87\\\". Austria, together with the United Nations, organized a world-wide competition of more than 500 original employment projects run by young people. During this session of the Assembly my country will present an exhibition and a film about this initiative and the intended follow-up. We very much count on the continued support of Members for the ideas and aims of this initiative, which nave already given new hope to many young people from all over the world. Hope should not only be given to youth, but to all those people suffering from violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In this regard, over the last 40 years the United Nations has developed an impressive body of legal instruments. However, negative phenomena such as arbitrary executions, torture, the denial of fundamental rights, racism and intolerance still prevail in many parts of the world.\nLet us intensify our co-operation to ensure that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are universally guaranteed and respected. We should support, in particular, all efforts to strengthen the implementation machinery of the numerous international instruments that already exist in the field of human rights. Only on the basis of the conviction that human rights are of truly universal concern will we be able to fulfil our duties in this regard, duties which have the individual human being, his rights and his dignity, at their very heart.\nThe resolution of regional conflicts, the strengthening of international partnership, the reform of international institutions and the preservation of the environment all seem to have one particular element in common: the need for a comprehensive legal framework. The development of this framework could not have been possible without the United Nations. We must all continue to contribute actively to endeavours to find solutions based on international law for the challenges of today and tomorrow.\nAmong these challenges we find a particularly odious phenomenon: international terrorism. There can be no exculpation whatsoever for those who endanger and destroy human lives, irrespective of their motives. The international community took an important step to fight this scourge by adopting a resolution by consensus two years ago. We sincerely hope that that consensus will prevail also during the current session of the General Assembly. A further intensification of international co-operation to combat terrorism - including the elaboration of new legal instruments - remains an absolute necessity. Austria is committed to join in this urgent and important task.\nInternational relations must remain firmly based on international law. International law can only represent a foundation for the behaviour of States if it is scrupulously respected. In many cases, it is not an international legal instrument but its implementation which is lacking. One field where this gap between norm and reality seems particularly wide is the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nBefore concluding, I should like to share a few thoughts. My delegation was impressed by the statement of the President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Mr. Choudhuty. Mindful of financial constraints, in his speech before this forum he concentrated on only a few thoughts, while distributing in writing Bangladesh's position on other important world matters. Perhaps that example could be followed by all of us in the future. The distribution of the written texts would ensure that the positions of all Member States on the various subjects would still be made known and would receive due attention. Then, general debates in the plenary Assembly could be structured in such a way as to permit a genuine general debate among political leaders o\u00a3 Member States.\nAustria believes in a strong United Nations; a United Nations that in the self-interest of its Member States will be able to bring about a greater consensus on the solution of existing and the definition of newly emerging problems. It is time to enter the age of global domestic policy. We are called upon to put our thoughts and imagination, our creativity and vision, our sense of pragmatism and realism, to this vital task.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President on behalf of the Government of Mexico, I should like to congratulate you on your well-deserved election. I should like also to assure you of my delegation's willingness to contribute to the success of your presidency. Your competence and experience are a guarantee that we shall achieve our aim.\nAllow me also to reiterate Mexico's support to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. The initiative that he undertook last November, together with the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States (OAS) , regarding the Central American conflict, as well as his recent mediation between Iran and Iraq, are proof of his unswerving commitment to the cause of peace.\nThis illustrious Peruvian diplomat has been entrusted with conducting the work of the United Nations at a particularly difficult time, when doubts are being expressed concerning the effectiveness of multilateralism and even the very validity of the precepts upon which the world Organization is based. In his arduous tasks he has the backing of Latin America and the developing countries. This solidarity is part of a larger contribution the aim of which is to establish an international system based on genuine co-operation among all States.\nA year ago from this rostrum, President Miguel de la Madrid emphatically stated Mexico's unswerving commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. That declaration faithfully reflects the strength of our foreign policy commitment in subscribing to the norms that lay the foundations for peaceful coexistence of all peoples based on respect and solidarity. They constitute the backbone of Mexico's international conduct. For Mexico, compliance with law and respect for the essential rules of international coexistence are basic elements of its foreign policy. It is not a matter of merely postulating universal values in the abstract, but of sustaining principles that are necessary for the preservation of national sovereignty - that is, rules of behaviour that have acquired a special meaning for us within our social system and history and are at the core of our nation's values.\nEthics and law as applied to political action necessarily lead to a search for just agreements in international relations that eliminate confrontations among States; to the establishment of dialogue in which there is real communication  to the achievement, through active and flexible diplomacy, of the conciliation of opposing interests, and to the curbing of the arrogance of the powerful - in a word, to the promotion of international co-operation as the basis for a peaceful coexistence based on justice and equality. Mexico repudiates all forms of intervention wherever they occur. By defending this principle we protect our own interests and thus ensure against interference in our nation's affairs. By upholding the self-determination of peoples we avoid the temptation of limiting our own sovereignty or imposing upon ourselves political models alien to us. We insist also on the peaceful solution of disputes to ensure that the community of States submits to legal order and abandons the tendency towards the use of force, power and arbitrariness in international relations.\nThese tenets, the application of which we have demanded without distinction, are not ours alone but a fundamental part of modern international law. Their enforcement protects the legitimate interests of the community of States in general. Hence my country's unswerving support for the work of the United Nations, which embodies the shared ideal of strict observance of the legal order.\nThe consistency of Mexico's foreign policy with these unchanging principles explains the policy of the Mexican Government, and the other member countries of the Contadora and Support Groups with regard to the Central American conflict. It should be recalled that in January 1983 there was a climate of confrontation and distrust in the isthmus, where mounting political tensions and the militarization of the region were the harbinger of an imminent conflagration.\nThe Contadora Group emerged as an example of mediation in good faith with the will to co-operate with the Central American Governments so that seemingly insurmountable antagonisms could be channelled through negotiations. We have worked towards dialogue and reconciliation among the parties to restore a climate of political trust and thus overcome the danger of armed confrontation and intervention, seeking a fair balance with regard to the political interests of the States of the area. \n\nThe activities of the Contadora Group do not respond only to a generic imperative or the memory of foreign interference and internal and international armed conflicts that have distorted the organic development of the Central American nations. We are trying, by promoting the diplomatic settlement of disputes, slowing the arms build-up and negotiating the economic and social development of the region, to avoid the extension of confrontation and guarantee the legitimate national interests of each of the Contadora countries, while protecting the political stability of Latin America.\nThe violation of the legal order in the isthmus undermines the possibility of claiming one's rights. The arms race and the state of war force the conflicting parties to allocate ridiculous amounts of investments to defence. The displacement of refugees also contribute to the creation of social tension. Recent history shows, too, that regional conflicts, limited at the start, can spread beyond the original area to neighbouring regions. It is essential that our nations prevent war and find a just, comprehensive solution to Central American problems. This is a task that cannot be postponed.\nIn Central America there are two opposing interpretations of the world, different political ideas and contradictory feelings about Latin American history and the means of contributing to the settlement of international conflicts.\nThe first adheres to a system of areas of influence that even in contemporary strategic terms seems obsolete and that would make force the main motivation for the conduct of States. This approach promotes war as an instrument for hegemonic affirmation and denies the pluralism of our peoples for the benefit of a supposed national security. At the same time, it deepens contradictions within the s, societies, which it claims have political freedom, preventing them from developing their own institutions and denying them the opportunity to make their own decisions. The second sees politics as a privileged means of making history. It discusses antagonisms at the negotiating table and tries to resolve them through diplomacy. It believes that the peaceful solution of the Central American controversy is in both the short and the long term in the abiding interests of all the countries of the region. This interpretation upholds the basic tenets of Western moral and intellectual traditions - that is, a social and international order which is based on reason, that identifies human progress with intelligence and creativity and that stems from the indissoluble link between political practice and ethical principles - and affirms the concept of man as a potential for irreversible freedom.\nFor more than four years now we have persevered in an effort to guide the Central American conflict in accordance with this political logic. We are gratified that those actions contributed to the peace agreement signed in Guatemala last August by the Presidents of the Central American countries.\nThose agreements mark a new stage in the life of the region and reflect the fundamental commitments of those of us Who have struggled to carry out our task of mediation: national reconciliation through dialogue and political action; pluralistic democracy that guarantees human rights and promotes social justice; free exercise of the right of self-determination; the cessation of support for irregular forces and the corresponding obligation to refrain from the use of one's own territory for the illegal activities of those groups; and a decision to continue negotiations on security and arms limitation - in short, to foster international co-operation in meeting the most urgent economic needs of the societies of the region.\nI reiterate the Mexican Government's satisfaction at the signing of the Guatemala agreement and its readiness to participate, together with the Contadora and Support Groups and the Secretaries-General of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the United Nations, in the International Verification and follow-up Commission to give effect to the obligations assumed by the Central American Governments. I reiterate also our determination to contribute, in association with the member States of the international community, to the fulfilment of a reconstruction project to increase substantially economic co-operation between the five countries of the area.\nUndoubtedly the Governments of Central America have shouldered their responsibility. We now need the international community's respect and assistance. Other States, especially those with interests and ties in the region, now have an obligation to co-operate with specific action in ensuring the realization of the aspirations to reconciliation of the Central American countries.\nLatin America is today confronting the most serious economic crisis in its contemporary history. An adverse international atmosphere combined with age-old deficiencies in the region's production infrastructure has created stagnation with inflation and a decline in the standard of living of its communities and has reduced the possibilities of progress and development in the region. It cannot be denied that in great measure the crisis has its origins in outside factors beyond the control of our Governments. A series of international circumstances combined to transform us into net capital exporters. Interest rates at unprecedented high levels, continued lowering of commodity prices and growing protectionism in the industrialized countries.\nThe countries of Latin America have made an enormous internal effort to adjust our economies and face the debt-servicing problem. Even so, the region as a whole has not been able to achieve its necessary development objectives.\nWe have noted with concern the direction that the industrialized countries wish to give to the plans to resolve the crisis. The proposed programme does not contribute to the design of an international co-operation system based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, nor does it help distribute the developing countries' burden of adjustment or reactivate in a symmetrical and balanced manner the functioning of the international economy as a whole.\nIn fact, when the allocation of financial flows is tied to programmes of commercial liberalization, for the purpose of providing resources in debt restructuring negotiations and obtaining new capital, the international financial organisms discredit the very foundations of the multilateral trade system non-discrimination and most-favoured-nation treatment. Thus the developing countries' possibilities of promoting greater access by their exports to the international market based on centralized negotiations in a preferential system that compensates for disadvantages, are diminished.\nIf to this is added the growing recourse by industrialized countries to the imposition of new conditions for access to their markets, demanding the opening up of the service and high technology sectors, direct investment and a stricter interpretation of the norms that govern intellectual property, the conclusion must be that the developing countries are seeing the advent of a new plan for an international economy that does not necessarily meet their interests.\nLatin America has chosen to face these challenges by strengthening and widening its consultation, co-operation and co-ordination mechanisms to achieve greater participation in the negotiation and operation of the international economic system. Through regional economic organisms and special mechanisms such as the Cartagena Consensus and the Group of Eight, we intend to strengthen the structure of an international economic order that will contribute to establishing a more solid basis for the collective self-sufficiency of the developing countries.\nThe regional action does not adversely affect the search for new understandings among the developing countries designed to strengthen their collective action with regard to world economy. The new directions that are proposed in the fields of currency, finance and trade necessitate attempts to reach a new consensus and new negotiating strategies so as to regain the initiative in the process of changing the international economic system.\nThe magnitude of the challenge demands United, logical action by all the developing countries, focusing on international co-operation that will protect their legitimate interests and prompt the industrialized countries to enter into dialogue and negotiation on all matters on the international economic agenda.\nThe question of development problems necessarily leads to that of disarmament. Only a few weeks ago we examined in this forum the undeniable link between these problems and the arms race, with the consequent diversion of funds and attention in the political and economic spheres, to the detriment of a more just distribution of wealth. We referred to the expenditure on the accumulation of arsenals and the resultant distortions in the international economic system. The existence of nuclear weapons constitutes a threat to life on this planet and, while it is true that the responsibility for eliminating the danger of a holocaust falls chiefly on the nuclear Powers, the cause of peace and disarmament is that of all States.\nThis is the purpose of the initiative of the Group of Six: the Heads of Government of Mexico, Argentina, India, Greece, Sweden and Tanzania have reclaimed our right to life. Their call to the super-Powers stresses two crucial themes: avoidance of the militarization of space and the prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. Both measures would represent a decisive political advance towards the achievement of broader agreements. I reaffirm in this forum my country's readiness to collaborate towards the eventual establishment of a verification system for a moratorium on nuclear tests.\nThree years ago when the Group of Six began its negotiations the disarmament talks between the super-Powers had been suspended. Today, fortunately, they have not only been resumed but offer promising prospects. My Government trusts that the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union will soon culminate in a treaty that eliminates short\u2014 and medium-range missiles from the planet.\nWe are pleased to see the beginning of an understanding not only to halt the development of new weapons but to eliminate an existing category of weapons. This must be only a first step towards the reduction and eventual eradication of strategic weapons.\nWe insist that nuclear disarmament is a priority, but we cannot neglect the problem of conventional armaments, the development of which complicates the stability of  the various regional conflicts, in which the super-Powers are involved and which must be resolved through dialogue and negotiation. We demand for Kampuchea and Afghanistan the same respect for the principle of non-intervention that we claim for Central America. We demand the independence of the people of Namibia and the elimination of the odious system of apartheid. On the South Atlantic, we again call for a political agreement that will protect the inalienable rights of Argentina. We emphasize that a definitive comprehensive solution to the Middle East controversies can be achieved only on the basis of respect for and compliance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nWe wish to express our special concern over the situation in the Persian Gulf. We trust that the principles of the United Nations Charter will prevail. We call on the Governments of Iran and Iraq to resolve their differences in accordance with the recent mandate of the Security Council. The mission of good offices undertaken by the Secretary-General must be recognized and supported in order that a dignified and just agreement may be achieved.\nMexico will continue to strive for the strengthening of the United Nations system and the preservation of the basic tenets of multilateral actions dialogue and the balance of interests. To that end we shall spare no effort to strengthen the institutional forums of the community of nations. We shall also continue to participate in the informal groupings of collective diplomacy whose final aim is to strengthen those tenets. Hence we shall maintain our active and responsible commitment to the political efforts of the Contadora support groups, the Cartegena Consensus and the Group of Six. Similarly, we have formed, together with Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Panama, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, a group of eight Latin American democracies to establish a permanent mechanism for consultations and concerted political action. We are making every effort to guarantee autonomy, respect and dignity for our countries and to ensure for coming generations a future of peace, freedom, democracy, economic well-being and social progress.\nNext November the Heads of State of those eight countries will meet in Mexico. Their discussions could contribute to the definition of new modalities with regard to the role of our region in world affairs. We are convinced that at that meeting new proposals will emerge in order to make of Latin America a more United region that is more at one with the interests o\u00a3 the developing world and more willing to fight for the basic principles of the international legal order.\nFrom its inception the United Nations has promoted understanding and co-operation among States and their commitment to the principles and purposes that emerged from a long, civilizing undertaking begun at the end of the cruel experience of two world wars. Its aim is basically to further multilateral co-operation in order to promote the shared progress of nations, to enhance the dignity of the human person, to promote respect for fundamental rights and, above all, to ensure permanent peace that banishes the scourge of war and its attendant suffering and devastation.\nThe drafters of the Charter were never naive enough to believe that the community of States could be built on some abstract Utopia, indifferent to the asymmetrical distribution of power. The structure given to the Security Council reveals the extent to which political realism and the need to provide the United Nations with the instruments for effective action defined the shape of the Organization - hence the powers vested in certain States regarding matters of exceptional importance, especially those concerning peace and security. It must be underlined, however, that such attributes are more a responsibility than a privilege, more an obligation for moderation and balance than the possibility of adapting international relations to unilateral interests.\nUnfortunately, those ideals of civilized political behaviour have suffered serious setbacks. Bipolarism and efforts to consolidate spheres of influence bring about alignments that render peace and progress towards international democracy more difficult. The weakening of multilateral organizations in turn erodes the fundamental norms of international law. The arms race threatens our existence and sharpens economic imbalances. Grave regional conflicts persist and could produce wider confrontations. The development needs of the vast majority of countries represented here have not been satisfied, and they require adequate and urgent attention.\nWe have not yet succeeded in imposing the rule of law over the use of force, dignity and respect over the abuse of power and the aspirations of independence and self-determination over hegemonic designs. Nor have we been able to replace efforts to dominate and exploit by those who have a concentration of resources with a world of international co-operation. No one should therefore be surprised at the recurring discouragement and scepticism regarding our Organization.\nBut it is also true that without this forum to further and regulate the international order, relations among States would be dominated by a policy of unrestricted power. Without failing to recognize the aims and limitations of the United Nations, we should rid ourselves of the notion that it has failed, for it has registered considerable success in a variety of areas of international co-operation, as we have described on past occasions. That being said, it is clear that the great tasks facing the Organization make it imperative that all Member States, without exception, fully assume their responsibilities. Improvement in international life requires our concerted political will. All nations have the obligation to make concessions in secondary matters in order to agree on fundamentals, to adopt constructive approaches in order to find practical solutions beneficial to all, to be always open to dialogue while setting aside sterile confrontations and useless recriminations, to renounce all attempts at domination and unjust privileges - in short, to strengthen our genuine solidarity.\nIn reaffirming its unwavering determination to contribute to the full attainment of these purposes - the greatest conquest of our political culture - Mexico urges Member States to persevere in the constant effort to make reason and law prevail among individuals and nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt is an honour and a privilege for me to stand here in the presence of the members of the General Assembly and especially of leaders who have placed their trust in the work of the United Nations. I share this trust with them. And so, Sir, may I offer you my congratulations on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. In my humble opinion, there is no question that your professional abilities and outstanding personal qualities will ensure the success of the work of this session and that it will yield the benefits that we may all expect from it. To that end, I assure you of the support and co-operation of my delegation.\nLet me also place on record Solomon Islands' deep appreciation of your predecessor, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, who presided over the last session in such an able and effective manner.\nTo our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, I reaffirm the gratitude of my Government and people for his dedication to the principles of our Organization and for his tireless efforts as well as his leadership in advancing the noble goals of international peace and security.\nI must at the outset take the opportunity to thank all Member States for the unanimous support which was given to resolution 41/193, on special economic assistance to Solomon Islands following cyclone Namu, which hit our islands in May 1986. My Government and people, whose warm and friendly greetings I bring to everyone here, are very grateful to each and every member. In particular, I wish to thank the co-sponsors of that resolution; Australia, Fiji, Japan, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and Vanuatu. Our deep gratitude goes also to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the good work it has been doing in our rehabilitation programme. We feel that UNDP's continuing role and assistance are crucial to the success of this programme.\nThe year 1987 has been designated as the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless. It is also the year during which the world's population will exceed the 5 billion mark. By the end of this century there is likely to be an additional billion people. The drastic reduction in death rates owing to advancements in medical science and technology, is something to be pleased about; but it is also a great cause for concern, because millions of people still live without the basic necessities of life - food, shelter and good clean water.\nPeace, we all agree, is not just the absence of war: it is the global ambience of harmony in the interrelationships of States. Peace is the kind of condition that will pave the way for improving living standards in developing countries, thereby ensuring that the world's five-billionth citizen will start the day with the most basic social services at hand. Looking back at 1986 as the International Year of Peace, have we come any closer to a full realization of this important principle of the Charter? With the passing of 1987, are we likely to see a glimpse of hope for the homeless, not only in our own countries or regions but globally as well?\nSolomon Islands is fully convinced that this glimpse of hope does not rest only on the effectiveness of modern technology or on improved agricultural productivity, important though these have been and will continue to be. Rather, the improvement of conditions for the poor and homeless rests squarely on global peace in its totality - and this includes the freedom of all peoples from the forces that hinder their self-determination and independence.\nIt is more than eight years now since the Vietnamese forces invaded and occupied Kampuchea. This act has not only caused much suffering to the Kampuchean people, but has been, and continues to be, a destabilizing factor in the South-East Asian region. Indeed it remains a threat to international peace and security. Solomon Islands continues to condemn Viet Nam for its invasion and occupation of Kampuchea. In our view, the Kampuchean problem can be settled only with the total withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces. In this respect, my Government strongly feels that the Eight-Point Proposal put forward by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea on 17 March 1986 is the best starting-point for a negotiated settlement which should set the scene for the restoration of peace, security and stability in the region, and the survival of democratic institutions in the country.\nThe situation in Afghanistan still remains another cause for concern. Here a popular resistance movement has been consistently suppressed by a super-Power. With more than 100,00\u00dc Soviet troops still in Afghanistan, we just cannot see how Afghan citizens can live normal lives, let alone determine their own destiny. Again, we earnestly urge the Soviet Union to heed the repeated calls of the \n\ninternational community to withdraw all its forces from Afghanistan and thereby give the Afghans a chance freely to choose their own system of government.\nHow long is the international community going to allow the racist regime of South Africa to haunt its conscience? How long are we going to sit by and watch our fellow human beings suffer under a regime that has not the slightest respect for human dignity? Have we not all agreed that apartheid is a mockery of justice and civilized behaviour and must therefore be eliminated? Yes, we have. It must be wiped out with a concerted action.\nIn the case of Namibia, we do not accept South Africa's insistence on linking an extraneous issue to the implementation of the United Nations plan for the peaceful transition to independence of the Territory. Both the Security Council and the General Assembly have categorically rejected this linkage as contravening the terms of Security Council resolution 435 (197B), which must remain the sole basis for resolving the Namibian problem.\nSince Pretoria has been turning a deaf ear to the call for the elimination of apartheid, we strongly feel the international community must move to apply comprehensive mandatory sanctions - a measure which is in keeping with the letter and spirit of Chapter VII of the Charter. If the litany of our exhortations is not going to bring Pretoria to any new enlightenment, then let us allow our actions henceforth to dismantle that evil system.\nPeace in the Middle East is one of the oldest and most contentious issues with which the United Nations has grappled. Solomon Islands supports the fundamental and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including their right to their own State. At the same time, we fully support the right of Israel to exist within secure and internationally recognized borders. We believe that it is only through the good will of all parties concerned to negotiate that a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the dispute can be reached. A United Nations sponsored international conference on the Middle Last would offer much to this end.\nLast month marked the eighth year of the Iran-Iraq war - a war which has now outlasted both the First and Second World Wars in its duration. Recent events have shown that a dangerous growth of tensions is also taking place in the Persian Gulf. Certainly, there is a pressing need to adopt urgent and effective measures which would promote a radical scaling down of tensions in the Gulf and the speediest ending of the Iran-Iraq war. My Government is firmly convinced that Security Council resolution 598 (19\u00d67) of 20 July 1987 provides the best framework for promoting peace, and we therefore urge both parties to comply with its terms in response to the clear call of the global community to end the war.\nIn Central America, Solomon Islands hopes that the recent regional efforts will soon yield a peaceful solution. In this context we welcome the efforts of tile Contadora Group and others to attain peace and democracy in the region.\nWith regard to the situation on the Korean peninsula, Solomon Islands continues to support the principle of the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas and that this be pursued without outside interference. It is therefore imperative that the dialogue between the two should be reopened at the earliest possible date without pre-conditions. Should South Korea and North Korea consider joining the United Nations as a step towards their reunification, Solomon Islands would welcome and support their individual membership. This would contribute to relaxing tensions while at the same time enhancing the principle of the universality of the membership of the United Nations. Since both countries are already members of a number of United Nations specialized agencies, we believe it would be in order for the Organization to admit them as Members. \nInternational terrorism is worse now than it ever has been. As in previous years, my delegation joins the universal condemnation of international terrorism and pledges to do whatever is possible within our limited means to eliminate it in all its forms and manifestations. The same must be said about drug abuse and its illegal trafficking. My Government is firmly committed to dealing severely with those who may try to introduce these practices to our islands and people. As a young democratic nation, Solomon Islands subscribes to the protection of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms. These are clearly enshrined in our national Constitution. I mention this to highlight our genuine concern over the violation of these principles in a number of countries around the globe.\nTurning now to the South Pacific region, I wish to congratulate the Assembly on its historic achievement of 2 December 1986, when it adopted resolution 41/41 A, relating to the question of New Caledonia. The debate on that resolution was most significant, because, for the first time in the history of this Organization, much attention was focused for one and a half days on the South Pacific region. To us in Solomon Islands, that event brought the United Nations closer to our region, and vice versa.\nThis is as it should be, for the South Pacific island States which are Members of the United Nations cannot continue to be passive recipients of decisions from here. We have to be active participants in the decision-making process of the Organization, because this is the only insurance we have against new outside forces and influences. I was therefore heartened to note that in late June and early July of this year Solomon Islands was included in the itinerary of the United Nations Visiting Mission looking at the performance of United Nations agencies in our region.\nWe certainly welcomed the Mission, which was led by the Permanent Representative of New Zealand, and we made our views amply clear to it. Our aim is to make United Nations agencies operating in Solomon Islands efficient and cost-effective. We will do our best to attain that objective and we expect the United Nations and its agencies to be equally responsive to our particular needs.\nThere is a growing school of thought which predicts that the Pacific Ocean is the ocean of the future. This proposition is both attractive and appealing to those of us living in that region. In my view, such a forecast is probably based on scientifically researched and proved criteria? Therefore any move to tap the resources of the region must not be left to blind chance or only to those with advanced technology. Pacific island nations must be part of the development challenge. Our regional development as well as the progress of our individual nations, however, can proceed only on the basis of a stable environment. Without that, we are more likely to suffer the loss of our dignity and self-respect as a result of increasing interest in the region shown by outsiders.\nBut the prospects for stable regional development are not good, because of such conditions as the potentially explosive situation in New Caledonia. This is why we ate deeply concerned by the stubbornness of Prance regarding the decolonization process of that Territory. This is why we have been urging the Administering Authority to co-operate with us within the framework of the established principles and practices of the United Nations.\nI should like to restate here the basic position of Solomon Islands on New Caledonia. New Caledonia is a Non-Self-Governing Territory; therefore France, as the Administering Authority, is obliged to do everything possible to bring it to self-determination and independence. Solomon Islands fully supports independence for New Caledonia and it is our desire to see this objective achieved peacefully, without further bloodshed.\nIt is our firm position that the United Nations, through its appropriate organ, must be actively involved in the decolonization process in New Caledonia. This is the only basis on which a legitimate act of self-determination should be pursued. Without such appropriate United Nations involvement, any determination by the French authorities as to the choice of the people of New Caledonia for the future status of that Territory must not be accepted as a choice which has been made through the normal democratic process of free and fair elections. The role that the Kanaks - the indigenous people of New Caledonia - must have in deciding the future of their homeland is vital to the question of independence. Of all the different ethnic groups in New Caledonia, the Kanaks make up the largest single group. Their position, as represented by the FLNKS (Front de lib\u00e9ration nationale Kanak socialiste) , which commands the majority support of the Kanaks, is clear; they want to exercise their right to self-determination and independence and they wish to do so with United Nations involvement in accordance with the established principles and practices of the Charter.\nIt is, therefore, a matter of regret that France has gone ahead with a mock referendum in total disregard of the views of the majority of the States Members of the Organization. In the circumstances, Solomon Islands does not recognize the results of that plebiscite as a genuine indication of the wish of the people of New Caledonia. Without independent observers of the referendum, those results must remain questionable in the eyes of the international community. My Government can only accept a United Nations sponsored referendum on the question of New Caledonia's independence.\nI now wish to clarify the position of my Government on the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. While the South Pacific Forum has accepted the Federated States of Micronesia and Marshall Islands as full members of the Forum, Solomon Islands does not as yet recognize them as fully independent States. The criteria for membership of the Forum are different from those governing membership of the United Nations, We consider that while the Federated States of Micronesia and Marshall Islands have both conducted genuine acts of self-determination under United Nations auspices, we still believe that until the trusteeship has been terminated by a decision of the Security Council, that trusteeship remains in force, Solomon Islands none the less respects the constitutional steps taken so at by the United States as the Administering Authority, in fulfilling its Charter obligations with respect to three of the countries of the Trust Territory of the pacific Islands.\nThe quest for peace is the concern of this Organization. Year in, year out, .n this very Hall we hear statements from this rostrum calling on us all to give peace a chance. Have we done so? In our desire for peace and a world free of nuclear weapons, Solomon Islands, in May of this year, became the eleventh signatory to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty - a Treaty to which some Powers readily acceded, while others disregarded it, but which the nations of the Pacific regard as a symbol of their contribution to peace and the safety of mankind.  \n\nMy Government is, therefore, deeply grateful to the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for signing Protocols 2 and 3 of that Treaty.\nAt the same time, we must express our disappointment that while the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland had indicated their willingness to abide informally by the provisions of the Treaty and its Protocols, they nevertheless refrained from signing them. We again call on those two Powers and on Prance to reconsider their positions with a view to signing Protocols 2 and 3 of that Treaty.\nOn the question of nuclear testing in our region France must again face international condemnation. Since Solomon Islands became a Member of this 0rgani2ation it has consistently and categorically condemned French nuclear testing on Mururoa Atoll. There is no need to elaborate on the danger of nuclear pollution. The memory of the Chernobyl disaster is still fresh in everyone's mind. It is one of those alarming events that have shocked people everywhere. Foe the people of Solomon Islands, the ocean surrounding us is our source of life. Our seas, reefs and lagoons have been and always will be our source of livelihood. Now we are worried because they are in danger of nuclear contamination.\nSolomon Islands is totally opposed to nuclear testing and the use of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific region. Despite the repeated protests of all States members of the South Pacific Forum regarding such tests, the Government of Prance defiantly continues its testing programme at Mururoa. We are not convinced at all by those who say these tests are safe, because if they are, why not conduct them on the farmlands of France?\nMy country is a nation of islands with a very narrow economic base. Our major exports are fish, palm oil and copra. Our efforts to step up production in these areas have always been hampered by natural disasters, particularly cyclones, which have, in the recent past, become so frequent in our region that they are almost part of our daily life. The resources of fisheries are very important to our economy. For that reason we subscribe strongly to the relevant provisions of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We believe the Convention provides the necessary safeguards for our fisheries and other marine resources.\nIn the exploitation of such resources, our basic objective is to gain the maximum benefit for our people, and a fair return to those who may wish to invest in these resources. For that reason, my Government welcomed the conclusion of the negotiations on the multilateral fisheries treaty between the United States of America and the countries of the South Pacific Forum.\nDespite recent events in the region, the South Pacific has been a reasonably peaceful place when compared with other parts of the world. But now, with super-Power rivalry gaining momentum, our future stability is uncertain. A small country like ours does not wish to be drawn into any super-Power confrontation. We are more interested in bettering our living standards and I therefore urge those concerned to respect and help us sustain our efforts to build our nation, rather than confuse us with power play.\nI trust that the resolution of the various issues that gravely concern this body - freedom for the colonized and the oppressed, prevention of the nuclear annihilation of mankind, peace and security in the world, shelter for the homeless, food for the starving, and a better living standard for all - will move a step closer to fulfilment in the course of this session. Then we shall have come nearer to realizing the promise; \\\"Peace on earth, good will towards men\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n I wish, Sir, to convey to you the felicitations of the people and Government of the Philippines on your unanimous election as President of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. You bring to that high office outstanding qualifications and long experience in diplomacy, particularly in the United Nations. It is therefore especially appropriate that you should be leading our deliberations in this critical period in the history of the United Nations, and it is with great confidence that we look forward to your stewardship of the General Assembly.\nI should like, at the same time, to congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, who provided able and effective leadership during the forty-first session. I wish also to pay tribute to the United Nations Secretary\u2014General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his painstaking efforts on behalf of peace in the world. His annual report highlights the major issues before the Organization and contains important recommendations which should guide us in our deliberations. Throughout the more than 40 years of existence of the United Nations the Assembly's agenda has been focused on the quest of man for a world order based on peace, harmony/ security and prosperity. Although the Assembly meets every year, the unique service of this forum is today more important than ever, for today the international community is confronted with a serious crisis of confidence in the collective ability of nations to move together towards a common goal. Despite the many approaches that have been tried in recent years/ the causes of world conflicts have not disappeared. Indeed, these conflicts could become worse as the political will to solve them. At the same time, every effort to turn each crisis into opportunity generates the momentum towards the elusive goals of genuine peace and prosperity.\nThe Philippines comes to the forty-second session of the General Assembly under a new mandate and inspiration. The Filipino people have ratified a new Constitution by which they hope to build a just and humane society and pursue their ideals and aspirations under the rule of law in a regime of truth, justice, freedom, love, equality and peace. In our relations with the international community we give paramount consideration to safeguarding our national sovereignty and territorial integrity and to respecting the right to self-determination of all nations. We have renounced war as an instrument of national policy and adopted the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land.\nIn pursuit of our programme of national reconstruction we convened, following a general election, a new Congress of the Philippines that is truly representative of the people and committed to giving meaning and reality to their will.\nMy delegation is deeply touched by and grateful for the many expressions of sympathy and support for the Philippines and the Government of President Aquino which have been heard in this Assembly. \nWith its new set of credentials, the Philippines seeks to fulfil its international responsibility and contribute to the common effort to build a better world for ourselves and our children. This universal aspiration is embodied in the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. Although the international community has committed itself to these objectives in the resonant language of repeated declarations, we remain fragmented and are often in conflict, independently pursuing our individual interests and preferring to rely on the security and comfort of our respective national shells.\nThe world is waking up to the erosion of many traditional premises, which are not being replaced by new principles upon which to base the resolution of our difficulties. As decision-makers faced with the responsibility of managing these challenges we must find, through discussion and by means of concerted action, new answers to age-old problems. It is our duty to construct a new system of international relations based on the reality of growing and genuine interdependence and on the principles of justice and equity that will both respond to our collective interests and permit us to achieve our respective national objectives.\nThe first element in this noble mission is the maintenance of international peace and security. Modern history has recorded the failure of innumerable attempts to stabilize the level of armaments of the world Powers. Today, in an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion and in the face of an ever escalating arras race, the super-Powers wrangle in a tug-of-war of gambit and rejection, while the rest of the world watches in horror lest the hair-trigger situation explode into a holocaust. Worse still, the danger is being carried over to outer space, which, as mankind's common heritage, should be reserved exclusively for the uses of peace. Meanwhile, scarce resources that could be utilized for improving the lives of the peoples and fulfilling the potential of the nations of the world are being dissipated. It is ironic that the Powers involved in the arms race are the very same nations as are entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining peace and security within the United Nations system. In this context, the Philippines welcomes the fact that the United States and the Soviet Union have reached agreement in principle to eliminate intermediate-range missiles  We hope that this will be followed by an agreement to reduce# if not eliminate, intercontinental systems. We also encourage progress towards an agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union for the reduction of strategic arsenals at the levels which they set last year in Reykjavik. These are vital steps in the continuing effort towards the goal of ensuring a safer world for mankind.\nConflicts and disputes of various kinds rend the fabric of peace in some regions of the world. These conflicts result as much from a fundamental lack of respect for the rights of men and nations as from the prejudice, arrogance and greed that motivate the disregard of these rights.\nIn South-East Asia the hapless nation of Kampuchea is in the grip of a military occupation that continues to be a threat to the peace and stability of the region. The political sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kampuchea have been violated, and violence has been Inflicted on the dignity of its people. Thousands of refugees have been driven across national borders and now live under the most difficult conditions.\nThe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), to which the Philippines belongs in solidarity of purpose, has worked tirelessly for a durable and comprehensive political settlement that will restore peace, freedom, independence and justice to the Kampuchean people and stability in the region. In this, ASEAN has received the support of the overwhelming majority of nations, support expressed in particular in resolutions approved by large majorities in the General Assembly.\nTogether with its ASEAN partners, the Philippines welcomes the recent agreement to hold an informal meeting, initially among Kampucheans and subsequently with the participation of Viet Nam. We hope that this meeting will be the beginning of a dialogue that will eventually lead to negotiations and ultimately to a solution to the problem of Kampuchea.\nIt will be a solution, we trust, from which will emerge a Kampuchea whose destiny is determined by its own people, free from outside interference, a Kampuchea that is independent, neutral and non-aligned, headed by leaders of the Kampucheans own choosing. At the same time the solution should take into account the security and other interests of all the countries concerned.\nIt is precisely such a solution that is envisioned in the draft resolution that is to be submitted under the agenda item, \\\"The situation in Kampuchea\\\". By again voting in favour of this resolution, therefore. Member States will be helping to hasten the settlement of the Kampuchean conflict. We must emphasize once again that an acceptable and enduring settlement must include the realization of this proposition: Viet Nam must leave Kampuchea.\nIn the same manner, the world expects from the Powers concerned a positive response in respect of Afghanistan. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan must be upheld and all foreign forces there must be withdrawn. Afghan refugees must be returned to their homes in safety and honour. The Afghan people must be left alone to determine their own form of government and their own economic, political and social system, free from outside intervention.\nThe Philippines has taken note of the efforts at national reconciliation in Afghanistan and of the pronouncements on the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country. However, we believe that these steps fall short of the principles embodied in General Assembly resolution 41/33, which calls for the immediate and total withdrawal of foreign troops.\nForeign troops must leave Afghanistan.\nAs great a tragedy on the contemporary scene is the plight of Namibia, captive of a racist regime that for the last 21 years has defied all calls from the Security Council and the General Assembly to withdraw from Namibia. South Africa continues to violate the human rights and dignity of the Namibians, plunders Namibia's natural resources, and denies the country its independence and rightful place in the family of nations. \nSouth Africa must leave Namibia. South Africa must set Namibia free.\nA state of genuine peace, harmony and stability is possible under conditions that recognize and respect the dignity of man. What evil force drives South Africa to defy the whole world bewilders the civilized mind. History does not have to pass judgement on South Africa. Humanity confronted with the gravest of moral issues - that is, apartheid - has already judged it. The judgement must be executed. There must be an end to the attempt to shield South Africa from the world's anger on the basis of any excuse or rationalization. The imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter is the only peaceful means available to create the necessary environment of change. This is imperative and urgent.\nThe Security Council's unanimous call in resolution 598 (1987) of 20 July 1987 for a cease-fire in the eight-year-old war between Iran and Iraq must be upheld. No effort should be spared to prevent the worsening of a war nobody wants. My delegation supports the Secretary-General's efforts on behalf of peace in the Persian Gulf.\nThe Middle East conflict has remained a tinderbox for too long. A just, comprehensive and lasting settlement must be achieved if we are to eliminate a major cause of international instability. The right of the Palestinian people to self-determination under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization and to establish an independent State in Palestine must be recognized. At the same time, the right of all States in the region to live in peace and within secure boundaries, free from threats or acts of force, must be upheld. The convening under the auspices of the United Nations of an international peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned and the five permanent members of the Security Council would be a most appropriate means for the resolution of the conflict. \nWe pay a tribute to the Central American countries for the historic agreement which they recently reached in Guatemala City. It augurs well for the peace, security and stability of that troubled region. It also speaks well o\u00a3 a political will founded on wisdom and statesmanship. We call on all the countries concerned to carry out this landmark agreement.\nMy delegation supports the resumption of negotiations on the Korean question at the earliest possible time. In keeping with the principle of universality and for the sake of international peace and stability, the Philippines supports the admission to membership of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the United Nations under Article 4 of the Charter.\nThe disputes in the Malvinas and in Western Sahara call for similar approaches. Efforts leading to their effective resolution, both direct negotiations and use of the good offices of the Secretary-General, must be encouraged.\nThe United Nations must take the lead in reversing the worsening global economic situation. Our hope for enduring global peace, harmony and security cannot be realized in a world beset with glaring economic inequity and injustice, which create serious instabilities in many areas of the world. What is required is for us to go beyond rhetoric and take action. \nWe are after all, not starting from scratch. There are principles and courses of action that have long been embodied in many declarations, joint communiqu\u00e9s, resolutions and decisions of the United Nations, we already have the Programme of Action for a New International Economic Order, the United Nations International Development Strategies# the Vienna Programme of Action for Science and Technology, and many more. However, there has been some unwillingness to give practical application to those instruments. If the international community had done what is called for in those instruments, we would be living in a better world than we have today.\nWe are aware of the obstacles that lie ahead of us. The reluctance of the industrialized nations to undertake appropriate industrial restructuring prevents world trade from regaining its buoyancy. The general slow-down in the flow of development resources from bilateral sources and international financial institutions deprives the developing countries, particularly the debt-ridden among them, of the means to achieve economic growth.\nTrade protectionism constitutes a frustrating barrier to the developing nations' economic aspirations. Their foreign debt is a crushing burden on those countries, bringing about great social and political tensions in their societies ad hoc and piecemeal management of the debt problem has been anti-development, destabilizing and inequitable. While there is a growing recognition of the principle of shared responsibility of debtors and creditors, the actual burden has been borne primarily, if not entirely, by the debtor countries, for which the costs of adjustment are intolerably onerous.\nMy delegation believes that economic growth must take precedence over debt servicing. Developing countries must have a reasonable economic growth that will enable their peoples to enjoy adequate standards of living. The long-term  interests of the creditors are better served by the continued stability of the debtor countries and the viability of the global financial system. The Philippines therefore supports a proposal to convene an international conference on money and finance to discuss a just and lasting solution to the debt problem.\nWe are called upon to take bold steps and innovative approaches in the political and economic spheres to meet the challenges of today. We are also called upon to take concerted action and respond to the mandate in the Preamble of the United Nations Charter \\\"to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\\\".\nNo effort to improve the quality of life can have meaning apart from the general well-being of the human person. The impairment of social life, the threat of disease, poverty and malnutrition, and the outrages that injure or violate the dignity of the human person could render ineffective, even meaningless, whatever gains are made in other fields.\nLast year the General Assembly adopted 68 resolutions on social, cultural and humanitarian matters. They encompass the promotion and protection of human rights the International Campaign Against Abuse of and Illegal Trafficking in Drugs; women, youth, the disabled and the aging\u00b7, crime prevention and criminal justice racism, racial discrimination, and the right to self-determination. The resolutions provide the building blocks that have resulted in a number of United Nations treaties and conventions. Thus, the United Nations has done much in setting standards by which the Member countries can measure their performance. We the Members of the United Nations, must match our zeal with concrete proposals, resolutions and decisions and place our collective determination and political will behind their implementation. The Philippine Government remains steadfast in its adherence to human tights and social justice and in the commitment of the new Constitution to giving the highest priority to the enactment of measures that protect and enhance the right of the people to human dignity, reduce social, economic and political inequalities, and remove cultural inequities by equitably diffusing wealth and political power for the common good.\\\" We place the highest value on those United Nations instruments which promote and protect human dignity and the worth of the individual.\nTo the extent that the United Nations has become the guardian of the highest moral values of humanity, the promotion and protection of human rights must keep its place high on the United Nations agenda. And, even as we keep vigilant watch over the conduct of individual Governments, we must constantly urge one another to renew our commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the other instruments in this field.\nTo signify the Philippine Government's unwavering support of the international struggle against apartheid. President Aquino recently signed, in the presence of General Joseph Garba, Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid, the instrument of ratification of the International Convention against Apartheid in Sports.\nThe United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment entered into force on 26 June of this year. The Convention represents a major step forward towards the world-wide proscription of torture. However, our intent to promote and protect human rights must be accompanied by an earnest effort to carry out our corresponding obligations.\nWe are encouraged by the efforts of the United Nations system to integrate women into the mainstream of national life by emphasizing that women are active participants in development as well as prime beneficiaries of its rewards. My country strongly supports the work of the United Nations on behalf of the advancement of women. We take pride in the fact that the Nairobi forward\u2014Looking strategies for the advancement of women to the year 2000 have been included in the Philippines' medium-term development plan for 1987-1992.\nDuring this session the United Nations will observe the tenth anniversary of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). UNIFEM has contributed much to the improvement of the situation of the poor in more than 100 countries around the world. We must therefore continue to support it fully.\nThe International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, under the presidency of the Prime Minister of Malaysia Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, which was held in Vienna in June, was a landmark development in international co-operation in meeting the grave challenge of the drug problem. The Declaration and the comprehensive multi-disciplinary outline should lay the groundwork for further co-operation. The Philippines will continue to pursue the fight against that scourge, both at home and on the international front, particularly in collaboration with its partners In the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) .\nIn its latest compilation the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 58,880 cases of AIDS. The Philippines views with concern the ever-increasing number of victims of that dreaded disease and is therefore prepared to support concerted joint efforts aimed at combating it. One of the most important documents that will be discussed by the General Assembly this year is the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development# entitled \\\"Our common future\\\". The Philippines was privileged to attend the presentational meeting to launch the report, which was held in New Deli in July 1987. \nThe realities of living on one Earth make us realize the constraints of the interdependency of our environments and economies. Unfortunately, the international community has not effectively addressed our urgent ecological concerns. Scientists throughout the world have brought to our attention the urgent but complex environmental problems threatening our survival. A warming globe, threats to the ozone layer, desertification, deforestation, pollution and environmental degradation are eroding the potential for development and have become a survival issue for developing countries.\nLet us recall with relief and gratitude that the forty-first session of the General Assembly ended with a renewed awareness of the need to overcome a looming crisis of confidence in the United Nations and to keep it moving forward despite a serious challenge to its very existence. The difficult situation created by the financial crisis in the United Nations system last year resulted in an unexpected bonus; it gave rise to a pervasive spirit of moderation and sobriety, which culminated in an earnest search for compromise and accommodation.\nIt is imperative for the entire membership to accept joint responsibility for keeping the United Nations not only alive and well but strong enough to face the tasks that have been entrusted to it. Obligations under the Charter must be met under the mandated arrangement of equitable burden-sharing based on capacity. The financial problem will remain and perhaps grow worse for as long as commitments are not honoured.\nThe administrative reforms directed by this Assembly and carried out by the Secretary-General should meet the requirements of rationalization and the need to streamline management. There is encouraging progress in the effort to review the Charter so as to strengthen the United Nations and make it a more effective instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security.\nThe vision that emerged for all mankind in 1945 in San Francisco will remain as a beacon in our quest for a better life in a world at peace. It is less important to know whether in the interval we have moved an inch closer to our goal than it is to make certain that our sense of commitment and responsibility has not diminished. The important thing is not to falter and not to surrender to cynicism and despair, for if we ate today a community of nations risen from the scourge of wars and deprivation it is because of our awareness that we can gather strength from a sense of solidarity and are nourished by a real faith in the vision of a bright future for mankind as we bestride the short distance into the twenty-first century.\n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe peoples of the world are turning towards our Organization with interest, expectations and hopes that are higher than ever before. There is a widespread, growing conviction that mankind will be able to survive and solve its problems only through joint efforts, with the participation of the United Nations.\nLike every other Member State/ Poland is shouldering, to the extent of its strength and aspirations, its share of responsibility for our shared world-\nWe welcomed with appreciation and hope the historic tentative agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States on the elimination of medium- and shorter-range missiles, as stressed by the President of the Council of State of Poland, Wojciech Jaruzelski, who stated that \\\"The Polish people, which in its history has had such painful experience of the horrors of war, fully understands the significance of this momentous event, and wholeheartedly endorses it-\\\"\nWe view the Washington agreement as a breakthrough in disarmament negotiations\nand as a step towards general and complete disarmament- We see it as an opportunity considerably to accelerate the long efforts to establish lasting peace and security and as the start of a new period, when we can begin to defuse the dangers facing our planet, which is excessively charged with explosives. But we know full well that the long-awaited elimination of two classes of deadly missiles is but the beginning of the long road back from the edge of the abyss to which nuclear weapons have brought mankind.\nWe want to believe that the Soviet-United States agreement will provide a strong impetus for stepping up disarmament negotiations and making progress in the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons based on full compliance with the anti-ballistic missile Treaty. We expect early finalization of an agreement banning chemical weapons. On the agenda as well are negotiations on the elimination from Europe of nuclear weapons with a range of up to 500 kilometres and on a reduction of conventional weapons. The world must take a deep breath and rid itself of the political, psychological, economic and social burden of the arms race.\nWe are deeply convinced of the responsibility of all States, be they large, medium-sized or small, for the future of the world, and of their potential to make a contribution to that future. On many occasions, Poland has spoken out constructively in favour of creating optimal conditions for the peaceful and safe development of our country, of Europe and of the world at large. We have always been aware, however, that the right of a country to security is not without limits. Precisely 30 years ago today, the same philosophy gave rise to the Rapacki plan presented from this rostrum by the then Foreign Minister of Poland on 2 October 1957. The aim of that celebrated initiative was to reduce armaments in the flash-point of Europe and give that region a special status of military security.\nAt that time Poland was trying to break the habit of thinking of security exclusively in East-West terms. Its proposal covered States belonging to both of the two major military blocs and thus reflected the interests of the whole of Europe. Without abandoning global solutions it pointed to the possibility of regional arrangements.\nThe ideas of the Rapacki plan remain valid. Unfortunately, they failed to materialize in Europe, to the detriment of that continent and of the world. But they have inspired statesmen and whole nations to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in Latin America, the South Pacific, Africa and Asia. Thousands of towns and cities on all continents have declared themselves to be nuclear-weapon-free zones. Under international agreements, the Antarctic, outer space and the sea-bed and ocean floor are zones free from those lethal engines. Today, 30 years after the Rapacki plan was put forward, the new positive transformation of the world is benefiting from the Polish initiative on decreasing armaments and increasing confidence in Central Europe: the Jaruzelski plan. The plan's underlying idea is to halt the arras race and promote confidence in the militarily most sensitive region of Europe: Central Europe. The Jaruzelski plan stems from Poland's national experience, from the traditions of a nation to which history has meted out harsh treatment. At the same time, the plan serves the interests of other peoples and other States of Europe. Although it refers to a single continent, it approaches the issue of security in broader terms. For that reason, it is our duty to set out here in the United Nations its principles and its substance.\nFirst, however, I should like to draw the attention of members to broader issues that have had an impact on the sources, the essence and the shape of that Polish initiative.\nWe believe it is time to end the very dangerous role of the military factor in the contemporary world. Now, at the end of the twentieth century, there is no place for policies based on military means and on dealing from a position of strength. That underlies the initiatives taken by States parties to the Warsaw Treaty. The essence of those initiatives are; the elimination of conventional armed forces and weapons] the complete prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests  the prevention of the deployment of nuclear weapons in outer space; a ban on chemical weapons; the inadmissibility of the use of military means in the resolution of any dispute; and the corresponding modification of military doctrines. These initiatives are well balanced and open, and are born of the conviction that one cannot build one's own security at the expense of the security of others. \nThe current general debate at the forty-second session of the General Assembly demonstrates that this conviction is shared by a growing number of States. We hope that in the interest of their own peoples, and in accordance with the expectations of the international community, the States members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will respond to the disarmament offer of the Warsaw Treaty organization.\nProgress in disarmament must have priority in the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations.\nThe consistency and flexibility with which the Soviet Union - in the United Nations and elsewhere - is addressing the implementation of the programme for ridding the world of nuclear weapons by the year 2000 deserves the highest respect and attention. That programme spells out the desires of all mankind.\nMankind's peaceful efforts and expectations manifest the conviction that the unity and harmonious growth of the world require acceptance of the simple truth that the interests of particular regions are part and parcel of the global interests of all nations. The world can develop, nationally and regionally, only with acknowledgement of the political and economic diversity of States and regions, and with mutual co-operation, understanding and respect. \nGuided by those considerations we, together with other socialist States, have proposed the establishment of a comprehensive system of international peace and security. We should like it to embrace the most important manifestations of the interests of all mankind, be they military, political, economic, humanitarian or environmental in nature. In an era of ominous nuclear armaments and advanced space research, it is our objective and desire to ensure, for every nation and every individual, through the collective efforts of the international community, the right to life, freedom, peace, prosperity and happiness. Only in this way can we meet the deep concern for the realization, in present-day practice of international relations, of the lofty purposes and principles of the United Nations set forth in the Charter, due account being taken of the new values created in the past four decades and of mutual interdependence and common dangers. That was stressed by Mikhail Gorbachev in his recent article on the realities and guarantees of a safe world. \nIn such a system of international peace and security we also see room for putting into effect the fundamental objectives of Poland's foreign policy. In Europe, in the region closest to Poland, the main problem of security now is, in effect, eliminating the possibility of a surprise attack. One can no longer walk around the European powder-keg with a lighted match, for sooner or later an explosion is bound to occur with incalculable consequences for the whole world.\nPolitical, economic and cultural relations in Europe, especially those related to the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) , do not warrant the current high level of armaments and military preparedness. In the area of Central Europe closest to my homeland, stockpiles of weapons have been amassed far exceeding the defence needs of countries of the region. It is with some concern and anxiety that we wonder about the future of European security after the elimination of medium- and shorter-range missiles. Will this really be the starting-point for genuine disarmament, detente and the building of lasting confidence or, on the contrary, for increased conventional armaments and the growth in stockpiles of tactical nuclear weapons?\nIt is our deepest conviction that favourable conditions exist for ensuring greater security for European States at a considerably lower level of military potential. This conviction is fully reflected in the Jaruzelski plan. It proposes, among other things, the gradual reduction and withdrawal of specific, mutually agreed on, types and quantities of nuclear and conventional weapons and agreement on the elimination of the disproportions and asymmetries in a variety of weapons and armed forces, together possibly with reductions in areas where one side enjoys superiority over the other. Those steps should be matched by appropriate and far-reaching confidence-building and security-building measures, along with a mechanism for thorough verification. The plan also proposes such modification of military doctrines that they would reciprocally be recognized as strictly defensive. The steps taken within the framework of the plan would be based on the principles of equality of rights, reciprocity, equal security of all patties without detriment to the security of any one State.\nAppropriate guarantees by nuclear Powers could be one of the conditions for the effectiveness of the measures envisaged in the plan, as well as the security of the States of the region, and respect for their status under the agreement.\nThe Polish plan is open in nature. It provides genuine possibilities for the partners jointly to select and spell out the means of implementation and to take into account the suggestions and proposals of all the interested States. It is a manifestation of the concept of achieving common security through the co-operation of States,\nWe also support the proposals made by Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free corridor and a chemical-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.\nWe take note with satisfaction of the finalization of the study of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research on the diverse effects of the militarization of outer space, which was the goal of the Polish initiative submitted at the fortieth session of the General Assembly.\nThe sense of security is deeply rooted in the minds of men and stems from the most profound motivations and aspirations for peace as man's supreme value. It is from that standpoint that we approach the third periodic review of the implementation of the United Nations  Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in Peace, adopted on Poland's initiative\u00b7 In our view the Declaration fulfils its role. This has been confirmed, inter alia, by observances of the International Year of Peace and the massive demands for real disarmament measures voiced then with unprecedented strength\u00b7 World public opinion has unequivocally confirmed the determination of nations to ensure peace and their readiness to act to strengthen it. In the view of the Polish government, the provisions of the Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in Peace could play a greater role if their implementation were not entirely discretionary. Therefore we suggest that the General Assembly consider the need and possibility of upgrading the international status of that important document.\nAccording greater priority within the United Nations system to solving humanity\u2019 s critical social problems, which are the source of many international tensions, would constitute an appropriate and welcome step towards a more secure world. The Conference of the European ministers responsible for social affairs held in Warsaw last April, served precisely that purpose. \nRespect for human rights constitutes an integral element of the system of international security. We are pleased that the international community is showing increasing appreciation of the need to humanize international relations. In keeping with the ideals of the United Nations Charter, that stand should lead to a perception of the world as a single entity, the development of which is determined by the interests of mankind and the democratisation of international relations.\nThe implementation of such a humanist view is served, not only by disarmament and broad international co-operation, but by human rights. We have established, within the United Nations system and on a regional scale within the CSCE process, a common basis for realizing those objectives; the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and other relevant documents demonstrate that. We are in favour of their full and creative application by all States. However, they cannot be approached in a selective manner. In the global effort to enhance human rights, greater attention should be devoted to social and economic rights, and access to culture, education and health care. We are also in favour of greater integration of human rights into social development.\nPoland supports specific international co-operation and serious discussion in the field of human rights. Accordingly, we have, for instance, supported the proposal to convene in Moscow a broadly representative conference on humanitarian co-operation between the States participants in the CSCE process. We have accumulated many positive experiences that we are prepared to share. We do not shy away from taking into account the experience of others provided that such experience is in keeping with mutually recognized values, national traditions and needs. We intend to go further in enhancing human rights and achieving national reconciliation, renewal, ever greater democratisation of social relations and the development of socialist pluralism. \nAware of the role of the family in the social life of nations and States, we have submitted to the Commission for Social Development a draft resolution on the proclamation by the United Nations of an International year of family\u00b7 We expect that year to be proclaimed for the early 1990s. We view the strengthening of the family as the basic social cell and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and as a concrete contribution to the development of common values for the sake of the present as well as the future of mankind.\nWe are confident that our initiative, which has also been sponsored by Austria, Canada, Mongolia, Portugal, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Ukraine, and which enjoys the support of many other States, will receive unanimous approval at the current session of the General Assembly.\nThe comprehensive system of international peace and security proposed by the socialist States means also that greater attention should be devoted to economic growth. A situation which for some nations is tantamount to bare survival while for others it means that they do not know what to do with their surplus goods cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely\u00b7 At a time of considerable growth in international economic interdependence, the establishment of a system of international economic security becomes a fundamental challenge. It is urgently necessary that the efforts of the United Nations be concentrated on ensuring decent and equitable development conditions for all States. The more developed participants in the international economic exchange can no longer treat weaker partners in a condescending manner. Today the latter are already indispensable parties to the development process of the more developed countries, and this will be even more true in the future. The narrowly conceived interests and short-term benefits of the developed countries should not obscure the broader and more fundamental interests resulting from the growing interdependence of all countries. \nPoland has consistently supported the building of confidence in international economic relations and has put into effect the concept of international economic security and stable international co-operation, free from restrictions and limitations. We ate ready to co-operate with all those that wish to co-operate with us on an equal basis. This means desisting from attempts to lecture others and to impose one's solutions on others. Attempts to make the capitalist market economy the only panacea for all the difficulties and problems of the contemporary world are naive and at odds with the interests of international co-operation. Each nation enjoys the right to choose the path to development which is in keeping with its own interests and historical processes. Entrepreneurship and the free market are not inventions of the capitalist economy alone.\nToday economic security is inseparably linked to foreign indebtedness, which has become an issue of global dimensions. The credits received, instead of enhancing the development of debtor countries, are frequently impeding it. Equally frequently they become instruments of political pressure against those States which, for many reasons, are unable to repay their debt. This phenomenon is not limited to the developing countries. At the present time, in this closely interdependent world, indebtedness affects the interests not only of the debtor States but also of the creditors. The latter, in their own best interest, should support the restructuring efforts of the debtor countries and lower the cost of debt servicing. We have been drawing attention to this situation for some time, inter alia by proposing at the fortieth session of the General Assembly that an international debt and development research centre be established under the auspices of the Secretary-General, With a view to facilitating the implementation of this initiative, we set up in Krakow at the end of 1986 a national centre devoted to dealing with these problems. I express the hope that the centre will shortly be associated with the programmes carried out within the framework of the United Nations system.\nPoland has also been actively involved in international efforts aimed at increasing the resources allocated for development. Like the overwhelming majority of States, we believe that one of the principal sources of development funds should be the resources which are today squandered on armaments. The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which was held in September, has confirmed the existence of an inseparable link between disarmament and development. We believe that disarmament is a prerequisite for development. The reallocation of resources obtained as a result of arms reduction should not be carried out automatically. It should take due account also of the level and requirements of the internal development of States, reducing military expenditures and promoting co-operation with the developing countries.\nThe building of a secure and better world will not be possible without stopping the continuing degradation of man's natural environment. Poland attaches major importance to ecological issues. We seek to expand international co-operation in this area. It is with great attention that we have acquainted ourselves with the valuable report of the World Commission on Environment and Development headed by the Prime Minister of Norway, Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland. We expect that, in keeping with Poland's proposal submitted at the fortieth session of the General Assembly, an increased exchange of environmental protection technology will follow. The resolution adopted at the Conference of the United Nations Environment Programme in Nairobi marked a degree of progress in that area. We hope that the General Assembly, too, will take constructive steps in this regard, at the current session. \nPoland supports efforts designed to eliminate the threat to the security of States and individuals posed by international terrorism. We are ready to participate in the establishment of effective international barriers against this dangerous phenomenon. These efforts, however, cannot in any way cause us to disregard the legitimate national liberation struggles that stem from the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination. To the extent of our possibilities, we are also endeavouring to contribute to the struggle against the deadly diseases of our day and to finding more effective means of containing drug abuse and preventing the spread of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).\nI have referred to only some of the roost critical aspects of the building of a more secure and better world. Poland has stressed on many occasions, however, that there cannot be a more secure world without the peaceful resolution of regional conflict situations: in the Middle East, on the basis of the return of the occupied territories and respect for the right of all peoples to self-determination\u00b7, in southern Africa, through the elimination of apartheid and the exercise of the right of the people of Namibia to self-determination; around Afghanistan and Kampuchea, with the implementation of the policy of national reconciliation and dialogue with the States concerned; in Central America, with respect for the original initiative of the States of the region; in Europe, with a settlement of the Cyprus problem; and in the Korean peninsula, with the peaceful reunification of the Korean people in accordance with the proposals of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea. There will be no safe world without the cessation of hostilities between Iraq and Iran and the solution of the contentious issues between those two States on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) . All States should refrain from unilateral actions and extend resolute support to the Security Council and the Secretary-General. As in past years, we are ready to take part in practical steps aimed at restoring peace to the sensitive regions of the world.\nTrue to the fundamental premises of its policy and the principles of the United Nations Charter, Poland is interested in the promotion of relations with all States based on the principles of equality, non-interference in internal affairs and mutual benefit. It is with satisfaction that we take note of the speeding up of positive changes in Polish-American relations. The reopening of the political dialogue and its elevation to higher levels, as well as the lifting of United States restrictions, have paved the way for the normalization and improvement of bilateral relations. We have travelled together a long way, from crisis situations to joint constructive actions, gradually restoring normal relations based on a lasting foundation and universally recognized principles, for the benefit of our nations, peace and international co-operation.\nThe development of this process calls for new efforts to overcome the obstacles and impediments that still exist. We wish relations between Poland and the United States to be normal and businesslike, based on peaceful coexistence and the rich traditions which bind our two peoples. We are ready for new joint constructive steps in political relations, equitable economic and financial co-operation and cultural, scientific and technological exchanges.\nSimilarly, it is our desire to promote mutually advantageous contacts with other Western States. We think that substantial progress in the normalization of relations between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of the 1970 Treaty would constitute a joint contribution to tine strengthening of positive trends, and not only in Europe. We took careful note of the statement of Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher on the \\\"special quality\\\" of relations with Poland.\nAll the problems that I have touched upon can be solved through full application of the principles and ideals set out in the Charter of the United Nations. To attain this goal it is indispensable to strengthen our Organization. We must enhance its effectiveness, especially in the key areas of the consolidation of peace, international security, arras control, disarmament and development. We appreciate the efforts of the Organization and its Secretary-General in easing tension and eliminating regional conflicts. \nA substantial contribution to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in the world is being made by efforts concerning the codification and progressive development of international law, in particular those of the International Law Commission.\nIn conclusion, it is with deep satisfaction that I greet in the high office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session the representative of the German Democratic Republic, a brother socialist country to which Poland is linked by ties of friendship and co-operation, as well as by a lasting and unalterable boundary of peace between two friendly sovereign States. At the same time, I should like to extend to the Secretary-General, Mr\u00b7 Javier Perez de Cuellar, an assurance of our unswerving respect and our support for his endeavours.\nPoland firmly believes that the United Nations offers the best platform for joining words to deeds in inter-State relations and in the peaceful resolution of the basic dilemmas of our times- At the time when we founded this Organization together we were equally convinced of the validity of this statement. This is borne out by the fact that Poland, foreign policy is fully in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations; this has found its expression in, among other things, the Jaruzelski plan, as explained today to the General Assembly\nWe are deeply convinced that the constructive, comprehensive nature of the present debate will contribute to the strengthening of the role and significance of the United Nations in the quest for a better, safer, peaceful world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me at the outset convey to the President the warm and sincere felicitations of Sri Lanka on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. Sri Lanka and the German Democratic Republic have enjoyed a fruitful association of co-operation in bilateral and international affairs, an association which has been further strengthened by exchanges of visits at a high level between our two countries recently.\nA special word of gratitude is due from us to the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, my friend and colleague from the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) , for his outstanding contribution to the forty-first session as President.\nTo strike a personal note, it is now a decade since I first addressed the General Assembly as Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka. For the last 10 years I have had the opportunity to observe the vagaries of the international situation, both economic and political. Many of the items I saw on the agenda in 1977 have eluded settlement. This has not always been for want of solutions. For many of these problems the General Assembly has, often by consensus, prescribed solutions based on the principles and purposes of the Charter. Unfortunately, those prescriptions have not been dispensed, nor have solutions been implemented. However, I will not outline the reasons for this sad state of affairs. They are very well known.\nPermit me to look at the global economic situation. The 1980s are already being characterized as the lost decade of development. The development process as a whole stands disrupted. For many developing countries it is a tragic tale of economic stagnation, with falling living standards and negative growth rates. Adverse socio-economic consequences of these developments have led to social and political unrest. The prospects for growth and development for many of us remain increasingly unfavourable. If the developing countries are to break out of this vicious circle  there has to be a revitalization of the development process. This will be possible only in an international economic environment that is supportive of such efforts.\nThe assessment of the world economy which emerges from the World Economic Survey 1987 is clear. World economic growth, as the Survey points out, is weak and fragile, and the prevailing uncertainties point downwards. It is equally clear that if the negative influences are not reversed in time, they could move the world economy closer to a global recession. Therefore, the urgent imperative is for the launching of policies and measures towards the stimulation of world economic growth. This has to be accompanied by an effective reinvigoration of development and trade on the basis of international economic co-operation.\nThe present modest economic recovery in the industrialized countries has slowed down further in the last two years. The macro-economic and deflationary policies pursued by them in recent years are responsible for this underlying situation. They have had only negative consequences for the third world, as they have precipitated protectionist policies, restrictive trade measures and a decline in third world exports. The situation relating to commodities is critical and prices have slumped since 1980 to their lowest levels in the last 50 years. What is more, there are little signs of an improvement. Several developing countries, such as Sri Lanka , which face huge losses in export earnings as a result of falling commodity prices ; and the deterioration in the terms of trade, find their development efforts seriously disturbed.\nThere is, however, a silver lining to the present gloomy situation and there is the increasing realization by the major market-economy countries of the need for greater co-ordination of their macro-economic policies and recognition of the interlinkages of issues of commodities, trade, monetary and financial policies. This awareness must be seized and broadened and deepened. The notion of Interdependence will have to be transformed into a global and co-ordinated approach reinforced by concrete policies and actions.\nIt is heartening, therefore, that recent developments have recognized the need to address common concerns in a mutually beneficial way on the basis of International economic co-operation. At Punta del Este in September last year Ministers from developed and developing countries alike adopted a bold and ambitious agenda in launching the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. That was aimed at a greater liberalization of world trade and the strengthening of the international trading system. Again, as recently as July his year, in Geneva, the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) adopted by consensus the Final Act of that Conference. The decision represents a political commitment by the international community to work towards the revitalization of development, growth and international trade through multilateral co-operation. It remains for the International community collectively to honour commitments that have been undertaken and to implement them faithfully and effectively.\nBefore turning to the international political and security situation I should like to refer briefly to the current situation in Sri Lanka. Last year I detailed the efforts of President Jayewardene to resist a threat to impose a separate State unacceptable to the vast majority of the people in Sri Lanka. I also detailed the endeavours of the Government to reach a negotiated political settlement with the Tamil community to redress their grievances. Today I am able to state that a new situation has been brought into existence by the signing of the India-Sri Lanka accord in July this year. The wisdom and statesmanship that led to that accord have been widely acclaimed both within and outside the Assembly. Today, terrorism is virtually at an end, with only some sporadic in-fighting between rival terrorist groups which have not yet surrendered all their weapons. Negotiations have been almost completed on the question of the devolution of political and administrative functions to the provincial councils. There will be an interim administration for the Northern and Eastern Provinces pending the transfer of responsibilities to an elected provincial council. A referendum will take place a year thereafter to ascertain the wishes of the people of the Eastern Province on the question of a merger with the Northern Province. We are hopeful that violent divisive and separatist tendencies in the Northern and Eastern Provinces will give way to the democratic process which has nourished Sri Lanka's political life for over half a century.\nThe year 1987 was designated by the United Nations General Assembly the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless on a proposal made by the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka in this Assembly in 1982. As a consequence we have witnessed impressive programmes of national and international activities to focus attention on the problem of adequate housing and to formulate enduring solutions aimed at satisfying a basic need. On 12 October the Assembly will devote two plenary meetings to the observance of the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless.\nWe see hopeful signs in the international political situation. We welcome the proposed summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union, The agreement in principle to dismantle intermediate-range nuclear forces signals the removal of an entire class of weapons of a particular range from the arsenals of the major military Powers. The threat of global extinction has not, by any means been removed, or even substantially reduced. Yet agreement is in the course of being reached on intermediate-range nuclear forces and its positive impact on the international scene make this perhaps the most significant step of the century in disarmament initiatives.\nDespite the easing of tension in many sensitive areas, much more remains to be achieved before we can enjoy the fruits of lasting peace and security. The horrific destructive power of nuclear weapons must itself be destroyed and a genuine process of disarmament under adequate verification must be set in motion. The nexus between disarmament and development was explored barely a fortnight \u0430 \u0437 by an International Conference held under the aegis of the United Nations. The Conference reached the clear conclusion that disarmament and development are the two pillars on which enduring international peace and security can be built and that an arms race and a more sustainable world order are not compatible. There is no denying the complexity of the issues involved, but the high-level political participation in the International Conference was indicative of our collective willingness to address those complexities and to find solutions through multilateral co-operation. Next year we shall- gather in New York again for the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. That session must not slide back from the achievements of the f lest special session on disarmament.\nSri Lanka had the honour and privilege of introducing in the Assembly in 1977, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, the resolution calling for the convening of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. The rationale of special sessions of the General Assembly on disarmament is that the imperative of disarmament affects, not only the nuclear-weapon States and those who have military muscle, but all nations.\t.\nNuclear disaster would make no distinction between those who can use these weapons, those who possess them, and those like us who do not fall into either category. The joint acceptance by the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union of the fact that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought, needs now to be translated into further reductions and the elimination of nuclear weapons beyond the intermediate nuclear forces. As an interim measure, negotiations for a comprehensive nuclear test ban should be conducted not only bilaterally but multilaterally as well. The Conference on Disarmament can be brought into service to negotiate the necessary agreements. This multilateral negotiating body has demonstrated its capacity in its efforts this year to complete a draft convention on chemical weapons.\nFew ages have faced such frightening challenges. To retreat from the nuclear race requires greater courage than to persist in a contest to exhibit military superiority. To extend this rivalry and to put weapons in outer space is to thwart the powerful development potential of the last frontier of mankind. Sri Lanka hopes to continue with other nations its efforts to reach consensus on a resolution that would help to prevent an arms race and to promote peaceful co-operation in outer space in the interest of all humanity.\nAnother initiative in disarmament and international security in which Sri Lanka has been engaged is the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We have offered to host one of the Ad Hoc Committee meetings in Colombo next year. This meeting is of course to be distinguished from the Colombo Conference on the Indian Ocean, which is now scheduled to take place by 1990. \nThere is another area of marine activity, economic in character, in which Sri Lanka has taken an initiative. I am happy to state that early this year, we hosted in Colombo the Ministerial Meeting on Indian Ocean Marine Affaire Co-operation. The Conference formulated a long-term programme of co-operation and a plan of action to provide a basis for concrete co-operative action among the Indian Ocean States. The Ministerial Meeting also set up the 17-nation Indian Ocean Marine Affairs Standing Committee, which held its first meeting immediately after the Ministerial Conference. The second meeting of the Standing Committee was concluded successfully early this month in Colombo.\nWe derive considerable satisfaction from the progress achieved so far by the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) for promoting regional co-operation. The agreement reached in identifying terrorist offences for the purpose of extradition is indeed a significant breakthrough. The Bangalore Summit Declaration recogni2ed the importance of the principle that each member State of SAARC should not permit the use of its territory for terrorist activities by terrorist groups against another member State. The last Ministerial Meeting held in New Delhi mandated a group of legal experts from SAARC countries to draft a regional convention on terrorism. I am happy to state that the group of legal experts who met in Sri Lanka this month have formulated a draft convention on terrorism which will now come up for consideration before the Council of Ministers in Kathmandu, early in November this year.\nA call has been made for an international conference to seek a just and lasting solution to the problems of the Middle East. The fate of an entire people, the Palestinians, continues to be in jeopardy, it is our view that until Israel withdraws from Palestine and other Arab territories it occupies, and until the rights of the Palestinians are restored, no lasting settlement to the cluster of issues known as question of the Middle East can be achieved. Sri Lanka will continue to support the just struggle of the people of Palestine under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, whose participation is indispensable in the negotiations for a durable settlement. The Arab Peace Plan adopted in Fez in 1982 continues to be relevant in this regard.\nThe plight of the people of Lebanon has become a part of the Middle East question. Sri Lanka calls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon to permit the sovereign exercise by the Government of its authority over all its territory.\nIn the adjacent Gulf region, relations between two fellow members of the non-aligned countries, Iran and Iraq, have deteriorated into a wasteful war, which exacts a terrible toll on their peoples. Regional stability has been affected and there looms the threat of a wider conflict. Sri Lanka welcomes the initiative leading to the visit by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the area, and supports every effort to find a settlement acceptable to both parties.\nThe Central American region presents no less a tangled web of issues, which can only be complicated further by unwarranted foreign intervention. The Guatemala Accord, a regional initiative, offers a blueprint for the construction of a solid edifice of peace. We hope that the initiative will lead to stable relationships among the countries concerned on the basis of sovereign equality, mutual respect, and the peaceful coexistence of differing political and economic systems. The international community must appreciate the wishes of the Governments of this region and respect their desire to develop their societies politically and economically in accordance with the aspirations of their peoples. \nCloser home, the situation in South-East Asia has been adversely affected by developments in Kampuchea. South-West Asia likewise has been affected by developments in Afghanistan. In both situations, Sri Lanka has consistently called for the withdrawal of foreign troops and affirmed the right of the peoples in the respective countries to resolve their problems and determine their political destiny without outside interference, pressures, subversion or coercion. Sri Lanka supports the desire of the Korean people to reunify their homeland peacefully, through direct dialogue, without foreign interference and in conformity with the principles of the North-South Statement of 4 July 1972.\nForeign troops have occupied a portion of the Republic of Cyprus, bringing about a de facto division of the island and exacerbating the internal issues concerning the relationship between the two communities in the Republic of Sri Lanka fully supports the call of the Heads of State of the Non-Aligned Movement for the immediate withdrawal of all occupation forces as an essential basis for the solution of the Cyprus problem.\nThe situation in South Africa offers a curious mix of the best and the worst in human endeavour. Racial bigotry that has been cynically institutionalised and piously justified in the system of apartheid displays the worst in man. What inspires us in this otherwise bleak situation is the spirit and determination of the majority people of South Africa to resist oppression, to endure suffering and overcome subjugation. Repression has only strengthened their resistance and reinforced their drive for freedom and majority rule. Comprehensive mandatory sanctions are internationally accepted as the most effective means to dismantle the ugly system of apartheid. Sri Lanka reiterates the call for the release of Nelson Mandela and others so that they can be brought into the mainstream of political life.\nApartheid has also kept Namibia captive. What is particularly tragic is the in this situation to the international consensus that would bring independence for Namibia - Security Council resolution 435 (1978) - has not been Implemented. South Africa's strategy to buy time has prevented freedom for Namibia. The obstacle to Namibian independence remains South Africa's intransigence. The courageous struggle of the people of Namibia, under the leadership of the South West Africa people's Organization (SWAPO) must reach its inevitable conclusion/ and the international community must hasten this process.\nBeyond South Africa and Namibia, apartheid has spawned unbearable horrors on the front-line States, such as the massacre of civilians in Mozambique earlier this year. We strongly condemn these actions that seek to destabilize independent countries through such cold-blooded acts of terrorism against innocent civilians.\nEvery year we gather here in New York to examine the international situation and to consider what our collective wisdom has to offer in dealing with issues of common concern to us. Pessimists may say that we are cataloguing failures of the United Nations and indulging in rhetoric. The measure of success or failure of the United Nations will depend on what we, the Members of the United Nations, would wish the Organization to be. For small non-aligned countries like Sri Lanka, the moral authority of the United Nations and its Charter and the international accountability it entails are important bulwarks of our security and independence.\nRecent developments in some areas have augured well  if not decisively bringing about solutions, at least offering in their wake promises for the future. Patient efforts over a sustained period have had a beneficial cumulative effect, ushering in new hopes, nurturing fresh optimism and yielding new avenues to overcome the failures of the past. These efforts must continue within the framework of the United Nations if decisions ate to command the confidence of the international community and to stand the test of time.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe Algerian delegation warmly congratulates you. Sir, on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its forty-second session. Your long experience in international affairs and especially your awareness of problems closely linked to United Nations activities justify the honour the Assembly has done you in giving you this onerous task. We are convinced that you will do your work to the great benefit of the Assembly. In electing you, Sir, our Assembly also wished to honour your country for its role in working significantly for a future in which dialogue and co-operation have a special place. My country is honoured to enjoy such dialogue and co-operation with your country. I assure you that you will always have the fullest support from me personally and from my country.\nYour position was previously held by Mr, Humayun Rasheed Choudhury. Showing his authority with regard to the matters before the Assembly and making himself available to all, he constantly demonstrated his inexhaustible personal resources, which he put at the service of the general interest. He was thus a credit to a brotherly country, Bangladesh, but even more of a credit to the whole international community. I hope that he will accept our expression of gratitude and my brotherly wishes for his future health and happiness.\nOur Organization has benefited greatly from being able to count on the unfailing devotion to duty of the Secretary-General, his absolute commitment and his tireless work in the efficient service of the shared interests of its Members. With his identification with the United Nations in the promotion of peace and development through dialogue, joint efforts and universal action, he embodies a conviction, which is infectious, that our Organization is irreplaceable, especially at times when attempts are made to question that.\nThe agreement in principle between the United States and the Soviet Union on the withdrawal and destruction of short-range and medium-range missiles based in Europe is, though it has yet to be formally confirmed, certainly a long-awaited event. Coming after a period of dangerous tension in super-Power relations, it offers timely hope of a better future in international relations. It is naturally very important, since it will be the first genuine nuclear disarmament agreement yet reached. We therefore welcome it and applaud its achievement. \nHowever, if the agreement is to have a significant historic meaning, apart from its importance in providing a moment of d\u00e9tente in super-Power relations, which have been troubled, it should set a lead for bilateral and multilateral negotiations. It is essential from this point of view that those concerned resolutely pursue the negotiations on the gradual reduction of strategic weapons and the prevention of an arms race in space, and that agreements be drafted or finalized on the banning of nuclear tests and on the banning and destruction of chemical weapons.\nClose to Europe both in immutable geographical terms and in terms of a constantly changing history, Algeria cannot but be concerned when matters affecting Europe can affect Algeria's security, as is shown by the Maghreb's involvement in the two World Wars and the fact that it is within range of the missiles I have mentioned.\nAlgeria's promotion of extended dialogue and in-depth co-operation with the countries involved in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe process should be understood in that light. Its action, taken with the other non-aligned Mediterranean countries, as was recently demonstrated at the meeting in Brioni, Yugoslavia, is aimed at accelerating the establishment of equal security for all in the Mediterranean. In this regard, measures concerning disarmament, the relaxation of tension and the promotion o\u00a3 greater security must be extended to the whole of the Mediterranean area, because the major nuclear Powers have a special responsibility in this regard since they maintain naval fleets and weapons, including nuclear weapons, in the region.\nThat means that d\u00e9tente and understanding cannot be limited to any given region of the world, no matter how sensitive that region might be, because nuclear and conventional forces are concentrated there or because it might potentially be the scene of a major conflict. Since world peace is not divisible, nor can detente be, unless the errors of the past are to be repeated and people are to continue to be unable to lay sensible, lasting foundations for a better future for all.\nThe dividends resulting from East-West dialogue must also play a part in lessening local tensions and defusing regional hotbeds of crisis. An improvement in super-Power relations and, beyond that, the improvement in relations between the two major military alliances does not mean that the legitimate security concerns of the non-aligned countries, especially Mediterranean non-aligned countries, can be ignored.\nThus we return to the fundamental truth that the problems connected with world security are indivisible and therefore require a comprehensive, integrated approach. While the regional approach has its merits, it can validly use its specific resources in the promotion of world peace only in conditions of non-discrimination and respect for the equal right of all States to security. In the still troubled context of international relations, each of our countries must be able to contribute its brick to the edifice of peace. This is the expression of loyalty to the United Nations and faith in its ideals. It is also the essential measure of the contribution of each country to the advent of a new era in international relations - relations which we hope will bring peace, stability, security and progress for all. \nThat brick in the edifice of peace Algeria gives to the Maghreb, in the unshakeable conviction that that grouping of countries has no other choice, no other future, than that in the unity which is its natural destiny. It is a sign of our times that peoples are committed, in addition to affirming and preserving their specific identity, to seeking and finding with their neighbours and immediate or traditional partners the common interests and shared aspirations that enable them, because their concerns are the same, to overcome mistrust and past misunderstandings and formulate together a unitary project that reflects the new requirements of development and the increased need for greater security.\nThis is especially true with regard to the peoples of the Maghreb, the expression of whose genius and creativity in their daily life derives from a unique heritage of culture, religion and civilization. In order to preserve that heritage they have in the recent past, had to fight in solidarity and together make the greatest sacrifices. The great Arab Maghreb, supported by the strength that the past has given it and undaunted by present obstacles remains an aspiration for the future and is an objective to work for. My country, even before its independence, decided to commit its will, determination and means to the attainment of that objective, thus making it a strategic objective desired by the people and pursued by their leaders. It is a task which, to be worthy of the values it proclaims, cannot proceed in ignorance or with disregard of that which is essential to the authenticity and legitimacy of that unitary project: respect for the fullness of the rights of each people called upon to carry out the work. Together with the other Maghreb leaders# President Chadli Bendjedid took the initiative in moving to a new stage in the Maghreb unitary process directed towards economic integration and collective political efforts based on the Treaty of fraternity and harmony between Algeria, Tunisia and Mauritania.\nThe purpose of that initiative was to expand the prospects for joint action by the countries of the Maghreb within the framework of that Treaty and to proceed progressively and methodically in such a way that each step would prepare the next and build on solid past achievements until the ultimate goal, unity, was achieved through the will and to the advantage of all.\nWe do not underestimate either the arduous nature of the task, the scope of the problems yet to be solved or the obstacles to be overcome. Since the united Great Arab Maghreb is an inevitable reality of the future, it is necessary now to make the proper choices and ensure the determination and active participation of all. We have no doubt that in all decisive instances the proper choices will be made and the determination and participation of all will be there.\nOriginally established by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), a peace plan that is now universally endorsed sets the framework, defines the conditions and identifies the means for achieving a negotiated peaceful, just and final solution of the conflict. The essential requirement is direct negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario front, the two parties to the conflict, on the conditions for a cease-fire and a referendum on self-determination. And, finally, the referendum can only be authentic if it is free from all administrative or military constraints. The United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) are today engaged in a joint good-offices process. Algeria welcomes the joint initiative of the current Chairman of the OAU and the Secretary-General in sending a technical mission to the Territory to determine the methods necessary to ensure the holding of a credible referendum organized and monitored by the OAU and the United Nations. We hope that this mission will be able to carry out its task validly, thereby enabling the current Chairman of the OAU and the Secretary-General to submit appropriate proposals for implementing the peace plan laid down in OAU resolution 104 and endorsed only last year by the General Assembly in its resolution 41/16.\nIt goes without saying that if the conflict in Western Sahara is to be finally settled by means of a referendum, that referendum must meet the indispensable requirements of justice and regularity. The concept and the carrying out of the referendum must not, therefore, presuppose a result that would confirm and legitimise a fait accompli and thereby give the occupying force a military or administrative presence that could greatly influence the result of the referendum.\nThe continuation and consolidation of the efforts of the United Nations and the OAU demonstrate that there is the good will to give assistance and take action to ensure the end of this fratricidal conflict. That is true, particularly, of the fraternal intervention of King Fahd Ibn Abdelaziz El Saoud, the sovereign of Saudi Arabia and the guardian of the Holy Places. This is a praiseworthy intervention that deserves our greatest appreciation.\nAlgeria endeavours to add stones to the edifice of world peace wherever local tensions or regional crises call for its contribution or its efforts at the side of others. That is true of the Middle East crisis, the painful situation in fraternal Lebanon, the fratricidal conflict that is draining the finest human and material resources and potential of Iraq and Iran, and the situation in Chad, to which my county extends best wishes for national reconciliation and reconstruction in its entire territory.\nIn the Middle East, the Palestinian people continue to be the victims of an intolerable situation. They have been unjustly robbed of their homeland and are forced to struggle for the full restoration of their national rights. Forty years of struggle bear witness to the impossibility of bringing peace back to the region if the right of the Palestinians to an independent State established on their historical territory, Palestine, is not realized. A solution to the Middle East conflict inevitably requires the restoration of the occupied Arab territories, including Al-Qods Al-Sharif. Lebanon's tragedy lies at the heart of our concerns. In its cruel ordeal, it can rest assured of our solidarity. Algeria is and will remain beside it in its efforts to mobilize its forces and bring together all its sons in restored national unity and understanding, and to affirm its authority and sovereignty over all its territory ravaged by Zionist occupation.\nThe solution to the Middle East crisis must be comprehensive. It is unimaginable outside the framework of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations. Such a conference remains, in this respect, an irreplaceable requirement, since it alone can embrace all the dimensions and aspects of the crisis.\nWe are among those who believe that the idea of such a conference, or even agreeing to hold it, is not an end in itself. The important thing is to identify what is to be involved. In that respect, there are four factors that must be taken fully into account if everyone's goal today is really to ensure a just and lasting settlement of the Middle East crisis. \nFirst, there is the nature o\u00a3 the conference. Its limits and its inability to provide the real solution expected of it would become immediately apparent if it were reduced to being an umbrella covering a series of bilateral negotiations - territorial or otherwise - and failed to address itself to the central parameters of the crisis, that is, the Palestinian question. To cover up the Palestinian question would be to forget that it is and will remain the original cause of the disputes in the Middle East and that if, as such, it is not solved there can be no real peace in the region.\nSecondly, there are the powers, the competence, of the conference. How could anyone venture to relieve the United Nations of its primary responsibilities in that respect, when we know the stake it has in the issue in view of its past role in the Palestinian tragedy? The United Nations continues to have complete and full responsibilities in this question, and they must be expressed within the international conference to be convened.\nThirdly, there is the matter of participation in the conference. The Palestinian question is the central issue to be resolved, and that cannot be done if its authentic representatives are absent and their aspirations and wishes are excluded - for they are the only representatives who can validly formulate and defend those aspirations and wishes.\nFourthly, there is the objective of the conference. How could that be anything but simple recognition of this natural right recognized by everyone; the right to self-determination, through the exercise of which the Palestinians would regain their homeland?\nThe war between Iraq and Iran continues. Today it is spreading dangerously in the Gulf, putting at risk the security and stability of fraternal countries in the region. This war, which is now in its eighth year, has become one of the bloodiest and most devastating in modern times. It is being waged to the increasing detriment of the real interests of the peoples of Iran and Iraq. But an inevitably common destiny requires them to work harder to identify the ways and means of finally bringing a peaceful end to their conflict so that, together, they can resolutely devote their potential to all the areas of solidarity which today unite the third world, faced with so many challenges. The Secretary-General is working to bring the war to a halt. Algeria cannot but encourage and support him in the peace endeavours entrusted to him by the Security Council so that the Gulf can once again be a region of understanding and co-operation and peace and world security can be preserved.\nAlgeria is an active partner in all the struggles being waged by Africa in a striking example of the mobilization of resources. In its efforts to attain full liberation and to foster its development, our continent is unfailingly and untiringly meeting its responsibilities. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) is playing a vital strategic role in this respect. It is up to the international community to meet its responsibilities towards a continent unfortunately characterized by, inter alia, persistent racial domination and an unparalleled state of underdevelopment. \nIn southern Africa, one cannot but admire the determination of the people of South Africa in their struggle fully to regain their rights and to throw out apartheid, which is stepping up its repression even as it is increasingly being abandoned by the sources of support that once justified its existence and provided the resources it needed for survival. The struggle of the people of South Africa under the leadership of the African National Congress ,(ANC) and the struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) are exemplary in terms of their achievements and the scale of the sacrifices they have made and represent one of the key lessons of the late twentieth century, which will finally see the end of racial oppression. Today, at this late stage, when energetic measures under Chapter VII of the Charter have still not been taken, one wonders how such a crime against humanity, a crime condemned by history, could have been committed and allowed to continue without evoking the necessary determination to put an end to it. At the very least we are duty-bound to ensure that the peoples of South Africa, Namibia and the front-line States receive the decisive support called for in this final phase of their struggle.\nThe border dispute between Chad and Libya has mobilized the resources of the OAU, which has demonstrated its capacity to provide the framework for the search for and attainment of a solution to the dispute. The committee of Heads of State set up by the OAU, which met recently in Lusaka, Zambia, has mapped out the appropriate path to be followed, which represents a significant and promising first step. Libya and Chad, whose proximity demands that they co-operate and reach an understanding, will, we trust find within themselves the sense of responsibility and courage necessary to ensure that what divides them today will tomorrow yield to mutual respect, understanding and progress for these two brother peoples.\nIn Central America, real prospects of achieving a lasting peace and co-operation in the interests of all the peoples of the area have emerged, thanks to the peace plan agreed upon in Guatemala on 7 August and the dedication of President Arias of Costa Rica and the other Central American leaders. This supplements the tireless efforts of the Contadora and Lima Groups. It is to be hoped that this agreement will enjoy the sincere and unreserved support of all who are in a position to assist in the restoration of peace and harmony in the region.\nAlgeria hails the political, economic and social achievements of Latin America and sincerely hopes they can be consolidated for the benefit of the peoples of Latin America so that their group of nations can reaffirm its place and confirm its role with respect to the defence of the essential cause of the Non-Aligned Movement and the developing world. \nIn Harare, at the summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement, and in Brioni recently, at the ministerial conference of Mediterranean members of the movement, our countries made clear their views on the question of Cyprus. My country identifies with their stated position, endorses it and hopes it will provide the basis for a solution.\nThe present system of contemporary international relations is a source of instability for all and an impediment for the developing countries. This fact prompted certain remarks made before the Group of 77, which I should like to share with the Assembly today:\nFirst, the developing world has lived up to its internal responsibilities with respect to development, but that has proved far from adequate.\nSecondly, the internal adjustments made by the developing world, at great political, economic and social cost, did not provide the expected result - far from it. At the very best, they had a negligible effect, as a result of the rigidity and inappropriateness of the external economic environment.\nThirdly, these internal adjustments have shown the vital need for comprehensive structural adjustments, are necessary now, if on all sides there really exists the political will to receive the structural development crisis which the present system of international economic relations has created and serves to perpetuate.\nFourthly, to talk about comprehensive structural adjustments inevitably implies the involvement of the United Nations, one of whose essential goals is to promote international co-operation for the well-being of all peoples.\nHence, fifthly, the need for a reinvigorated North-South dialogue with precise objectives. The future of peace lies in disarmament and development, which are indissolubly linked and interdependent. Sixthly, and lastly, at a time when the North-South dialogue is dwindling, the United Nations has the duty to revitalize it, with our assistance and co-operation. The United Nations finds itself today at the crossroads. It must take up problems relating to the very survival of mankind at a time when the Organization sees its very existence threatened. On the one hand, we have a devastating nuclear arms race, which threatens the survival of life on our planet; on the other hand, we have a proportion of mankind whose precarious economic conditions have resulted in the tragic impossibility of assuring the basic means of survival. One is as morally unjustifiable as the other is in terms of common humanity. This dramatic situation was highlighted at a recent conference which pointed to ways for dealing with the disarmament-development equation.\nThe pursuit and attainment of these objectives cannot be conceived without the United Nations, which must recover the vitality of its role and the full complement of its resources.\nThere is no alternative to the preservation and strengthening of the role of the United Nations. If, in this respect, reforms are necessary to enhance its efficiency and if it can be shown that there is room for structural improvements, we all have the duty to encourage this and contribute to it. But as the international situation makes clear, one cannot dispense with this tool, the only one available to mankind to pool the efforts of all and, finally, offer the prospect of universal peace and progress.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIn the name of the Chinese delegation, may I begin by warmly congratulating you. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. I am sure that with your ability, wisdom and experience, you will fulfil this noble mission with distinction. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation and thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Choudhury, for his positive contribution to the work of the previous session.\nOver the past year, people of the world have made unremitting efforts on various fronts in pursuit of peace and development and achieved new and encouraging results. The third world and many small and medium-sized countries have played an active role in international affairs, exerting an increasingly great influence. This shows that the forces for peace have grown in strength. There have been ever-stronger demands for a halt to the arms race and to aggression and expansion, and for genuine disarmament and an early settlement of regional conflicts. Under the circumstances, the United States and the Soviet Union have kept up their dialogue and there has appeared a somewhat relaxed atmosphere in East-West relations.\nHowever, factors causing international tension and turbulence are still present. The arms race, far from coming to a halt, is extending into outer space and other high technology fields. None of the hot-spots in the world has been removed, and certain regional conflicts even threaten to escalate. The world economic situation remains grim. Many developing countries are faced with increasing difficulties and the North-South contradiction has become more acute than ever. All this cannot but cause grave concern to China and all the other countries which uphold justice and strive for peace and development. In order to join in a common search for effective solutions to those problems, I now wish to set forth the Chinese Government's position and propositions. \nIt is the universal demand of the world's people and the consistent stand of the Chinese Government to stop the arms race and to remove regional conflicts. Effective disarmament constitutes an important link in the efforts to ease international tension and to maintain world peace. Since the resumption of the Geneva arms control talks between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1985, we have all along hoped that they would, through serious negotiations, reach agreements conducive to world peace and not detrimental to the rights and interests of other countries. Now there has been progress in their intermediate nuclear forces (INF) talks. The two sides have reached agreement in principle to adopt the global \\\"double-zero option\\\" on long range intermediate nuclear forces and short range intermediate nuclear forces. We hold that dialogue is better than confrontation, and relaxation better than tension. World peace is indivisible, and European security and Asian security are equally important. If the United States and the Soviet Union could formally conclude an INF treaty and implement it by thoroughly destroying all their long-range intermediate nuclear missiles and short-range intermediate nuclear missiles deployed in Europe and Asia, that would be a first step towards nuclear arms reduction and would undoubtedly be welcomed.\nOf course, there is still a long way to go and much work to do before genuine disarmament can be realized. Even with the long range intermediate nuclear forces and short range intermediate nuclear forces dismantled, the nuclear weaponry of the United States and the Soviet Union would only be reduced by less than 5 per cent and each would still retain a nuclear force capable of destroying the world several times over. To maintain world peace and security, there should be complete prohibition and thorough destruction of all types of nuclear, space, chemical and biological weapons as well as other weapons of mass destruction, and a substantial reduction of conventional arms. \nThe people of all countries long for development in peace. Disarmament is an urgent task, but the disarmament talks have been proceeding very slowly, since the INF talks alone have dragged on for almost six years, negotiations on strategic arms reduction or other disarmament issues will be even more difficult. If things move along at this pace, when could the approximately 50,000 nuclear warheads ever be destroyed completely? When could the above disarmament goals ever be reached? Naturally, the international community strongly hopes that the United States and the Soviet Union will drastically reduce their armaments as soon as possible, and that after reaching an INF agreement they will proceed to conduct earnest negotiations on disarmament in other areas and reach agreements followed by effective implementation. They should not stand still, let alone vie with each other in developing new types of even more sophisticated weapons in the wake of an agreement to dismantle INF missiles.\nIn order to promote disarmament, the Chinese delegation last year submitted to the General Assembly two draft resolutions on nuclear and conventional disarmament, which were adopted with the broad support of other United Nations Members. The two draft resolutions emphasized that the countries possessing the largest arsenals bear a special responsibility for disarmament and should take the lead in drastically reducing their nuclear and conventional armaments. This is the key to progress in disarmament. In the world today, it is the United States and the Soviet Union that possess the largest nuclear and conventional arsenals, and they alone are capable of launching a world war. if they could take the lead in drastic arms reduction, the threats to world peace would be greatly diminished.\nChina has not only actively put forward its views and proposals on disarmament, but has also taken a series of concrete actions towards disarmament. On the very first day when China came into possession of nuclear weapons, in 1964, we declared unilaterally that at no time and under no circumstances would China be the first to use nuclear weapons. We have also undertaken not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States or nuclear-free zones. We neither advocate nor go in for nuclear proliferation; we do not help other countries develop nuclear weapons. China respects and supports the countries and regions concerned in their endeavour to establish nuclear-free zones or zones of peace on the basis of voluntary agreement to be reached through consultation among themselves. We have signed the additional protocols of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. Furthermore, in recent years we have stopped atmospheric nuclear testing, reduced the size of our armed forces by one million and cut down our military expenditures. We have also shifted some military industrial facilities to civilian production and put some military installations to civilian use or dual use.\nDisarmament is an arduous and complicated task. Progress in disarmament requires the good faith of the countries concerned and, more importantly, the persistent efforts of all peace-loving countries and people. On the question of disarmament, which concerns the future of the world and the destiny of mankind, all countries, whether big, small or medium-sized, nuclear or non-nuclear, should have an equal say, and each has a positive role to play. Europe experienced the holocaust of two world wars and is now a place of direct confrontation between the two major military blocs. East and West European countries are particularly concerned about disarmament, which is closely related to their own security, and have played an important role in promoting the United States-Soviet arms control talks. When addressing the question of disarmament, the legitimate rights and interests and reasonable proposals of every country should be fully respected and taken into serious consideration.  Disarmament agreements of any kind should help to enhance the security of every country and region in the world and not to weaken \nHere I should like to refer to the recently concluded International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which unanimously adopted the final document through the concerted efforts of all sides. That Conference is of positive significance in heightening the international community's awareness of the close relationship between disarmament and development,\nA fair and reasonable settlement of regional conflicts and the elimination of hot-spots are of great importance in easing international tension and safeguarding world peace. Despite the efforts made by the United Nations and by many justice-upholding countries towards this end in the past year, no substantive progress has been made so far. That is essentially because certain countries, in disregard of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the basic norms governing international relations, have refused to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions and have persisted in their policies of aggression and expansion. They have continued their occupation of other countries' territories and have kept encroaching upon others' sovereignty and interfering in others' internal affairs. As a result, regional conflicts have been continuing and it is difficult to remove the hot-spots in the world. \nChina Is consistently opposed to the threat or use of force In International relations and Is all the more opposed to acts of aggression and Interference against other countries by any country under whatever pretext. It Is our view that the commission of aggression by one country against another Is the most serious international crime, which must in no way be confounded with the Internal problems of the country under aggression. China has always maintained that the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence should be strictly observed by all countries in the world. We are in favour of a fair and reasonable political settlement of any regional conflict, because it is in the fundamental interests of the countries concerned and of world peace.\nTo achieve a fair and reasonable political settlement of a regional conflict, the primary requirement is to stop aggression and expansion against, and terminate military occupation of, other countries. Foreign troops must immediately and unconditionally withdraw from the territories they occupy, and the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the countries under aggression must be restored. No country can get away with keeping the gains of aggression and expansion under the pretext of a \\\"political settlement\\\".\nTo achieve a fair and reasonable political settlement of a regional conflict, it is also necessary for the people of the countries or regions concerned to solve their own problems, free from outside interference, and to observe the principle of genuine self-determination. Disputes between States should be settled by the countries concerned through negotiations, in line with the basic norms governing international relations. Internal disputes of a country should be settled by its own people. To achieve a fair and reasonable political settlement of a regional conflict/ all parties concerned must observe the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the five principles of peaceful co-existence.\nThe key to the settlement of the Kampuchean question lies in Viet Nam's cessation of its aggression and the speedy withdrawal of all its troops from Kampuchea. The United Nations General Assembly has adopted many resolutions in this regard. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (AS\u00a3AN) and other justice-upholding countries have also made sustained efforts to seek a political settlement of the question. Under the pressure of international public opinion, the Vietnamese authorities have over the year talked a lot about a \\\"political settlement\\\" but have in fact failed to show any sincerity. Their stubborn position of aggression and expansion has remained unchanged. Up till now, they have continued with their military occupation of Kampuchea under various pretexts, in defiance of the relevant United Nations resolutions. Being clearly the aggressor, the Vietnamese authorities bear an unshirkable responsibility on the question of Kampuchea. Yet, they brazenly try to disguise themselves as an outsider, insisting that Kampuchea's \\\"national reconciliation\\\" must come before their troop withdrawal. The kind of \\\"political settlement\\\" they have proposed is, to put it bluntly, designed to make the International community accept the Vietnamese aggression and occupation of Kampuchea as a fait accompli, prop up a Vietnamese-controlled \\\"government\\\" and ensure the Vietnamese vested interests gained through aggression and expansion. This is of course unacceptable to the coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, the ASEAN countries and all justice-upholding countries and people.\nChina seeks no self-interest in Kampuchea. Our principled position on the Kampuchean question is to safeguard the norms governing international relations,\noppose aggression and uphold justice. We consider it essential to include in\n \n\nearnest the relevant resolutions of the previous sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, we support Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the ASEAN countries and the United Nations Secretary-General in their efforts to seek a just and reasonable settlement of the Kampuchean question. The eight-point proposal on a political settlement of the Kampuchean question put forward by the coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk is fair and reasonable. It has won extensive sympathy and support from the international community and should serve as the basis for the settlement of the Kampuchean question. We are confident that provided Viet Nam withdraws all its troops from Kampuchea under international supervision, the Kampuchean people, led by the prestigious, great patriot Prince Norodom Sihanouk, will solve their internal problems through consultation free from outside interference, effect true national reconciliation and choose their new government through United Nations-supervised free elections, so that Kampuchea will become an independent, peaceful, neutral and non-aligned country. This will be in the interest of peace and stability in that region and in the rest of South-East Asia. Once the parties concerned reach agreement on a settlement of the Kampuchean question, China will be ready to join other countries in a relevant international guarantee.\nThe \\\"cease-fire\\\" declared by the Kabul regime has not put an end to the war in Afghanistan. As a matter of fact, the encirclement and suppression of the resistance movement, the killing of innocent civilians and incursions into Pakistan have been going on all the same. As long as the foreign aggressors do not\t.\nwithdraw, the war of resistance to aggression will not stop. It is clear that \\\"guarantee first, troop withdrawal next\\\" or \\\"reconciliation first, troop withdrawal afterwards\\\" are nothing but excuses for putting off the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. If the Soviet Union really wants a political settlement, it should\ncomply with the relevant resolutions of successive sessions of the United Nations\n \nGeneral Assembly and withdraw all its troops from there as soon as possible. This is the key to the settlement of the Afghan Question and the only way to heal the \\\"bleeding wound\\\". We support Pakistan and other countries concerned and the United Nations in their efforts for a fair and reasonable settlement of the Afghan question. It is our hope that Afghanistan will regain its status as an independent, sovereign, neutral and non-aligned country at an early state.\nThe convening of an international conference on the Middle East question under the auspices of the United Nations is a feasible way to seek a peaceful settlement of the said question. The Chinese Government supports the United Nations Secretary-General's efforts towards this end. We hold that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), recognized internationally as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, has the tight to participate in the conference on an equal footing with other members. China is always opposed to the Israeli policy of aggression and expansion and firmly supports the just struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples to recover the occupied territories and restore their national rights. We sincerely hope that the Arab countries and the PLO will remove their differences through friendly consultations, close their ranks and co-ordinate their actions in a common endeavour towards an early, just and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East question.\nAt present, the situation in the Gulf is becoming more turbulent, with sharp confrontation in the region. The Chinese Government has expressed grave concern over this. We have all along taken a position of neutrality and of promoting reconciliation between Iran and Iraq and have urged them to bury the hatchet as soon as possible, engage in peaceful reconstruction and strive for further development rather than wearing themselves out in the war. Security Council resolution 598 (1987)\\\" adopted unanimously by the Security Council through concerted efforts by all the members reflects the strong desire of the international community for e speedy end to the Iran-Iraq conflict and has provided a good basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. We appreciate the valuable contributions made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the implementation of this resolution and support him in his continued endeavours to ensure this. China has made and will continue to make efforts to promote comprehensive implementation of the resolution. With the desire to see an early end to the sanguinary conflict and the restoration of peace stability and prosperity In the Gulf region, the Chinese Government once again calls upon Iran and Iraq to stop immediately all their military actions and to implement Security Council resolution 598 (1987) in real earnest, in co-operation with the Security Council and the Secretary-General, so as to seek a just, reasonable and comprehensive settlement of the Iran-Iraq dispute. The Chinese Government also calls on the parties concerned to exercise restraint and ensure free and safe passage in the international waterways in the Gulf. It further calls on the big Powers to stop their military involvement in the Gulf so as to avoid escalation of the conflict, leaving the littoral countries of the Gulf to solve the Gulf problems themselves through consultations.\nOver the past year there has been an ever-surging movement in South Africa and Namibia, with a steady growth of the struggle against the foreign rule and for national liberation and independence. The South African racist regime, though more and more isolated, la clinging obstinately to its apartheid system and brutally suppressing the South African people. It has kept Namibia under its illegal occupation and wilfully harassed its neighbours, trying hard to delay and Obstruct settlement of the problem of southern Africa. The Chinese Government strongly condemns the perverse acts of the South African authorities. We will, as always, firmly support the just struggle of the peoples of South Africa, Namibia and the rest of southern Africa. We call on the international community, and particularly countries that have influence with South Africa, to support the struggle of the peoples in southern Africa and, through further pressure and effective sanctions, force the South African authorities to abandon their policies of apartheid and of destabilizing the neighbouring countries and implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978) unconditionally, thus paving the way for the early independence of Namibia.\nRecently, an important step forward has at last been taken in the peace process in Central America after repeated setbacks. The document entitled \\\"Process for the establishment of firm and lasting peace in Central America\\\", signed more than a month ago at a summit meeting of five Central American States, is of positive significance in easing the tension and turbulence in the region. That document gives expression to the desire of the Central American States for peace and is a result of the peace mediation of the Contadora and Lima groups. We sincerely hope that all the parties concerned will respect the hard-won achievements of the meeting so as to facilitate the smooth implementation of that accord and bring about peace and stability in Central America at an early date without interference from outside.\nTension on the Korean peninsula can be eased only through reduced military confrontation and increased contacts and dialogue between the north and the south of Korea. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has recently put forward successive proposals, such as phased disarmament by both the north and the south, withdrawal of United States troops and tripartite talks by the north and south of Korea and the United States at the Foreign Minister level. Those proposals are constructive and reasonable and we hope that they will receive a favourable response from the parties concerned.\nThe present world economic situation is yet another major issue about which the international community is deeply concerned. Over the past year economic growth in developed countries has remained slow and the economic friction among them has been exacerbated. The developing countries are faced with unprecedented serious difficulties owing to their worsening external economic environment. The prices of many of their primary products have remained at the lowest level since the end of the Second World War, while the export of their manufactured goods has been hindered by ever-increasing trade protectionism. The export earnings of the developing countries have plummeted, while the inflow of funds has dropped drastically. The debts of developing countries, which exceeded $US 1 trillion last year, are weighing more and more heavily on them. Under the circumstances, their economic growth on the whole remains very slow and their difficulties are mounting, although they have made strenuous efforts to achieve economic readjustments or reforms. In the case of the least developed countries, there are even more difficulties.\nThe world economy is an integral whole. The North and the South need each other and are interdependent. The economic stagnation and growing poverty of developing countries are bound to affect the world economy as a whole and, naturally, the economic growth of the developed countries. Those that benefit the world will benefit from the world. The developed countries should do their best to improve the world economic environment and help developing countries overcome their economic difficulties. To this end, we wish to put forward the following propositions.\nFirst, the developed countries should adopt measures to stabilize the prices of primary products and provide financial assistance to the developing countries for diversifying their export commodities so as to help stabilize and increase their export earnings. \nSecondly, the developed countries should honour their commitment to reduce and stop protectionist trade practices. They should also expand the treatment granted to the developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences. The interests of the developing countries should be taken fully into account in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations.\nThirdly, the developed countries should try to fulfil as early as possible the official development assistance quotas set by the United Nations and provide more funds to the developing countries in other forms. International financial bodies should also make efforts to provide funds to the developing countries on favourable terms in the light of their actual conditions.\nFourthly, debtor and creditor nations, international financial institutions and commercial banks should share the responsibility for the solution of the debt problem and agree upon practical measures through continued dialogue so as to reduce as much as possible the debt burdens of the developing countries.\nFifthly, special preferential treatment should be given to the least developed countries in respect of trade, funds, assistance and debt, and effective measures should be adopted to implement the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, approved unanimously by the special session of the United Nations General Assembly last year.\nDuring the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) held not long ago there were extensive discussions on such questions as the development of resources, commodities, world trade and the least developed countries, thereby creating favourable conditions for the furtherance of the North-south dialogue. We hope that at the current session the General Assembly will make new progress on this basis in its deliberations on the Questions concerned. We hold that the developed and developing countries should continue and step up dialogue and work together to establish a new type of North-South relationship, a just and rational relationship based on equality and mutual benefit, so as to strengthen international co-operation and revitalize the world economy.\nChina is marching forward along the road of building a socialist society with Chinese characteristics. Now, stability and unity prevail throughout the country. Reform and the open policy are being implemented steadfastly. The Chinese economic registers a sustained and steady growth, and the people's living standards keep improving. Of course, we are fully aware that China's productive forces are cooperatively weak and its economic relatively backward. China is still at the Initial stage of socialism. During this fairly long historical period, our main: task is vigorously to expand the productive forces so that China will gradually lift itself out of poverty, backwardness and underdevelopment. To this end, we must persist in reform and opening up at home and to the outside world, work hard to develop a planned commodity economy and continue to expand our economic and technological exchange and co-operation with other countries in the world, leading to a dynamic and rapid development of the productive forces. The forthcoming thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China will review the historic changes that have taken place in China in the past nine years, reaffirm a series of fundamental principles and policies that have proved effective and give a theoretical exposition of reform and the open policy. The Congress will draw up new plans aimed at accelerating and deepening the economic structural reform, and work out a blueprint for political structural reform with a view to promoting the cause of socialist modernization.\nLike reform and the open policy, China's independent foreign policy of peace is also our fundamental State policy which will remain unchanged for a long time. By pursuing this policy, China aims at both securing a lasting international environment of peace for our socialist modernization drive, and fulfilling its responsibilities and obligations for world peace and development in tune with international developments. The policy is in keeping with the fundamental interests of the people both of China and of the world as a whole. By persisting in reform and the open policy as well as in the independent foreign policy of peace, China will develop faster and contribute more to mankind.\nAs the most important global organization of our time, the United Nations is playing an important role in maintaining peace, promoting development and strengthening co-operation. We are glad to see that such a role is being further strengthened. At its last session, the United Nations General Assembly adopted - through efforts on various sides - the resolution on the strengthening of administrative and financial efficiency of the United Nations. At present, the United Nations is at a critical juncture of its reform. We support this world body in its efforts to introduce necessary and rational reforms so as further to improve its efficacy and give better expression to the purposes of the Charter. The United Nations is the Organization of all the countries in the world, and it needs the support of all its Member States. It is our hope that the big Power directly responsible for the current financial difficulties will fulfil its obligations as provided for by the Charter. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China will, as always, strictly abide by the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and discharge its obligations in real earnest. We are ready, together with other Member States, to make our contributions to further strengthening of the role of the United Nations in its many areas of endeavour.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI wish first, Sir, to congratulate you on your election to the vice-presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. I should be grateful if you would be good enough to convey to Ambassador Peter Florin the congratulations of our delegation on his election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. That election is a tribute both to his talents as a veteran diplomat and to his country, the German Democratic Republic, with which Burkina Faso enjoys the best possible relations. It is with genuine pleasure that I thus offer you both my congratulations and those of my delegation.\nFurthermore, I wish to pay a sincere and well-deserved tribute to Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, who presided so successfully over the forty-first session. I take this opportunity to reaffirm our active support and encouragement for the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and an appreciation of his ceaseless and tireless efforts to defend the noble ideals of our Organization.\nWe meet here each year to exchange views and consider together international problems and matters of common interest. We meet to seek together solutions to our problems, not only those that divide us but also those faced by each of our States individually.\nUnfortunately, year after year, we have gradually found ourselves in a Tower of Babel, in which the most varied languages mingle: the voice of the West, the voice of the East, the voice of the Non-Aligned, the voice of the aligned of the non-aligned - all are heard in the ensuing cacophony. Feelings of fraternity and friendship are long since dead. They have given way to the arguments of force and the language of material interests. The conduct of the economically and militarily powerful nations convinces us more and more finally each day that in the court of the international community one is guilty or innocent depending on whether one is powerful or weak. Equality, sovereignty and independence are more and more becoming words devoid of meaning.\nI should like to make some simple observations to illustrate this point: first, let us take participation in the general debate at the annual sessions. At these we see that the General Assembly Hall is crammed when certain delegations speak and empties with deplorable rapidity when their statements are over. To listen to these same speakers our various delegations attend in force with as many people as possible; but how many of those same delegations will be represented in this Hall by the I4inister, or even by the Permanent Representative, when it comes the turn of Burkina Faso or any of the small States to make their contribution to our debate? This conduct is not without significance. It is actually the deliberate assertion of the superiority of some over others, what else could it be, when luncheons and dinners are organized in honour of African, Asian and Latin American delegations, to which they are actually invited by those who have not even bothered to come and listen to them?\nAfrica is indeed suffering from hunger, as ate Asia and Latin America. This is a grim reality on which we cannot turn our backs and of which we are trying to rid ourselves, but what our different continents are really suffering from is hunger for justice, liberty, independence and dignity. The sessions of the General Assembly should constitute special opportunities where a mutually enriching exchange takes place, not a jungle where might is right. Rhetorical hurly-burly, the cut-and-thrust debate, are very far from reflecting the vigorous and dynamic give-and-take which should De the form our discussions take. And this testifies to the burning desire we all share, to transform our world to serve the well\u2014being of our peoples.\nOur Organization can be effective and work for peace in the world only when it is agreed in this very place to give each of our States, particularly the most underprivileged of them, the consideration they merit, not on account of what they wish they could be, but on account of what they are.\nI have chosen to open my statement with these somewhat, as it may appear to some, unusual words, because the inability to produce appropriate solutions to the problems besetting our world is nothing more than a true reflection of the state of our morale, as sessions succeed sessions, as statements follow statements, the chaotic situation of the world shows no visible sign of improvement: there are the same hotbeds of tension; the same crying imbalances; the same injustices; the same feats continue to weigh upon us.\nIn spite of all we have said. President Samora Machel fell victim to our irresolution and inconsistency. Glory and honour to his memory! This dastardly and barbarous crime will not even have touched the consciences of those who set themselves up as the policemen of the world.\nIn southern Africa there persists a situation which is an offence to human dignity, to the rules of international law, and to our Organization. The abominable Pretoria regime has succeeded in numbing the conscience of the international community and in reducing it to apathy in the face of the indescribable sufferings caused by apartheid and the odious crimes which it commits every day. Otherwise how to explain the fact that apartheid, a crime against humanity, as it has been branded here, cannot be punished as such?\nWhile some handle the situation with kid gloves, or refuse to get involved, the minority, because it is white, oppresses and does violence to, and even slaughters without scruple the majority, whose sole crime is that they are black. In this hell, the freedom fighters and the martyred black people of South Africa continue their stoic struggle.\nThe recent strikes, which led to the foreseeable consequence of the firing of many workers, the murder of women and children and of members of the black opposition, are the latest testimony to the determination of the majority to triumph over apartheid at whatever price.\nThe Burkinab\u00e9 revolution, for its part, is resolutely committed to the support of those fighting for freedom and dignity. Thus our people has channelled its assistance to its South African brothers through an anti-apartheid struggle fund made up of voluntary contributions. Furthermore, arrangements have been made to convene in Ouagadougou/ from 8 to 11 October 1987 - in just a few days, m fact - an anti-apartheid forum. The organizing committee for this international forum is known as Bambata, in memory of the valiant South African fighter so basely murdered by the Pretoria criminals. This international meeting will we hope help to awaken the peoples of the world to the relentless struggle being waged so valiantly by the African National Congress and other liberation movements in South Africa to put an end to the heinous system of apartheid,\nBurkina Paso, which shares the ideals of the freedom fighters in their bid to establish a multiracial and democratic society, believes, for its part, that a South Africa freed from apartheid will be of invaluable assistance for the rehabilitation and enhancement of human dignity. \nIn this regard, permit me, as we have done in the past with regard to other countries, to welcome the decision of Canada to apply sanctions and if necessary to go so far as to break off diplomatic relations with the racist regime of South Africa.\nIn spite of all we have said, South Africa has remained deaf to our words. In Namibia, the symbol of the powerlessness of our Organization, South Africa, with the aid of its imperialist allies and flouting Security Council resolution 435 (1978), continues to plunder the wealth and trample underfoot the rights of the peoples to self-determination. Burkina Faso reiterates its support for the South West Africa People's Organization, the sole representative of the valiant Namibian people. Similarly, Burkina Faso reaffirms its support and active solidarity with the African brothers in the front line who, every day, are suffering from the destabilizing attacks of the Pretoria racist regime launched from Namibian territory, without those who dominate us and believe they have a world mission, even deigning to lift a finger.\nIn spite of all we have said, we have been unable to prevent the explosion of the situation in Chad. This situation is of the greatest concern to my country, because/ without doubt, it constitutes a threat to peace and security in Africa. All peace-loving nations, particularly the members of the Organization of African Unity, must do everything in their power to create the necessary conditions for national unity in Chad, by the withdrawal of foreign troops and by the halting of all forms of foreign intervention.\nIt is, in any case, from this standpoint, that Burkina Faso is making mediation efforts between the fraternal States of Libya and Chad, and also among the various opposing factions in the Chadian political arena. At a time when all of us are striving to do our very best to serve peace wherever it is threatened or breached, to do the work of reconciliation and to ensure that the Chadians and Libyans choose the force of argument over the argument of brutal and blind force, it is simply regrettable that - here in this very Hall certain delegations are still exploiting the sufferings of these two countries by making unconstructive statements. I say that because, if it had been that easy to decide between two States facing a frontier problem inherited from colonialism, Burkina Faso and Mali would have avoided a fratricidal war.\nLet us therefore leave it to the Organization of African Unity (OAJ) and give them time to pursue their efforts. The results reached by our organization at Lusaka show, if evidence is needed, that to restore confidence and peace between those two fraternal States is not beyond Africa's power, only provided that there is a will to put an end to external interference.\nOn the question of Western Sahara, Burkina Faso\u2019s position has not changed. Here again, more than a decade of discussion has done nothing to bring about the necessary solutions. My country hopes that Morocco will do everything necessary to make possible the success of the Secretary-General\u2019s endeavour.\nWe have for many years now spoken of the Middle East, in particular of the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories where the same misery persists. Yet we continue to watch, powerless or passive, or perhaps both, the application of the principle that might is right - in this case the might belongs to the Israeli occupier. Here, again, our Organization has not succeeded in granting the Palestinian people its inalienable right to an independent and sovereign State. Here, too, the powerful countries of the world have never felt it necessary to try to bring Israel to its senses by any kind of constraint.\nLebanon is dying slowly - and that in spite of all we have said. More than ever we have grounds for fearing that external interference will jeopardize the very existence of the Lebanese State and the sovereignty of its people. Burkina Faso hopes that President Gemayel's appeal, made here last September, will be heeded and that, consequently, there will be as soon as possible the withdrawal of all foreign troops - with the exception, of course, of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). \nWe have been speaking for nine years now about the hotbed of tension created by the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq\u00b7, today it is the focus of attention. The world is preoccupied by it. People are talking, without the slightest embarrassment, of an embargo. No one seems to be worried or to take into account what we have said. The argument of force has become a necessity to which my country has resolutely refused to subscribe, because the motive behind this attitude is not to put an end to the loss of human life and economic damage caused by nine years of armed confrontation, not to preserve peace in the region, but to protect certain interests. I should like to remind representatives that when the question of mining Nicaraguan ports was raised there were not too many persons around who wanted to put matters right.\nHowever, we can only reiterate our urgent appeals to those two countries, to which we are bound by our common membership of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, to halt hostilities and prevent others from exploiting them to lead the world into an irretrievable situation.\nWe take this opportunity to welcome the Secretary-General's efforts to bring peace to that part of the world. The contribution my country has always attempted to make to the search for a final solution to this conflict is aimed, first and above all, at preserving our Organization's credibility. Halting hostilities - something my country earnestly hopes for - is not and cannot be exclusive of the objective establishment of the responsibilities of the parties to the conflict.\nPeace in Asia remains seriously jeopardized owing to the situation in Kampuchea. We can only hope for the rapid establishment of an honourable peace for the peaceful reunification of Korea has not yet cone about, although we have been talking about it every year. The efforts undertaken to transform our quest into reality have been undermined by divisive forces emanating from outside Korea.\nIn Afghanistan recent manifestations of national reconciliation give us grounds for hoping that that hotbed of tension will soon be extinguished. That process can only be helped by the withdrawal of Soviet troops.\nWe have been speaking out for many years. But because we are small and have no means of coercion the arms race has been going full steam ahead. Today it. has reached pinnacles which are indeed frightening to those who yesterday were undertaking it with relish. Now the need is to disarm.\nAs I stressed here last year, mankind's greatest tragedy at the end of the twentieth century is what super armament, particularly with nuclear weapons, has wrought. Indeed, apart from the fear caused in those who are able to measure its consequences, there is the grim reality that the arms race has devoured vast human and material resources - the very resources we should be devoting to general and complete disarmament. In this context, our hopes of seeing these resources placed at the service of development are becoming rather slim.\nAmong the problems that this year are still undermining our world is the international economic crisis resulting from the imbalance in relations between industrialized and developing countries. Its main factors are: a hostile international environment, ever worsening terms of trade, continued decline in commodity prices, an alarming reduction in the flow of financial resources, and problems of external debt and its servicing. This last factor is without doubt the key to the crisis, because its solution, owing to a chain effect, would lead to the \u00b7 solution of the other factors. \nThe peaceful reunification of Korea has not yet come about, although we have been talking about it every year.

Halting hostilities - something my country earnestly hopes for - is not and cannot be exclusive of the objective establishment of the responsibilities of the parties to the conflict.\nPeace in Asia remains seriously jeopardized owing to the situation in Kampuchea. We can only hope for the rapid establishment of an honourable peace. Burkina Faso, whose position on this is well known, nevertheless believes that if the debt problem is to be the subject of a compromise in view of the present tendency of the debtor countries this problem will be solved by an indexation of repayments pegged to export earnings, an indexation that would take account of both the capacity to repay and the development effort of the debtor.\nIt is clear that the current context of crisis and imbalance in the world economy make even more difficult the task of development of countries like Burkina Paso.\nThe process of intensive development laid down two years ago to give our country an economic infrastructure still remains at the mercy of natural calamities, in spite of efforts and sacrifices made at the national level. For example, a drought is always possible, as is an invasion of locusts, and we are also at the mercy of international financing. In spite of those difficulties we have every hope of achieving certain objectives, including the creation of a communications infrastructure to help in opening up the country, and food self-sufficiency by a consistent water-supply policy and by placing emphasis on the modernization the agriculture and livestock sectors, setting up an agro-industry and, above all, fighting desertification.\nWith regard to the last point, it is worth pointing out that for two years now our people have been waging an intensive struggle to restore the equilibrium of the ecosystem. That action has been undertaken on three fronts and has been known as \\\"the three struggles\\\". The first is a series of measures to put an end to a traditional practice which is eroding the vegetation cover: these are bush fires usually caused by peasants in the course of hunting or clearing fields. The second is an attempt to regulate the uncontrolled collecting of fire-wood in order to protect trees and forests. The third struggle concerns the moving around of animals which, owing to the effect of unorganised pasturing, is causing the destruction of the flora.\nFurthermore, and still in the area of the struggle against desertification, Burkina Faso envisages a vast programme of re-the forestation. This is a green belt project, because it consists of \\\"ringing\\\" the zone most heavily affected by drought with a wooded strip that could be as broad as 25 kilometres to prevent the advance of the desert. In view of its scope, such a programme will require vast resources for its implementation and these are not fully available to my country. It remains our hope that the international community will participate, effectively and efficiently, in implement ting this project, the importance of which is, I am sure, clear to everyone.\nIn the implementation of our development process there is a factor to which Burkina Paso gives absolute priority, namely, the integration of women into all sectors.\nOn 8 Match 1987 in Ouagadougou we celebrated the International Day of Women. On that occasion the President of the National Council of Revolution, the President of our country, Comrade Thomas Sankara, announced the forthcoming adoption of a national action plan for the Burkinab\u00e9 woman. This plan of action, and I quote the President; \\\"far from being a catalogue of pious wishes, has to be the lightening conductor for the intensification of revolutionary action\\\". This will testify once again to the great importance which our people intends in future to attach to the full and total integration of women into the development process of our country.\nIn order to ensure effective respect for this commitment, statistics will be drawn up which will necessarily indicate the part of the actions undertaken which are of benefit or concern to women. To do so - and again I quote our President: \\\"the question of women must be borne in mind by all decision makers at all times at all stages of the conception and execution of development action, because to conceive of a development project without the participation of women is to make use of only four fingers when you have ten, and is courting failure.\\\" \nWe therefore hope that very soon. Burkinab\u00e9 women, finally freed from the constraints and shackles of traditional society, will be able to take any job, practise any profession, except of course the \\\"oldest profession in the world\\\" - prostitution. Indeed, in the face of the degradation of women involved in prostitution, a campaign has been begun for the rehabilitation of prostitutes.\nThis same concern for rehabilitation inspired the campaign and accompanying measures with regard to the problem of begging. Solidarity courses have been organized in the principal towns of Burkina to take in beggars, and action has been undertaken to give those of them in a position to make use of it a minimum of job training.\nBoth in the fight against prostitution and in the fight against begging, our aim is to improve our social habits and build for the future a new society in which men and women on an equal footing, healthy in body and mind, will live happy and dignified lives.\nIn this new society that is being built, we should like men and women to have a healthy attitude with regard to our state of underdevelopment. Some have denigrated our decision to make use in our wearing apparel of our traditional home-grown cotton instead of the usual imported cloth. This, like the decision to consume as little as possible of imported foods and replace them by national substitutes, is something that is covered by the watchwords \\\"Buy Burkinab\u00e9\\\".\nApart from the fact that this reflex is aimed essentially at awakening in the conscience of each of us a duty to protect a fragile economy because we consume too many imported products, to the detriment of national products, such conduct, if it is undertaken, cannot but have an impact on our agricultural production and our industrial production. So \\\"buying Burkinab\u00e9\\\" will go hand-in-hand with \\\"producing Burkinab\u00e9\\\". What could be more natural in the normal process of development? \nWe have spoken, and this despite the fact that the virtue of words has not sufficed to teach us wisdom or to Inculcate in us a desire for action. It has been thus because our words have rarely been accompanied by the necessary weight to translate them into concrete action. It has been thus because very often we have spoken one way and acted just the opposite.\nIt has been thus because, hypocritically, we have left to a Secretary-General, beset and overwhelmed by all the problems I have just described, the difficult task of ensuring the implementation of our decisions and resolutions, which we seem often to be busily undermining. It has been thus because those who have mastered science and technology have more often than not placed man at the service of progress rather than progress at the service of man.\nThis gloomy finding should not, however, lead us into inaction. For our part, we feel that the opposite is true, because in revolution is action. It is on behalf of our revolutionary faith, on behalf of our unshakeable faith in the qualitative transformation of man that we have come and tried to communicate here with the utmost candour what we feel about the problems confronting mankind and how we view the current problems facing humanity. \nWe hope then that at this forty-second session the General Assembly will pay more attention to constructive action than to the formulation of pious wishes and that in so doing our Organization will resolutely set out on a path that will make it possible in the near future for inequalities to be done away with, for injustice to be remedied, for fears to be overcome and for hotbeds of tension to be eliminated. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nFirst of all, allow me to congratulate the President on his election to such an eminent post. We are certain that his well-known merits will be a decisive contribution to the success of the work of this forty-second session of the General Assembly. Likewise, I should like to pay tribute to the outgoing President,\nMr. Rasheed Choudhury, for the competent manner in which he carried out the duties of the presidency.\nIn such a troubled period of international life, it is for me a special pleasure to address this Assembly as Foreign Minister of a Government which, under the leadership of Professor Cavaco Silva, was able to find for Portugal a balance between political stability and economic and social development and the fulfilment of the ideals of freedom, democracy and solidarity.\nThese have been, after all, important goals of the United Nations ever since its creation 40 years ago, and they have become a constant source of inspiration to Governments and men of good will. The United Nations has acquired a long and rich experience as a mediator.\nThis is no less remarkable than its ability at the same time to preserve, over and above everything else, a legitimacy of its own that defines it as the irreplaceable instrument for co-operation and understanding among the peoples that make up the Organization.\t\u00b7\nI have already referred to the role of mediator played by this Organization and its contribution to the settlement of conflicts. However, I am pleased to mention here an example where calling upon this role was not needed and an exclusively bilateral settlement was reached, thanks to the understanding among nations and to their good will in the search for a solution of their differences.\nI am referring to the agreement signed between the People's Republic of China and Portugal on 13 April 1987, establishing the necessary conditions for the transfer of the exercise of sovereignty over the territory of Macao, to begin in\nIt should be noted that from the beginning of such negotiations there was no dispute over the title of sovereignty, which the Portuguese Constitution of 1976 had already acknowledged as belonging to China. Tribute should be paid not only to the conditions embodied in this agreement but also to the atmosphere of good understanding that prevailed throughout these negotiations and allowed for the safeguarding and strengthening of the bonds of friendship and co-operation that already existed between our two countries. The perspectives are now opened in our relations with the great nation of China.\nNevertheless, there are instances in which countries should, or have to, resort to the mechanisms established in the Charter of this Organization in order to look for an equitable settlement of disputes. This was the case of Portugal in relation to East Timor. Unable to fulfil its obligation as the administering power and, in view of there having been no practical results after seven years of condemnation of the occupation of the Territory by Indonesian forces, Portugal decided to request the intervention of the Secretary-General.\nWe are still relying on the mandate under which the General Assembly, in resolution 37/30 in 1982, requested the Secretary-General to search for an equitable, universal and internationally acceptable solution to the question o East Timor. Further consultations and useful contacts have been carried out w thin the framework of that mandate, keeping the dialogue open in the hope of reaching positive results. Hence, we have agreed once again to the postponement of the debate called by the General Assembly, in view of the progress report of the Secretary-General issued on 8 September.\nOur sincere disposition actively to co-operate in the fulfilment of the mandate carried out by the Secretary-General is based, as we repeatedly stated, on clear-cut underlying principles: the absence of any sort of claim over the territory of Timor, which is closely linked to us by historical bonds  the search for a dignified settlement that will respect the religious and cultural identity of the people of Timor, and the fulfilment of its legitimate aspirations} respect for the right of the people of East Timor and of any other people freely to decide upon its collective destiny in full compliance with the fundamental and unquestionable principle of self-determination, in accordance with resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV) of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\nMy Government pays particular attention to the measures affecting the humanitarian conditions of the people of East Timor and sincerely welcomes the Secretary-General's intention closely to follow such developments \\\"so as to promote future and constant improvements in the conditions of the Territory\\\".\nTherefore we participated in the work recently carried out in Geneva by the Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and the Protection of Minorities, which, in the framework of the issue of the violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, approved a resolution on the situation in East Timor.\nPortugal has recently been elected by the Economic and Social Council to membership in the Human Rights Commission. As an applicant, my country was fully aware of the particular responsibilities entailed in such membership. But it was likewise inspired by the possibility of making a more decisive contribution in this field since human rights are one of the main items of Portuguese foreign policy.\nWe cannot talk about human rights without bearing in mind that in many areas of the world millions of people are still denied safeguard of the most fundamental fight, the right to life. We firmly believe that international peace and security, as well as the social and economic development and progress of the different nations, can be fully achieved and safeguarded only if they are based upon resolute implementation of human rights, social justice and each individual's freedom to choose and pave his own destiny.\nSince we firmly believe in these principles, we cannot share the misleading concept that State sovereignty can be invoked to prevent international safeguards of human rights, not even if lack of social and economic development is used to justify lesser observance of and respect for civil and political rights. On the contrary, the implementation of human rights should, in our opinion, be a primary concern in the assessment of the major problems that afflict the international environment today.\nIn this regard we cannot stress enough the paramount importance of the role that the United Nations and its several organs and specialized agencies have \u042c en playing and should continue to play. Important legislative work is being caned out based upon the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As a parallel development, we believe that the international community should embark on a concerted effort to reinforce the systems of surveillance and verification of the implementation of human rights. Measures like the appointment of special rapporteurs, the creation of task forces, the presentation of reports, the organization of international conferences an< congresses on specific subjects or specific cases of presumable violation of human rights, wherever they may occur, have proved to be fruitful and should be pro 3ted and reinforced in the future. I should like also to acknowledge the important role played by non-governmental organizations since safeguard of human rights is a task that we should all embrace and one that affects us all.\nIn the same framework please allow me briefly to refer to another subject of increasing concern in today's world, namely, the systematic practise of violent acts carried out by organized groups that do not respect the democratic order prevailing in our countries. These actions, no matter who perpetrates them or why, directly jeopardize personal rights, freedoms and safeguards, such as the rights to life, to freedom and to security.\nFor these reasons we have always upheld adherence to and full respect for the spirit and letter of the conventions drawn up by the specialized agencies within the United Nations system, similarly we positively support the consensus expressed by the approval of resolution 40/61 of 9 December 1985. That agreement deserves our tribute inasmuch as it was the first time that a consensus was reached on such a difficult issue having such a wide range of implications, and we are firmly convinced that we should pursue actions in accordance with the spirit of such a resolution, in our opinion, this is a problem that, given its gravity and urgency, should be carefully addressed by the whole international community.\nOn 1 July this year the European Communities took a significant step forward in the process of a new European development; the enforcement of the European Single Act.\nPortugal considers this initiative, together with the related reforms now under way, to which we have actively contributed, a demonstration of great vitality, it stands for both adaptation to an internal reality to which new elements have added richness as well as diversity and adjustment to the development of the political, economic and technological conditions of the latter years of our century, which are undergoing rapid and profound mutations.\nWe consider that Act a valid attempt to meet coherent challenges that the community will have to face simultaneously; on the one hand an external challenge; on the other, an internal one. Overcoming the external challenge will entail the possibility of reinforcing and giving broader meaning to the constructive position that the Community has been taking on the international scene. The internal challenge entails the need to secure a balanced development process within territorial boundaries, which may allow for the reduction of the existing gap between countries and regions and the reinforcement of internal cohesion\u00b7\nIt is essential to find the appropriate solution to both challenges so this the community and its members may, as we all wish fully assume their responsibilities in the political and economic spheres at an international level.\nAfter all, there has been a constant effort to achieve international openness and co-operation) evidence of that is provided by the recent revision of the co-operation agreements with the Lom\u00e9 countries and the southern Mediterranean countries\u00b7\nAlong the lines of a policy of co-operation and assistance to development I should like to stress that my country has this year completed its full-fledged adherence to the Third Lom\u00e9 Convention. This is a framework between the European Economic Community (EEC) and 66 countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, which will allow us considerably to extend our actions to underdeveloped countries and hence reaffirm the bilateral co-operation policy that we have endeavoured to accomplish.\nI should like to mention here the work carried out by many of the countries that participate in the General Assembly within the \\\"Uruguay Round\\\" of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This round of negotiations, broader than any previous one, should attain results leading to a sound change in economic international relations. Portugal is determined actively to contribute to the success of this round of negotiations, and here and now we renew our quest: enable support for the Declaration of Punta del Este. Nevertheless, the success of such negotiations should stem from the concerted action of all the participating countries. Each country\u2019s capacities and a fair distribution of responsibilities should be taken into consideration so as to attain complete transparency regarding artificial protectionism, in international trade. That is the essential basis for the carrying out of structural changes and reforms that lead to the necessary conditions for the optimal use of existing resources. Hence it is appropriate to recall the conclusions of the UNCTAD meeting. In one single document it was possible to express a concerted assessment of the economic international situation and to list a series of specific political actions to be implemented within the next few years by the developed and developing countries. The climate of dialogue achieved during the conference allowed for a sound analysis of multilateral economic co-operation. This is an essential factor in the North-South dialogue, which is such a pivotal item in international relations.\nIt is well known by all that co-operation with Africa, in particular with Portuguese-speaking African countries, is of paramount importance to Portugal. It is for us a crucial matter of top priority at both the political and the cultural levels.\nThe priority attributed to the African coast and to the African continent in the celebrations that Portugal is holding before the turn of the century commemorating the Descobrimentos, the adventure of our maritime expansion and the encounter of peoples and civilizations, speaks for itself.\nI wish to express here the hope that the United Nations may become involved in these celebrations, a clearly universal event.\nAs many have acknowledged, Portuguese expansion was, as a famous sociologist put it, more of a maritime and exploratory expansion than a conquering one. Cultural roots are deep, and all recognize the special bonds created by such a heritage, for which we are willing to expand and intensify the co-operation and dialogue between Portugal and all African countries that ace Portuguese-speaking or that share our historical heritage. Accordingly, Portugal has undertaken serious efforts to promote our already reinforced common solidarity, and has widely proved that. This co-operation apart from bilateral action in different sectors, also encompasses very valuable multilateral programmes - for example, our participation in the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC), a body which has achieved year after year increasing political and economic solidarity, giving special priority to the problems of development-\nMoreover, it is with serious apprehension that Portugal views the series of developments taking place in southern Africa: the considerable deterioration of the social and economic conditions of the population, and the escalating instability and tension\u00b7 Underlying this situation are two factors that have been vehemently condemned by the international community} the present internal framework of the Republic of south Africa and the deliberately provoked destabilizing outbreaks that have been afflicting countries of the area, namely, Angola and Mozambique.\nLikewise, Portugal has unequivocally denounced and condemned, both within the United Nations system and elsewhere, the immorality and injustice entailed in apartheid. The dismantlement of apartheid is an essential condition of the achievement of equitable solutions to the conflicts and problems besetting South Africa today.\nThus, it is essential that the South African authorities pursue a dialogue with all the political and social groups that try to make a decisive move towards the definite elimination of apartheid and the establishment of conditions that we ensure more effective access to political participation, employment and social justice for all the communities of the country. Only with the courage, decisiveness and true sense of responsibility required at this historic moment w: the governing classes in South Africa avoid a process of internal confrontation.\nSimilarly, Portugal views with great concern the continuous postponement by the Republic of South Africa of the exercise by the Namibian people of the right self-determination. Twenty years after the adoption of resolution 2145 (XXI),\nwhich ended South Africa\u2019s Mandate over Namibia, the question of the independence of that Territory is not yet solved, owing to South Attica's persistent demands, which delay the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nPortugal's position in this matter is well known. Portugal has repeatedly declared that the solution of the question of Namibia is of primary concern, and has consistently upheld the independence of the Territory, in keeping with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Portugal has also repeatedly expressed its firm opposition to any act capable of further delaying the attainment by the people of Namibia of their right to self-determination.\nSouth Africa should respond constructively to the appeals voiced by the international community and abandon the position of confrontation that it has adopted, particularly against Angola. Portugal has vehemently condemned this position on the part of South Africa.\nMy Government is firmly convinced that the solution to the problems that afflict South Africa lies in the creation of conditions leading to the widening of a genuine and constructive dialogue. This is the spirit of the Nkomati agreements and of the contacts we have carried out in the region. Without pretending to find solutions to problems that others will have to solve, we believe that it is our duty to contribute in the best possible way to a peaceful, concerted settlement of the conflicts that so dramatically beset such important areas of the African continent.\nIt is with deep concern that my country views the constant worsening of the living conditions of the people of Mozambique and the acts of extreme violence t at have recently been perpetrated against them by groups involved in a p spreading instability, which my country vehemently condemns. \nAngola, too, is living in particularly difficult times. There, too, the population is afflicted by the widespread instability and conflict that prevail in most countries of southern Africa. We pay a tribute to the pragmatism that the political leaders in Angola have demonstrated in their search for a global solution to the problems that afflict the country. Also worthy of praise are the reopening of the dialogue aimed at a solution of the problem of Namibia and the recent announcement of important economic reforms, Portugal firmly supports and encourages such measures.\nI should also like to address here the recent unanimous election within the United Nations system of a renowned diplomat and legal expert from Cape Verde to the presidency of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, I am certain that with all his merits he will make a decisive contribution to the work of that body, whose success is of great interest to a country with such maritime traditions as Portugal.\nI should also like to refer with great satisfaction to the views set forth at the last meeting of the five Heads of State of Central America in the city of Guatemala. The results achieved at that meeting are a promising step towards the creation of the atmosphere of mutual confidence which is so essential to the preservation of peace, respect for political freedoms and the social and economic development of the area. Nevertheless, the promise can be kept only if specific actions are taken that will embody the safeguards for the exercise of civil and political rights that are an essential part of the Guatemala document.\nIn spite of the progress achieved in this vast area of America, we remain concerned about the overwhelming need for further efforts so that the serious economic problems that afflict many Latin American countries may be overcome. It is not always easy to make a profound diagnosis of the causes of the problems that affect these countries, but the international community should do away with solutions that have proved to be unsatisfactory and turn to more innovative ideas. I am convinced that the developed countries have an important contribution to make in this area. I firmly believe that we should seek constantly and persistently a new set of formulas for co-operation with Latin America.\nI also pay a tribute to the increasing solidarity that the Latin American countries have demonstrated. Examples of this solidarity can be found in the endeavours of the Contadora Group and the Support Group - namely, the establishment of a mechanism for periodic political consultations between the member countries of these two groups and of closer contacts between Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. These measures are the starting point of a process of gradual integration that will have major consequences in the area.\nI turn to disarmament. I will not dwell on this vast and complex subject, since my colleague from Denmark has already addressed the issue on behalf of all the member countries of the European Communities. I would simply re-emphasize that Portugal will continue to participate actively with the allied countries in all the actions carried of the international community in this field that may lead to effective reinforcement of international security.\nIn our opinion this will occur only in an atmosphere of greater mutual trust, achieved through a continued, sound East-West dialogue, without jeopardizing the delicate balance of power, which in today's world, remains the most solid safeguard of security and stability in international relations.\nIt is in this spirit that we carefully observe the positive developments in the current negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Moreover, I cannot fail to make a special reference to the agreement on the dismantlement of medium-range missiles in Europe achieved recently in Washington. We hope that this measure will contribute not only to a more secure Europe, but also to greater stability and collective safety, which it should never impair. \nIt is with deep concern that we have noted in the last few weeks the deterioration of the situation in the Gulf region. We join whole-heartedly in all the urgent appeals from all corners of the world for an end to all acts of violence and intimidation, so as to achieve a cease-fire in the area as the pre-condition of the establishment of an environment of understanding in which genuine solutions may be found.\nIn accordance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987), which is a good example of the unity at present prevailing in the international community, we uphold freedom of navigation and free trade in every part of the world, and cannot accept that principles universally accepted and enshrined in international documents signed by every nation should be jeopardized.\nWe likewise fully support the endeavours of the Secretary-General in the search for peace and a lasting, dignified agreement that may lead to the ending of the conflict that has been undermining Iran and Iraq. We are confident that the Secretary-General's decisiveness may become a crucial element in this issue, as long as both parties prove willing to search for peaceful solutions, without any reservation.\nAs for the conflict between Israel and the Arab countries, we are convinced that underlying the problems faced by the region is the postponement of solutions. Together with other countries of the Common Market, our country will do everything possible to reach realistic, balanced and lasting solutions to this issue, taking into consideration the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and the need to withdrawal from occupied Arab territories and recognition of the right of all the nations of the area to peaceful coexistence. \nIt is thus with great hope that we face the reopening of the dialogue between Europe and the Arab countries. We firmly believe that invaluable benefits can stem from a more perfect understanding and more conscientious consultation with the large family of Arab countries.\nWe cannot fail to mention Afghanistan and stress once again the wish of Portugal to see that country, free of the presence of foreign troops and external pressures, find peace, and with that peace be granted the right to self-determination.\nAnother country that has had to bear the occupation of foreign troops for several years now is Kampuchea. In that case also the international community and in particular the Secretary-General should spare no effort in the search for a just and peaceful solution that will safeguard the territorial boundaries and the independence and free will of that people.\nI began by stating that the ideals embodied in the Charter are still valid today  indeed I consider them part of the goals that move Governments and men: peace, economic and social progress, respect for the individual and the freedom and independence for each nation. It is for this Organization especially the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, in whom we fully trust, to fulfil the difficult mission of continuing and renewing that noble and worthy task.\nWe are confident that lasting solutions to the present financial crisis will be found, solutions that will satisfy all and hence contribute to the support for and prestige of the actions of this forum. Only then will this Organization be able to fulfil its original pledge and play the role that is its tight.\nIn this connection I should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his initiatives directed towards a stricter rationalization of expenditure and more efficient management and tighter control of human and financial resources. Such measures, of course, are applicable to the whole United Nations system, including the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which should not only be subject to a more strict and efficient management but also regain its universal vocation. These were the main reasons that led my country to nominate for the director-generalship of UNESCO a Portuguese whose well-known and undeniable merits would ensure the rapid and effective achievement of those goals.\nAllow me in conclusion to emphasize again the total devotion of my country to the success of the United Nations as an instrument of peace and progress in the international community.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI come from a country you know well. You know our values, our struggle for development, our striving for peace. I come to ask you for help, to tell you that we need the support of all countries of good will if peace is to prevail in Central America.\nI have come to appeal for the strength of enduring principles in order to achieve peace, freedom and democracy in Central America. I have come to appeal for the political and diplomatic might of the world's nations, to enable us to set out together upon a new course that can ensure peace in the region.\nA year ago I came here to say that the fate of Central America hung on a decision between war and peace. Now I can tell you that the five States of Central America have cast their lot with peace. To end the war, political democracy must be established in all the countries of our America} freedom must be enjoyed by all citizens and human rights must be scrupulously respected within our borders.\nIn the peace plan we signed in Guatemala, we asked for dialogue and amnesty. We want a cease\u2014fire as soon as possible. We want an immediate beginning to democratization. We want free elections that reflect the true will of the majority of our peoples. We call on any Powers intervening in the region to suspend military aid. We want a guarantee that territories will not be used to stage attacks on other States. We seek a reduction in armaments. We request national and international supervision by the Contadora Group, the Support Group and the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the Organization of American States. We propose guidelines to evaluate progress toward peace. We state that in an atmosphere of democracy and freedom development can take place that can enable us to enjoy a lasting peace. Those points represent years of effort by the Contadora Group and express the force of a century of democracy and freedom in my Costa Rica.\nSome are fearful of the peace agreement signed by the Central Americans. They say that what we are seeking to achieve has never been done before. They say that dialogue is impractical where hatred is so deep-rooted. They say that reconciliation is impossible when differences have been so pronounced foe so many years. They say that it is not possible to walk side by side when such extreme ideologies divide our people. They say that the word of a liar cannot be trusted. If we had to renounce anything that had never been done before, America would never have been discovered, nor would mankind ever have reached the moon. We would have to resign ourselves forever to accepting the impossibility of curing certain diseases, to accepting the persistence of war, to accepting a future of everlasting cruelty for Central America.\nI maintain just the opposite. We are obligated to try something different. We cannot relinquish imagination and courage in promoting the changes society requires. We cannot continue to pass through history in the shadows, bowed down by poverty and tormented by war. We cannot set out upon a new course gropingly, hesitantly, hoping that others will guide us. We demand peace, democracy and freedom, for we know where we want to go, and we know the kind of future we hope to build. We are tired of shedding tears. We yearn to share our ideals in order to work together for development. We want to take the fate of our region into our own hands.\nIn the agreement signed in Guatemala we committed ourselves to work for peace in good faith. We have established, as a basis for dialogue, guidelines to be observed and goals to be achieved by all of the nations involved. We have set deadlines for achieving them. All of us agree that we roust take immediate steps toward those goals. To the extent that we attain them, credibility will grow and confidence will build among ourselves and in the eyes of the world. The sooner the guns are silenced, the sooner hatred will wither. The faster freedoms are re-established, the sooner our people will be able to enjoy democracy and the greater will be their respect for human tights.\nLet us be clear. No one has the right to judge the success or failure of the Central American path to peace in terms of artificially imposed deadlines. Some of the purposes of the agreement may be accomplished in less time than has been estimated} others may require more time. So long as real progress is being made toward national reconciliation, toward the enjoyment of freedom and toward an end to domestic warfare, to long as such progress is part of a new political reality, the plan will survive, the plan will continue in effect, and hope will spread everywhere.\nWe are aware of the enormous scope of the obstacles we propose to overcome. We know that there are enemies at home and abroad who oppose the course charted by the Central Americans. But no failure to meet an unrealistic schedule can close the door to the rule of reason and to the elimination of war in Central America. \nThe plan will no longer be valid or honest if any of the regional or non-regional players act with the deliberate intention to betray the agreement reached in Guatemala. It will no longer be valid or honest when there is clear evidence of an unwillingness to lay down arms, to move toward democracy or to seek national reconciliation. No one has the right to judge exclusively on the basis of past conduct. None of the players, none of the great Powers has the moral authority to cast the first stone. A new political reality is emerging in Central America. We ask for respect for regional self-determination. We ask for understanding. We ask for help in overcoming obstacles and moving closer to peace. The problems in Central America result from entrenched dictatorships and grievous social injustice. Decades of hunger and cruel suffering were and are evidence of the poverty-stricken lives led by millions of men and women in the region. We are certain that the restoration of democracy to the Central American republics will promote a shared, appropriate development that can meet the basic needs of the people promptly and reliably.\nWe realize that we ourselves must take the primary responsibility for restructuring our economies. A significant part of that responsibility will be to make peace, for without peace there can be no development. We have begun to move towards peace and we are willing to make every effort to attain it. It is of vital importance that we should revive sustained development in order to ensure a better International position. We also need access to new markets and more favourable terms for the payment of our debt. It is essential for us to secure more stable prices for our exports.\nCentral America has not been granted all the economic concessions it needs. The world economy is afraid of making exceptions on the premise that if -they are extended to some countries they must be extended to many others also. That argument is a pretext for not making exceptions even to alleviate the sufferings of poverty and the anguish of those who are struggling to maintain democratic systems at a time when peace is at stake and when more favourable economic conditions could help to bring war to an end.\nIt is inconceivable that the calculating coldness of financiers should govern international relations. We have not made sufficient progress in renegotiating an external debt that we ate unable to repay on the terms originally stipulated. Very little progress has been made in opening up new markets and in stabilizing prices for our primary products. We must continue to insist on an international economy concerned with the poverty of certain countries. We need an international economy conducive to the strengthening of emerging democracies. There must be an international economy sensitive to the agonies of war and always allied to the hope for peace. We believe that the economy cannot be divorced from the political concerns of mankind designed to eliminate poverty and guarantee a stable peace among nations.\nIn a world that presents a complex and sometimes hostile panorama. Central America stands today at the dawn of a new political era. Dialogue among the presidents of the five nations is re-emerging. Their ministers and their experts are talking. Armed rebels and Governments alike are engaging in dialogue. Reconciliation commissions have been set up. Many individuals are beginning to think about forgiving and being forgiven, about working together again. The men and women of our countries are doubtful about the policy of peace. There are powerful reasons for many to doubt. The task at hand is now to overcome obstacles and enrich dialogue, to ensure that every effort will lead to a little more freedom, a little more democracy, a little less violence. I should like to assure this Assembly that Costa Rica is firm in its determination to work for peace. Today a new climate is evolving in Central America. A waning faith is being reborn; it must be helped to flourish. We must believe again in freedom, in dialogue, in free expression of the will of the people. I have come to ask you to share this undertaking with us. I have come to appeal for your help.\nThe Costa Rican delegation to this Organization will present to the Assembly the peace plan signed in Guatemala. We shall ask for approval of that plan In a resolution of the United Nations and for its adoption by this Assembly. We shall ask that it be backed by the full political force that the nations of the world bring to bear on identifying and supporting just causes in this forum. I am confident that we shall receive that support. I am certain that, together, we can say that the power of diplomacy and the validity of political accords undertaken in good faith will always be more effective than weapons, that they will always be stronger than war. I am certain that we shall walk the path of peace together in order to banish war from our region once and for all.\nThe great French historian and statesman, Francois Guizot, said that \\\"pessimists are merely onlookers; it is the optimist who change the world\\\". I have come to invite this Assembly to participate with high optimism in this struggle to establish in Central America a territory of freedom, justice, democracy and peace.\nWe for our part will redouble our efforts on behalf of all the noble causes in which this Organization is involved. With renewed vigour we condemn all manner of racial discrimination. We condemn the practice of terrorism, regardless of where it originates or how it is expressed. We indignantly condemn drug traffic. We should like to see International co-operation strengthened to combat these terrible threats, and we should like to see more severe punishment meted out to offenders.\nWe should like to see the beginning of a dialogue designed to solve the problem of sovereignty in the Falkland .Islands. We should like to see the door opened, by means of dialogue, to reconciliation of the two Koreas. We should like dialogue to ensure the prompt and unconditional Independence of Namibia. We should like to have dialogue serve as the instrument for securing the prompt liberation of Kampuchea and Afghanistan. We applaud the Intensification of talks between the two Germanys and we support with renewed faith the efforts of the United Nations to secure peace in the Middle East.\nI reaffirm here my country's stand in favour of creating special financial arrangements to combat hunger in Africa, to mitigate the suffering of exiles, to expedite the consolidation of emerging democracies, and to promote peace efforts through the world. Costa Rica places high hope In disarmament negotiations between the super Powers. We encourage the reduction of arms In every corner of the planet. As a country without weapons, we know that security does not reside In force or in threats, much less in the use of violence. Security resides in progress towards shared development, in the prevailing of co-operation over selfishness. In respect for pluralism, in the rejection of Imperialistic designs.\nThis time compassion will not suffice to ease the pain of countries that choose to make war, for whoever encourages war by word or deed will in the end be himself mortally wounded when his own sons are sent to die in lt. Fear of freedom causes many to seek refuge in arms. Fear of dialogue causes some to take refuge in dogmatism. We cannot turn our backs on history. How many times have we overcome one hatred only to develop another! How many times has a tyrant fallen only to be succeeded by another! How many times has democracy trembled before the treachery of disloyal armed forces! Let us now embark upon a new course. Let us confront the uncertainties involved in development. Let us assume the risks inherent in achieving peace, freedom and democracy.\nMy country has invoked the most cherished principles and the loftiest values of mankind to put an end to war. It has invoked those principles to call for a more equitable international economy, to build a new economy with less poverty and more proprietors, to say that we are weary of dictatorships crushing the human spirit in many parts of the world, to repeat to the world that it is injustice that drives human beings to violence, and to proclaim that we must no longer commit the same mistakes over and over again.\nWe are not apprehensive because everything seems more difficult at this time.\nLet us not be afraid because the problems are multiplying. Let us not be afraid because the solution of our difficulties may at some point be beyond our control or because hatred may temporarily prevail over love. It is up to us to explore the way to a new dawn of understanding and peace.\nOur poet Isaac Felipe Azofeifa left us a message of hope in the following inspiring words;\n\\\"Yes, my child.\nThe stars have all disappeared.\nBut it is always darkest\nJust before the dawn.\\\"\nWe have an opportunity to rewrite history. I should like to say, in all humility, that it is our duty to do so. We must not see the past whenever we look towards the future. The time has come now to forge a better destiny for our peoples. I am certain that, with your help, with the efforts of all peoples and nations of goodwill , we will succeed. We are determined to try. Let us do it, now, together.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt gives me great pleasure, Sir, to congratulate you most sincerely on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session. I am convinced that under your wise leadership the Assembly will reach the satisfactory results all Member States expect and seek.\nAllow me also to congratulate the President at the forty-first session. Ambassador Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, whose recognized ability and dedication enabled him to succeed in the difficult tasks he performed. We also extend our appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and applaud him for his effective and selfless endeavours at this complex juncture in international relations, particularly the diligent help he extended to my country in the grave circumstances experienced by Ecuador as a result of the disastrous earthquake in March of this year.\nIn this Hall countless highly authoritative voices have said much, if not all ; there is to say, about the peoples' desire for peace, security and economic and; social improvement. Ecuador wishes to state that it shares and warmly supports those statements, and it expresses the hope that the forty-second session of the General Assembly will excel in upholding these oft-repeated and universally acknowledged truths. I wish to highlight certain concepts that are dear to Ecuador in connection with the most important issues debated here and explain the reasoning and attitude behind Ecuador's international policy, one that is constant with ethical and legal standards which cannot fail to nourish the values and aspirations of all men of good will and whose application in good faith could bring about the noble objectives of justice, peace and development.\nIn his recent message to the National Congress on 10 August, the President of the Republic of Ecuador stated that last year had \\\"witnessed the organic consolidation of a serious international policy, based on ethics and the sound principles of international law; open to co-operation on all valid initiatives in favour of peace, disarmament, justice, human rights and development; inspired by the will to maintain relations with all States of the world, in a spirit of respect and meaningful co-operation.\\\"\nThose words by the President of Ecuador summarize the basis of our international policy and faithfully reflect Ecuador's actions within the world Organization, whose ideals enshrined in the Charter have, unfortunately, often been contradicted by the harsh reality of international conflicts and their intractable persistence. On the one hand, the politicisation which surfaces in practically all the problems dealt with by the Security Council and the General Assembly and, on the other hand, the tendency for the international community to judge those problems, not always on their own merits, but in the light of group, if not individual, interests, reduce the effectiveness of the system and deprive it of the authority that all its decisions should carry.\nGiven the circumstances in which international relations are evolving and the growing complexity of an ever more interdependent world, it is necessary and urgent for the United Nations to become the effective instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security that was envisaged at its inception. This transformation requires the concerted efforts of all its organs and all the Governments of the Member States, which should disregard possible ideological victories and strive to arrive at practical results for the solution of conflicts in keeping with the spirit of the Charter, which offers genuine possibilities to this end, for instance the provisions of Article 33 on the peaceful settlement of disputes. \nEcuador has participated and will continue to participate in the building and consolidation of international law, which is constantly growing and diversifying. This reflects our feeling that peace is based on the supremacy of law, which Is valid as an invariable rule of conduct for all countries, powerful or weak. No one will fail to notice the existence of a cause and effect relationship between the law and the obligation of States to refrain from the use or threat of force. In this regard, the present General Assembly is to consider a draft declaration, on the recommendation of the Special Committee, to Improve the effectiveness of this fundamental principle. In spite of the draft declaration's shortcomings, Ecuador will support its adoption, which will represent a reaffirmation of the validity and relevance of a principle that is the logical and inseparable corollary of the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nWhile it is true that one of the most serious problems facing the world is that of the chasm separating the rich from the poor or underdeveloped countries, it is also a fact that the United Nations constitutes what may be the most important means of launching progressive action in the struggle to eliminate or at least reduce those tragic differences.\nThe International Conference on the Relationship Between Disarmament and Development, which met here just a short time ago, requires a mighty effort towards the ideal of the struggle against underdevelopment since, as is acknowledged in the Final Document of the Conference,\n\\\"The global military expenditures are in dramatic contrast to economic and social underdevelopment and to the misery and poverty afflicting more than two thirds of mankind.\\\" (A/CQNF. 130/21, para.3) That fearful spending I amounting to almost a trillion dollars each year, could help eliminate hunger, ignorance, sickness, insecurity and fear in one generation. \nIt follows that Ecuador, a country with an undeniable pacifist mission, is deeply concerned at the unbridled arras race, which involves a sizeable portion of the world. States obviously have a right to preserve their own security, but that logical right cannot and must not justify the costly excesses of acquiring lethal devices that threaten the life and health of large portions of the human population and deplete resources needed for development.\nEcuador is opposed, as it has demonstrated on several occasions, to all attempts at undue stockpiling. It follows that it supports proposals to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones, among which that sponsored by the Treaty of Thatelolco for Latin America is a good practical example.\nDisarmament is an objective essential to the future of mankind. My Government therefore welcomes the news that the Secretary of State of the United States and the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union have reached an accord whereby they have agreed in principle to sign a treaty for the total elimination of medium-range missiles.\nEcuador has also learned with satisfaction that intensive efforts will be made to arrive at a treaty on a 50 per cent reduction in offensive strategic weapons, that talks are to begin before 1 December on questions relating to nuclear tests and that a summit meeting between President Reagan and General-Secretary Gorbachev has been agreed for autumn of this year.\nThis entire process deserves the support of my Government, which understands how difficult the negotiations ate and appreciates the value of the efforts made by the parties directly concerned, thanks to which it has been possible to reach this prized objective. Aware that this agreement makes an essential contribution to peace and understanding and helps dispel distrust, the Government of Ecuador expresses the hope that the fruitful work of these great Powers will continue until general and complete disarmament is attained, thus giving mankind the confidence it needs to move forward towards achievement of its well-being.\nThe inestimable gift of peace is being seriously affected in various parts of the world. In the Middle East, in Africa and in Central America, death and devastation are present. Each day, many innocent human beings are the victims of wars and of guerrilla and terrorist acts in which they are caught up by the cruel force of fate. Yet, despite their painful train of horror and tragedy, such events are of small significance compared to a nuclear holocaust which, regrettably, represents a dire threat to the very survival of mankind.\nNever has such great responsibility rested on any group of countries as that which today falls on the nuclear Powers. It is necessary and urgent that they hear- and respond to the anguished call to bury these unspeakable weapons - a call that springs from the elementary right to life of millions of human beings. Moreover, conventional disarmament, still slow and scarcely regional in scope , should also progress in step with the concern of the international community, which is searching for collective peace and security. This, however, will not easily be achieved so long as there remain political antagonisms, extremist ideologies and the serious economic crisis that besets the great majority of the Members of the Organization.\nPeace cannot prosper without the peaceful and just solution of the problems existing between States. Faithful to its constant policy of firm respect for the norms of international law and the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, Ecuador reiterates its resolve to maintain and strengthen friendly relations with all nations, and most particularly with its neighbours, in order thus to\u00b7 contribute to the progress and well-being of peoples who were meant to live in unity and understanding  thereby creating a favourable climate for the just/ peaceful and honourable solution of territorial or other disputes that divide them.\nLatin America has just demonstrated its political will to move forward and deepen the process of integration. Every day we see more clearly the need to agree on policies and to act jointly on many issues of common interest. We all face the challenge of eliminating the differences that separate us and strengthening the ties that bind us. Territorial problems also infringe on the spirit of brotherhood which we want to strengthen, and their solution by legal means will definitively clear the way to understanding.\nIn Latin America, there is a strengthening and growing climate of solidarity and a firm determination to apply joint efforts to development. There is an increased firmness in the spirit of unity which expresses itself as a thirst for integration and a determination to achieve co-operation and friendship. This implies the establishment of a climate of trust, the laying of solid foundations for justice and a determination to move towards the settlement of disputes. The rest will be achieved because we are aware of a shared destiny and are determined to achieve the well-being of our peoples.\t\nThe growing dimension of the crisis resulting from the enormous debt of the developing countries is well known, as are its grave consequences for their capabilities in the short, medium and long term and the real risk it poses to their political and social stability. The road to growth of their economies is blocked by the difficulties and cost of foreign credit and by the closing of markets to their new production. The stifling of their economies warns of repercussions still graver than at present. That is so clear that it would be absurd for creditors to fail to understand their joint responsibility in solving a problem of such magnitude that it will, if left unsolved, drag along with it debtors and creditors to avoid this; a clear and courageous decision is called for on the part of the creditor Powers to make good their political will and to make \u0105 significant contribution to the basic development of the debtor countries. Multilateral projects administered by the United Nations must be increased, along with credits and technology transfers, with special emphasis placed on the opening of the markets of the industrial countries in both East and West to the products and raw materials of the developing countries through the removal of restrictive barriers which create unjust situations and jeopardize the economic, political and social stability of the latter countries.\nEcuador's international policy is firmly based on respect for human rights and on their promotion and universal protection. We have pointed out that the general nature of the standards of protection of such rights cannot be distorted by selective and discriminatory criteria inspired by reasons of politics or ideology.\nWe advocate the need to improve the international machinery for monitoring human rights in all countries of the world. We maintain that the international bodies inquiring into the human rights situation must consider it independently of political systems in order to avoid discriminating against certain countries while Keeping silent about what happens in others. We believe it is necessary to create conditions for the true exercise of rights, taking Into account the requirements of well-being, culture and health. The denial of such rights, whether within a country or internationally, is an infringement of justice and renders freedom illusory, while weakening the democratic nature and social and political stability of countries experiencing deep-seated development problems. We consider the right to development to be an inalienable human right.\nAt sessions of the General Assembly the delegation of Ecuador has abstained in the voting on draft resolutions condemning only certain countries, and has stressed the need to seek new mechanisms to ensure impartiality and universality in dealing with this matter.\nParticular mention deserves to be made of my country's absolute rejection of that violation of human rights that exists and persists so shamefully in South Africa in spite of the countless appeals and words of condemnation that have been and are being voiced within this Organization. I am referring to the detestable system of apartheid. The burden of inhuman racial discrimination which it imposes must be removed for the sake of the dignity, equality and brotherhood of man.\nEcuador respects the rights of human beings, men and women, and condemns all  discrimination, be it based on sex, religion or race, or on nationality and political ideology.\nIt is incumbent upon Governments to make a gigantic effort to resolve the socio-economic problems besetting the developing societies, small societies in particular. This takes time. It is not possible fully to satisfy the just demands for a way of life that affords the rights inherent in human dignity so long as such basic issues as education, health and housing are, for the most part, financed with capital from abroad and, therefore, dependent upon the co-operation of the international financial centres.\nThe neglect of long-deferred needs creates social tension and disorientation in certain sectors. It must be acknowledged that when violent and extremist groups are present, alienated from organized society and disoriented with respect to the future, they form nuclei that proliferate with the help of organizations in other countries. For this reason the problems of urban violence and guerrilla warfare do note a rule concern one country alone. In Ecuador we aspire to preserve social peace, which, fortunately, we have managed to preserve. We are, nevertheless, aware of the danger that the presence of guerrillas in other countries represents. My country is particularly interested in joining those countries in an effort to eradicate that wretched evil, which is often linked to drug trafficking. This is another cause for social alienation to which my country also calls the attention of the international community, and we state our sincere wish to contribute to the fight against those evils.\nTerrorism and drug trafficking have aroused the concern of the United Nations and of such regional bodies as the Organization of American States. Ecuador Is a member of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs and has signed several conventions on the same subject, with the United States, Colombia and Peru, Moreover, it is actively co-operating with the Andean Group's Convention on Drug Trafficking and the South American Agreement on Narcotics, drawn up by international bodies to which It belongs. With the recent International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking the international community took a step forward in the struggle against this grave danger that threatens it. Averting this danger will require a firm decision on the part of the drug-producing countries, as well as the persistent and effective action of consumer countries, which are a source of incalculable revenue for this international crime. \nEcuador takes this opportunity to reiterate its firm determination to maintain close relations of friendship, co-operation and understanding with all nations. The Government of Ecuador reaffirms its decision to continue to co-operate with the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and will work for the preservation of the principles of autonomy and impartiality which prompted Its establishment. We consider that the action of the non-aligned countries must reflect true Independence and an endeavour to maintain international peace and security and to promote the economic and social development of members of the Movement. \nWhat I have said does not imply any Intent to detract from the overall authority of the United Nations to the advantage of the groups established within the Organization. As one of its founding Members  Ecuador maintains its unfaltering faith in the principles and purposes that inspire the United Nations and, for that reason, it has always held that universality is an essential condition for its efficiency and success.\nConsequently, Ecuador would welcome, for Instance, the admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations without prior conditions for their admission. It also views as positive the efforts to work out bilateral agreements leading to understandings in favour of the Korean people, of international peace and of co-operation.\nEcuador's devotion to peace is reflected in its persistent adherence to the principles and resolutions of the world Organization to preserve or restore peace. It therefore expresses its unstinting support for the efforts to end the cruel war between Iran and Iraq and, in particular, for the Secretary-General's tireless efforts in this respect.\nTo the same purpose, and in support of all initiatives for the peaceful settlement of conflicts, we reiterate our backing for Contadora and its Support Group, in their attempts to arrive at solutions to the Central American crisis and avoid the outbreak of a general war. We believe that the solution requires the political will of all parties, that it is necessary to make constant efforts and not to exclude opportunities for negotiation, that it is essential to obtain the withdrawal of foreign forces and to rid the situation of the explosive ingredients of East-West confrontation. We also consider that the existence of an authentic democracy in the region will make understanding possible among countries and Governments and help overcome the distressing problems of the area. For this reason Ecuador has welcomed with hope and satisfaction the agreement signed by the five Central American countries on 7 August last in Guatemala, which opens the way to peace, democracy and freedom for that group of sister countries. \nOn October 1986, the British Government declared a 150-mtle exclusive zone around the Malvinas Islands, the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry made known its opposition and, having reiterated its support for the Argentine claims, declared that such illegal actions make it difficult to arrive at a favourable climate for negotiations which would guarantee peace in the region and allow for the conversion of the South Atlantic into a zone of co-operation and understanding.\nIn the same vein, at the previous session of the General Assembly, Ecuador supported the draft resolution introduced by Brazil, aimed at ensuring the maintenance of peace in the South Atlantic, and backed the holding of an international peace conference on the Middle East.\nEcuador unswervingly rejects any occupation of territory by force. It has repeatedly expressed this rejection, in such cases as those of Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Cyprus, Namibia and the Middle East, and supported resolutions of the world Organization condemning them.\nEcuador's policy has been equally unswerving with regard to affirming the right of peoples to self-determination and independence. Our resolute anti\u2014colonialist attitude has been clear at all times, and today we reiterate this line of conduct more particularly in the case of sorely tried Namibia. The use of force does not create rights and intervention must be prohibited in International relations.\nAs for outer space, Ecuador and its Government reiterate on this occasion the position they have maintained regarding the geo-stationary orbit and the frequency problem. Such resources are to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of all peoples, in particular those of the developing countries, notably the equatorial countries that claim special obligations and rights over the segments of the orbit spanning their territories. Ecuador welcomed the requests to include in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly two new items relating to co-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of American States and between the United Nations and the Latin American Economic System. My country vigorously supports the inclusion of these items, since it is considers that it is high time for close collaboration to be established between the United Nations and the Organization of American States the oldest regional organization, which was a source of inspiration at the San Francisco Conference in 194 5.\nOver its 42 years of existence the United Nations has had to face harsh conflicts, serious differences among its Members, overweening ambitions, ideological struggles and breaches of the peace and well-being in various parts of the world. In carrying out its activities the Organization has occasionally met with bureaucratic and financial difficulties which, starting at the previous session of the General Assembly, are being reformed and corrected. But we are also bound to acknowledge important achievements in many areas of multilateral relations \nIn this irreplaceable forum, angry words have been heard from time to time, but we have also listened more often to words of peace, conciliation and hope. Let the latter be the words that prevail in future, inspired by faith in the United Nations and by the peoples9 will to build a fraternal world of progress and well-being.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr. President, let me first extend to you my congratulations on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly, and at the same time express my country's warm appreciation to the outgoing President, and representative of a fellow Commonwealth country, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh.\nThe General Assembly meets this year at a moment of great hope for the world, yet also at a moment of grave and mounting danger: hope because, after years of effort, an historic arms agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union is within sight; and grave and mounting danger because the conflict between Iran and Iraq poses daily a more serious threat to wider peace and security.\nIn the Gulf two proud, independent countries, themselves both founding Members of the United Nations, have been mauling each other relentlessly for seven years. That is almost twice as long as the First World War. We have before our eyes the image of hundreds of thousands of corpses, young people blown up, gunned down or gassed to death, civilians on both sides mercilessly bombed. The combatants have moreover extended this senseless destruction and loss of life into the international waters of the Gulf. Only two days ago another British vessel, the Gentle Breeze was attacked with loss of innocent life. This was a disgraceful and unprovoked act of aggression against an unarmed vessel, the sixth attack on a British ship in the Gulf.\nShips have sailed this great seaway for centuries. It is an international thoroughfare; no State may dictate who uses it. As it has done throughout its long history, the United Kingdom will continue to champion freedom of navigation. Individual States that take action to uphold that freedom are entitled to support from the entire community of nations. Yet today, and for many months now, freedom of navigation in these waters is threatened - threatened by indiscriminate attacks on unarmed vessels, by harassment of innocent merchant shipping and, most reckless of all, by the laying of random mines. The world saw another example on Monday, as Iran sowed mines in the path of a convoy in international waters. The response of the United States to that insane act was fully justified, and it should be supported by all those who wish to bring this conflict to an end, for the stability of the entire region is menaced by this escalating threat to peace.\nThe challenge to this institution and all it stands for could not be more direct. The blunt truth is that the way in which the United Nations handles the conflict between Iran and Iraq must have a decisive effect upon its reputation in the eyes of all the peoples whom we represent.\nIf the United Nations is to rise to this challenge, to help end this grotesque slaughter, then we must strive for and maintain a degree of unity that has hardly ever been achieved before. Other international groupings can give a powerful lead, by condemning the conflict and mobilizing all their energies in the cause of Peace. That is why we value the mounting weight of support from the Organization of African Unity, the Arab League, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. In the same sense, the twelve members of the European Community are giving their United backing.\nAll this shows how deeply the world cares about ending the Gulf conflict. But caring is not enough. The Security Council has a particular responsibility to act. That responsibility has been unanimously accepted by the Council, and that unanimity has been built on the collective determination of the five permanent members. Each permanent member has resisted the temptation to put its national interest before the cause of peace - and must continue to do so, for there is an overriding need for the five to continue working together, as the motor of action by the whole Security Council. \nNo one has understood and emphasized that need more than the Secretary\u2014General himself. So it was particularly fitting that he personally should have undertaken the difficult and delicate mission recently entrusted to him by the Security Council\u00b7 For this, as for all his service in the cause of peace, he deserves our warm thanks and admiration.\nAs a result, we now know the views of the Iraqi and Iranian Governments on resolution 598 (1987). That resolution, legally binding, demanded that both Iran and Iraq should cease fire. It paid due attention to the legitimate concerns and grievances of both Iran and Iraq. And, rightly, it provided that in the absence of compliance the measures necessary for enforcement would be put in place, The Security Council's determination to ensure compliance must remain firm. What we now have to decide is whether the Security Council should move without further ado to an arms embargo.\nAfter Iran's deeds and words this week, can anyone still believe that it intends to comply with the resolution? Monday's two unprovoked attacks, with missile and mine, show Iran's true intentions. So do the words of its President from this rostrum yesterday. He described the Security Council as \\\"a paper factory for issuing worthless and ineffective orders\\\". He invited the world to conclude that \\\"the only option left is to use violence' (A/42/PV.6, p. 57).\nThe United Kingdom therefore thinks it essential now to start work on the further measures foreseen in resolution 598 (1987). The first step should be an arms embargo, to prevent the flow of arms to those wishing to ignore the United Nations and to prolong the conflict. For action is needed - action to show that the Security Council is neither worthless nor ineffective, that it will uphold its authority. We in Britain will not hesitate to take the steps at home which we judge necessary. I can announce today that we have decided to close down the operations of the Iranian military procurement offices in London. For us, the cynical attack on the \\\"Gentle Breeze\\\" was the last straw. The United Nations as a whole should learn the same lesson from what Iran has said and done this week.\nThe Gulf conflict is the most imminent danger. But it is not the only threat to world peace. The Arab-Israel dispute has already dragged on for decades. But the present deadlock is no solution, no panacea. Far from it: It is highly unstable. In the occupied territories, misery and repression persist. In Israel itself, the Palestinian population is rapidly expanding. Already two generations of Arabs and Israelis have lived out their lives under the shadow of war and insecurity. Yet the basis for the settlement that must one day be reached is plain to see: Israel's right to a secure existence; and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.\nVirtually the whole world now accepts the idea of an international conference under United Nations auspices. The United Kingdom is convinced of the need for it. An international conference will provide a framework for negotiations. It will not be a trick or a trap. It will not impose solutions, nor have the right to veto agreements reached between the parties. It need not be feared by any man of goodwill. Nor can the international community ignore Lebanon, where the United Nations Interim Force needs our full support. The Lebanese must be left to tackle their problems free from outside interference. All foreign forces should withdraw, and Lebanon's international borders must be respected. \n\nThere are far too many innocent victims of all these conflicts. They include those who have been taken hostage, some of whom, alas, are citizens of my own country. We have some experience of defending ourselves against terrorism. Our position is clear and quite unshakeable. We will do no deals with terrorists. That is the only policy that makes sense. Every sordid deal by a Government, every ransom paid, makes another terrorist act worthwhile and increases the threat to all out citizens.\nI say to those who are holding Britons hostage; we shall never submit to your blackmail. You will gain nothing. You will only bring your cause into disrepute. Set the hostages free. I urge all those with Influence over those holding hostages to say the same. And I urge this whole Assembly, on behalf of the hostages of every nation, to send the same plain and urgent message.\nAnother problem cries out for a United response from the International community; southern Africa - never off the agenda of this Organization, and tightly so. For although South Africa may not be the only example of racial Intolerance in this world, it is unique in the Institutionalised domination of other races by the white population. Apartheid is morally repugnant, indefensible, inhuman. But it is indeed more than that; it is also suicidal for those who practise it. All the lessons of history tell us that. Apartheid breeds discontent, violence and revolution. We understand the seething discontent of the black population, who can fall to be moved by the thought that a whole generation  as come of age while Nelson Mandela has remained behind bars?\nAnd yet a prosperous, stable and just South Africa cannot be built by violence that is the way to ruin, despair and death. Those who rule South Africa must change course before it is too late. There are signs that some of them realize that, but reforms so far have been too slow and too limited. The time bomb is in place and the clock is ticking; it must be defused before it is too late.\nWe all share one common aim: the elimination of apartheid as quickly as possible. What can the world do to encourage South Africa in the right direction? The answer cannot lie in further measures which would serve only to unite the whites against the world, to slow the process of change, to prolong apartheid, and to blight the lives of the very people we wish to help. Yet we must maintain the moral pressure on the rulers of South Africa. They must not be allowed to put their faith in the status quo. We must convince them that peace and security can be achieved only through genuine dialogue with the leaders of the other races, and by comprehensive reform. We are working to that end.\nOf course, apartheid afflicts not only those who live in South Africa; it also destabilizes South Africa's neighbours. The United Kingdom is taking a lead in helping the front-line States: for some of them we are giving practical help in training and equipping their military forces to ensure the security of their transport links; for others we have given extensive aid to develop alternative transport systems and to pay for training and equipment. Our aid to the States of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) over the last five years totals more than $1 billion. Few if any of the States represented here today can match that record.\nSouth Africa is by far the world's worst example of racial intolerance. But very few areas of the world are free from quarrels founded on differences of race, religion or language. Such quarrels need not be insoluble. The European Community is one of the most successful examples in history of making shared values and aspirations rise from the ashes of war and division. Yesterday's speech by the Foreign Minister of Denmark, which now holds the presidency, was eloquent testimony to our progress towards \\\"ever closer union\\\". In Sri Lanka there are hopeful signs that ethnic conflicts might be ended. The agreement between President Jayawardene and Mr. Gandhi is a bold step forward. The deplorable terrorist attack on the Sri Lanka President last month underlined the dangers besetting those who work for an agreement of this kind. They displayed great courage. Everyone must now work for its continuing success.\nLikewise in Cyprus we support the Secretary-General's efforts to bring the two sides towards a settlement. The United Kingdom knows that difficult decisions are needed. We call on both sides to show the necessary courage.\nAnd, in Korea, the United Kingdom notes with close interest the recent moves to restart dialogue between North and South. We support moves to reduce the tensions in that divided peninsula. We hope that the Korean people may soon be represented here. All these political problems demand the urgent attention of the United Nations. So do those in the economic field, which directly affect so many Member States.\nOne economic burden, one which has featured prominently in many speeches from this rostrum, is the cycle of debt. Here Britain has recently put forward an initiative to help the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa, which are striving to set their economies on a sustainable basis for development. This means converting aid loans into grants, rescheduling official loans with longer grace periods, and reducing interest rates on official loans. Already in this region we have written off aid debts to the tune of \u00a3244 million.\nYet despite all our efforts, glut and famine still disfigure the world. In the industrial countries we subsidize our farmers to produce food nobody wants and sell it below the cost of production. In developing countries, the subsidy, if there is one, goes to the consumer, and price control deprives the farmer of the incentive to produce more. So he leaves the land to find work in the city - and his Government has to buy from abroad the food he would have produced. The cost to the world and the waste are enormous.\nThe huge and urgent task of agricultural reform is to recreate market incentives and progressively to eliminate protectionist measures around the world. Food must be on the agenda whenever nations gather for discussion. It will be much on our minds at next month's important meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in Vancouver, to which Britain much looks forward.\t.In Europe in the last 40 years we have shown that the divisions of history can be healed by wholly peaceful means, by political co-operation and by economic integration. Military force, as we Europeans know to our cost, seldom brings a lasting solution to anything) it can be only a last resort when everything else has failed.\nThat is just as true in Central America. Here, too, long-term security can only be assured by a peaceful settlement reached with the free consent of all its peoples, democratically expressed. That is why we welcomed the agreement signed by the five Central American Presidents in Guatemala in August. We wish it every success.\nIt is true too in the South Atlantic. We shall continue to look for ways of restoring more normal relations with Argentina while upholding the Falkland Islanders' rights to self-determination.\nThis universal truth applies to Asia as well, and nowhere more than in Afghanistan. During eight years of Soviet occupation, tens of thousands have been killed and 5 million refugees have been driven to leave their country. That is a bitter indictment of Soviet polices and a grave burden for Pakistan, which has shouldered it nobly. \nBut the Soviet Union of today is not the Soviet Union which invaded Afghanistan. Since he took over the reins of power, Mr. Gorbachev has made a remarkable effort to reform, to restructure, to let in light and air from the outside. We have publicly applauded this, and we wish him well. We believe that a more prosperous and efficient Soviet Union will be easier for the world to live with and for its own citizens to live in.\nI believe that Mr. Gorbachev knows that he needs a stable international environment to carry out his programme of reform. I detect a genuine wish to find a way to end the war in Afghanistan and to bring Soviet soldiers back from the rocky valleys where so many of them have fallen. Of course that is not an easy task. But the Soviet leaders must make the necessary leap of Imagination if glasnost and perestroika are to have the effect that they should on Soviet foreign, as well as domestic, policy.\nThe Soviet Union can reasonably seek to avoid instability or threats to its security on its borders. But it must accept that only when a government emerges in Afghanistan that truly commands the confidence and trust of the Afghan people, only then will Afghanistan be stable. The Soviet Union must grasp the nettle: it must withdraw its troops and let the Afghan people decide their own future.\nSo yet again we meet in the shadow of numerous conflicts. But the gloom is not unbroken. The arms control agreement announced last week by the United States and Soviet Foreign Ministers has lit a beacon of hope for all those who see in greater co-operation and mutual trust between the super-Powers the key to a less troubled world, for the hope must be that an intermediate-nuclear-force (INF) treaty, once concluded, will have benefits extending beyond the agreement itself. It has always been clear that arms control cannot on its own carry the weight of placing and keeping East-West relations on an even keel. Indeed, recent years have shown how difficult it is to make progress in arms negotiations if relations between East and West are generally sour.\nBut these things do cut both ways. An INF agreement which, for the first time ever, bites into the nuclear arsenals of each side, which, for the first time ever, provides for stringent verification - such an agreement should significantly increase the mutual confidence without which any significant progress in East-West relations is unattainable.\nWe have not suddenly arrived at some promised land, but an INF agreement will give a shot of adrenalin to the often lethargic and lumbering process of arms control. The next priorities are a 50 per cent cut in the strategic arsenals of the super-Powers, a world-wide ban on chemical weapons, the removal of imbalances in conventional weapons from the Atlantic to the Orals. They are complex and difficult and will test to the utmost the skill, patience and determination of both sides' negotiators.\nBut an INF agreement will begin to erode the thick ice-cap of mistrust that has accumulated over the years. Of course the melting process will itself release dangerous ice blocks and floes around which we shall all have to navigate with care.\nThe key is greater trust. If we can see the Soviet Union making a genuine effort to co-operate in solving the world's regional tensions; if we can see them putting the solution of such tensions before the pursuit of national interest; if we can see a more just, free and humane society developing in the Soviet Union, then I think we shall see greater trust between East and West.\nI am not unhopeful. The co-operation between the Five on Security Council resolution 598 (1987) may be a sign of better things to come; and the\u00b7 last year has seen real progress on human rights in the Soviet Union. But there is still a long way to go. For our part we have worked intensively to build up the East-West dialogue. The visit to Moscow by the British Prime Minister and myself in March was an occasion for unusually deep and valuable exchanges. They will continue.\nAt the beginning of this statement I spoke of a moment of hope. The INF agreement and the impending summit between President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev are indeed reason for hope. I think it will be the prayer of every one of us here that' that still faint shaft of light will grow and will drive the shadows of fear and distrust ever backward until they ate finally eliminated from this world.\nIn opening the first General Assembly session in London, Clement Attlee, then British Prime Minister, described the simple truth behind the formation of the United Nations; \\\"The realization by all nations that without co-operation for peace there can be no security for any nation\\\".\nThat is still the most basic truth. That is why we are here.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nComrade president, allow me to congratulate you cordially upon your election to the high office of President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session. We are confident that under your able guidance the world Organization will adopt important decisions in the name of peace and the well-being of peoples.\nI should like to express the confidence of my country in the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, and our readiness to extend to him, as we have done in the past, our fullest support in the discharge of his highly responsible mission.\nEach session of the General Assembly brings us closer to the twenty-first century. The age in which we live and the issues which we debate have no parallel in the history of mankind. The discovery of the secrets of the atom and the consequences of outer space are the most remarkable characteristics of the unprecedented revolution sweeping science and technology today. However, to out regret, the opportunities presented by the achievements of man's genius and talents have also been used for the needs of destruction. Mankind is now simultaneously faced with the prospect of great material and spiritual progress, and with the prospect of self-destruction. Such is the tragic paradox of our nuclear and space\nA distinguishing feature of the present phase is the scope and complexity of the problems confronting nations and States, as well as their interrelated and Sometimes conflicting interests. But for all its contradictions the present-day world is becoming ever more interconnected and unified. The threat of a nuclear Catastrophe that looms over us binds States and social systems together by a common fate. Radioactive death and \\\"nuclear winter\\\" know no boundaries, be they Geographical, State or ideological. This reality, as well as a number of other social, economic and ecological factors of global scope, have brought to the fore the necessity for new thinking and a new approach to international affairs.\nSecurity for all, mutual trust, and common efforts to build a world free of violence and war, hunger and poverty, a world of harmony between man and nature - this is the essence of the comprehensive system of international peace and security proposed by the socialist countries. Only in this way can the problem confronting mankind today be resolved. Of course, no single State or group of States can claim to offer us a faultless model for the future. My delegation is of the view, however, that the question is one of a principled approach to the problem of the survival of mankind and the continuation of civilization. By promoting and building upon a dialogue on this question which affects all peoples and States on our planet, the General Assembly could, at the current session, fulfil an important obligation to succeeding generations.\nThe core o\u00a3 the problem of security in the nuclear age is undoubtedly to be found in the need to eliminate the material base for waging a war of destruction\u00b7 Forty-two years after the explosions of two primitive - by today's standards - nuclear bombs, there are now over 50,000 nuclear warheads stockpiled in the world. New and even more lethal weapons of mass destruction are being developed. With each new round of the arms race, world security is being critically eroded, instead of strengthened. The spectre of an annihilating nuclear apocalypse, lurking in the agony of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, has increasingly haunted the conscience and consciousness of modern man.\nAt a time when close to a trillion dollars are being squandered on the production of means of destruction annually, 13 million people die of malnutrition every year. Let me recall the words of the great daughter of India, the late Indira Gandhi\t\n\\\"Independence and development are inseparable from disarmament and peace.\\\" My country is deeply convinced that the implementation of real disarmament measures will not only lessen the threat to human life, but will also allow more resources to be released for its betterment.\nCommon sense and the striving for good and creativity have never been in harmony with the philosophy and policy of violence. In keeping with the law of dialectics, the growing nuclear danger has been accompanied by a steep rise in the activity and impact of those forces that recognize the Inadmissibility, absurdity and criminal nature of nuclear war, as well as the damage done by the arms race. For a number of years now, peace and disarmament forums have been active, and talks on arms reduction and strategic stability have been under way. A turning-point in this difficult and sometimes painful process was the programme for the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction by the year 2000, put forward by the Soviet Union. It set forth a direct and realistic way towards a nuclear-free world. It was on this basis that the Reykjavik summit meeting became possible, creating opportunities for the first time to achieve truly significant progress in the field of disarmament.\nThe first major breakthrough could come with the removal of the medium- and shorter-range missiles of the United States and the Soviet Union. Everyone knows what a long road has been traversed. The \\\"global double-zero\\\" proposal has in fact cleared the road ahead of all obstacles. A few days ago the world learned with great satisfaction that the two great Powers had come to an agreement in principle to do away with these types of weapons. The peoples welcome this step as a prelude to further improvement in the international climate.\nAs the President of the Council of State of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Todor Zhivkov, said on this occasion: \\\"We sincerely believe that the forthcoming signing of this treaty will not only result in the elimination of two classes of nuclear weapons for the first time in history, but will become an incentive to achieving even greater goals, ... it will have a positive effect on relations between the two States, on the East-West dialogue, on the whole international atmosphere\\\". The elimination of the missiles of these classes would have a major political significance for the further progress of efforts in the field of real disarmament. At the same time, we should not forget that these missiles constitute only one of the components of the overall military-strategic confrontation. The next step, one of far-reaching implications, could be a 50 per cent reduction of the strategic offensive arms under conditions of strict observance of the anti-ballistic missile Treaty.\nIn this connection, I should like to express our firm opinion that the development and deployment of space-strike weapons offer no way out of the universally unacceptable situation of \\\"mutual assured destruction\\\". Not only will the work on the strategic defence initiative fail to slow the pace of nuclear rearmament, but it will start the development of qualitatively new arms, including third-generation nuclear weapons. It is obvious that such a system will be another extremely destabilizing addition to the already existing arsenals of offensive weapons. Its role is that of a trump card in efforts to obtain military superiority. That is why my country supports a universal ban on the deployment of weapons in outer space.\nThe Geneva Conference is called upon to play an important role in reaching agreements on the entire spectrum of key disarmament issues. A positive element in its recent work is the progress made on the question of banning chemical weapons. There are increasingly real prospects for agreement on the text of a relevant convention. The People's Republic of Bulgaria will do its utmost to assure the successful conclusion of this work. We sincerely hope that the positive resolution of this extremely important problem will not be blocked by unilateral actions aimed at chemical rearmament.\nIt has long been recognized that the complete cessation of nuclear-weapons tests is both an urgent need and a prerequisite for closing other channels of the arms race. Through its unilateral moratorium, which lasted for more than a year and a half, the Soviet Union has demonstrated in practice that it is ready to take immediate practical steps in this field. There is certain cause for optimism in the agreement reached at the meeting between the Foreign Ministers of the USSR and the USA, Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr. Shultz, to start bilateral talks, the final goal of which would be to achieve a general and complete prohibition of nuclear-weapons testing.\nEnsuring security through disarmament is not confined only to the elimination of nuclear weapons and other means of mass destruction. It also implies the reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces to the minimum level required for defence. The Declaration of the member States of the Warsaw Treaty, adopted at Budapest, contains a realistic programme of radical measures on conventional disarmament and on the reduction of military confrontation \\\"from the Atlantic to the Urals\\\". We believe that the Informal consultations between the members of the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which began at Vienna, will develop into serious negotiations to resolve major long-term issues.\nThe socialist countries do not limit the system of security to the military-political area alone, but view it also as a complex of relationships encompassing the economic, social, humanitarian and ecological fields, in the final analysis, the goal of our peace initiatives is to furnish genuinely humane living conditions for nations and individuals, to preserve man as the greatest value of life and as the creator of wealth and progress.\nThe universal efforts designed to guarantee human rights and to promote international co-operation in the social and humanitarian fields should, as a whole, be aimed at the \\\"humanization\\\" of international relations, at their democratisation, and at providing moral and social guarantees for the maintenance of peace. To pave the way for all this, concerted and enduring efforts will obviously be needed to reaffirm the ideas of peace, disarmament and international security, to increase the scope of mutual knowledge and understanding and to translate the natural right of every human being to live in conditions of peace and freedom into a fundamental norm of international life.\nAn indispensable condition for the \\\"humanity\\\" of international relations and the protection of human rights as an element o\u00a3 international security is to ensure the right of every nation freely and without outside interference to determine its own future, to select its social system, to manage its natural resources and to participate in the International division of labour on an equal and just basis. \nIt is equally evident that in order to build a more humane and safer world it is imperative that we eradicate apartheid, racism, aggressive chauvinism, racial discrimination and religious intolerance. It is necessary to eliminate those deep-rooted social and political factors which generate massive violations of human rights. In other words, International co-operation in the humanitarian and social sphere is feasible, necessary and useful on the basis of an integrated approach to the question of human rights - collective and individual, political and socio-economic alike. We support the proposal to convene in Moscow a representative conference of the States parties to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) which would consider the full range of humanitarian questions as a unified whole, including the issues of human contacts, information, culture and education.\nIt is impossible to imagine a stable international system without equitable and mutually advantageous economic co-operation. It is necessary to eliminate all kinds of discrimination, to alleviate the debt burden of developing countries as much as possible and to restructure the international monetary system.\nThere is a universal need for concerted action to deal with the aftermath of natural disasters, to protect the environment and natural resources and to fight disease and the spread of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic.\nNo less urgent is the need for wide-ranging international co-operation to combat crime and particularly international terrorism. The People's Republic of Bulgaria reaffirms its readiness to contribute towards the co-ordination of effective measures, including those within the framework of the United Nations, to stem this ugly and dangerous phenomenon. We should further strengthen effective measures against the illicit production, trafficking in and abuse of narcotic drugs on a global scale. In this respect too, Bulgaria, which is located at a busy international crossroads, has been working diligently and unswervingly, endeavouring to protect the physical and mental health of its own citizens and of foreign nationals endangered by this scourge of modern-day civilization.\nWe need not mention all the spheres in which co-operation is possible. It is important to emphasize that such opportunities do exist, however, and that our use of them depends, first and foremost, on our overall readiness to take a fresh look at problems and to give up worn-out stereotypes. The question before us today is not \\\"Who benefits from co-operation?\\\", for the answer to that question is clear: everyone does, the whole world benefits from co-operation. The question that we must ask is \\\"What shall we lose if we do not undertake such co-operation?\\\" Perhaps some still delude themselves, but the answer to this question is no less unequivocal: we all risk losing everything.\nInspired by its positions of principle on the cardinal basic issues of peace, security and co-operation, the People's Republic of Bulgaria has been actively engaged in the all-European process. My country has put forward a number of specific initiatives at the Vienna meeting of the States parties to the Helsinki Conference. At this stage, the principal task of that meeting remains the transition from deliberations to the elaboration of the concrete elements of a future final document.\nI should like to recall that a remarkable anniversary is soon to be commemorated by all of mankind - the seventieth anniversary of the great October socialist revolution - for it was that event which brought about a revolution in international affairs and established for the first time practical conditions for the democratisation of international relations and for peaceful coexistence. \nThe new political thinking that is steadily gaining support today means approaching each international problem from the standpoint of finding a generally acceptable solution to it and not viewing it only through the prism of dogma and military-strategic interests. No single State, no matter how powerful, has the right to make unilaterally decisions upon which the fate of entire countries and peoples depends. Existing conflicts should not be settled by the dictate of force. As Mikhail Gorbachev noted in his article devoted to the opening of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly; \\\"new rules of coexistence on our unique planet are called for, in keeping with the new requirements and the changed circumstances\\\".\nOnly through dialogue, responsible behaviour, sincere collective efforts and co-operation can problems be resolved wherever conflicts exist and wherever there is danger to peace and security in a particular region and throughout the world.\nThe situation in the Persian Gulf region is of particular concern. The bloody war between Iraq and Iran has already been raging for almost seven years and has brought untold suffering to those peoples, with both of which we have ties of friendship. The position of Bulgaria is one of principle and is consistent. The war conflicts with the interests of both countries; it provides conditions for selfish interference from outside and threatens unpredictable escalation of the crisis. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council, Bulgaria was involved in the preparation and adoption of resolution 598 (1987). The complete implementation of this resolution would be the best guarantee of a peaceful political settlement of the contentious issues. We support the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his responsible mission to find a just solution to the problem.\nA comprehensive and lasting settlement of the Middle East conflict should not be delayed any longer. Reaffirming our well-known position on this question, we express our hope for the removal of the obstacles to the convening of an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) , as the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\nThe hotbed of tensions in Central America persists. That is why we consider the procedure for establishing lasting peace in Central America adopted by the Presidents of the five Central American countries to be timely and necessary. The series of peace initiatives by the Contadora Group and the Support Group also play an important role in efforts to eliminate this hotbed of tension.\nThe People's Republic of Bulgaria calls for the immediate elimination of the disgraceful system of apartheid and the illegal occupation of Namibia r for strict implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and for the ending of the brutal aggression by Pretoria against the African States.\nIn close proximity to the borders of Bulgaria, the situation in Cyprus remains a source of danger to peace and security in the region. This is a classic example of aggression against and occupation and annexation of part of a sovereign country. As a Balkan State, the People's Republic of Bulgaria is keenly interested in the attainment of a just and lasting settlement of the question of Cyprus. The way out of the existing situation is offered by the proposal to convene an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations. The internal aspects of the problem must obviously be dealt with by peaceful means, including negotiations, taking into account the legitimate interests of the indigenous population of Cyprus and the integrity, sovereignty and non-aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus.\nThe People's Republic of Bulgaria supports the constructive policy of the Afghan Government, which is aimed at restoring peace in the interests of an independent, non-aligned Afghanistan. We believe that the policy of national reconciliation in Kampuchea is in the best interests of the people of that country. The People's Republic of Bulgaria supports the initiatives in favour of the peaceful and democratic reunification of Korea, as well as the proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to declare the Korean peninsula a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\nIt is stated in the Charter of the United Nations and confirmed by practice in international affairs that regional security is an important ingredient of overall international security. In this connection 1 should like to emphasize the particular importance we attach to the situation in the Balkans. The People's Republic of Bulgaria is working with determination to strengthen the positive trends in relations among the Balkan States and to establish confidence and good-neighbourly relations in our region. The proposal of the People's Republic of Bulgaria that bilateral agreements be concluded containing a code of good-neighbourly relations, renunciation of territorial claims and provisions concerning the non-use of the territory of one country for hostile purposes against another and its other initiatives in the area of bilateral and multilateral co-operation are all well known. Equally well known is our idea that, as a first step in that direction, bilateral agreements on the non-use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes that endanger peace and security should be concluded.\nThe People's Republic of Bulgaria is a principled and steadfast proponent of the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. We are profoundly and firmly convinced that the transformation of the Balkan peninsula into a zone free of nuclear and chemical weapons would contribute to improving the climate in the region, in Europe and in the world, and that it would be fully in the interests of the Balkan peoples. We are making every practical effort to this end. We have also proposed that the Balkan States conclude an agreement on the ecological protection of the peninsula and are ready to take practical steps in that direction\nThe United Nations has been entrusted with the unique mission of maintaining peace and security. We cannot conceive of the present-day structure of international relations and their peaceful development without the crucial contribution of the United Nations\u00b7 Nor can we imagine that the major global problems ranging from disarmament to humanitarian issues could be resolved without its involvement. Bulgaria has always supported and will continue to support the activities of the world Organization and strive to contribute to the best of its ability to the strengthening of its effectiveness.\nThe foreign policy of the People's Republic of Bulgaria which is shaped by the highest national interests of our people and the nature of our socialist system, fully reflects the dynamic processes of thorough restructuring and accelerated growth which are under way in our country today. I have in mind the increasing effectiveness of our national economy r the growing democratisation of our social and political life and the radical improvement in the living and cultural standards of our people. We openly discuss our concerns and problems with the rest of the world, we offer our sincere help wherever we can help and we welcome the co-operation of those more experienced and advanced than we are. \nOur internal reforms provide new, propitious opportunities for the international activities of our country and facilitate more active co-operation with our partners at all levels and in all fields. As I have already mentioned, the principal aim of that co-operation is to promote in every possible way friendly ties with all countries, in the name of peace, security and the free and independent development of peoples, and of the prosperity and progress of mankind.\nI reaffirm that the People's Republic of Bulgaria will continue to pursue its policy unwaveringly, a policy which is in harmony with the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great honour for me to speak in this Assembly on behalf of my country, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau,\nSir, the delegation of Guinea-Bissau, which is familiar with your many qualities and talents, takes special pleasure in congratulating you on your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. This is particularly the case because your country, the German Democratic Republic, with which Guinea-Bissau enjoys relations of friendship and co-operation, has always made a positive contribution to the strengthening and consolidation of the role of the Organization, You may rest assured, therefore, that our delegation will not spare its efforts to co-operate with you. I should also like to extend to your predecessor, Mr. Choudhury, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, my country's gratitude for his distinguished services to the international community during his term of office.\nOn behalf of the Government of Guinea-Bissau, I should also like to pay a tribute to Mr. Perez de Cuellar and to express to him our gratitude for his vigorous and tireless work at the head of the Organization. Since his election six years ago the Secretary-General has accustomed us to concrete, courageous and intelligent deeds. Our delegation would like to extend to him once again its support in the restructuring of the Secretariat with a view to strengthening the Organization's ability better to respond to the problems facing it.\nIn this connection, I welcome the appointment of Ambassador Reed as Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs, and I should like to express to him once again my feelings of friendship and to extend to him my warm wishes for success.\nThe agreement in principle with regard to the elimination of intermediate-range missiles reached by the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, as well as the announcement of an autumn summit meeting, have raised fresh hopes within the international community.\nAll of us regard this as the fruit of an earnest desire on the part of the super-Powers to pursue their negotiations successfully and to find grounds therein to encourage them to continue their efforts to arrive at a better understanding and enable them, sooner rather than later, to engage in additional, concrete, complementary and necessary actions to achieve general and complete disarmament. Indeed, disarmament remains the paramount objective, an absolute imperative towards which all States, large, medium-sized or small, must strive with conviction and determination. The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which concluded its work here only a few weeks ago, highlighted the advantages of more rational utilization of the planet's resources. Indeed, while it is true that every State has the right to take the measures needed to ensure its own defence, nothing can justify over-armament, the cost of which is matched only by its absurdity.\n \nIn a world in which the interdependence of peoples is a tangible reality and we all feel both its good and its ill effects, it would be wrong, even harmful, for any country, large or small, to disregard the existence and conditions of life of other peoples, because security is a collective concept which embraces both individual and collective responsibilities.\nMost of the problems facing mankind stem from existing disparities, the injustice that still prevails in the world, the intolerance regarding certain cultures and religious beliefs and the failure to respect individual and collective freedoms in many countries.\nToday we can only watch helplessly the decline in moral values, which are, however, the very basis of all human society. The use of drugs by a growing number of young people is one of the most tragic aspects of this. My country welcomes the results of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, held recently in Vienna, and is determined to play its part in the great international offensive against that scourge.\nMany countries are now facing such difficulties that their peoples have to struggle furiously simply to survive. The adoption by the Governments concerned of sometimes draconian measures to contain and control the situation has not yet yielded the desired improvements. The world economy continues to be characterized by an unprecedented structural crisis, with rare exceptions, growth has remained slow in developing countries, where the volume of exports remains limited if indeed it has not fallen dramatically.\nThus, in Africa, a continent assailed by drought and prey to other natural calamities as unforeseeable as they are disastrous, tremendous efforts have been made to improve the standard of living of the peoples. Important reforms have been undertaken in most African States, including Guinea-Bissau, where vast restructuring has been completed with a view to stabilizing the macro-economic environment. A programme of structural adjustment is under way which embraces, among other things, trade reforms to balance incentives in favour of exports, the adoption of a more realistic rate of exchange and appropriate measures to reduce the budget deficit.\nBut all these reforms, the success of which requires additional sacrifices on the part of our peoples  may be in vain if the international economic situation does not change. The developing countries are now facing the progressive decline in the prices of commodities and the rise of protectionism. This situation has caused them considerable losses and seriously jeopardizes their development efforts. If international trade prospects do not improve, stagnation, if not actual economic decline, is liable to ensue in those countries. We must therefore prevent the multilateral trade system from continuing to decline. But existing imbalances can be eliminated only if current financial flows are reversed to take into account the real ability of developing countries to face the difficult problem of indebtedness.\nThe seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) enabled the international community to make progress on a number of the items that we have mentioned. The final Act of that Conference, which was adopted by consensus, takes into account both the complexity of the debt crisis and the need for the reforms undertaken by debtor countries to be accompanied by an additional input of financial resources on liberal terms. The proposals made by the African Governors at the annual assembly of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which concluded its work last week in Washington, stem from the same analysis and are designed to meet the same concerns.\nAs economic theory and the facts show, merely balancing the books does not necessarily mean progress in terms of development. The social and cultural aspect of development must be at the very centre of our concerns, dominate our analyses and underlie the adoption of appropriate measures to promote the progress of our peoples. The interdependence of various world problems from the economic and political standpoint make it incumbent upon us to avoid confrontation and seek harmony through dialogue and common endeavour.\nOur delegation shares the concern expressed by the Secretary-General in his masterly report and endorses his conclusions as to the grave risks inherent in the current conflicts.\nAll the countries represented recognize that there has been no substantial progress towards solving many of the problems affecting the international community. Indeed, in spite of declarations of intent and the many protestations of good faith, the international situation remains precarious and millions of human beings throughout the world continue to be victims of the horrors of war and repression.\nIn southern Africa, the apartheid regime persists in its policy of domination and racial discrimination, in spite of universal condemnation. The majority of the South African people remain victims of an abominable political system and are exiles in their own country, where the right to exist and live in full dignity is denied them. The racist regime of South Africa has become a master of the art of evasiveness and provocation and is stepping up its delaying tactics and acts of intimidation against its neighbours to delay the independence of Namibia. It has resorted to a whole range of subterfuges and promulgated a series of repressive laws with the cynical idea of breaking the ranks of the South African militants and weakening their liberation movement. The South African people who continue to languish in the apartheid gaols expect practical action from the international community that will bring about the necessary changes more rapidly. They demand the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners, and in particular Nelson Mandela.\nThere are countries among us that have the necessary political power, the essential economic and cultural influence and the clear historical moral obligation to play without further delay the role incumbent upon them to achieve the desired end. My country urges them to do this and follows with interest the positive developments under way in some of those countries.\nApartheid must be combated by all. On this question more than on any other, the international community must unite, organize and take action to wipe that odious system from the face of the earth.\nThe southern African liberation movements must be supported and encouraged in their legitimate struggle, as must the front-line countries, Angola and Mozambique in particular, which are the victims of continuous acts of aggression and destabilization by South Africa. The African National Congress (ANC) has demonstrated to those that might still have doubts its maturity and political intentions and that it is led by responsible people who are aware of and anxious to preserve the equality in law of all South Africans without distinction. The independence of Namibia can be brought about within the desired time-frame only if the necessary pressures are exerted on South Africa and it' all Member States give the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) the constant, resolute support merited by the justice of its cause.\nGuinea-Bissau, faithful to its recent past and to the principles of freedom and democracy, will continue to support actively and in solidarity the struggle of the peoples of southern Africa for their right to dignity. Still in Africa, but closer to Guinea-Bissau, there is the question of Western Sahara and the conflict between Chad and Libya. The persistence of these two crisis situations is a cause of concern to all Africans, who for many years now have spared no effort to bring about peaceful solutions on the basis of the principles in the charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the United Nations Charter and other relevant international juridical instruments.\nGuinea-Bissau, which has always made dialogue one of the instruments of its foreign policy, will continue to support the efforts of the OAU to bring about a settlement of the conflict between Chad and Libya, two countries which we regard as brothers and friends. As In the past, we shall fully support the joint initiatives of the Secretary-General and the current Chairman of the OAU to organize as soon as possible, on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the two Organizations, a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara.\nFor many years now, we have deplored the persistence of the conflict in the Middle East, the consequences of which are not any longer confined to that region. We therefore believe that the convening of an International conference on the Middle East is necessary and could help to promote the establishment of peace and justice in the area. However, if it is to succeed, that conference must take into account the Interests of all the parties concerned, and in particular, the participation on an equal footing of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole, authentic representative of the Palestinian people.\nThe Middle East conflict has assumed such proportions that it has now engulfed Lebanon, whose very existence Is now threatened. On behalf of my country, I reiterate our support for the Lebanese people in its struggle to defend its Independence, national sovereignty, territorial Integrity and cultural and religious heritage. In spite of the persistent efforts of the international community, the conflict between Iran and Iraq continues to worsen. Several leading personalities, Governments and international organizations, including the organization of the Islamic Conference, have tried in vain to use their good offices to help bring to an end that fratricidal war, which is becoming increasingly internationalised. The Persian Gulf has become a veritable powder keg where any mistake could lead to a conflagration with, to say the least, unforeseeable consequences. Understanding of this fact by the members of the Security Council led to the unanimous adoption of resolution 598 (1987), which constitutes an important step towards a negotiated solution to the conflict. \nOn behalf of United-Bissau and in a brotherly spirit, I reiterate our appeal to Iran and Iraq to co-operate fully in this endeavour. With regard to Central America, we are encouraged by the positive development of the situation, particularly through the signing of the Guatemala agreement between the Heads of State of the region. This new and important achievement, while confirming the virtues of dialogue inherent in the peoples of Latin America, clearly demonstrates their determination and ability to resolve their problems for themselves. So we must encourage them to persevere in total independence in the wise direction that they have taken, which is in keeping with their aspirations.\nThe right to self-determination is a hallowed principle of our Organization.\nThat is why I invoke it to defend the right of the people of East Timor to live in freedom and in the way it wishes. For more than a decade now it has been denied that right, in the tragic circumstances with which we are all familiar, East Timor cannot and must not be an exception to the cardinal principles laid down in the Charter. The United Nations and, in particular, Portugal, the legal Administering Authority, can and must discharge their responsibilities so as to bring that Territory, in the conditions provided for in the relevant United Nations resolutions, to the full exercise of its right to self-determination and independence.\nSimilarly, we wish to see the Korean people realize by means of constructive dialogue and in full independence its aspiration to reunification of its country. We hope that the two parties concerned will show the political will necessary to achieve this and we encourage them to continue their efforts.\nIn Kampuchea and Afghanistan, the initiatives taken so far have not yet yielded the desired results. We hope that the efforts of the Secretary-General will be met with a sincere desire on the part of the countries of the region to solve their disputes by negotiation. My country will continue to support the efforts of the international community to bring about a solution that takes account of the principles of the Charter and respect the non-aligned status of the two countries and their sovereign right freely to choose their political system and their course of social and economic development.\nSimilarly, we support the efforts of the international community to preserve the independence, national sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Cyprus, where the two communities must be able to live in peace and harmony.\nThe rapid survey that I have just undertaken, although it has taken in many parts of the world, is not exhaustive and the list of questions that I have mentioned is far from complete. Nevertheless, I shall bring my statement to an end.\nThe international political situation remains precarious because little progress has been made towards achieving respect for the right of peoples to live in freedom, with full enjoyment of their civil and political rights. This is particularly true in Namibia and South Africa, where the inhuman apartheid regime persists. \nIn spite of the efforts of the international community and the good offices of the Secretary-General, serious conflicts continue to threaten international peace and security. The war between Iran and Iraq is assuming ever more alarming proportions. In the Middle East the peoples concerns have not yet seen their hopes fulfilled and the prospects of peace are still remote. The questions of Western Sahara, Kampuchea, Afghanistan and Cyprus, among others, remain items on our agenda, no solutions having been found.\nThe world economic situation remains critical and the debt crisis is threatening the development of many countries, particularly in Africa and Latin America.\nTensions, conflicts, terrorism, the economic crisis, the moral and political crisis and indebtedness are among the major obstacles to the establishment of world peace and the major challenges facing the international community. Solution of the grave problems facing humanity is in many cases difficult. Many attempts are made to achieve settlement but they are constantly frustrated by misunderstanding and intransigence. As we have said, dialogue and trust among nations must be restored if today we want to succeed where confrontation and distrust caused us to fail yesterday. The peoples of the world are entitled to hope that their dreams will come true and it is the duty of the Governments that we represent here to act to that end.\nMy country, Guinea-Bissau, on the oasis of the fundamental principles which have always guided its non-aligned policy of friendship and co-operation with all States, will do everything in its power to make a positive contribution to the efforts of the international community to restore a climate of peace to the world and to strengthen international co-operation, in the real interests of our respective peoples. Our confidence in a better future remains, none the less, unshakeable, for we continue to believe in the genius of man, a genius which has made it possible to bring about the fantastic progress of the world today and the conquest of new domains. We continue to believe, therefore, in the genius of man and in his capacity to overcome all obstacles facing him, provided the will exists. I believe\nand I trust that we shall succeed in mustering that will, which is still lacking.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the people and the Government of Barbados I offer you sincerest congratulations. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session.\nWe also wish to commend your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury of the Republic of Bangladesh, for his deft and elegant execution of the presidency at the forty-first session. His approach and his success are timely reminders that the effectiveness of this Organization resides not in the size of the material store of its Member States but rather in the quality and capabilities of their citizens.\nWe must express our appreciation to you, Mr. Secretary-General, for your steadfast stewardship in remaining at your post to steer the United Nations through this period of unprecedented financial and political peril. Yours is not an easy job, but we have every confidence in your commitment to the integrity of multilateralism and to the survival of the United Nations.\nPermit me to take this opportunity to pay a brief tribute to a statesman who in the normal course of events would have been standing here today. The late Errol Barrow was a man who had limitless faith in the purpose of this Organization and a clear recognition of its importance for small States. \nErrol Barrow's was the gift of a comprehensive grasp of history, from which evolved a remarkable foresight. Within five years of his assuming control of government, the foundation of Barbados1 independence had been laid. His was a vision nurtured in but not confined to the politics of Barbados. He spent his political life promoting and exhorting others in the Caribbean to pursue the goals of self-reliance and political non-alignment# which he regarded as pre-eminent in a world wracked by ideological conflicts.\nHis charge to Barbadians that they be \\\"friends of all, satellites of none\\\" underscored a conviction that modern history had given to the new and emerging States of the world a specific role in international relations. Let me express the deep gratitude of all Barbadians for the universal sympathy extended to us on Prime Minister Barrow1 s passing.\nOn 1 July this year, I addressed the plenary session or the Caribbean Community Heads of Government meeting in Castries, St. Lucia, and took the opportunity to articulate the principles on which Barbados' foreign policy would be predicated \nThey are simply these: recognition of the right to equality of all States in the international community and, in particular, the right of small States to conduct their relations without being bullied or harassed by richer and more powerful States; the preservation and protection of national independence, national sovereignty and national security; the pursuit, protection and development of national resources and national economic interests; resistance to the penetration of our culture and way of life by alien ideologies which do not respect fundamental rights, moral values the rule of law and a greater measure of equality in social and economic life collaboration with countries in the region and beyond, in working for peace and justice and for a new social, political and economic order and repudiation of all forms of racism, apartheid, colonialism, hegemonism, tutelage and imperialism.\nHaving declared these principles, I should like to examine a few questions often raised about the politics of small island States. Why should a tiny island like Barbados, with few resources, enjoy national sovereignty? Can such a small State, having gained its independence, contribute anything to the international community? Will such a small State become a burden to the large and powerful States?\nMy answer to the first question is both brief and self-evident. Barbados, a mini-State, sought to achieve national sovereignty because, for Barbadians, national sovereignty is the most natural condition of a people's existence. We hold that it is not independence and national sovereignty that need justification. Rather, it is the condition of dependence and suggestion - whether it be colonialism, imperialism, hegemonism or any of the several modern \\\"isms\\\" used to describe a system in which the conditions of existence of one people hinge on those of another.\nTherefore, when we assert that no one can manage our own affairs better than we can, we are doing more than voicing an opinion: we are stating a philosophical principle - that freedom to determine their own destiny is the birthright of all people.\nOn 30 November 1987 Barbados will celebrate the twenty-first anniversary of the attainment of sovereign independence. Our experience during those 21 years has confirmed that what Barbadians believed in principle has proved in practice to be effective. With few resources and a capacity for hard work we have been able to transform what was a poor, one-crop economy into a thriving centre of diversified economic activity that affords our people a vastly improved standard of living.\nWe have created a political system of social democracy in which the talents and enterprise of individuals are allowed free play and in which people are assured of health care, education, housing and working conditions as basic rights not subject to market-place negotiation. Moreover, that system is Institutionalised within a legal framework that guarantees the rights and freedoms of all citizens.\nBut national sovereignty must signify more than the right to manage one's domestic affairs\u00b7 The exercise of national sovereignty must encompass the right, the capacity and the will to manage one's relations with other nation States, free from all forms of external coercion, inhibition and interference\u00b7 I am therefore distressed to note that many small States represented in this Organization have frequently found themselves the target of ill-conceived and lightly considered criticism ever since their emergence from colonialism\u00b7\nThis leads me to my second question  Can a small State contribute anything of value to the international community? The answer to that question is equally obvious to Barbadians, for we contend that small States can and do make valuable contributions to the international community. Indeed, the international community as we perceive it today owes its very survival to the small States of this world.\nLarge and powerful States often succumb to the illusion that they can forgo multilateral diplomacy that they can dispense with international co-operation, that they can rely on \\\"balance of power\\\", \\\"spheres of influence\\\" and \\\"alliances\\\" to protect and promote their national Interests abroad.\nSmall States, on the other hand, cannot court self-delusion. They must be active participants in the international community. They must be steadfast practitioners of international co-operation. They must be vigorous exponents of multilateral diplomacy and firm supporters of international organizations.\nSmall States, therefore, have a significant responsibility in this regard. And it is precisely because we are aware of that responsibility that the Government of Barbados rededicates itself to working assiduously for the continued evolution of an international system of multinational diplomacy for peace, development and the security of human rights. For peace cannot be the brokered result of power. While this might have been possible in a pre-democratic age, in today's enlightened world a peace that does not satisfy people's demand for freedom, justice and development will hardly be lasting.\nIn Barbados we see a logical connection between disarmament and peace. We believe that if resources now devoted to destruction were deployed to meet the teal needs of our people many of the causes of conflict and the guest for weaponry would not arise. In this connection, we should like to record our commendation of the efforts of the super-Powers to reach an arms limitation agreement. However, we concur in the dictum of the Brandt Commission that arms limitation arrangements cannot replace disarmament.\nBarbados is a vigorous exponent of true and genuine non-alignment and a faithful adherent of that movement and its principles. We believe that the prospects for peace may be enhanced if small States refrain from engaging in conflicts whose origins are often alien to the interests of their peoples or their national priorities. We believe that, such prospects would be fortified if major States devoted their influence and capabilities to assisting small States in finding productive avenues for national development. We are convinced that such assistance would substantially reduce those tensions which propel small States into local and fratricidal conflicts which devastate their vital human and material potential\u00b7\nAccordingly, Barbados was quick to welcome the signing two months ago of a plan designed to bring peace to Central America\u00b7 This Organization and all peace-loving nations must commend highly the five Central American Presidents who were involved in that initiative. Barbados especially commends the Government of Costa Rica for spearheading this latest development in search of harmony in the region - a process nurtured by the painstaking diplomacy of the Contadora and Support Groups of countries.\nIt is our wish that similar approaches could prevail in the Middle East, the Korean peninsula, Kampuchea, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Barbados believes that the concept of development has many components; economic advancement, the attainment of greater human dignity, security, justice and equality. Strategies for development may differ among States, but it is widely agreed that, without appropriate regard for the interdependence which links all States, no strategy, however well-devised, will have much scope for success.\nSome small States see multinational co-operation, quite correctly in my view, as the most important means of preserving and enhancing their sovereignty: that is, preserving sovereignty from excessive dependence on powerful bilateral partners and enhancing it by allowing small States to achieve collectively what individually lies beyond their resources  It is for this reason that small States must foster the establishment, growth and continued stability of all forms of multilateral partnership and co-operation. \nWe in the Caribbean have drawn clear lessons from our efforts at functional integration under the umbrella of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Now in its thirteenth year, this regional body has given the Caribbean people an efficient mechanism for the expression of their highly developed sense of regional unity and identity and for the attainment of common economic and political goals.\nBarbados has derived similar satisfaction from its membership of the organization of American States, in which our wider loyalties as a hemispheric people are encouraged and strengthened. We welcome the opportunity offered us by the amendment to the Cartagena Protocol to demonstrate further our commitment to sovereignty and solidarity in the region. The past 21 years have brought with them significant economic transformation in Barbados. We take pride in this achievement, but we are mindful of the fact that our performance might have been far different had it not been for the support and co-operation developed through the United Nations system.\nBarbados remains committed to working for the implementation of both North-South and South-South international co-operation. The biggest impediment, in this regard, however, remains the global debt crisis in which the third world is entrapped. We are persuaded that the solution of this crisis may be found in commitment to partnership between developed and developing countries. The long-term solution to the debt problem, as I see it, will require a new orientation to the concept of international trade, bearing in mind that small countries, and especially small States, are heavily dependent on an orderly and fair system of international trade for their economic stability. The Barbados Government will continue to make every effort, both at the regional and at the global levels, to co-operate with other States to ensure that such a system prevails. At stake lies the very survival of our people.\nOur efforts will be no less unstinting in the general area of human rights. Barbados stands among States that pledge themselves to the promotion of all human, civil and political rights and freedoms, among them the right to personal property and protection from slavery and enforced labour? Freedom of expression, assembly and association; and freedom of movement and protection from discrimination on the grounds of race, place of origin, political opinion, colour, creed or sex, subject to respect for the rights and freedoms of others and the public interest. We also pledge ourselves, within the limits of our resources, to promote the economic rights of citizens which enhance the quality of life for individuals and families.\nThe year 1987 carries yet another symbol for the people of Barbados\u00b7 The social and political foundations of what we may regard as modern Barbados were established by certain events which occurred some 50 years ago, in July 1937.\nBarbados was one of several countries in the Caribbean whose inhabitants confronted in the 1930s a declining colonial regime whose modes of governance were not sufficiently responsive to the interests and aspirations of the Caribbean masses. The masses revolted. It is against this historical background that the people of Barbados repudiate the violations of human rights that continue to besmirch our world. \nWe are aware that there are those who ask: Why does the Government, or indeed the General Assembly of the United Nations itself/ make such a fuss about apartheid in South Africa when violations of human rights are committed elsewhere in the world without attracting quite the same attention? The answer is simple: We condemn apartheid and its perpetrators because it is a systematized, institutionalised and governmentally sanctioned abomination, and just as the United Nations was formed out of the tumult and bloody conflict of the Second World War to ensure that such an abomination may not be repeated, so too the United Nations must have as its highest priority the elimination of apartheid.\nWe believe that apartheid owes its survival in part to the weakening of international commitment to clear concepts of the rights of mankind. We have wavered when we ought to have been forthright. Too often have the issues of human rights been viewed through the screen of ideological concern. Too often have they been subordinated to perceived national interests.\nI have sought to indicate some of the principles which underpin the foreign policy of the Government of Barbados. We are a small nation, but our size has in no way impinged upon our capacity to differentiate between human rights and human wrongs.\nAs we in Barbados prepare to mark our coming of age as a member of this body, we look forward to even greater participation in its several councils and agencies. And as I conclude, I wish to suggest that greater participation by small States in the management of the Organization will not be an achievement for small States only, it will be, above all, an accomplishment for the United Nations. It is only when such participation becomes commonplace that the United Nations will have reached its own maturity and the promise of San Francisco will have been fulfilled. \nWe in Barbados look forward to continuing the excellent relations we have enjoyed with the United Nations. We pledge ourselves to continue to uphold the principles of the United Nations Charter. We affirm our belief that men and institutions are free only when freedom is founded upon respect for the rule of law and respect for moral and spiritual values. We declare our intention to assist in maintaining a society and an international community in which all persons and nations, great and small, may make their just contribution to the welfare of all mankind.\n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session attests to your personal eminence and distinction and our confidence in the guidance and leadership you will provide to our deliberations. We are particularly happy since you come from a country with which India has warm and fraternal relations. We congratulate you on your election and look forward to working together with you.\nAllow me also to pay a tribute to our esteemed friend and neighbour from Bangladesh, Foreign Minister Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, for the effective manner in which he conducted the proceedings of our last session.\nWe greet also our distinguished Secretary-General, and wish him well in the discharge of his many exacting responsibilities.\nThe year 1987 has special significance for us in India. Four decades ago our people won freedom from colonial bondage through a unique non-violent struggle. Independent India took its rightful place in the comity of nations. We have sought to strengthen the foundations of new India by keeping what is best from our own tradition and by assimilating what is admirable from other civilizations. The fundamental concepts of tolerance, non-violence and equality have conditioned our Weltanschauung. Tolerance and non-violence are embedded in our policy of peaceful coexistence and the principles of Panchshila. Equality lies at the root of our belief in democracy and in the sovereign equality of all nations, a principle that is embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.\nEven before our independence, the people of India reposed great faith in this Organization. We were present at its creation. The founder of modern India, our first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, proclaimed that India's attitude towards the United Nations was one of wholehearted co-operation, and of unreserved adherence, both in letter and spirit, to its Charter, It was in this spirit that he promised that India would; \\\"participate fully in its varied activities and endeavour to assume that role in its Councils to which her geographical position, population and contribution towards peaceful progress entitled her.\\\"\nIn our own way, we have endeavoured to fulfil this promise. Though the Organization has had many ups and downs in its short but chequered history, our commitment to it has never wavered. We ate happy that it has been resilient enough to withstand the attempts to retreat from multilateralism and the financial and budgetary pressures brought to bear upon the Organization.\nMy delegation welcomes the significant understanding between the United States and the USSR to eliminate in termediate-1ange nuclear forces. Even though these forces constitute only a very small fraction of the world's nuclear arsenals, we see the significance of the understanding in the prospects it has opened up for more wide-ranging agreements, which could eventually lead to meaningful nuclear disarmament.\nThis understanding vividly demonstrates that, given political will, disarmament measures can become a reality. It is imperative that this momentum towards peace and disarmament be sustained. While the primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament rests with the United States and the Soviet Union, a decision by other nuclear-weapon Powers to eliminate nuclear weapons would be an important contribution to the promotion of peace.\nNot long ago, on 22 May 1987, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi joined with leaders of Argentina, Greece, Mexico, Sweden and Tanzania in emphasizing that: \\\"For too long, fear and mistrust have prevented progress in disarmament. Arms and fears feed on each other. Now is the time to break this vicious circle and lay the foundation for a more secure world\\\". (A/42/319, Annex). It may perhaps be premature to believe that the \\\"vicious circle\\\" is broken\u00b7, but it has perhaps been dented and we hope that the momentum will not be lost.\nA historic event in this continuing struggle to save humanity from a nuclear holocaust was the signing of the Delhi Declaration on principles for a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world, in New Delhi last November. Its importance lies in the fact that a major nuclear-weapon Power, the USSR, joined with a major non-aligned country, India, to announce 10 principles that could pave the way to a nuclear-weapon-free civilization. We are happy that a beginning has been made by the super-Powers towards translating at least some of the principles of the Delhi Declaration into concrete action.\nThe international arms race and its deleterious effect on the world economy was the focus of a conference earlier this month. The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development threw into stark relief the deplorable dilemma of massive global expenditure on arms, on the one hand, and the non-availability of resources for meeting the basic needs of a large portion of the world's population, on the other. An overwhelming majority of nations took part in it. I had the privilege of presiding over that Conference, which reaffirmed, at the political level for the first time, the relationship between disarmament and development. It is important that follow-up steps be taken quickly so that the conclusions of that Conference may be translated into action. May we now hope that those who stayed away from those discussions will participate in this effort. \nI now turn my attention to southern Africa, where the struggle for freedom and equality continues to this day. The racist regime in Pretoria violates every norm of civilized conduct. Its policy of apartheid is an affront to the conscience of mankind. The Pretoria regime remains in illegal occupation of Namibia and continues to carry out acts of aggression against the front-line States. It is thus the root cause of tension, instability and conflict in the region, endangering international peace and security. It has rejected every initiative for a peaceful resolution of the problems of the region. \nIn the face of the intransigence of the racist regime, the only peaceful course before the international community is to impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa\u00b7, the alternative is violent upheaval. We reiterate our full support for the freedom struggle of the people of Namibia, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization. The only basis for a peaceful settlement of the Namibian question lies in Security Council resolution 435 (1978), without bringing in any linkages.\nThe non-aligned countries, at their summit meeting in Harare last year, decided to set up the Africa Fund, with the object of assisting the front-line States and national liberation movements in southern Africa against the depredations of the racist regime. India is privileged to have been chosen to chair the fund, which has become operational with wide support from the international community. Those of us who believe in the moral need to work for the peaceful resolution of the problems of southern Africa have a duty to support and contribute to the fund.\nOn 29 July President Jayawardene of Sri Lanka and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi signed a historic agreement which has brought peace and tranquillity to Sri Lanka after four years. We had throughout stressed the importance and the necessity of a political settlement to the ethnic conflict that had plagued Sri Lanka since 1983. I should like to pay tribute to the President of Sri Lanka for signing this agreement, which is a manifestation of the fact that non-aligned countries can resolve their problems without outside interference. Bearing in mind the recent history of the conflict, there are inevitably minor hitches and problems, but they are not insurmountable. Given the existing understanding and goodwill between the two countries they will be resolved sooner rather than later.\nThe situation in West Asia is gravely worrying. The core problem is the question of Palestine. The people of Palestine are still denied their inalienable human rights, including the right to establish an independent state in their homeland. We support the struggle of the Palestinian people, led by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). We urge that an international peace conference on the Middle East be convened at an early date, under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the PLO.\nThe continuing hostilities between Iran and Iraq concern us greatly. We have close historical ties with both countries. Our heartfelt desire is to see those two nations live in peace. The conflict between two important members of the Non-Aligned Movement, taking place as it does in a region which is in our immediate neighbourhood, has consistently engaged our attention. The United Nations has been deeply involved in seeking ways and means to end the war. The Security Council adopted unanimously resolution 598 (1987) and the Secretary-General has been engaged in important consultations relating to its implementation. We commend and support these continuing efforts in the hope that they will bring about a\t'\nnegotiated, mutually acceptable settlement of this tragic conflict.\nIndia supports the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to secure an early and peaceful solution to the situation in Afghanistan. The military presence of great Powers in the Indian Ocean is ominous. Such presence has unfortunately intensified in recent months. The heightened military, presence of outside Powers is in conflict with the 1971 Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. It demonstrates vividly that the main objective behind the 1971 Declaration is as valid today as it was when the Declaration was made.   What is more, it shows the futility of efforts to dilute the thrust of the primacy in the objective of the Declaration, which is to tackle the external threat in the Indian Ocean. In that context we believe that for the proposed international conference on the Indian Ocean to achieve meaningful results it will be necessary to ensure that all big Powers having a military presence in the Indian Ocean participate.\nI come new to another neighbouring region of ours with which we have very close historical and cultural links. As we have always advocated in conflict situations, the south-east Asian question can be resolved only through political dialogue. The legitimate interests and concerns of the countries in the region must be taken into account. We are encouraged by the fact that all countries in the region want a peaceful solution and are engaged in finding a formula for a regional dialogue. We have seen possibilities of common areas of understanding emerge following the recent meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Viet Nam I have myself recently visited all the countries belonging to the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Indo-China States. We believe that such contacts must be strengthened and more widely established among the countries of the region.\nThe Korean peninsula continues to remain divided. We support the desire of its people for peaceful reunification. There have been encouraging developments in Central America. Following the invaluable work of the Contadora and Support Groups the Central American States have taken a regional initiative of great importance. We warmly welcome the Guatemala accord and the subsequent follow-up action. We trust that all parties, both within and outside the region, will co-operate fully to ensure the success of this regional initiative, which offers the prospect of peace, progress and stability in Central America.\nWe reaffirm once again our solidarity with the people of Cyprus, whose country remains divided with part of it under foreign occupation. We reaffirm our support for the unity, territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence and non-alignment of Cyprus, a country with which we have traditionally had close and friendly relations. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General to bring about a satisfactory resolution of this issue.\nThe events in Fiji have been deeply distressing. It is particularly tragic that at a time when the political parties representing the people of Fiji had come to an agreement which could have taken the country on the path of national reconciliation the armed forces have dealt a severe blow to that process, by seizing power for a second time. Attempts to deprive citizens of the country of their legitimate rights merely on the basis of their racial origin are against all tenets of democracy and human rights and are contrary to the United Nations Charter. What is happening in Fiji has distinct and unacceptable racial overtones. This development is reprehensible. We believe that the path to peace and prosperity in Fiji lies in the restoration of democracy and the rule of law.\nThis year India achieved the unique distinction of becoming the first registered pioneer investor under the United Nations regime of the oceans with the allotment of a deep sea-bed mine site in the Central Indian Ocean. An equivalent mine site has been reserved for international exploration and exploitation. We believe that this historic event has set in motion the international regime of deep sea-bed mining and has strengthened the rule of international law. \nI now turn to the world economy, which continues to be in a state of deep disarray. The rates of growth of even developed countries are historically very low. All future projections indicate even lower rates of growth for those countries. The per capita incomes of many developing countries have dropped to levels lower than they were a decade ago. Commodity prices in real terms have collapsed to their lowest levels in 50 years. Despite the launching of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, the proliferation of protectionist measures continues unabated. Interest rates continue to be high in real terms. International liquidity has suffered a sharp contraction in relation both to the volume of trade and to the needs of developing countries. The pattern of trade balance is extremely skewed, with unsustainable surpluses in some countries and deficits in others, and exchange rates continue to show wide fluctuations. It is now widely recognized that the world economy faces a structural crisis which cannot be overcome within the framework of the system instituted after the Second World War. There is therefore an urgent need for evolving co-operative strategies informed by the explicit recognition of increasing global interdependence. We require concerted and comprehensive policy measures in the interrelated areas of money, finance, debt, trade, resource flows and development. The current crisis of the world economic system can be overcome only if we work towards a new international economic order.\nIn the area of international trade, the highest priority must be given to the preservation and strengthening of an open multilateral trading system, and particularly to translating into practice the oft-repeated commitments on standstill and rollback. It is important to ensure that the Uruguay round of negotiations leads to the emergence of a truly international trade regime conducive to growth and development, with a clear recognition of the needs of developing countries. Multilaterlism and non-discrimination must form the basis for the sustained expansion of trade.\nIn the area of commodities, we reaffirmed at the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) the continued validity of the integrated Programme for Commodities. We trust that with the new ratifications the Common Fund will become operational before the end of 19B7. We also hope that the new round of consultations on commodities not covered by existing agreements and arrangements will be initiated soon.\nThe flows of financial resources from developed to developing countries should be increased substantially and the resources of international financial institutions should be augmented so as to enable them to play a leading role in development finance. We are disappointed that the eighth replenishment of the International Development Association is no larger in real terms than the sixth replenishment. We are however encouraged by the recent move towards reaching agreement on a general capital increase of the World Bank.\nThe external debt crisis is one of the most serious problems afflicting the developing countries today. The solution to the debt crisis has to be equitable, flexible and development-oriented, based on the concept of shared responsibility and political dialogue. For the success of such a strategy, the promotion of parallel objectives - such as increased access to markets for exports of developing countries, lower interest rates, strengthened and stabilized commodity prices, more stable exchange rates and more vigorous growth-oriented macro-economic policies in major developed countries - is indispensable.\nIn the light of the generally dismal state of the international economic dialogue, the recent seventh session of UNCTAD must be viewed as a modest success. In at least some areas progress was achieved. Viewed against the background in which the Conference was held, its major significance lies in the reaffirmation of the validity and mandate of UNCTAD.\nThe report of the World Commission on Environment and Development is a major contribution to the subject. We are glad to note that the Chairman of the Commission, Prime Minister Brundtland, in her address to UNCTAD VII, sought to allay apprehensions that environmental concerns could be used for imposing additional conditionality in the lending policies of international financial institutions. The Brundtland report clearly demonstrates the importance and urgency of tackling environmental issues on a global level. If we seriously want to attach high priority to this objective, the international community must find additional resources for sound environmental measures. Any diversion of existing resources from growth-focused to environment-focused disbursement will be counter-productive. Poverty pollutes. Any slowing down of development can only aggravate environmental problems in developing countries.\nWe meet here each year in the month of September to deliberate on what ails mankind. Does looking back on the past nine months fill us with hope or despair? This is a time for stocktaking, self-criticism and introspection. The international horizon presents a dark and sinister picture. Here and there an all too brief break in the clouds is visible; otherwise we seem to be looking at clouds that have no silver lining.\nSome weeks ago the world population exceeded the 5 billion mark - a sobering event. The drain on sources of energy is unabated. The affluent are burning their candles at both ends and in the middle too, while the less fortunate are deprived of the basic necessities of life. The daily onslaught on the environment continues. The economic scene is not cheering. Terrorists and fanatics disturb the peace and repose of nations.\nThe United Nations does not offer salvation, but it has paved, it can pave, the way, create the atmosphere, provide the venue and propose the agenda for peace. As somebody has said, while it cannot, perhaps, negotiate for the world, the United Nations can help the world to negotiate.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMy first words are words of congratulation to you, Sir, on your unanimous election to the Presidency of the General Assembly. The delegation of Argentina is pleased to have supported the election of the Bureau. Let me assure you that we will co-operate with you in your efforts so that the forty-second session of the General Assembly may contribute to the solution of the problems facing mankind.\nAt the same time I wish to acknowledge the wisdom with which my distinguished colleague Mr. Humayun Rasheed Chowdhury fulfilled his duties.\nI wish also to express our congratulations to Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed in his new duties as under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs. From this rostrum, we often warn about the serious crises that affect our planet and we call attention to the misunderstandings and conflicts that threaten the harmony of mankind.\nI believe that in 1987 we must begin recognizing the progress towards peace that has taken place in the world. One fact suffices to explain my statement, which is also the reason for my hope - the recent historic understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union concerning the dismantling of short- and medium-range missiles in Europe. It is the first time since the development of nuclear weapons that an effective commitment to disarmament has been initiated. The fact that common sense has prevailed in the relationship between the major ' Powers is, I believe, the event of the greatest political importance to affect the planet in recent decades.\nAll members of the international community have an important role to play in this regard. Nuclear disarmament is undoubtedly a priority task, which cannot be delayed, with that conviction, the leaders of Greece, India, Mexico, Sweden, Tanzania and Argentina are actively pursuing the initiative for peace and disarmament known as the Group of Six, which since its inception has postulated the adoption of decisions that might halt and reverse the nuclear arms race.\nIn the multilateral sphere, we feel encouraged by the progress evidenced in the disarmament conference towards achieving a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. We hope to see that convention materialize in the near future, on a non-discriminatory basis. There is thus evidence in the world of a greater willingness to have recourse to negotiation as the proper way of approaching the solution of conflicts. Such an attitude must obviously be encouraged by all means - among these, our Organization, the United Nations, provides an ideal framework for the development of negotiations and understandings, in that sense, my Government wishes to stress the tireless activity of our Secretary-General, whose efforts to make the United Nations the most valuable element for peace available to us are widely recognized and appreciated. His work is a source of legitimate pride for his country - so dear to us Argentines - and for our regional group, from which he was chosen.\nIn its participation in the Security Council Argentina is inspired by its desire to make a concrete and effective contribution to the strengthening of the United Nations. Through our votes, and our participation in general, in the Security Council we have in view the consolidation of the system set forth in the Charter, convinced as we are that small and medium-sized countries may contribute significantly to the maintenance of international peace and security.\nIn that light, we have considered various international conflicts, some of them, such as the war between Iran and Iraq and the questions of southern Africa and the Middle East, are obvious and exert daily pressure on the international conscience through their manifestations of destruction and death. Others, such as terrorism and drug trafficking, constitute a more subtle and less orthodox, but none the less dangerous, form of violence.\nAs regards the armed conflict between Iraq and Iran, we have achieved, with the agreement reached among the 15 members of the Security Council, which led to the adoption of resolution 598 (1987), an instrument that allows us to act, to mediate and to promote conditions would allow both countries to safeguard their vital interests, preserve their national honour and dignity, and, above all, regain peace. But we are seriously concerned by the events that have taken place since the adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). That is why, in the view of the Argentine Government, immediate compliance with a cease-fire is necessary as the primary and indispensable condition for achieving the objectives set forth in resolution 598 (1987).\nThe main challenge is, indeed, to achieve peace, but it also seems appropriate to state that we face another challenge - that of demonstrating the effectiveness of our Organization and, in particular, of its Security Council. Accordingly, my Government believes that, without ever putting aside the exercise of political restraint, the Security Council should - if circumstances so require - intensify the search for machinery that might ensure the effective implementation of resolution 598 (1987).\nAlso among the many promising signs this year is the fact that the two Koreas are analysing proposals for reducing armaments and troops and are considering the possibility of signing a non-aggression pact. We must likewise call attention to the meeting of the German leaders as another element favouring the reduction of tension.\nAmong these encouraging events, the Latin American countries would, obviously, also wish to emphasize the development of the situation in Central America. It would be hard to enumerate all the meetings, contacts, proposals and negotiations carried out by the Foreign Ministers of the Contadora Group and the Support Group. Today, we can say that nothing seems to have been in vain, that no effort has been useless. But for that to be so, if peace again becomes possible it will undoubtedly be due to the political will of the five Central American countries whose Presidents, resolutely confronting the regional crisis, signed the Guatemala agreement on 7 August last with a view to working out fundamental solutions with regard to security, the consolidation of institutions, and social and economic development. The Argentine Government continues to be firmly committed to its support of a lasting peace in Central America and has given evidence of that will in a practical way through Its participation in the mechanism for the verification and follow-up of the Guatemala agreements drawn up at Caracas on 22 August.\nThere Is therefore cause for rejoicing that peace in Central America appears possible, but we must also be aware that although the progress achieved is substantial, the situation remains fragile. No political will, no diplomatic skill, can ensure peace without self-determination, non-interference, pluralistic democracy and economic development. And we are all well aware how difficult it is to bring about these conditions. It is therefore essential that the entire international community co-operate in order to create the basic conditions for peace in Central America. If we rejoice at peace, if we search for it and preach it, let us all share the responsibility for its attainment.\nThe situation In the Middle East continues to be unstable and dangerous. We consider it imperative to continue to explore all feasible formulas for obtaining a just, honourable and equitable peace. We are convinced that this will become possible only if the solution Includes recognition, at the same time, of the Inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to live in their own territory - with the authorities and forms of government they freely choose - and the rights of all States of the region - obviously including Israel - to live within internationally recognized boundaries. In that context, the convening of an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation and approval of all parties, would represent a definite step forward. \nWith regard to the critical scene in the Middle East we continue to follow with particular concern the situation in Lebanon, and we feel it is necessary to step up efforts to ensure that Lebanon may recover its full territorial sovereignty and exercise its inalienable right to live free of all foreign interference.\nThe growing deterioration of the situation in southern Africa and the problems of that region have a common cause in South Africa's persistent refusal to abide by the decisions of the United Nations. The continuation of the apartheid regime constitutes one of the worst and most urgent of today's problems. Argentina reiterates its solidarity with the oppressed people of South Africa and its rejection of the Pretoria regime, whose inflexibility endangers international peace and security.\nIn addition, the Government of South Africa continues to occupy Illegally the Territory of Namibia. It is imperative that progress be made towards the self-determination and Independence of the Namibian people. To that end, the Organization must fully assume its direct responsibility over the Territory, adopting the measures necessary for that purpose. In this connection, as in the question of apartheid, my country supports the adoption of mandatory sanctions against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter, since we view that as the most appropriate and effective means to establish justice and the principles of the Charter in southern Africa.\nTense situations between States are often aggravated by acts of international terrorism. The General Assembly has unanimously condemned such criminal acts. We undertake to lend our support to the search for measures that would enable us to make co-operation in this area even more effective.\nArgentina also wishes to reaffirm in the General Assembly its support for the legitimate and just aspiration of the Republic of Bolivia to recover a direct outlet to the Pacific Ocean. We have followed with interest and attention the talks that took place at Montevideo and we hope that the spirit in which they were convened may be renewed in the search for a solution through negotiation and dialogue.\nThe identification of our foreign policy with the principles and purposes of the United Nations is concretely evidenced In those subjects in which we are directly involved. Thus, with regard to the question of the Malvinas Islands, the Argentine Government Is firmly committed to the search of a peaceful and lasting settlement of the sovereignty dispute and related problems that at present exist between my country and the United Kingdom. In this context we have accepted General Assembly resolution 41/40, which requests both Governments to initiate negotiations with a view to finding the means to resolve peacefully and definitively the problems pending between both countries, including all aspects on the future of the Malvinas, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. It is worth recalling that that resolution received overwhelming support, which included close friends of the United Kingdom. That wide support confirms the genuine interest of the international community in finding a solution to the question of the Malvinas Islands.\nUnfortunately, that feeling of the international community has not been shared by the British Government, which has repeatedly rejected the idea of global negotiations without exclusions that may allow us to resolve the dispute between the two countries. The Argentine Republic, while reaffirming its sovereign rights over the Malvinas, South George and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding sea, also repeats its permanent willingness for dialogue, its decision to respect the\ninterests and life-style of the inhabitants of the Malvinas, guaranteeing their well being and prosperity, and its firm commitment to peace. In that sense ray Government expresses its permanent willingness to find mechanisms that may ensure peace in that region without altering in any manner its titles and claims over the islands.\nThe Argentine Government expresses once more its gratitude for the mission of good offices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in accordance with General Assembly resolutions, in the question of the Malvinas. My Government appreciates his efforts and is convinced that the Organization has an important role to play in the process of settling the dispute over the Islands.\nTurning to another area, my delegation is duty-bound to express its gratitude to the outstanding and noble task of the World Commission for the Environment, presided over by the Prime Minister of Norway. The relative reduction in world tension will enable us to devote greater efforts and resources to environmental conservation and to ensure a harmonious and sustained development. From that perspective, for example, the Malvinas region, which today is an area of tension, might, through appropriate solutions, become a region for co-operation and d\u00e9tente that would generate progress and development, with a priority concept of environmental conservation. Once the Argentine territorial claim has been answered, the South Atlantic might become a formidable experiment for co-operation and progress with an inestimable effect on the economies of the Malvinas and Patagonia.\nToday Latin America is confronting a triple challenge.\nIn the first place, there is a challenge to recover and strengthen the democratic political system in places where it has not hitherto existed or where it had been allowed to lapse. The 1980s signalled the recovery of the founding ideals and values of our region. Our destiny is once more in the hands of our peoples. Nothing could be more encouraging for universal peace, because a democratic Latin America is a guarantee of stability and common sense for all the international community.\nIn this new stage, in itself fragile because of the traces left by authoritarianism in Latin America, we are now confronted with a second challenge, the challenge of the threat of war in Central America, the consequences of which would undoubtedly affect the entire region. Contadora has shown that Latin America is capable of facing this second challenge, even at times when all hope seemed lost.\nOur region also faces a third challenge, that of resolving the crisis caused by the external debt and the distortion of the international economic and financial system. Our peoples and Governments have also shown their abilities and decisiveness vis-\u00e0-vis this challenge, which casts the darkest shadows over our future.\nThe consequences of this crisis were defined with common sense and resolve in the Cartagena consensus, in which, with unprecedented courage, we initiated structural adjustment programmes that meant and continue to mean great sacrifices for our peoples.\nAt the same time, we understand that we are facing a re-organization of international political and economic relations and, in spite of the narrow perspectives of the present day, we have made significant progress towards shaping a common regional space. This is evident, for example, in the creation of the so-called Rio Group which, at the forthcoming meeting of the eight Presidents to be held in Mexico, will take one more step towards the integration of Latin America. Consolidation of political systems, a concrete contribution to peace, compliance with the demands of an exorbitant and unfair debt, far-reaching economic restructuring, substantial progress towards integration - these, in short, are some of our achievements in response to that triple challenge. Nobody could reasonably expect so much; nobody could reasonably demand more of us.\nHowever, despite all this, our future is still dark. The present economic situation cannot continue without the chances of deep social crises, which would seriously affect all the progress that we have made. Latin America cannot and should not continue to subsidize the creditor countries as a net exporter of capital. Latin America cannot continue to be the victim of trade wars between the industrialized countries, which have caused an unprecedented fall in the prices of its traditional products, while markets are closed or lost because of the unfair competition created by subsidies. Common sense prevents us waiting passively for an end to that situation.\nA few figures suffice to show the magnitude of the Latin American economic problem. In the last five years alone the main countries of the region have produced a net transfer of capital to the developed world of about $150 billion, which represents an annual reduction of approximately 5 per cent in the investment capacity of our countries, whose investment levels are already below those needed for sustained growth.\nThose figures and that situation are applicable to all the other countries of Latin America, too, and we are sure that our Latin American brothers feel the same. We Argentines have no doubt that the main responsibility for change and growth in our country lies with the Argentine people themselves. Like all our Latin American brothers, we do not beg for help or shift on responsibility on the other shoulders. Having said this, we roust affirm that we have no doubt either how limited is the viability of our countries, however hard we try to achieve our own reforms, however much we reduce our concessions to legitimate social demands, however firmly we reject any demagogic temptation, as long as the present international situation persists. In present international conditions resulting from the debt and the restrictions on trade it will be very difficult to achieve the goal of strengthening democracy and securing an acceptable level of development.\nThe majority of the industrialized countries, if not all, often show their solidarity when an authoritarian regime afflicts our nations; similarly, they rejoice when we Latin Americans return to democracy. It is high time for us to state clearly that we Latin Americans hope that we shall not again in the future need that solidarity in our misfortunes, not having found solidarity in our reconstruction. In that case it would be, as President Alfonsin has so often said, a post-mortem solidarity.\nRightly, since we are responsible for our own future, and are determined never >gain to need that post-mortem solidarity, we believe that it is not possible to deal with situations which are no longer traditional and conventional with the traditional and conventional models and instruments. This is true of the debt. It is fair to acknowledge that in several developed countries there is a growing understanding of the need for a new, unconventional approach to a new problem. The United States Senate recently passed a Bill in which, analysing the question of the external debt, it proposed the creation of an international authority to develop new methods so that creditors and debtors might find a solution to this problem on which to a great extent the present and future of Latin America now depend. The viability of democracy, its continuity and its strength depend above all on the hope of the people, the conviction that it is democracy that makes possible the struggle for a better future. It must be made clear to the Assembly that in Latin America the persistence of the unjust situation created by the debt and discriminatory trade practices is destroying the hope of the peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, allow me to extend to you my delegation's sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. I should also like to express our deep appreciation to your distinguished predecessor, Mr. Huraayun Choudhury, for the skill with which he was able to guide the last session through a difficult period.\nMay I also express our gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his commitment to the cause of peace and his tenacious efforts to promote it. Those efforts, supported by the Security Council, are particularly relevant to the region to which I belong. Despite setbacks, we continue to believe firmly that the United Nations and the Secretary-General remain a decisive factor in the process of peace-making and peace-keeping.\nMany people believe that nuclear deterrence has saved humanity from a world war during the last four decades. The so-called balance of terror may have played a role in military strategy, but it negates our common humanity and remains devoid of any ethical content. On the other hand, few realize that since the Second World War there have been more than 150 armed conflicts, in practically all parts of the world. These have claimed more than 2(J million lives since 1945 - most of them innocent victims of power games and man's inhumanity to man. Right now there are some 40 armed conflicts going on within or between States. The Eastern Mediterranean region, from which I come, has witnessed all three types of armed conflict which have through the ages blotted human history.\nThe first type is characterized by internal tensions and armed violence. Lebanon is a tragic example of this. As compared to the First World War, when the ratio of civilian casualties was only 5 per cent, 95 per cent of the lives claimed in the Lebanese conflict have been those of non-combatants - innocent men, women and children. We mourn them all the more because the tragedy of Lebanon is exacerbated by the perpetuation of the conflict by proxy. The continuing war and the partition of Lebanon only serve interests beyond its borders.\nThe second type of armed conflict is that in which blood is shed when a State, in order to export its revolution, resorts to any means, even armed violence and war. The Iran-Iraq war is an example of this type of conflict. We deplore the use of religion to promote political ends. This war, which has already been ravaging two Muslim nations for more than seven years, is now spreading to the rest of the Gulf area. It represents a serious threat not only to the region but to global peace. Jordan has, without any reservation, supported Security Council resolution 598 (1987), which calls for the imposition of a cease-fire and the withdrawal of all forces to the internationally recognized boundaries, in order to bring an end to this senseless war. The war has already taken hundreds of thousands of lives, including those of children who have been used as soldiers. It must not be allowed to be internationalised by proxy. The super-Powers, which play a decisive role in the context of the Security Council, have a special responsibility which they must fully shoulder in order to bring about peace.\nThe third type is the classic colonial form of armed conflict, where territory is occupied by force for purposes of exploitation and annexation. The Arab-Israeli conflict is a perfect example of that. In this respect, throughout the last two decades Israeli aggression in the occupied territories of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights has continued unabated. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) provide adequate bases for establishing peace in the area. For its part, Jordan has spared no effort to promote the process of a comprehensive peace through the convening of an international conference, sponsored by the United Nations, in which all parties concerned and the five permanent members of the Security Council should participate.\nIt has been said that since war begins in the minds of men it is in the minds of men that the defences for peace must be constructed. The time has come for all of us to adjust our thinking to contemporary realities and to recognize that all our efforts to promote human welfare will be in vain if a just and durable peace remains elusive. It is now 70 years since the Balfour Declaration was signed, nearly 4\u00dc years since Palestine was partitioned and 20 years since the Israelis occupied the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. I personally represent the fourth generation of my Hashemite family which had the honour of leading the great Arab revolution to gain independence and ensure prosperity for the Arab nation. But the problem of Palestine, for which my grandfather gave his life and which has been the main preoccupation of the Hashemite family for decades, remains unsettled. Time has not healed wounds; on the contrary, it has deepened them. A whole generation of Palestinians has been born and bred in refugee camps. These Palestinians have known nothing in their lives but death, horror and deprivation. It is time for the world's conscience to revolt and act decisively to resolve the Palestinian Question, including the Palestinians\u00b7 right to a Palestinian homeland on Palestinian territory.\nThe United Nations has rightly emphasized the importance of regional co-operation. We, in our region, respect this principle and look up to it. The Arab League was in fact established for that very purpose. Unfortunately, its structure has weakened over the years, not only because of internal strife and differences, but also because of external influences and interference. We consider regional co-operation to be an essential corner-stone of multilateralism. Unfortunately, recent years have witnessed a steady retreat on this front. Nations, in particular the major Powers, have increasingly resorted to bilateral dealings. In our view, this change is due more to the pursuance of short-term self-interest than to any inherent weakness in multilateralism, which must of necessity remain the corner-stone of our interdependent world.\nBilateralism undoubtedly enables the major Powers to promote their own policy objectives at the expense of regional order. The policy of containment those Powers have pursued vis-\u00e0-vis conflicts in our region may have bought time for them, but it has also helped to perpetuate inherently insalubrious situations. Preservation of the status quo can never be a step towards problem-solving. More often than not, it does nothing but exacerbate the problem. In the Middle East, for instance, instead of promoting tangible progress towards peace, the time invested in preserving the status quo has strengthened the potential of irresponsible elements to obstruct rather than promote peace. Thus it can be said that the policy of containment which impedes the achievement of a just peace has nourished the motives which breed terrorism and counter terrorism and has made it possible for those who thrive on chaos, social tensions and political upheavals to pursue their interests very energetically indeed.\nThe status quo, which has overshadowed region since the 1960s, has now become a source of factionalism and a cause of conflict between minorities and ethnic groups, thus paving the way to a vicious divide-and-rule policy that can exist only at the expense of the long-term interests of the region.\nIf, in the first place, I have dwelt on the problem of conflict, it is because the attainment of peace in the region is our principal preoccupation and because we realize, as should all others, that insecurity anywhere is a threat to security everywhere. We do, however, fully realize that economic stability and social harmony are the prerequisites of human welfare. Thus we welcome the results of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, (UNCTAD VII), which, despite bleak forecasts, was a relative success. There is no doubt that the inherent problems of the present world economic order urgently need to be addressed. Foremost among them is the problem of international debt. Like a malignant disease, the debt problem is spreading and taking its toll in developing countries. It is time we recognized at the international level that there is no panacea and that palliatives will not do.\nAt the same time, let no one be under the illusion that this is a problem of the South alone. Clearly, international co-operation, cemented by mutual understanding and a recognition of interdependence, is called for if adequate and effective solutions are to be found. The earnings of more and more developing countries are now being swallowed up by mere payment of interest. There is a cash flow from the South to the North. This is clearly an aberration. It is not just a cause for concern in political or economic terms. It is also an affront to the human family that the poor should go on becoming poorer and the rich richer.\nWhen addressing UNCTAD VII, I proposed the establishment of a mixed commission composed of eminent persons of international repute to re-assess the performance of the international economic system in the context of the colossal challenges we face. Such a body should independently and impartially prepare a comprehensive executive report on the major economic issues which hamper international co-operation and suggest formulae on alternative approaches to global economic and financial problems.\nWe in Jordan have steadfastly followed a policy of moderation in all respects. Likewise, our foreign policy has remained steadfast. Jordan's position on questions which figure on the General Assembly's agenda is well-known. We strongly condemn the policies of apartheid, and we deplore foreign occupation and support peaceful solutions to problems which have long been sources of conflict in Africa, Asia and Latin America, If I have not dwelt on those problems and conflicts, it is to save the Assembly time and not because of lack of zeal or concern on ray part.\nIt has been said that the most important lesson of history is that men do not learn from its lessons. However, the nature of contemporary global problems is such that a basic change in thinking and in attitude is called for on the part of the human family as a whole. Despite spectacular scientific progress and technological advances, humankind has remained incapable of resolving the problems of poverty and development. It is indeed ironic that while famine was recently ravaging one continent there were mountains of grain, beef and butter causing serious storage problems in another. Penury and plenty cannot coexist without causing the human conscience to revolt. The dilemma of our times is that human wisdom has not kept pace with human knowledge, and man, alas, has not learned to be more humane. \nNo statement in this Assembly can be complete without reference to the ultimate beneficiaries or victims of the policies and practices that we discuss here - individual human beings, whatever their creed, colour or political affiliation.\nRepresentatives may recall that in 1981 I had the honour to propose to the Assembly from this rostrum the promotion of a new international humanitarian order. Since then the General Assembly has adopted, without a vote, a series of resolutions in support of that proposal and received two reports on the subject from the Secretary-General. My proposal was inspired by the realization that in purely human terms the quality of life has been steadily degenerating over past decades, despite modern technological achievements. I stated then that whether one looked at the globe in the East-West or North-South context the overall picture continued to be grim. In human terms we are not yet ready for the next century, or even the next decade. Now, in the late 198us, that assessment remains even more valid than before.\nEncouraged by the support my proposal received from Member States, an Independent Commission on International Humanitarian Issues was established outside the United Nations framework to play a catalytic role and facilitate the Assembly's task of promoting the humanitarian order. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Independent Commission, which had a limited mandate in terms of time and programme of work, and which I had the honour to co-chair with His Highness Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, has completed its final report. However, the final version will be published in coming weeks and made available to Member States for their consideration.\nThe Commission took the view from the outset that tangible results can be achieved only if we remain specific and concentrate on a few selected issues of major concern. Consequently, \u0430 series of sectoral reports covering a range of humanitarian questions reflecting our views and containing detailed recommendation has been published. The final report is a synthesis of those reports, and we hope that it will be helpful in the process begun by this Assembly to elaborate and implement the humanitarian order. We believe that a vigorous follow-up is necessary for any report to produce the expected results. To that end, we have foreseen a series of measures in our report. In that context I should like to suggest that a small group of governmental experts be formed within the United Nations to look into practical ways and means to make further progress and ensure that the relevant recommendations are translated into action by Governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental agencies. I have no doubt that many Governments would wish to come forward on a voluntary basis to provide the require expertise.\nIf we are to improve the human condition and make this planet a better and more secure place to live in for our children, we must not wait for things to change; we must change ourselves first. We must adjust our thinking and attitude to the new realities of the contemporary world in order to bring about a change in the global political, economic and social environment.\nAllow me to conclude my statement by quoting a former United Nations Secretary-General, the late Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, who gave his life in defence of the principles and purposes of this Organization: \\\"Working at the edge of the development of human society is to work at the brink of the unknown. Much of what is done will one day prove to have been of little avail. That is no excuse for the failure to act in accordant with our best understanding, in recognition of its limits, but with faith in the ultimate result of the creative evolution in which it is our privilege to co-operate.\\\" \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nAllow me first, Mr. President, to congratulate you on your election to preside over the forty-second session of the General Assembly. You can count on the full support of my delegation in carrying out your important task. Is there some flaw in the design of the human species? Is there any possibility for us to change before it is too late?\nThese questions were raised in a speech by the much beloved Swedish writer of children's books, Astrid Lindgren. The title of her address was; \\\"Violence, never\\\"\nAstrid Lindgren answered the questions herself by pointing to the children. It must begin with them, she said.\nChildren who encounter repression and violence themselves use violence when they grow up. Children who are received with love and respect themselves acquire a loving attitude to the world around them.\nChildren do not make a distinction between black and white, yellow and brown. To children, other children are simply children, regardless of their origin, their language or the colour of their skin.\nMy country, Sweden, used to be an ethnically homogeneous society. During the last few decades it has been transformed into a multinational and multiracial country. Certain suburbs of the nation's capital count more than a hundred nationalities, representing all parts of the world.\nAdults like ourselves should learn from children. We should avoid letting racial prejudices create antagonism between human beings. We must launch an attack against the evils of racism, wherever they may occur.\nRacism is senseless. It jumps to conclusions regarding the merit and characteristics of human beings on the basis of such superficial matters as the colour of their skin or hair; racism is pitiable. It often acts insidiously, fawningly and treacherously.\nRacism is cowardly. It hides behind false phrases and spreads its poison in the dark.\nRacism is egoistic. It denies and counteracts solidarity and co-operation. It pits man against man.\nRacism is cruel. It constantly commits horrid crimes and acts of war and violence.\nDevelopments in South Africa give cause for deep concern. The regime's hardening attitude since the May elections is ill-considered and tragic. The brutal outrages against the opponents of apartheid, trade union leaders and their organizations, and the escalated destabilization policy against neighbouring countries have seriously impaired prospects of a peaceful solution.\nThe determination of the minority regime to uphold the apartheid system must be met by the international community with increased pressure and firmer demands for change. This is necessary if we want to contribute towards breaking the violence and making way for a peaceful dismantling of the apartheid system. This must be brought about now. Otherwise, it will be too late.\nThe abolition of apartheid is the concern of the entire international community. A special responsibility rests with the permanent members of the Security Council.\nIt is disappointing that the Security Council has not yet been able to decide on effective, mandatory sanctions against South Africa. Pending such sanctions, Sweden and the other Nordic countries have extended their previous unilateral measures and introduced a general ban on trade with South Africa and Namibia, We hope that these measures will lead to other countries' following suit, thereby increasing pressure on the South African Government, \nSouth Africa's occupation of Namibia continues. We support the Secretary-General's efforts to break the deadlock. A solution must be based on Security Council resolution 435 (1978) , without irrelevant conditions.\nThe countries of southern Africa have been hit very hard by the South African policy of destabilization. Increased bilateral and international development co-operation efforts are imperative in order to give them support and to reduce their dependence on South Africa. Assistance to southern Africa constitutes a very important part of Sweden's bilateral development aid. In the last five years about $1.5 billion has been allocated to the region.\nMobilizing and co-ordinating such efforts should be an important task of the United Nations. Assistance to the victims of apartheid policy and humanitarian aid to the liberation movements should also be increased.\nIncreased support for the front-line States would also create a more favourable start for the entire region - including South Africa - the day apartheid is abolished.\nThe war between Iran and Iraq has caused immense human suffering and enormous material losses.\nRecent developments in the Gulf imply great risks of escalation and widening of the conflict. All the parties concerned must, in this explosive situation, exercise the utmost restraint. The Swedish Government welcomed the adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). The resolution provides a good basis for a solution to the conflict and must be complied with. It is also a matter of the authority of the Security Council. The Secretary-General has my Government's whole-hearted support in his renewed efforts.\nIn the Middle East, Israel's long occupation of Arab territories constitutes a dangerous threat to both Arabs and Israelis. Agreement on an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations would bring to the region hope of peace and of an end to the occupation. Sweden supports the efforts to bring about such a conference.\nThe foundations for a settlement are laid down in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Israel must leave the territories that were occupied in 1967. The Arab parties must recognize Israel's right to exist within secure borders. Furthermore, the Palestinian people must be allowed to exercise their right to self-determination and the right to establish a State of their own, It is important that the Palestinians be represented in negotiations by those in whom they have confidence. In our view the Palestine Liberation Organization enjoys such confidence.\nIn violation of international law, the Soviet Union continues its war in Afghanistan, now in its eighth year. The Soviet invasion forces must be withdrawn. The Afghan people themselves must be allowed to decide their own form of government and their future. That is imperative for success in the efforts to settle the conflict and to enable the millions of Afghan refugees to return to their homes. The efforts of the Secretary-General to that end has the Swedish Government's strong support.\nTo resolve the conflict in Kampuchea, it is equally crucial that the Vietnamese troops be withdrawn and that the Kampuchean people be allowed to decide their own future. The Swedish Government has noted with interest the recent contacts concerning the country's future. We hope that this development signifies the beginning of a real dialogue.\nWe welcome the agreement that has been concluded between the Governments of Sri Lanka and India on a return to peaceful relations between the ethnic communities in Sri Lanka. There are now better prospects that this distressing conflict can be resolved in a peaceful way. It is our hope that the increased activity shown by the two Korean States in their endeavours to resume their dialogue will be successful.\nThe agreement reached in August between the five Central American countries is an important step towards peace and co-operation in a region that has long been troubled by conflicts. These have their roots in social and economic injustices. They have been aggravated by foreign intervention, such as United States support - in violation of international law - for those who are waging war against Nicaragua's lawful Government. We welcome the fact that the Government of Nicaragua, through recent positive measures, is clearly demonstrating its will to implement the peace plan, in spite of the aggression directed against that country. The agreement expresses the aspirations of the Central American countries to shape their own future in accordance with their own wishes. Implementation requires the support of the entire international community. Everyone, in and outside the region, must be guided by the fundamental principles of the agreement: respect for international law and democracy. One condition for success is that assistance to the irregular forces cease. The Contadora countries and their Support Group, as well as the Organization of American States and the United Nations, have an important role to play in the continued peace efforts. As the President of Costa Rica, Mr. Arias, put it recently in Washington, \\\"We have to give peace a chance\\\".\nThrough its peace-keeping operations, the United Nations has in several cases been able to assist the parties to regional conflicts in cooling off the situation, thereby facilitating the search for a peaceful solution. Sweden's long-standing, active support for these operations is illustrated by our decision last year to pull a logistic unit at the disposal of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) .\nOur positive attitude towards participation in peace-keeping operations remains. That applies also to the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). We regret that, above all, the unreasonable method of financing has forced us to withdraw out battalion from Cyprus. It is increasingly intolerable for such a \u013c United Nations operation to be financed that extensively by the troop-contributing countries. Sweden will continue to participate with police and headquarters personnel in the United Nations peace-keeping operation in Cyprus in the future also. The efforts of the Secretary-General to bring the parties together have out undiminished support.\t \nViolence and oppression must be combated. That is the only way to create the necessary conditions for a lasting peace for future generations.\nOne of the main purposes of the United Nations is to protect and promote human rights. With the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as its foundation, an impressive structure of norms has emerged. International conventions on the protection of human rights have been adopted. More recently a convention against torture entered into force. It is important that States accede to these conventions. All States must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nThere is every reason to stress the significance of the struggle against international terrorism, with its destructive violence. Co-operation within the United Nations and other international forums is of immense importance. It is our hope that the General Assembly during this session will reach agreement on increased co-operation in this field.\nThe narcotic-drugs problem has acquired world-wide proportions. At the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking held in Vienna last summer the participating States pledged to undertake forceful international measures to counteract drug abuse. In order to fulfil that undertaking, it is essential that the United Nations obtain the necessary resources to play a central role.\nThe importance of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) was highlighted at its meeting this summer. The Final Document shows an awareness of the interdependence of countries and the close relationship between different growth-promoting measures. The outcome of the conference was positive. It is now the responsibility of all Governments to fulfil the intentions of the Final Document in a constructive spirit. Two threats of annihilation hover over mankind: nuclear war and global degradation of the environment. The first can be unleashed at any moment} the second would take longer. If we do not have the ability to remove these threats, human civilization is in danger.\nTwo years ago our hopes of progress in the disarmament field were strengthened. At that time the leaders of the two super-Powers made their historic declaration; nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\nThe Swedish Government welcomes the agreement in principle between the United States and the Soviet Union on the elimination of intermediate-range nuclear weapons. But it would be a serious set-back if these disarmament measures were to result in an arms build-up in other fields. It is essential that progress be achieved as soon as possible also in the current negotiations on strategic nuclear weapons and space weapons.\nA comprehensive nuclear-weapons-test ban is becoming increasingly important. A test-ban agreement would render more difficult the development of new and ever-more-advance d types of nuclear weapons. It would also reduce the risk of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Such an agreement would be a definite sign of the will of the nuclear-weapon States to break the vicious circle of the arms race.\n\nIn the shadow of the nuclear-weapon threat, there are other weapons of mass destruction also. Some are more than a threat. At this very moment people are suffering from the horrible effects of chemical weapons. \nWe now have before us an opportunity to save future generations from those weapons, with continued progress at the negotiating table of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, a convention banning chemical weapons could become a reality in the near future.\nNor must we tire in our endeavours to reduce conventional arms at both the global and the regional level. Within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe there seem to be good prospects for reaching agreement on further developing the confidence- and security-building measures agreed upon at the Stockholm Conference last year. There also seem to be good prospects for initiating negotiations on conventional disarmament in Europe within that framework.\nThe Swedish Government actively supports the idea of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Nordic area and a corridor free of battlefield nuclear weapons in Central Europe,\nIncreased attention should be paid also to the naval arms race. It is high time that negotiations were initiated on confidence-building measures and disarmament in this field too. An appropriate first step could be a multilateral agreement on the prevention of incidents at sea to supplement existing bilateral agreements.\nThe world must choose development instead of the arms race. The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development was a success for multilateral diplomacy. It is our hope that those who did not take part in the Conference will participate in the continued process. We are responsible for the world we leave to future generations. The World Commission on Environment and Development, under the chairmanship o\u00a3 the Prime Minister of Norway, Gro Harlem Brundtland, has shown convincingly how important it is to bring about sustainable development. If that development concept is applied, we can save our environment and safeguard our natural resources. If we do not manage to do this, economic and social progress will be impossible, and in the long run the survival of mankind will be jeopardized.\nThe current agenda of the General Assembly contains items concerning draft resolutions from the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme on the report of the World Commission and on the action-oriented environmental perspective. We sincerely hope these will be adopted this autumn. If they are, a process could be initiated in which the decision-making bodies of the United Nations could revise policies, programmes, budgets and activities with the aim of promoting sustainable development. Similarly, all Governments should review their own national policies. That process has already been initiated in Sweden. Far-sighted management of natural resources and preservation of the environment will, furthermore, be established as one of the five objectives for Swedish International development co-operation.\nAs proposed by the Brundtland Commission, a second global conference on the human environment should be considered. Its aim could be to review developments since the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to evaluate and assess the hazards posed by environmental problems and to agree on a programme of action to ensure sustainable development.\nIf there is wide support for that proposal, a new conference could take place in 1992, that is to say 20 years after the first Conference. Sweden is prepared again to act as host, if that is the general wish. The United Nations are going through a critical period of self-examination and change. To overcome the difficulties, commitment and patient work are required of all Member States. A good foundation for reform work was laid last year by the General Assembly, on the basis of the report of the Group of 18. The aim of the reform process cannot be budget cuts as such} the overall aim must be to attain a world Organization that is well equipped to perform its functions.\nThe purpose of the altered budget procedure we have agreed on is to make it possible for the programme budget to be adopted with the greatest possible support from Member States. In that way  the preconditions can be created to secure the necessary support for the activities of the United Nations.\nIf the reform process is to be successfully completed, it is of utmost Importance that all Member States should fulfil their financial obligations under the United Nations Charter. That applies not least to the Organization's largest contributor. Otherwise, the consequences could be devastating.\nThere is reason to recall the ideas on a more even scale of assessments put forward by Sweden's late Prime Minister, Olof Palme, at the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. That would be one way of making the world Organization less vulnerable. As things stand now, the scale of assessments agreed on has ceased to function. If this unsatisfactory state of affairs continues, we shall inevitably have to consider a revision of the scale of assessments.\nThe future agenda of the United Nations will have an orientation that is partly different from the one it has today. We are increasingly faced with issues and problems of global importance. Such challenges cannot possibly be met through national or regional measures only. For the Swedish Government, the conclusion is obvious: it is through more efficient and purposeful co-operation within the framework of the United Nations and the United Nations system that we can effectively tackle these types of issues. This applies to the threat posed by nuclear weapons, environmental degradation, and North-South injustices. It applies to serious diseases such as AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), to the increasing drug abuse, and to refugee problems.\nThe United Nations system must be capable of adapting to these realities, but it is not changes in the purposes and principles of the United Nations set forth in its Charter that are required. The rules of international law embodied in the Charter must be unconditionally upheld. What is needed is to review and reconsider the structure and work methods of the United Nations system. The world Organization must be capable of effectively meeting the requirements of the 199Us and beyond. This applies not least to the economic and social sector.\nBut it is not just a question of being prepared for tomorrow. We must also make better use of the machinery the United Nations offers today.\nCo-operation within the United Nations symbolizes hope for a life without fear, a life in peace and dignity for all people. It is our compelling duty to keep that hope alive. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, you represent a country with which mine entertains the best of relations, and your election to the presidency of this session is a tribute to the contribution of the German Democratic Republic to the promotion of peace, social progress and international co-operation. It is also a recognition of your qualities as a statesman with which ray Government associates itself with particular pleasure since in your many activities in the United Nations you have demonstrated special understanding for the problems of the third world, particularly those that affect Africa.\nTo your predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, I offer, on behalf of my delegation, sincere gratitude for his effective and responsible manner in which he fulfilled the mandate that has been entrusted to him.\nI cannot let this opportunity pass without congratulating the Secretary-General of the Organization on his timely and courageous initiatives at the administrative, political and economic level, in particular those for the benefit of Africa, thus meeting the challenges to multilateralism. He has our support and we wish him every success in his endeavours towards peace, his mediation efforts and the use of his good offices.\nThe last time we were able to welcome the adoption of a real disarmament measure was on 16 December 1971, on the occasion of the adoption of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction. Since then, despite acceptance of the need for general and complete disarmament, and m particular nuclear disarmament, negotiations and discussions have centred on the concepts of limitation, reduction, control and verification. The objective demanded by the non-aligned countries of a world without nuclear weapons, has thus become increasingly illusory,' perhaps to the satisfaction of those whose strategies are still based on the precarious balance of deterrence, parity or, worse, superiority. The escalation of the arms race, the emergence of technologies at the service of theories and concepts that justify the deployment, possession and use of nuclear weapons, the promotion of a nuclear strategy based in space and the continuation of testing will continue seriously to affect international security, even if they temporarily enhance the sense of security of some states. Nevertheless, the problem is not insoluble. \nThe non-aligned countries have on several occasions proposed collateral deterrent measures such as the conclusion of an international treaty on the prohibition of the use, or threat of the use, of nuclear weapons and the creation of nuclear-free zones or zones of peace, while the two super-Powers and the two politico-military blocs have been engaging in countless initiatives in Geneva, in Vienna and elsewhere; without giving an exhaustive list, I shall mention the treaties on strategic arms limitation, the limitation of nuclear weapons and nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes and the most recent proposals on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe, the freezing and reduction of military expenditures, and conventional as well as nuclear disarmament in central Europe.\nWe thus have a consensus which must be structured and harmonized if it is to be democratic and effective. To this end, we have available to us the Conference on Disarmament and the Disarmament Commission as well as the relevant departments of the Secretariat. We shall soon hold our third special session devoted to disarmament, the agenda for which includes the evaluation of new facts and trends, and the consideration of the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament. These few indications convince us that the United Nations must be properly informed of the state of affairs and progress of negotiations on disarmament.\nIn any event we should be churlish were we not to hail, as is appropriate, the announcement made on 18 September last by the Soviet Union and the United States relating to their acceptance of the principle and the broad lines of a treaty on the elimination of medium- and short-range nuclear missiles. From 1972, the date of the first strategic arms limitation talks, to 1987, has been a long and difficult road. Imagination, a sense of compromise and a desire for dialogue were needed to reach this result, and we shall not attempt analysis, for in truth what matters is the spirit that allowed the adoption of this very promising decision. We support the joint declaration of the six nations which, on 22 May 1987, in anticipation of the event, stated, inter alia, that it had been proved that when the political will existed it was possible to arrive at major agreements on nuclear disarmament measures.\nUnfortunately, such political will failed to materialize last month, when we completed our discussions on the relationship between disarmament and development. There were many points of agreement, but the doctrinaire perception of reality caught up with us at the crossroads. Indeed, if the world needs disarmament as much as it needs development, if they are the conditions for a system of international global and collective security, and if we admit the negative repercussions of the level and scope of military expenditures on the economic world situation, where is the harm in proposing the creation of a fund for economic and social development, financed through resources released as a result of disarmament measures or the limitation of armaments?\nSome might tell us that the time is not ripe, although the question has been under discussion, on and off, for more than a quarter of a century. We may also be told that security has priority over all other considerations. If so, we shall respond that our security requires development and that to be convinced of this, it suffices it to look at the kind of development that has been bequeathed to us.\nThough they use the usual language, there is agreement among international authorities and international experts - be they from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank or the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) - that, apart from a few pockets of relative prosperity, the economy of the third world is on the verge of bankruptcy. The relevant statistics and figures are so grim that they are difficult to believe. \nFirst, for 70 per cent of low-income countries, basic commodities represent 50 per cent of total export earnings.\nSecondly, for half of such countries, the same commodities bring in 9\u00dc to 10 0 per cent of export earnings, out of which 8 0 per cent is devoted to the import of foodstuffs and fuels.\nThirdly, the average deficit in the commodities sector in the period 1980-1984, for all developing countries, has been assessed at $14.9 billion per year, half of which is the burden of low-income countries.\nFourthly, those countries have only received approximately 30 per cent of compensatory financial assistance, be it Stabex or Coiapex of the European Economic Community (EEC) or the mechanism of compensatory financing of the International Monetary Fund.\nFifthly, in 1986, the prices of industrial goods rose by 17 per cent. The export earnings of commodities dropped by an average of 26 per cent and the losses suffered by developing countries because of deterioration of terms of trade rose to $100 billion.\nSixthly, in 1986 an average of 37 per cent of export earnings were devoted to the repayment of debt, which is 50 per cent above the 25 per cent limit considered tolerable.\nFinally, loans from commercial banks have declined by two thirds since 198Q. Commercial credits only represent one sixth of the 1981 level. The level of direct foreign investments has plummeted by approximately 50 per cent, and official development assistance has been reduced to half the 1982 level.\nI need not continue, bet us simply say that we have reached the breaking-point, while international institutions are beginning to run out of steam and private banks, on which we have relied for the recovery of investments and free enterprise, are becoming more than reluctant in granting us new loans. Thus we are now bearing the overwhelming social burden of policies referred to as curative. The problems of commodities, trade and development, and indebtedness are intimately related. The reaction of some - inherited from the nineteenth century - has been to say that Oliver Twist is still asking for more. But if we wish to give real meaning to interdependence and international economic security at the dawning of the twenty-first century, let us really meet the challenge inherent in the relationship between disarmament and development. Let us think in positive terms about a common fund for commodities, and let us accept the need to establish an additional mechanism for compensatory financing while improving existing mechanisms. Let us reverse the negative trends of the transfer o\u00b1 resources from developing countries and, above all, let us admit that it is important to embark upon a genuine dialogue on the problem of indebtedness. \nThe proposal to create a stabilization fund for commodities, a monetary fund and a development fund among third world countries, which was confirmed by the President of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar during the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of our Organization, seems, in view of these considerations, to be most timely.\nIt is true that in adopting resolution 41/202 and by the consensus that we supported during UNCTAD VII we have placed this dialogue in a general framework. But the dialogue must become political in nature, for above and beyond technical, financial and banking considerations it is the future and security of all our peoples for many decades to come which is at stake. That dialogue must also be open and not take place behind the screen of preconceived or rigid ideas. In other words, on the basis of the idea of shared responsibility, we must ensure that this dialogue is at no time overtaken by events. It is in that spirit that I should like briefly to recall the position of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar on the question of the debt.\nOur shared responsibility with regard to the rising tide of debt imposes an obligation to undertake direct concerted action between debtors, grouped together in a club of debtors, so to speak, on the one hand and their creditors on the other. If the restructuring of the debt is to be viable it requires an amendment of the rules of the Paris Club and the London Club, a one-year moratorium on interest modelled on the practices of the International Development Association and the fixing of the percentage of the export earnings to be devoted to debt servicing on the basis of the figures for several years.\nIn this connection we have proposed the following alternatives; either to request or decide upon the freezing of debt repayment for the next 10 years or to limit the payment to a maximum of 10 per cent of the value of the export earnings of each country. The basic objective is to postpone payment of most of the debts to the year 2000.\nThe strategy must contain elements that allow us to bring about the recovery and strengthening of our national economies. That objective would involve reconsideration of the concept of adjustment programmes, which must be based on growth and must not exist simply for the repayment of the debt. In this connection it would be appropriate to have a more equitable distribution of the burden of adjustment and to proceed to an easing of the rules of conditionality required by international monetary and financial institutions and acceleration of the procedures for subscription to structural adjustment loans. Such measures must be coupled with structural reform of the international financial system.\nWe are pleased that elements of our position have already been reflected in some reference documents. It is not our intention to make these elements pre-conditions, for in the final analysis we must play the game of solidarity with both the developing and the developed countries if we want to avoid the blocking of the dialogue, to the detriment of the interests of all.\nI have just dealt, in a somewhat linear fashion, with some of the problems inherent in disarmament, development and debt, in the firm belief that we must find solutions to these problems that will contribute to the strengthening of international security. Nevertheless, our efforts would be in vain if we did not use our imagination and work together to ease or eliminate the regional tensions and conflicts that continue to beset the third world, including Africa, the Neat East and Middle East, central Africa and South-East Asia.\nIndeed, in South Africa the hopes born of the mass rebellion which occurred last year have been swept away by the maintenance of the state of emergency over the entire territory. Despite unanimous condemnation by the international community, the Pretoria regime continues to persist in its defiance by tightening the apartheid system. Under the pretext of better mastering apartheid by controlling it, it continues to ignore the needs of the black population. That same regime lends support to the illegal occupation of Namibia and increases its murderous acts of aggression against front-line States.\nHow much longer will we continue to accept this savage policy of domination, this hegemonism? How much longer will we continue to accept this policy which subordinates a man's dignity to the colour of his skin? Are we to be satisfied with mere talk of condemnation in the face of the humiliation of man, the image of God on earth?\nIt is those considerations that lead the delegation of Madagascar to congratulate and strongly support the Nordic countries, which have decided to impose economic sanctions against South  Africa, and to encourage all those that still hesitate to follow suit. We do not have sufficient power to act in these matters, much less the necessary resources to assist the front-line States, but we have the voice of reason and wisdom and we shall continue to raise it for as long as the South African regime exists.\nIn Palestine, what crime has been committed by the Palestinian people that it should be hunted as one hunts a deer in the forest? Is it the crime of claiming its legitimate rights or of recovering its lands, its homeland? what is the reason for the persistent rejection of peace, security and stability in the Middle East? Why is it that all the parties to the conflict in the Middle East persist in maintaining the explosive situation in the region, with all the dangers inherent in it? Can one sacrifice the life of an entire people to protect the conflicting interests of all sides? Can one condemn a people to wander, like a ghost, for its entire life? \nWe shall not cease to appeal to the international community to recognize the right of that people to self-determination and to a homeland freely chosen within the context of a peaceful overall settlement of the Middle East crisis. Such a settlement could be found through the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East, under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties directly concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the permanent members of the Security Council.\nWe cannot remain silent in the face of the equally crucial problem of the Lebanese people. The soil of Lebanon continues to be occupied by foreign forces. It seems that 12 years of conflict have only sharpened the will of the enemies of Lebanon to see the country torn apart, divided and subjected to contradictory spheres of influence. Therefore, with the Lebanese people wounded, torn apart and the victim of the conflicts in the Middle East, but refusing to die and determined to defend its life and its reasons for living, we demand the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanese soil in accordance with United Nations resolutions, so that the Lebanese people may regain its full authority over all its national territory. \nWith regard to Afghanistan, can we simply sit on our hands in the face of the efforts for national reconciliation? The Afghan people have suffered for many years. Some have confined themselves to purely and simply condemning the presence of foreign troops in that country. We will say mote; some are encouraging and continuing to support those who are against the regime. But why? Is it in order for one ideology to win out over another? Can we treat so lightly the identity and personality of a people? That is why, after considerable thought, we support the policy of national reconciliation in Afghanistan and condemn any attempt at blocking it.\nThe same goes for the reunification of Korea, which we most vigorously support politically and diplomatically. There may be a confrontation of ideologies, but people can engage in dialogue and reach understanding.\nAs for Western Sahara, we repeat our support for resolution 104 (XIX) of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and take note of the Secretary-General's decision to send a fact-finding mission to the Sahara. However, that mission might be a futile exercise in the absence of a prior political commitment for the establishment of an interim United Nations administration in the Territory.\nWith regard to the Chad-Libya conflict, we respectfully abide by the decision of our Heads of State or (Government at the last summit of the OAU, namely, confirmation of the Ad Hoc Committee's mandate to organise negotiations between the two belligerent parties to find a just and lasting solution to the problem, and the search for a negotiated political settlement to their border dispute.\nIn Central America we see a glimmer of hope, thanks to the commendable efforts of the countries of the region to ease tension and re-establish stability in that part of the world. Thus we unreservedly support the Guatemala Agreement of 7 August 1987. \nWith reference to the Iran-Iraq war, we cannot fail once again to deplore the fact that Security Council resolution 598 (1987), demanding a cease-fire, has not been implemented. Of course, one might fear that effective implementation of a cease-fire could be undermined by those who supply weapons, as that might run counter to what they regard to be their vital interests. Also, one wonders whether negotiations between those two fraternal countries - now enemies - could ever take place while they are obstinately clinging to their respective positions.\nThis war makes no sense and has lasted far too long. It represents an ongoing threat to countries of the region in particular, and in light of the present state of affairs could become internationalised. Furthermore, the concentration of naval forces in the region is a real danger for the whole world, and it is truly regrettable that security for international shipping has been affected and become practically non-existent as a result of this conflict.\nMadagascar, through its President, has consistently called for the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a demilitarised and denuclearised zone of peace. But can we today still hope for such a development? Hence we wish to address an appeal to all parties in the Iran-Iraq war to remain calm and avoid inflaming further this most dangerous and critical situation in the Gulf. In particular, we appeal to Iran and Iraq to accept implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) on a cease-fire.\nIt has never been Madagascar' s posture to remain on the sidelines of international affairs; thus we advocate an immediate cease-fire simultaneously with a halt on all arms deliveries to the belligerents, and the establishment of a fact-finding commission to determine responsibility for the start of the war. Finally, we support the establishment of an international force to ensure the security, safety and freedom of navigation in the Gulf.  We cannot conclude this analysis of regional conflicts without emphasizing in the Assembly that these regional conflicts might have been solved but for the persistent policy of interference in the internal affairs of third-world countries.\nWe have come here to seek peace, justice, social progress and co-operation - ideals and objectives which we shall attain by displaying the utmost responsibility and the needed generosity. A reading of the Charter always leads us to conclude that it is in keeping with the common good. Even though peace remains, as it should, our primary concern, in these 40 years priorities and realities have often changed.\nOur Organization's role is also to allow for the necessary adjustments with due regard to our purposes and principles. And when initiatives sometimes reflect ideals set forth in the Charter it is not intended to counter or bypass them, but simply to clarify their scope by bearing in mind the evolution of international relations on the ideological, political, economic and social levels.\nThus, our support for the establishment of a comprehensive system of international peace and security stems from two considerations; to give the United Nations another chance to play its legitimate role, after the failure of our commitment to a system of collective security; and to recognize that the time has come to renew and ennoble our debate on the basis of tolerance, mutual respect, dialogue and interdependence.\nIt has never been a crime to proclaim one's dedication to peace and to advocate a security system for all individuals, peoples and nations. At the end of our quest and efforts, may peace, justice, social progress and co-operation reign \u012f and no longer be empty words. May our Organization be the master builder. May the ; peoples of the whole world be the beneficiaries. \n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI have the honour to convey to all representatives the warm greetings and best wishes of my august sovereign. His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, for the success of the forty-second session of the General Assembly.\nI should like to extend my sincere felicitations to you/ Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly. We are indeed fortunate to have a statesman of your great experience and ability to guide our deliberations. I should also like to congratulate Ambassador Joseph Reed on his appointment as the Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs. Mr. Huraayun Rasheed Choudhury, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, deserves our highest praise for the truly outstanding manner in which he conducted the proceedings of our last session and for the valuable contribution he made to the work of the Assembly. A tribute is also due to our Secretary-General for the dedication with which he is carrying out his onerous responsibilities.\nIn his annual report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General made the following comment on the current international situation:\n\\\"Countries of disparate political orientations and economic systems have begun to deal with problems of an interdependent world with a new pragmatism in awareness of the dangers of immobility. ... It is as if the sails of the small boat in which all the people of the earth are gathered had caught again, in the midst of a perilous sea, a light but favourable wind.\\\" (A/42/1, p. 2) The favourable wind of which the Secretary-General spoke has in no case been more dramatically demonstrated this year than in the agreement, in principle/ between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America to dismantle the intermediate nuclear forces. The significance of that agreement does not lie in the number or class of weapons it will eliminate. Its true significance has been explained by Foreign Minister Shevardnadze in the following eloquent words;\n\\\"For the first time in history the idea of nuclear disarmament is close to the beginning of its fulfilment. It is not a new idea. What is new is that this turns out to be possible. Only yesterday all we could see was a blank wall; today we can see far ahead.\nTwo thousand warheads are but a small part of nuclear arsenals, but that is a big enough part for its disappearance to give the world a new vision. The agreement on these weapons is only the lesser part of what has happened. Something much more important has taken place: the Soviet Union and the United States have finally spoken together the first word in a nuclear-free vocabulary. When that word becomes deed, the world will also gain new knowledge. It will become convinced that nuclear weapons and security are not synonymous and that security becomes stronger when those weapons disappear.\\\" (A/42/PV.9, p. 2)\nThe delegation of Bhutan fully subscribes to those lofty sentiments, which give renewed hope to humanity. We are convinced that the two super-Powers, imbued with purpose and vision, have embarked on an undertaking of heroic proportions, an undertaking which seeks to ensure the very survival of the human race.\nWe wish Secretary of State Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze every success in their talks in Moscow later this month and we hope that the summit meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev later in the fall will become a real turning point in the history of east-west relations and will herald the beginning of the process of eliminating all strategic nuclear weapons as well as other disarmament measures. The world will then become an infinitely safer place in which to live and the two leaders, through their contribution to the disarmament process, would have carved out for themselves honoured niches in the history of mankind.\nIt is to be hoped that the wisdom that has dawned on the super-Powers will also cast its benign rays on the other nuclear Powers of the world and that they will exercise self-restraint and control in the testing and development of new nuclear weapons and in accretion to their existing stockpiles. It is also hoped that other countries that have developed the capability of producing nuclear weapons, particularly developing countries, will desist from taking the path of economic and strategic disaster. Diversion of massive amounts of scarce resources to unproductive ends at the cost of the economic well-being of nations, cannot be justified in any circumstances. The greatest fear under which all the peoples of the world live today is the threat of a nuclear holocaust. We must all endeavour to rid ourselves of this spectre.\nThe majority of States on this planet ate small, while their locations and circumstances may vary greatly, they are by their very nature weak and vulnerable. Internally, their transition to modernity is creating a whole range of disturbing imbalances. Externally, they face a sombre economic, political and strategic environment compounded by erosion in the spirit of multilateralism. Because of their limited resources, they are severely handicapped in pursuing their development goals. Yet, in spite of those handicaps, it is quite heartening to note that an increasing number of small States are playing significant roles in international affairs. All of us in the third world are committed to the creation of a new and just world order in which all States, large and small, can enhance their well-being and security and make a contribution to international peace and progress.\nWe subscribe to the view that internal cohesion, economic self-reliance, a prudent and well-thought-out foreign policy based on geo-political considerations, and a distinctive national identity based on a nation's culture and traditional values, are important elements in ensuring the well-being and security of a small State. The assumption that the main threat to a nation's security comes from other countries has not only led to a disastrous world-wide arms race, but has diverted attention from the real causes of a State's instability and insecurity; namely, internal social, cultural, economic and political factors. In fact, the arms race by ruining the economies of developing and developed countries alike, has led to a deterioration of the international politico-strategic environment. While Bhutan attaches the highest priority to nuclear disarmament, we should like to appeal for a halt in the conventional weapons race which consumes the bulk of global military expenditure and which fuels all regional conflicts.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI should like first to congratulate Ambassador Florin on his election as President of the General Assembly. I am confident that with his experience he will guide the Assembly's work to a successful conclusion. The strengthening of the United Nations is the theme of this statement.\nWe ate meeting in the General Assembly at a time when it is more evident than ever before that the problems facing the world community can be solved only through joint international action. This is also a time of the year when we usually take stock of the state of our Organization. We do this in the knowledge that the many complimentary words uttered during the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations two years ago have been followed by an extremely difficult period for our Organization.\nThis year we may have better opportunities than we have had for quite some time to move forward. As the Secretary-Gen et al has stated so aptly in his report, there is \\\"in the midst of a perilous sea, a light but favourable wind.\\\" (P/42/1, p. 2) That wind of change became significantly stronger last week, after the historic breakthrough in the negotiations on nuclear weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union. I should like to join others in welcoming the fact that the two nations have agreed in principle to conclude a treaty on all land-based, medium-range nuclear missiles. Rather than freezing nuclear arms at existing levels, as in previous accords, the new emerging agreement will break new ground by eliminating entire categories of United States and Soviet nuclear missiles.\nIt is our sincere hope that the impending agreement will open the way towards further progress in other critical areas of arms control and disarmament. All possible avenues should now be explored to reach agreements on strategic nuclear forces, on chemical weapons and on a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, as well as on reductions in conventional forces. These new developments will contribute to an Improved International climate and provide the basis for the solution of the many problems on the United Nations agenda.\nWhat are the problems facing us today as Members of the United Nations? To answer that question we need look no further than to two documents now before the General Assembly: the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization and the report by the World Commission on Environment and Development, \\\"Our Common Future\\\".\nThe Secretary-General's report gives us a lucid overview of the state of the world today. Including the many areas where armed conflicts are raging or threatening. The most burning of those issues Is the Iran-Iraq war and the spread of that conflict to the Gulf area. That war has been going on for more than seven years. It has brought untold suffering to the populations of the two countries. It threatens International shipping and the supply of oil to other nations. As Members of the United Nations, we need to make every effort to stop it, both in the interest of the two nations concerned and to maintain international peace and security. \nThe report by the World Commission is a global agenda for change focusing on three main areas; first, it stresses the preservation of the environment, which is of vital importance not only to our own generation but also, even more, also to future ones; secondly, it highlights the inter linkage between economic growth, development and the environment} and, thirdly, it demonstrates the interdependence between nations and thus the need for strengthened multilateralism in a field where all countries - East, West, North and South - have a common interest. The report thus gives us a long-term strategy for sustainable development. It makes it very clear that there is no rational alternative to strengthened international co-operation in the interrelated issues of environment and development.\nBoth the Secretary-General's report and the report of the World Commission point to the extremely difficult situation still facing many developing countries. The impending ecological crisis, the problems caused by drought, new epidemics and other disasters, the political and social unrest in many countries, the heavy load of the debt burden - all are problems which require both pragmatism and vision. I very much agree with the Secretary-General that we need both, that many of these problems cannot be dealt with in isolation, and that a greater understanding now seems to be emerging of the interrelationship between economic and social - and, I should like to add, ecological - problems.\nThe States Members of the United Nations have shown repeatedly that a genuine political will to act together to solve international problems can often be found, especially in times of crisis. The individual wills of nations may not always be shared. Nevertheless, we need to ask ourselves: when there is a will, do we have the tools? How can we, the States Members of the United Nations, continue our efforts to strengthen the United Nations as the most important instrument for handling the many pressing problems facing the world community today? At the outset of the forty-first session last year, the United Nations was confronted with what is sometimes described as the worst crisis in its history. The consensus reached last year on steps to improve the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations proved, however, that the Member States could rise above their differences when the very viability of the Organization was at stake. I agree with the Secretary-General that the consensus reached last year \\\"could signify a historic turning point\\\". \nWe now need to discuss how we can continue the reform process to increase the efficiency of the United Nations. Organizational reforms cannot be the subject of one\u2014time decisions. A reform process must be continuous and orderly, involving both member Governments and the responsible leadership of each individual organization. The member Governments have a direct interest in the sound financial management of the Organization. At the same time we, the member Governments must, out of obligation and self-interest, respect the rights and duties of the Secretary-General as laid down in the Charter.\nAt this point I should like to pay our compliments to the Secretary-General for his very active and constructive follow-up on the decisions taken last year. There are many interesting observations and proposals in his reports to which we will give further careful study. On this occasion I shall concentrate on four aspects.\nFirst, concerning the strengthening of the fact-finding capabilities of the Secretary-General and the Secretariat, we welcome the establishment of a separate Office for Research and the Collection of Information. The strengthening of the early-warning capability of the Organization will help to identify potentially dangerous situations before conflicts break out. This could be an important step to make the United Nations better prepared to fulfil its tasks in the maintenance of international peace and security. We hope that this will lay the foundation for an even more active role on the part of the Secretary-General and the Organization in preventing and settling disputes.\nSecondly, concerning the financial situation of the Organization, my Government agrees with the Secretary-General that prolongation of a situation of financial crisis will have an adverse impact on programme implementation, on orderly management and on the morale of the Secretariat staff. The financial soundness of the Organization should therefore be restored as soon as possible. That can come about only if all Member States accept the collective responsibilities inherent in the Charter of the United Nations. In this context we should perhaps examine ways and means which would make the Organization less financially dependent on any one nation or group of nations.\nThirdly, concerning the related subject of the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations, those operations have long been considered to be potentially the most important and innovative contribution that the United Nations can make to maintaining world peace. The Secretary-General's report mentions several areas where such operations could make extremely important contributions - in Namibia, in Central America and in the Gulf. We also have the suggestion that peace-keeping mechanisms be used for preventive purposes. But we also know the financial problems facing present United Nations peace-keeping operations. It is becoming Increasingly difficult to find countries that are willing to provide contingents for a peace-keeping force and acceptable to the parties. I believe that new and serious thought should be given to measures which could improve the present highly unsatisfactory situation. It should not be necessary to have new crises, conflicts or wars before this problem is given serious consideration by the members of the Security Council.\nFourthly, concerning follow-up on the reform process in the economic and social fields, my Government will continue to take an active part in the special commission established by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) to study the intergovernmental structures and functions of the United Nations system in the economic and social fields. Like many other countries we welcome the very constructive proposal put forward by the Group of 77 at the meeting of the study group earlier this month for the strengthening of ECOSOC. We also find an interesting proposal in the Secretary-General's report on making EOOSOC a council of ministers for economic and social affairs in the world, with much more integrated responsibilities than it has today. In this connection let me even give support to the proposals to strengthen forward-looking and policy-planning functions within the Secretariat to make possible a more system-wide approach to these issues.\nDuring the last year we have made high demands of the Secretary-General and the Secretariat to implement the strict austerity measures inherent in the decisions taken last year. We, the member Governments of the United Nations, now need to consider how we may get our own act together to follow up our consensus of last year in order to give new political impetus to our Organization.\nOne such step would be to increase the level of political participation in the meetings of the central bodies of the United Nations. Two years ago we saw the important meeting of more than 60 Heads of State or Government in New York on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Organization. We have also seen that the Security Council more and more often meets at the ministerial level when important issues are debated, the latest such occasion being during the adoption of resolution 598 (1987) on the Iran-Iraq war. We believe that this practice should be encouraged, regularized and perhaps institutionalised. In this context I also welcome the participation of Heads of State and Government at the General Assembly, I have already expressed our support for the Secretary-General's proposal to increase the level of participation in ECOSOC to that of ministers.\nPerhaps we could also examine more informal ways through which representatives of Member countries could meet at political levels to discuss how we could strengthen the United Nations. One way in which we could strengthen the position and the influence of the United Nations would be to make more use of the machinery provided to us by the Organization to tackle the political problems facing us.\nMy Government will make clear its position on individual issues when the relevant agenda items are discussed later in the session. In this statement I shall concentrate on only a few issues.\nThe finding of a solution to the conflict between Iran and Iraq and the prevention of a further escalation of the conflict should continue to be given the highest priority by the United Nations. The Norwegian Government supports Security Council resolution 598 (1987), and we strongly appeal to the parties to respect the terms of the mandatory resolution  which was adopted unanimously by the Council, under Articles 39 and 40 of the Charter. We welcome the personal involvement of the Secretary-General to establish direct contacts with the leaders of the two parties and the report on his recent mission to the area. We would encourage him to continue his efforts to bridge the positions of the two parties. No stone should be left unturned in attempts to find a peaceful solution to this tragic conflict.\nWe support the diplomatic efforts led by Under-Secretary-General Diego Cordovez as the best hope of reaching an early negotiated solution to the problem of the occupation of Afghanistan. We should not forget the dangers created by the lack of progress in the peace process in the Middle East. My Government supports the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations as the best way of establishing real contacts and negotiations between the parties to the conflict.\nIn November this year it will be 10 years since the Security Council imposed a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa. The United Nations embargo needs to be implemented more strictly and to be made more comprehensive. Norway will\ncontinue to work with other member nations to strengthen the oil embargo. It is our view that comprehensive and mandatory sanctions adopted by the Security Council remain the most effective means to exert pressure on the South African Government.\nIn Central America, there are encouraging signs of a momentum for peace.\nNorway has always supported solutions in the region, for the region and by the region. Thus, we support the peace plan adopted by the five countries of the region in Guatemala in August. We will continue to work with other nations to see if there are ways in which we can further support the peace process.\nWhile we are meeting here at the highest State and Government levels to discuss the problems of common concern it is vital to remember that the United Nations is much more than its 159 Member States. At the outset, the Charter states; \\\"We the peoples of the United Nations\\\". To fulfil the intentions behind this sentence we need also to strengthen and further develop the ties between the United Nations and non-governmental organizations.\nOver the past 40 years we have experienced a remarkable structural change.\nMuch of this change has been brought about by public pressure, with people ahead of Governments. We have seen the importance of the work of non-governmental organizations in a whole range of areas, such as human rights, women's emancipation, disarmament, the North-South dialogue and environmental protection. This clearly shows that the establishment of closer links between the United Nations and non-governmental organizations is not only in the interest of the latter, but also in the interest of the Organization.\nMy statement, as I hope the Assembly has understood, has concentrated on the situation of the United Nations solely. Representatives may ask why. The explanation is that for a country such as Norway a strong United Nations is of major importance, it actually means a strengthening of our ability to take care of our national interests.\nA weak United Nations means that more decisions with direct implications for our country will be taken without our participation in the decision-making process. For us, active involvement in the many activities of the United Nations in tackling the many problems facing the world is not an act of charity  it is in our own interest.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt gives me great pleasure to convey to the President the congratulations of the Tunisian delegation on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We are confident that, given his well-known experience and skill, he will conduct the proceedings at this important session with the utmost efficiency. I can assure him of Tunisia's co-operation with his country, the German Democratic Republic. Our two countries have always maintained excellent relations of friendship and co-operation.\nI am also happy to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, who presided tactfully and effectively over the work of the forty-first session. Our deep appreciation and sincere gratitude go to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, for his dedication and for his eminently active role in the service of the Organization and in pursuance of the noble objectives of its Charter.\nIn mounting this rostrum, from which the world's conscience is periodically expressed, sometimes in anguish and sometimes inspired by hope, I venture to request attention so that I may enumerate a distressing series of problems that have often been raised in this prestigious forum. I have, frankly, felt tempted to limit this statement to making a strong appeal for a radical change in all of us. Namely that in our deliberations we set aside individual problems and current differences and - in our thinking, in our statements and in the formulation of our resolutions - acknowledge the absolute primacy of a common creed based on the Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of the United Nations. For it is time - I might say it is high time - to enforce compliance with those two instruments, which are not impractical products of man's idle invention but.\nIndeed, irrefutable commandments and fundamental precepts that govern the conduct of each and every one of us.\nIt is indeed high time for States in their relations to eschew their obsession with issues deriving from dogmatic allegiance and with conventional rifts that result from a kind of short-sightedness in the evaluation of International relations.\nIt is time for us to join together in exorcising the demons of aggressiveness, hegemonism and tyrannical power so that mankind can finally live in peace and the peoples of the world can prosper through exchanges founded on fraternal relations.\nI would have liked to conclude by saying that, but this session has begun at a particularly critical time. The world is going through a period of turmoil, and the direst threats are gathering momentum in more than one region of our planet.\nIn addition to the long-standing conflicts that have preoccupied the Organization almost since its Inception, such as the problems of the Middle East and southern Africa; in addition to the serious problems afflicting Asia, where both Afghanistan and Kampuchea are still occupied by foreign armies, and in addition to the convulsions in Central America, we now have a protracted war in a particularly sensitive region, which compounds the frustrations of the peoples of the Middle East, who have contributed so much to the development of civilization. I refer to the war between Iran and Iraq. That war is sapping the strength and potential of two fraternal peoples and may even jeopardize the future of those two great countries.\nAll our efforts should be directed towards bringing that tragedy to an end\u00b7\nIt is urgently necessary to establish a just peace, with no victor and no vanquished in order to terminate that particularly lethal and unjust conflict, a conflict that is all the more unjust as it involves two nations whose confrontation violates the very concepts of their traditional faith the Islamic religion, which preaches peace, brotherhood and tolerance for all mankind. The resolution adopted by the Security Council concerning the war between Iran and Iraq seems to us to offer hope by the very fact that it appropriately strengthens the role assigned to the United Nations in Chapter vu of the Charter. By assuming the task Incumbent upon it, our Organization can and must enforce solutions wherever peace Is threatened.\nThe authority of the United Nations must be the guarantee of law and peace. That is my country's position, Tunisia, inspired by Bourguiba, a champion of peace and the brotherhood of peoples, has solemnly vested supreme authority in international legality and the world conscience\u00b7 \nThat authority is in perfect concord with the authority deriving from the spiritual values bequeathed by the Islamic message, to which ray country, while welcoming dialogue and keeping pace with progress, remains absolutely faithful.\nI must express my sorrow at seeing the Islamic message perverted and bereft of its real meaning because of some individuals and some terrorist organizations deceitfully arrogating to themselves a mission of redemption while actually furthering their own political ends or unleashing a fanaticism foreign to the real meaning of that message of Islam.\nUnfortunately this has been turned to their own account by the disparagers of Islam. Thus, a whole campaign of propaganda has been mounted against the sacred tenets and culture of Islam, propaganda that is sometimes based on ill will but most often on ignorance. In this all-embracing world of ours, how can we refuse to recognize the plurality of cultures, their originality, their message, their own dynamism and their evolutionary processes? In fact, the self-styled dominant cultures and civilizations simply reject what, through ignorance, they fail to understand. Let us therefore face up to the vital necessity, in an international community that has become one and indivisible, of dialogue between cultures and civilizations.\nThere is certainly one country which in its life, history and institutions has given us an example of such a dialogue, a country which is today enduring a tragedy that envelops its territory, its identity and its very existence, a country which certainly does not deserve such a fate - namely, Lebanon. No one with any sense of justice or respect for human values can ignore a cry that arises from the depths of his conscience, a cry that betokens his sorrow, indignation and, above all, his solidarity. \nWithout claiming to solve the world's problems it must be said that, by its history and geography, its culture and economy, and inspired by its universalist vocation, Tunisia is deeply sensitive to all the upheavals convulsing our modern world. Being both African and Arab, both Islamic and Mediterranean, Tunisia is situated at the crossroads of all the currents and turmoil that afflict the international community.\nThat is why President Bourguiba, the founder of modern Tunisia, as a profound peace-loving man, has always given priority and deep thought to all the problems that have persistently beset the region.\nAs regards one of the problems that is most difficult and important because of its historical and strategic implications, namely, the Middle East problem, ever since 1965 President Bourguiba has advocated recognition, as is now desired by all, of both the Palestinians and the Israelis, rejecting the racial confrontation aspect of this tragedy of historical, strategic and cultural-social dimensions.\nIt is now essential for all of us to acknowledge the cogency of this approach, and the Arab countries, for their part, endorsed if not the letter at least the spirit of this approach in the Fez plan, which they adopted virtually unanimously in 1982 and which constitutes a realistic basis for solving the Middle East problem and especially that which lies at its very heart, the Palestinian problem\u00b7\nWe are all aware, however, that for so long as Israel refuses to recognize the Palestinian personality and its right to self-determination and independence all efforts to reach a peaceful solution are doomed to failure. It takes two to negotiate and reach agreement. Fortunately, voices are now being raised in that country in favour of recognizing the Palestinian fact# which is an irrefutable reality. There is no doubt that if Israel's allies were themselves to accept this fact the international conference which we so earnestly advocate not only could be convened but would lead to the desired results. We hope that the efforts made in this direction by the Secretary-General will be successfully pursued so that the triple message of the one and only God, invoking peace and brotherhood, may once again resound from Jerusalem. Then, and only then, will genuine co-operation among all the countries of that region so crucial for the world, namely, the Mediterranean, be established.\nIt is always with a sort of nostalgia for the past that people speak of the Mediterranean region, overlooking the fact that even today it is the principle area in which almost all dilemmas are concentrated - and sometimes confront each other. Alas, it is precisely there that the problems and contradictions of East-West and North-South relations intersect. The establishment of peace in this region of exceptional geostrategic importance would constitute an incomparable foundation for building a more brotherly, more interdependent world.\nThe active participation of the great Powers in a conference on the Middle East could only help to further the necessary solutions and compromises. Moreover, they would be giving not only their own direct endorsement but also that of the Security Council and the United Nations as a whole.\nIt is the Security Council that must at all times be the overseer of efforts to solve all the serious conflicts that threaten international peace and security.\nWe shall not resort to an apocalyptic view of the future of our planet, where problems are indeed world-wide in scope. Rather, we shall strive confidently to emphasize the many signs and glimmers of hope that appear here and there. \nToday we are relieved - and this feeling has been confirmed by the statements we have heard - to catch a glimpse of the possibility of a return to more harmonious relations between East and West# which holds out the promise of a slowing down of the armaments race, in other words the beginning of real nuclear disarmament and above all the hope of seeing West and East helping to solve the vital problem of peace in all regions of the world.\nIndeed such concord would among other benefits open the way for the normal operation of the Security Council the only organ capable of eliminating the many disputes that are decimating the peoples of the third world in the Middle East Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nThus in the efforts to ensure fulfilment of the legitimate aspirations of southern Africa the Security Council has already made a major indeed decisive, contribution by adopting resolution 435 (1978), on Namibia. This is the only way to bring about the solution of that problem for which the United Nations will continue to bear particular responsibility until the total independence of that country. \nWhether Namibia or apartheid is at issue, it is also high time for the will of the Security Council - as I have already said - to become, for everyone, an incontestable rule of conduct for our countries in their international relations in a world that is at last banishing recourse to force and aggression. The sufferings inflicted by the apartheid regime on the black people of South Africa will not crush its heroic struggle for liberation. Given South Africa's refusal to compromise either on Namibia or on apartheid, the Security Council must impose the requisite mandatory global sanctions in order to stop the massacre of populations whose only crime is that they aspire to liberty. It is in the light of this problem and of all the other problems confronting mankind that we judge the scope and nobility of the role of the United Nations.\nWe are therefore fully confident that the Security Council will fulfil its responsibilities under the Charter.\nConvinced as we are that grave dangers and perils threaten our world, we would like to believe that we are witnessing the dawn of a general awareness of the major problems of our time, be they political, economic or humanitarian.\nAccordingly, only the resumption of a serious, in-depth North-South dialogue inspired by our faith in the natural interdependence of peoples - in a community in which differences in the choice of ways of life cannot override strictly human aspirations and problems - can rescue us from the economic, financial and social anarchy characteristic of our present era, an era that is marked everywhere by the resurgence of poverty and violence, by persistent and spreading unemployment and by the irresponsible destruction of our environment.\nThere is a major problem that persists in the minds of the international community. Because of its universal and lethal character, it must continue to engage the serious attention of our forums: I refer to the problem of international terrorism and the taking of innocent people as hostages. These attacks on people's safety and dignity constitute a challenge that outrages the human conscience. This form of violence, particularly odious because it is carried out in a blind and craven manner, is perpetrated indiscriminately against innocent victims who, by chance or coincidence, happen to be in the path of the killers or their bombs.\nTunisia proclaims once again its condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and reaffirms its intention and determination to work for the enforcement of measures proposed by the General Assembly and of all other ways and means of putting a stop to this terrible scourge.\nThe deterioration in the sense of humanity in countries where the need has not arisen, the frustrations generated by the situation in the Middle East, the persistence of white segregationist domination over the peoples of South Africa and Namibia, and the armed conflicts in Asia and Latin America all contribute to a distressing picture of world-wide anarchy and disorder, which is only intensified by the armaments race, the economic crisis, monetary instability and the rapid decay of the environment.\nPolitical crisis, economic crisis, social crisis - actually we are witnessing a crisis of civilization in a world that prodigious scientific and technical advances have enfolded into a single network of interacting and interdependent influences.\nIt is incumbent on the international community, which now constitutes an indivisible whole, to face up to the mounting perils created by many tensions, which are, for the most part, attributable to causalities and disparities often inherited from the colonial past. It is for us to eliminate the terrible anachronisms which, at the end of the present millennium, are represented by famine, poverty and sickness, mass unemployment and destruction of ecosystems which ravage the countries of the South by instituting in their stead a new world economic order capable of ensuring the viability, peace and security of our planet and by creating decent living conditions for the populations of the developing countries.\nTunisia, like so many developing countries and so many sister countries of Africa, has agreed to make considerable sacrifices, inter alia, in the context of a thorough structural and global economic reform, being aware of the responsibilities incumbent upon it as a full member of the world economic system.\nIn spite of these efforts and owing to the lack of substantial support on the part of their partners, the economic and financial situation of the vast majority of developing countries has now passed the critical point and continues to deteriorate, in particular in the most vulnerable countries.\nThe extremely serious problem of the developing countries, external debt and the mounting flow of capital from our countries to the developed countries clearly illustrate the unacceptable and suicidal perversion of the world economy. Current debt management would actually only contribute to a dangerous increase in economic, political and social pressures on the world system as a whole. Nevertheless we continue to nourish the hope that the North-South dialogue, which was finally resumed at the last session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), will be strengthened by addressing all questions relating to development and growth and will co-ordinate the action of the Organization itself with the action of all bodies making up the United Nations system, for development must not remain a challenge or a mere, albeit fervent, aspiration. It must become a wish and a reality. \nThe economic, monetary, trade and financial problems facing mankind as a whole have never been so great and never before have so many people, with the world population explosion, aspired to a better life.\nNever have the differences between the communities of our world and within these communities been so shocking and inadmissible as they are today.\nPerhaps there is no instant cure or magic solution for the present tragedy of the current rapidly worsening Imbalance between the overfed minority of humanity, living in superabundance and waste, on the one hand, and the majority, living in malnutrition and deprivation, on the other hand. Moreover, one cannot remain indifferent to the resources and sums of money expended on armaments when famine is ravaging millions of people and threatening millions more.\nThese are the main concerns that Tunisia wishes to share with the international community. There are others, more directly and more specifically relevant to our country, such as the Western Sahara conflict, which constitutes a major obstacle to the progress of the people of our region towards realizing their aspirations to form a Maghreb community.\nSuch a formation is certainly in the nature of things, but it has become more necessary than ever because of the close proximity of one of the world's greatest economic groupings, are which embraces all the traditional economic partners of the countries of our region within the European economic communities.\nThis indicates how extremely urgent our crucial and vital need has become to co-operate with this strong European entity because of the added power that we would acquire from the formation of a Maghreb economic community based on the planning of our industrial projects and on the smooth operation of our economic structure. \nIt explains the importance we attach to seeing the obstacle of the Western Sahara problem removed once and for all, so that our community can develop and assume the leading role that is expected of it, especially by Africa and the Arab world. We are particularly indebted to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuelar, for his persevering and imaginative efforts to find a solution to this thorny question. We consider that these worthy efforts are justified by the importance of what is at stake. By resolving the crisis and clearing the way for setting up a coherent and homogeneous Maghreb community, the Secretary-General will have helped to introduce an element of equilibrium, of political, economic and strategic stability, of co-operation and of prosperity into three regions of the world at present in deep distress: Africa, the Arab world and the Mediterranean.\nIt is, nevertheless, a fact that the whole world - not to say the universe - is confused and threatened by a destructive lack of order.\nNever before has man been, thanks to scientific progress and the development of prodigious technologies, so powerful in the material sense. Never before, however, has he been so vulnerable and helpless, like the sorcerer's apprentice, overwhelmed by the forces, energies, weapons and achievements of his own creation, whose technologies he masters so well but which he uses so badly. For we know that science without conscience is soul-destroying.\nIt is, however, striking that the future is every day becoming a more shared future, in a world where pollution for some people generates sickness for others, where war directly involving some people may lead to death and desolation for everyone else, but where the advancement, enrichment and abundance of some people have not, unfortunately, led to prosperity for all. \nThus, if we want peace, security and development to be more than a mere slogan, we must all accept the comprehensiveness and interdependence of our responsibilities, so that we can join together in building a future that is no longer conceived and achieved in fear and anxiety, but is based on a fervent and irrepressible zest for life and hope.\nWith respect for human rights, and unfailingly inspired by the Charter, we shall turn that hope into reality and life will thus fully enjoy the values given it by the Creator.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset. Sic, to convey to you, on behalf of my Head of State His Majesty King Mswati III, the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland, our warmest congratulations on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. Your unanimous election to guide the deliberations of this session is indeed a clear indication of the confidence the Assembly has in you as a diplomat of outstanding ability and profound experience in world issues. I have no doubt that under your eminent guidance and with your skilful advice the Assembly will be able to tackle effectively at this session the many pressing and difficult global problems facing mankind today.\nI should like also to express my delegation's sincere gratitude to your predecessor, Ambassador Rasheed Choudhury of the Republic of Bangladesh, fox having steered most capably our discussions in this Hall during the last session. We were deeply impressed by his inspiring leadership and discerning insight into the various matters of growing concern to humanity. His ingenuity in fostering the difficult but essential spirit of compromise and accommodation in the quest for solutions to international problems made an enormous contribution to the success of the last session.\nThe delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland would also like to convey its hearty appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his entice staff for the invaluable service they have continued to render loyally to the international community by ensuring that this world body effectively fulfils its mandate to preserve international peace and security.\nForty-two long and eventful years have now come and gone since the United Nations was founded in 1945. Since that date the Organization has played a role of paramount importance as an Instrument for fostering international peace and security and as an indispensable forum for International co-operation in an increasingly complex and interdependent world. A great deal has been accomplished in the past 42 years. We have witnessed great changes in the world's political map. We have seen the dismantling of colonial empires and the emergence of many young nations from a position of total obscurity and foreign domination to their present status of full national sovereignty, in which today they play an increasing role in shaping the destiny of this planet.\nAlthough we rejoice at the achievements of the past 42 years, we are nevertheless painfully aware of the persistent presence on our planet of several obstinate pockets of resistance to the process of decolonization.\nThere are also still areas where the noble principles of human equality and dignity are being consistently flouted and where a considerable amount of time and energy are still being devoted to devising an array of flimsily disguised political schemes to give a cloak of respectability to the inhuman practice of political domination and the exploitation of man by man.\nWe are, however, convinced that no amount of glossy political schemes intent on side-stepping the central issues can replace the basic need for addressing the people's genuine aspirations for economic, social and political justice. We are equally convinced that no amount of internal repression or military forays into neighbouring countries can succeed in bringing lasting peace to a country that denies the majority of its population their basic right to freedom, economic justice and equal political participation in the country of their birth.\nAs a peace-loving nation that strongly believes in resolving political differences by peaceful negotiations, Swaziland is deeply concerned about the growing crescendo of violence and political assassinations now spilling over into our own territory with increasing frequency. We are deeply concerned about this flagrant violation of our territorial integrity and we are convinced that the myopic policy of trying to silence one's political opponents by murdering them will not stem the tide of the people's demand for freedom and justice, but will only increase the amount of bloodshed and bitterness and thereby make it even more difficult for any subsequent reconciliation and peaceful co-existence to succeed.\nMy delegation regards it as both unfair and unjust that the people of Namibia continue to be denied their birthright to self-determination and full national sovereignty by linking their independence to extraneous and totally unrelated considerations of mere ideological expediency. We, therefore, wish to appeal most earnestly, in the name of fairness and natural justice, for the people of Namibia no longer to be denied their right to freedom because of reasons of political ideology and international rivalry over which they have no control. We feel that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) should be implemented without any further delay.\nThe prevailing political situation in southern Africa is not only breeding violence and considerable human suffering but also causes large numbers of refugees to flee into Swaziland from the neighbouring countries. In fulfilment of its obligations under the relevant International conventions, Swaziland makes every possible effort to give shelter and other humanitarian assistance to all such refugees. However, the refugee population in ray country has become so large that the Swaziland authorities are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with this task. Consequently, we are appealing to the international community for Increased assistance to enable us to meet the ever-increasing demand for basic facilities for these unfortunate human beings.\nThere are a number of other conflict areas in the world today that continue to need the close attention of the United Nations. These include the seven-year old war between Iran and Iraq, the Palestinian question, Lebanon, Afghanistan, the Korean question, Kampuchea, Chad, Western Sahara and Central America, just to mention a few. Although some critics would point to those areas as evidence of the failure of the United Nations to solve international disputes, my delegation still believes that, given the necessary political will on the part of the international community, all these difficult problems can be resolved and peace restored to those trouble-torn areas.\nThe war between Iran and Iraq is developing daily into a world conflict. The Security Council's unanimous resolution of July 1987 demanding a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq, with the threat of sanctions to enforce this demand, needs the whole-hearted support of all Member States. This unfortunate war is costing both countries enormously in both human and material resources. Hence, the Gulf war cease-fire resolution, considered one of the few mandatory directives the Security Council has unanimously approved in its 42-year history, is a timely and welcome step by the world Organization. We hope the Security Council will continue to demonstrate unanimity concerning other conflict areas in the world so as to bring peace and justice to all.\nIn keeping with its strong belief in the principle of self-determination, Swaziland supports the inalienable right of the people of Afghanistan to determine the form and ideological complexion of their own government and the socio-economic structure of their own country without outside interference. It is in this context that my delegation commends the untiring efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to find a negotiated formula for achieving an early withdrawal of all foreign troops from that country. We therefore hope that an agreement on the question of a mutually acceptable time-frame for the withdrawal of foreign troops will soon be reached by the parties closely involved in this conflict, so that the Afghan people may be allowed once again to share their own destiny in peace.\nEqually, my delegation supports the United Nations resolution calling for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea and for the restoration of Kampuchea's independence and territorial integrity. We believe that an early end to outside intervention in the internal affairs of Kampuchea will make a positive contribution to the noble efforts of the countries of South-East Asia to establish a zone of peace in that part of the world.\nThe tense political situation that continues to divide North and South Korea should not be allowed to escape the attention of this world Organization. We therefore wish to urge the international community to continue to encourage the process of achieving the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation.\nMost developing countries, like mine, are heavily dependent upon a very limited range of primary commodities for their export earnings, with the result that wide price fluctuations in world commodity prices of our young, fledgling economies. The unemployment problem in the developing countries is fast approaching crisis proportions and is threatening serious consequences for the socio-political stability of those young countries. Unemployment is rising not only as a result of stunted economic growth in most developing countries, but also because the numbers for whom jobs must be found are multiplying at rates that far outstrip the sluggish pace of economic growth in those countries.\nThe economic problems of the developing countries are further compounded by generally low commodity prices and unfavourable exchange rates which cause severe balance-of-payments difficulties and the chronic shortage in those countries of foreign exchange to pay for essential imports and spare parts needed for production activities.\nThe low prices of major export commodities and the unfavourable exchange rates give rise to another complicating dimension, namely, the increasing inability of many developing nations to cope with the mounting burden of foreign debts.\nMy delegation is therefore convinced of the need for urgent and appropriate measures to be taken, on a global scale, to stabilize international exchange rates if the economies of the developing countries, which are heavily dependent upon foreign exchange earnings from primary commodity exports, are to be protected from the debilitating effects of wild exchange-rate fluctuations.\nMy delegation believes that it is essential for the economic survival of developing nations that they be given all possible assistance to help them acquire the necessary capacity to process more and more of their own raw materials so as to generate much needed employment opportunities in those countries and to enhance the value of their exports and thus help to broaden the base of their economies and thereby reduce their presently high vulnerability to the vagaries of the international commodity markets.\nWe are convinced that a strategy of locating the relevant processing industries nearer to the source of raw materials in the developing countries would be of immense economic advantage to both the exporting and the importing countries, in that it would bring about a substantial reduction in the high freight costs currently incurred in exporting bulky raw materials with a relatively low unit value.\nAn industrial development strategy of this nature can be successful only if it is accompanied by willingness on the part of the developed nations to dismantle the existing plethora of tariffs and other protectionist measures that currently restrict access to the markets of the industrialized countries by processed or semi-processed goods from the developing nations.\nIt goes without saying that any meaningful development programme in the developing countries can be successfully undertaken only if these countries have access to international loan capital with soft interest rates and reasonably long repayment periods. This would largely obviate the current problem of the heavy debt burden, which is proving too onerous for many developing nations.\nI conclude by expressing the hope that the General Assembly will find it possible at this session to address itself positively and constructively to the many pressing problems facing mankind in this decade. My delegation wishes to urge the Assembly to build bridges of peace to span the many yawning gulfs created by diverse and largely conflicting interests, so that freedom/ human equality and justice may one day truly prevail throughout the world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, Sir, on behalf of the Albanian delegation, to extend to you my warm congratulations on your election to the high post of President of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its forty-second session and to wish you success in the performance of your task.\nAlthough more than four decades have elapsed since the founding of the United Nations, the international community is still very far from achieving those objectives and goals pertaining to peace that are clearly stipulated in the Charter and constitute the fundamental purpose for which this Organization was founded. The political situation in the world today presents a grave picture. Various peoples and countries continue to be threatened with aggression by imperialist forces or have been the victims of declared and undeclared imperialist wars - wars in which a number of States and millions of troops are involved, with resultant huge human losses and colossal material damage, and with serious consequences for international peace and security.\nIn fact, the stationing of military troops by the United States of America and the Soviet Union indefinitely in the territory of many States has been legitimised under various pretexts, such as the threat from the East, or the West, and so on. Indeed, repeated meetings have been held, where there is talk about the maintenance of the balance of forces and military manoeuvres conducted alternately by one bloc or the other, but the most that is ever heard is satisfaction at the participation in them of observers from the two blocs, and there is never any talk of the complete withdrawal of American and Soviet troops from foreign territories where they are stationed. For the sake of co-ordinating policies in the context of blocs, even the taking of independent decisions has been restricted, and made virtually impossible. All the political activity of the two super-Powers, whether in the bilateral talks between blocs or in a broader framework, has concentrated on maintaining, and indeed extending, their respective spheres of Influence. This impermissible situation of undeclared occupation in modern times cannot but remind us of the long-drawn-out invasions of past centuries and the lessons of history.\nWe hear a lot of talk at present about the United States and the Soviet Union reaching an agreement on the removal of medium-range missiles from Europe. From the very outset the Albanian Government has expressed its opposition to the deployment of these missiles in Europe, just as it has always been and still is in favour of the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons, and against the miniaturization of space and the arms race in general. It is a well-known fact that when the two super-Powers installed those missiles, they paid no attention to the strong opposition of the peoples of Europe. Now they are talking about dismantling and removing them from Europe, and are trying to present this as an important step in the field of disarmament. It is abundantly clear that in this whole business the super-Powers have made their calculations. When they speak about international security, they are in fact talking only about their own security, which means insecurity for the others. Even after such an agreement, thousands of nuclear weapons, regardless of type, will still remain in and around Europe and hundreds of military bases established in a number of European States will still be there. \nHence, the factors that threaten peace on the continent and in the world remain. Thus an agreement, on the removal of short- and medium-range missiles must absolutely be accompanied by other steps in the field of disarmament, and that would constitute a victory for the peoples and democratic States that are continuing to fight against the arms race as they have been fighting for years. For some time, especially in recent years, much has been said about summit meetings between the United States and the Soviet Union in the hope that they would solve the problems of safeguarding peace and assuring the future of mankind. For the super-Powers to meet and hold talks is their right and business, but what is unacceptable is that they should discuss and take decisions for others. It would be dangerous if peoples were to accept the institutionalisation of summit meetings between the super-Powers as a forum empowered to take decisions for third parties. The super-Powers would like to be given a free hand and have other States welcome and accept as fait accompli everything they decide.\nThe Albanian delegation believes that on issues connected with the destinies of peoples, with world peace and security, every sovereign State must have its say.\nThe problems of Europe and European security are of direct concern to socialist Albania. Peace on the continent, friendly relations among European peoples and countries signify peace and normal development also for the People's Socialist Republic of Albania. Our people, which throughout the centuries have suffered from wars and foreign invasions, have been and continue to be in the vanguard of those fighting for peace and friendship among peoples.\nBut who and what threatens European security? Who and what jeopardizes peace on this continent? Europe has been shackled hand and foot with heavy fetters. It is the military pacts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and of the Warsaw Treaty, the military bases and arsenals of nuclear and conventional weapons deployed in so many countries, the armies of the United States and of the Soviet Union which, for more than the 40 years that have elapsed since the Second World War, continue to make themselves at home in Europe; it is the warships, cruisers and aircraft carriers of the super-Powers which criss-cross the Mediterranean and European waters like sea serpents; it is imperialist economic and political pressure and cultural aggression which is stifling the continent. It is precisely this that is undermining the sovereignty of various countries, affecting their personalities and independence and endangering peace and security in Europe.\nAlbania does not participate in the meetings of the Conference on European Security and Co-operation, for we are convinced that these meetings, which are manipulated by the two super-Powers, cannot lead to any fruitful results unless one believes that the United States and the Soviet Union are going to frustrate their own ends. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania, which under its Constitution prohibits foreign military bases and troops on its territory and which has solemnly declared that no harm will ever come to any of its neighbours from Albanian territory, appreciates the genuine aspirations of peoples, honest men and progressive personalities in Europe to peace and security in our continent, and we welcome their efforts in that direction.\nHowever, the Albanian Government has always been firmly convinced that European security cannot be achieved through such meetings and conferences where the super-Powers impose their will. European security can be achieved only by getting rid of the chains with which the two super-Powers have shackled it and by opposing their presence and interference in the internal, affairs of European States. Only thus can their freedom, independence and sovereignty be guaranteed.\nAlso, the Balkan region does not enjoy tranquillity, neither is it without problems. In addition to interference by the super-Powers, there are a number of negative regional elements that have increased tension. It is common knowledge that history has intermingled the peoples of the Balkans and that there are many ethnic minorities. Regrettably, in recent years chauvinistic feuds and passions have been incited in one way or another. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania is opposed to these dangerous trends. It cannot reconcile itself to acts and deeds that restrict the national rights of the peoples of the Balkans, or that divide them and sow hostility among them, it advocates respect for the rights of every people and each ethnic minority.\nThe Albanian Government believes that minorities should be viewed as a bridge to unity and friendship among the peoples of the peninsula and not as a source of discord. Acceptance and recognition of their identities, cultures and national traditions and respect for their own languages and their spiritual bonds with their own nation would greatly contribute to strengthening an atmosphere of understanding and sincere co-operation.\nFrom time to time initiatives are taken regarding various political activities and meetings at the Balkan level. The Albanian Government appreciates every sincere and constructive step aimed at serving peace and stability in the region. Hence we support in principle the holding of bilateral and multilateral meetings and talks. At the same time we believe that it is necessary first to create the kind of atmosphere that will ensure their making a contribution towards genuine solutions of the problems of our region and not their becoming a source of further exacerbation of the situation.\nFor its part Albania has acted with a high sense of its responsibility and has never been the cause for any exacerbation of the situation. It favours the removal of nuclear and chemical weapons and so on, not only from the Balkans but also from other regions and countries. That is in keeping with its political line. Also, Albania has realized in practice what the Balkans need to ensure peace and understanding.\nFriendly Balkan co-operation is the hope and aspiration of the peoples of the region, but to achieve this it is necessary to face up realistically to the problems of the peninsula. We believe that at present it would be advantageous to each country and to the region as a whole to settle existing differences by means of bilateral negotiations, just as it would be equally necessary to develop bilateral relations. We believe also that inter-Balkan activities in the fields o trade, transport, culture, science and technology, ecology and so on help to develop co-operation and strengthen trust and understanding, which are so indispensable for the concerted consideration of the major political problems of the Balkans.\nThe problems of security in the Balkans and in Europe are closely connected with those of security in the Mediterranean. For years this basin has been transformed into an arena of rivalry between the super-Powers, which have deployed their fleets there thousands of kilometres from their own borders and are threatening the peoples and the peace of the region. Their growing presence and activities keep the Mediterranean peoples and countries in a state of continuous tension. The anchoring of American and Soviet cruisers and other warships, which in the guise of \\\"friendly\\\" or \\\"tourist\\\" visits have secured permanent access to port services and facilities in various countries, also constitutes a real danger to neighbouring countries.\nThe worsening of the situation and the continuation of the crisis in the Middle East and the repeated American military operations in the western Mediterranean and so forth is eloquent evidence of the urgent need to oppose the military presence of the super-Powers in the Mediterranean with their bases and fleets. Albania continues to maintain the view that, their removal constitutes the primary and decisive pre-condition for turning the Mediterranean into a sea of peace. For years now the tense situation in the Middle East, with its almost regular flare-ups, has been a constant threat to international relations.\nTo the terrible tragedy of the Palestinian people, who have long been the victims of genocide like that carried out by the Nazis against the Jews during the Second World War, has now been added the drama and the tragic events in Lebanon, which has been turned into an arena of fratricidal strife whipped up by the imperialist Powers and Israel, and all those that are playing their game. Irrespective of the political groupings or religious sects of those engaged in the present fighting, it is Arab blood that continues to be shed in Lebanon and it is the Arab cause in general and the Palestinian cause in particular that are constantly under attack.\nThe People's Socialist Republic of Albania and the Albanian people, sincere friends of the Arab peoples, with whom they are linked by traditional bonds, are saddened by the events in Lebanon, which we follow with concern, just as we follow the overall developments and crisis in the Middle East. We rejoice at every step towards Arab unity, just as we welcome whole-heartedly any positive development towards the strengthening of the unity in the ranks of the Palestinian movement, of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\nRecently there has been talk, which continues, of convening an international conference on the Middle East. We believe that no conference on this question can yield results if it ignores or seeks a substitute for the PLO. Still less can be expected from such a conference if it fails to deal with the very heart of the Middle East problem, the Palestinian problem.\nThe Middle East and Gulf areas have been transformed into permanent hotbeds of war, and the imperialist Powers bear a grave responsibility for this. The continuance of the Iran-Iraq war has caused incalculable human losses and material damage to the peoples of the two countries. The war benefits only the enemies of those countries and of peace, who one day may use it as a pretext to in the flames of war not just throughout the Gulf but beyond. The United States and other Powers have now sent their battle fleets to the Gulf on the pretext of guaranteeing freedom of navigation and clearing the waters of mines. This sets n extremely dangerous precedent. The guns in the Straits of Hormuz have made the situation even more explosive. Battle fleets were sent there before the ink was even dry on resolution 598 (19B7) which the Security Council adopted unanimously calling on all other States to refrain from any act which might lead to further escalation and widening of the Iran-Iraq conflict.\nIt is now more essential than ever for the sincere appeals of democratic and peace-loving States, which represent the voice of reason and sound international opinion, for an immediate end to the war to be heeded. This would be in the interest of both Iraq and Iran and of the peace and stability of the region and the world.\nA number of hotbeds of tension are being kept alight and fanned by imperialism and reaction in other areas of the world, such as Africa, Central America and South-East Asia.\nContrary to the will of the Korean people, Korea continues to be divided. The Albanian Government supports the right of the Korean people to the independent reunification of its country without any outside interference.\nThe People's Republic of Kampuchea is not being left in peace to build a new and independent life, and is still denied its lawful place in the United Nations. Peoples everywhere - whether in the occupied Arab territories, Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Namibia or South Africa - are stepping up their patriotic resistance to foreign aggression and interference. They are intensifying the anti-imperialist struggle, along with the struggle against racial discrimination and apartheid, for their democratic and national rights.\nCurrent political developments cannot be viewed in isolation from the effects of the prolonged economic and financial crisis and the intensification of neo-colonial exploitation. An indication of the degree of exploitation and injustice in existing international economic relations is the fact that 50 per cent of our planet's raw material resources are utilized by the industrialized countries, although, of course, they make up only 15 per cent of the population of the world. The developing countries are up to their necks in debt and the repayment conditions imposed have become impossible to meet; in fact, the economies of many States are being stifled. International trade is encountering difficulties of many kinds, as was clearly confirmed at the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Similarly, the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development brought to light new facts about the paradoxical and tragic situation of the world today. The colossal sum expended on arms is equal to the total debt. Yet the production of all types of weapons continues unabated, as does the arms trade.\nThe peoples and the developing countries are exerting every effort to fight the system of neo-colonial relations imposed by the imperialist Powers. We associate ourselves with the efforts to change the inequality of international economic relations. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania has always been and remains in favour of the development of international relations on a basis of justice and mutual advantage. In the future, too, we shall continue to participate actively in these relations. This we consider to be both a right deriving from our status as an independent and sovereign State and a duty deriving from the policy of a truly socialist country. The Albanian Government believes that development and international co-operation in various fields must contribute to the strengthening of friendship among peoples and strengthening of peace and security.\nThe Albanian people and Government, as in the past, will continue in the future to give its unreserved support to the struggle of peoples for freedom and national independence, which is one of the fundamental trends of world development at the present time and a contribution to the cause of peace, freedom and democracy.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first, on behalf of the Indonesian delegation, to extend our sincere congratulations to Mr. Peter Florin on his election as President at the forty-second session of the General Assembly. His elevation to that high office is a tribute to his personal qualities and record of great distinction in the service of his Government and of the international community. I am fully confident that under his stewardship we shall achieve substantive progress in our work.\nTo his distinguished predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, I wish to convey our deep gratitude for, and appreciation of, the exemplary manner in which he presided over our deliberations during the last session.\nThe past year has been marked by several significant developments affecting the course of international relations. During the forty-first session the Assembly took a momentous decision to strengthen and revitalize the functioning of the United Nations. Its implications went beyond the confines of Improving the Organization's administrative efficiency and financial viability and provided a critical boost to its capacity to face the multiple challenges confronting the international community. It has resulted in renewed confidence and recognition of the irreplaceable role and value of the United Nations as the unique multilateral framework for dealing with the global problems of our time. The ability of the United Nations to rally the community of nations in common purpose to seek solutions to a diversity of critical issues has been manifest at various forums during the past year.\nLast June some 140 nations gathered in Vienna for the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. The Declaration and Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline adopted at that Conference were clear manifestations of the ability of nations to forgo rhetoric and polemics in favour of jointly facing a common threat - not only a threat to the moral and social foundations of all societies, but indeed a potent threat to the youth who represent the future of all countries. \nMeeting against the sombre background of a global economy in the throes of persistent crisis, the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), convened in Geneva this summer, was able to overcome the paralysing differences and scepticism that had plagued previous sessions and achieved by consensus the Final Act of the Conference. In addressing squarely the key issues in the fields of trade, money, finance and development, the agreements reached may well presage a resurgence of momentum in the North-South dialogue and signal a reversal of the current malaise in international co-operation for development\u00b7\nThe recently concluded Conference on Disarmament and Development was yet another landmark in the process of jointly addressing two of the most urgent challenges facing the world today. For the first time at the intergovernmental level the close and multidimensional link between disarmament and development was explicitly acknowledged and the Final Document of the Conference committed participating Governments to making this relationship an effective and productive one.\nWe believe that, above all, the results of these conferences have contributed to arresting the erosion of multilateralism and to strengthening the commitment of Governments to the larger common interests and priority concerns of the international community.\nWhile these are all encouraging developments, they cannot and should not divert our collective view from the dismal realities and dangerous anomalies that still condition the present international situation. Today more than ever before  we have become aware of the dangers posed by an unrestrained arms race in the nuclear era, which, apart from its potent threat of mutual destruction, is now also acknowledged to be a serious impediment to the pursuit of optimal development\u00b7 The world economy remains mired in prolonged crisis, international economic relations are in acute imbalance, and economic development is bogged down in sharply reduced growth or stagnation. At the same time, the persistence of tensions and conflicts in many regions continue to take a heavy toll in both human and material resources of nations. The struggle for self-determination and true independence, justice and racial equality, economic progress and social emancipation must still contend with outmoded structures and new forms of neo-colonialist domination, pressures, interference and intervention.\nIf we are to move progressively towards a more viable world order of common security and common prosperity, there can be no alternative to fostering the renewed recognition of the value and indispensability of multilateral co-operation.\nThis is particularly relevant in the fields of disarmament and international security. I have earlier referred to the recently concluded Conference on Disarmament and Development. Indonesia welcomes the results that were achieved through the consensus of all participating States. Although it obviously fell short of our expectations, the Final Document of the Conference in our view provides us with a sufficiently broad framework for our future action and continuing efforts in these two interrelated fields upon which the building of a more peaceful, secure and prosperous world is so vitally dependent. In focusing global attention on the negative and far-reaching implications of current military expenditures, especially by the major Power blocs, for the world economy and the present international system and by highlighting the pervasive non-military threats to security, the Conference succeeded in establishing a compelling economic case against the arms race. It also underlined the imperative need to redirect resources released through disarmament to the improvement of the socio-economic conditions of the developing countries, especially. It is to be regretted that the Conference could not yet agree to provide for an international financial mechanism to facilitate such a reallocation of resources\u00b7 None the less, Indonesia expects that on the basis of the Action Programme that was adopted, this and other follow-up actions will be pursued in the context of an enhanced, interrelated perspective within the United Nations and its appropriate organs and agencies.\nWe are also greatly encouraged by the progress that is being made in the disarmament negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. We welcome their agreement in principle to conclude a treaty eliminating all intermediate- and shorter-range nuclear missiles - a treaty which, however limited in scope, would for the first time involve the actual dismantling of specific categories of nuclear weapons. Such an accord may, it is to be hoped, lead to further agreements on the larger issues of strategic and space armaments.\nMore importantly, it is to be hoped that this initial but significant achievement may bring about a new atmosphere and give a fresh impetus to the multilateral disarmament negotiations now in progress in Geneva. Bilateral agreements between the super-Powers only, while providing the  necessary catalyst towards general disarmament, do not meet the goal of eliminating all nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction under effective international control. Although primary responsibility indeed rests with those who possess a monopoly of destructive power, all States have a vital stake in disarmament and therefore have the right and the duty to contribute to this process. If concrete progress is to be made in genuine arms limitation and disarmament, then multilateral negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations should be the rule rather than the exception. Accordingly, the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva should be allowed to perform its rightful function as the single multilateral negotiating forum in the field of disarmament. In this context, we should like in particular to see the Conference on Disarmament complete as soon as possible the negotiations on a chemical-weapons convention and continue to deal with such questions as a comprehensive test ban and the prevention of an arms race in outer space on a high-priority basis.\nOur collective efforts to strengthen international co-operation and to meet the challenges of the future can hardly succeed while unresolved conflicts continue to rage in many regions of the world. It is of the utmost importance to bring to an early end the strife and turmoil which have their source in the continued violation of the fundamental rights of nations and peoples as envisaged in the Charter. This is painfully self-evident in the region of southern Africa, where institutionalised racism and the remaining vestiges of colonialism continue to affront our shared sense of justice and morality.\nDespite world-wide censure and condemnation, the racist Pretoria regime has intensified its campaign of brute terror against the oppressed majority and persists in its illegal occupation of Namibia. Its lawless and predatory nature is further reflected in its incessant acts of aggression, political destabilization and economic strangulation against its neighbours, particularly the front-line States, thus posing a constant threat to regional and international peace and security.\nApartheid is at the root of the deepening crisis in southern Africa and must be eradicated in its totality. It is high time for those who pay lip service to the dismantling of that inhuman system but who continue to lend credence and support to Pretoria to cease such duplicitous behaviour and join the international community in working towards the objective of a free, non-racial and democratic society in South Africa. Likewise, the liberation of Namibia is a sine qua non for the re-establishment of peace and stability region-wide. It is utterly unacceptable that after almost 10 years since the adoption of the United Nations plan for Namibia's independence South Africa continues to cling to irrelevant pretexts such as the presence of Cuban troops in Angola to block its implementation. Indonesia has long been convinced that Pretoria will not voluntarily co-operate in the realization of the genuine independence of Namibia and that the only alternative is to compel it to comply with United Nations decisions.\nThe Security Council can no longer justify any further procrastination in imposing comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa\u00b7 For if there is one Government against which Articles 39 and 40 of the United Nations Charter should appropriately be applied it is surely the renegade regime in Pretoria.\nTime and again the search for a just and durable peace in the Middle East has been thwarted by Israel's brazen acts of expansionist aggression against its neighbours, its reign of terror and repression in the occupied Arab territories and its illegal policies and practices directed towards the goal of ultimate annexation of Arab lands and the permanent denial of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and independent statehood. Let there be no illusions among us that it is precisely in pursuance of those sinister designs that Israel is bent upon sabotaging any prospect of the convening of the international conference on peace in the Middle East, There is also no doubt that Israel's intransigence could hardly be sustained without the virtual carte blanche extended to it by its powerful friends and supporters.\t.\nMy Government remains convinced that it is only through the proposed international peace conference that a viable negotiating framework can be established within which all the dimensions of the Arab-Israeli conflict and its core aspect of Palestinian self-determination can be comprehensively addressed. It would also provide an acceptable forum where all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation organization (PLO), the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, could participate on an equal footing.\nGiven the ever present danger of escalating violence and widening conflict, there should be no further delay in preparing for the conference. We fully concur with the Secretary-General that questions of procedure should not present insurmountable obstacles and that our priority concern should continue to be directed towards what the conference would achieve in terms of the objective of just and lasting peace in accordance with the aspirations of the peoples of the region.\nRecent initiatives undertaken by the Security Council offer renewed hope of a mutually acceptable negotiated settlement of the agonizing conflict between Iran and Iraq, which has lasted far too long and has inflicted such grievous loss of human life and material destruction on both sides. The protracted hostilities now threaten to expand into wider conflagration, including the deepening involvement of extra-regional Powers, which we cannot but view with serious concern. It is Indonesia's fervent hope that the Secretary-General's current efforts, mandated by Security Council resolution 598 (1987), will succeed in bringing an end to war and paving the way towards a comprehensive, just and honourable peace.\nIn the sub region of South-East Asia the unresolved conflict situation in Kampuchea still constitutes the one major obstacle blocking the path towards stable peace, regional harmony and common prosperity. Despite continuing hopes for some movement in the direction of a just and comprehensive settlement through dialogue and negotiation, the profound and legitimate aspirations of the Kampuchean people to an end to foreign intervention and the presence of foreign forces on its soil  and to self-determination and national reconciliation still remain unfulfilled. My Government is acutely aware of the complications and dangers of the prolonged impasse in resolving this tragic conflict, which cannot but be contrary to the interests of all the parties concerned. Thus, in July of this year Indonesia, as interlocutor for the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), arrived at an understanding with Viet Nam on the holding of an informal meeting, without pre-conditions and with no political labels, of all political factions of the Kampuchean people, on an equal footing, in which at a later stage Viet Nam and other countries concerned would be invited to participate.\nWe sincerely believe that this two-stage informal get-together would be a useful device in breaking the deadlock and preparing for actual negotiations towards a settlement of the Kampuchean problem in all its complex ramifications. We regret to note that this understanding has subsequently evoked differing interpretations among some of the parties directly concerned. Nevertheless, Indonesia, together with the other states members of ASEAN, stands ready to engage Viet Nam in the continued search for a political solution that would lead to the restoration of a genuinely independent, neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea, while at the same time assuring the legitimate interest of all countries in the region in living in peace with one another free from extra-regional pressures and interference.\nOn the situation in Afghanistan, we have taken note with keen interest of the progress made and the obstacles that remain in the efforts aimed at finding a viable settlement. A negotiated solution based on the withdrawal of foreign forces and the restoration of the independence, sovereignty and non-aligned status of Afghanistan would not only bring peace and national reconciliation to the valiant Afghan people but also contribute to greater harmony and stability in the relationships among the States in the region and beyond. \nRecent events in New Caledonia have shown that a process of decolonisation which ignores or suppresses the innate rights of the indigenous people cannot yield a just or durable outcome. The holding of a referendum under such conditions serves only to exacerbate the divisions and strife in the Territory. Self-determination and the peaceful transition to an independent New Caledonia can come about only if it is fully in accordance with the fundamental rights and interests of the indigenous Kanak people, while at the same time guaranteeing the rights and interests of all inhabitants of the Territory's multi-ethnic and multiracial society.\nWith so many persistent conflicts defying peaceful resolution, it is with particular satisfaction that Indonesia welcomes the conclusion of the agreement between the Central American States to establish a stable and lasting peace in accordance with the principles of sovereignty, common security, non-interference, self-determination, democracy and development. The accord represents a clear reaffirmation that dialogue and negotiations among the regional States themselves institute the most effective means of resolving regional problems. It is now more essential than ever for all the parties involved, including countries external to the sub region, to sustain the momentum of the peace process and make possible the emergence of a regional order truly responsive to the basic Interests and aspirations of the peoples of Central America.\nIn the economic sphere, the international agenda this year has been dominated by the convening of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). That Conference assumed crucial importance because it was expected not only to address the key issues central to the health of the world economy but also to revive the stalemated dialogue between the developed North and the developing South and reactivate multilateral co-operation for development. The Conference was held against the dismal backdrop of a world economy caught in serious imbalances and dislocations. As summarized in UNCTAD, We agreed assessment of global economic trends, compared with the preceding two decades the' world economy in the 1980s has been characterized by a slowdown in growth of demand and output despite generally lower rates of inflation. Many developing countries are experiencing serious difficulties in adapting to structural changes under the impact of such acute reversals as mounting external debt burdens, high real interest rates, increased protectionism and commodity prices depressed to their lowest levels in 50 years. In short, the present decade is witnessing a generally insecure economic environment in which millions of people still lack the basic conditions for a decent life. \nIt is a matter of considerable satisfaction to Indonesia that after long and often strenuous debate UNCTAD VII could in the end unanimously agree on a set of policy measures covering the four key interrelated areas of resources for development, commodities, international trade and the problems of the least developed countries. Obviously, these policy measures still fall far short of the expectations of the Group of 77 as expressed in the Havana Declaration. Indeed, some of these prescribed policies amount to a simple reiteration of earlier unimplemented policy measures and are thus wholly inadequate to meet the aggravated situation of today. Nevertheless, judged against the background of the persistent crisis enveloping much of the developing world and the stalemate in the North-South dialogue, the consensus achieved represents a step in the right direction.\nOne development which was the highlight of the Conference, and which is of particular interest to my delegation, was the decision by the USSR to sign the Common Fund Agreement, thus opening up the very real likelihood of an early entry into force of the agreement\u00b7 We trust that the follow-up action for the speedy operation of the Fund will also be promptly undertaken. But the major overall conclusion that can be drawn is that UNCTAD has emerged stronger from the process, thereby rebuffing the efforts by some to marginalize its role.\nWhile quite understandably preoccupied with the more immediate threats to our development efforts, we should not lose sight of the longer-term challenges confronting us. The multiple crises which are currently besetting the world can no longer be viewed or addressed in their sectoral compartmentalization. As the Secretary-General aptly points out in his report on the work of the Organization, the symbiosis of development, environment and population is beginning to be better appreciated. In facing this challenge we welcome the timely decision of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to submit to this session of the General Assembly two major reports of great relevance, namely the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond, and the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, entitled \\\"Our Common Future\u00b7. It is indeed crucial for us to ensure accelerated growth and development in order to meet our present needs without compromising the well-being of our future generations. This is essentially what we understand to be the meaning of sustainable development. We agree with the World Commission that poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems; and that it would be futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective covering the underlying world poverty and international inequality. It is also undeniable that sustainable development would be further enhanced by an international atmosphere of peace, security and co-operation free from the presence and the threat of war, especially nuclear war, and the waste of intellectual and natural resources on armaments.\nTurning to the world social situation, we must remain vigilant so as to ensure that the substantial progress already achieved in various fields will not fall victim to the adverse trends in the global economy.\nIn Indonesia and the other countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) , the implementation of programmes such as that of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on the strategy of child survival and development, which is supported at the highest levels of Government, has led to Immeasurable improvements in the quality of life of our peoples. Central to this success Is the importance of widespread popular participation and guidance, as recently manifested by the adoption of an agenda for action by parliamentarians from the ASEAN region in support of this strategy. If such direction can be sustained our goal of health for all by the year 2000 can Indeed become a reality. In Indonesia, social development programmes continue to enjoy the strong personal support of President Suharto and have resulted in dramatic advances, particularly in such areas as the immunization of children. Despite the severe constraints of economic adjustment, social development has also been greatly accelerated both by the institution of integrated health and social services and by the increased attention being focused on Improving the status of women.\nI have already alluded to the results of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. The progress achieved in that forum should now be sustained with decisive action at the national, regional and International level. Of critical importance In this regard Is the speedy finalization of the new draft convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, as a necessary complement to existing International instruments.\nIndonesia is also encouraged by the progress that has been achieved in the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. The registration of India as the first pioneer Investor is a significant augury for the implementation of the provisions of the Convention as regards the sea-bed regime and resolution II of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Indonesia urges all States which have not done so to ratify the Convention to ensure its early entry into force.\nIt is quite apparent that the economic and social issues of our time have become increasingly multidimensional in character and closely Interrelated. We therefore concur with the Secretary-General's observation in his annual report that \\\"in dealing with this web of global problems, the United Nations system will need to be more fully integrated, and better able to follow priorities established for the system as a whole\\\". (A/42/1, p. 14). In this connection, my delegation has noted with interest his proposal to strengthen the role of the Economic and Social Council in order to make it more consonant with the original intent of the Charter. We are confident that in conducting the in-depth study of the United Nations intergovernmental structure in the economic and social fields the Council's Special Commission will give this proposal the serious consideration that it deserves.\nAt the same time it should always be borne in mind that all efforts to strengthen the role, improve the functioning and Increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations and its organs will remain marginal unless they are matched by the consistent support, including financial support, of all Member States. Therefore, in order to reach an effective solution to the current crisis confronting the Organization it is necessary to re-emphasize at this time the imperative need for all Member States to fulfil their financial obligations under the Charter.\nIn a world of increasing interdependence of nations and interrelationship of issues, international co-operation is no longer an option, it is a necessity. Equally, recognition of the fundamental rights and interests of all nations and peoples, apart from being a moral imperative, is an essential prerequisite for lasting peace. The eradication of the poverty and deprivation which afflict vast areas of the world can no longer be regarded as a long-term goal; it is of urgent relevance to national and international security. If the pursuit of these objectives is to achieve tangible results it is to the revitalization of the multilateral institutions that we must turn. While our Organization is obviously not without deficiencies, our hopes for a new world order must lie not in the rejection but in the rejuvenation of the United Nations. Utilizing the system effectively is as important as changing it. Together we should exert continuous efforts to strengthen the United Nations as the principal collective Instrument through which Members can resolve the fundamental global issues confronting humanity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like to begin my statement at this world meeting by extending my congratulations to you. Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. The delegation of Bolivia respects your great personal qualities and experience and your worthy representation of a friendly country. I wish also to commend your predecessor Ambassador Choudhury of Bangladesh, for the distinction with which he presided over the last session.\nOn behalf of the Government of Bolivia, I express gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his selfless and tireless efforts. His skill and perseverance in the search for solutions to the various problems facing the world are recognized by all. He is the champion of peace, understanding and brotherhood among peoples. For all these reasons, his re-election to his important post is a clear acknowledgement of the personal qualities of an illustrious Latin American.\nIn this Assembly the people and the democratic Government of Bolivia reaffirm their faith in and unqualified commitment to the principles of the Charter and their conviction that it is only through dialogue and decisive political will and understanding among all the peoples of the world that we shall succeed in solving the problems that beset mankind, that our generation will be able to build peace and brotherhood and that the interdependence of all nations will be placed above hegemonism and sterile ideological disputes.\nWe have noted with concern since the last session of the General Assembly that in many areas democratic dialogue among States has been replaced by violence/ and that force and the abuse of power have prevailed over reason, tolerance and the rule of law, with attempts to substitute themselves for negotiations in the solution of international conflicts. However, as we are all aware, force and aggression, apart from their illegality, have clearly demonstrated their inability to bring about or preserve peace.\nThe United Nations has promoted the self-determination of peoples and the peaceful settlement of disputes, which are the very pillars of peaceful coexistence and principles that Bolivia has always respected and furthered.\nPeace is the very essence of the code of civilized norms of coexistence that must guide mankind on its historic journey within the framework of the profound sense of ethics that permeates the spirit of all human beings. One enormous obstacle to peace and the attainment of international security is the arms race, which is growing apace and has reached unimaginable levels. The arms race not only jeopardizes the precarious peace that we enjoy at present but is a key factor in the stagnation of the social and economic development of both the nations involved in that mindless race and the countries of the third world, since their efforts and resources would be better spent on raising the living standards of their peoples.\nBolivia, as always, resolutely supports all disarmament initiatives designed to bring about peace and strengthen international security. I hereby declare Bolivia's readiness to seek the establishment of a zone of peace and security in the South Pacific. In keeping with those principles, my Government welcomed the announcement by the Governments of the Soviet Union and the United States of their agreement in principle to dismantle the weapons covered by the zero and double-zero options. This marks the beginning of a gradual process of nuclear disarmament, which must be maintained.\nIn spite of the selfless peace efforts made by the United Nations, we continue to be alarmed by the conflicts in various parts of the world, which thwart the commendable humanitarian work of the Organization.\nIn the context of eliminating one source of social conflict that is a blight on and a disgrace to mankind, Bolivia reiterates its utter repudiation of apartheid and all forms of discrimination, whether racial, religious, cultural, political, social or economic. Bolivia calls insistently for the self-determination of Namibia and the cessation of military aggression by South Africa against neighbouring sovereign States. Ideological pluralism, along with the self-determination of peoples, is the foundation of the coexistence of States. In this spirit, just as Bolivia recognizes the juridical and political existence of Israel/ so does it recognize the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to form a sovereign State in a free and clearly defined territory. We are certain that a solution to this problem will benefit the peace and security of the countries of the Middle East, and we therefore enthusiastically support the idea of an immediate multilateral conference, with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and the States involved, to reach a consensus on peaceful coexistence in a region so sorely tried by all the horrors of violence and blind hatred.\nSimilarly, the search for an appropriate solution to the problem of the two Koreas can only benefit that part of the world. We appeal most fervently to the parties concerned to engage in negotiations inspired by a spirit of reconciliation and brotherhood. Tragic and fierce conflicts in Asia and Africa, particularly the Iran-Iraq war, the constant deterioration of the situation in Lebanon, the military occupation of Cyprus - all persist in spite of the pleas of the international community. Bolivia, in its traditional spirit of peace, appeals earnestly to the Governments and the leaders of the parties concerned to take constructive decisions and make meaningful efforts to reach solutions to these conflicts. We emphatically urge implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987), which was adopted unanimously.\nThe persistence of those inhuman situations distresses the Bolivian people, because we see with heavy hearts that similar tensions are now arising in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nHappily, the prolonged Central American crisis is entering upon a process of change, thanks to the commendable initiative of the Heads of State of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, who, with the firm support of their peoples, held a meeting of Heads of State of Central America last August under the auspices of the Government of Guatemala. This meeting contributed in raising our hopes for the achievement of diplomatic solutions, hopes which we had voiced even before the efforts of the Contadora and Support Groups began.\nAccordingly, we are exceedingly gratified to learn that the five Heads of State decided to unite their efforts and strive as one to bring about an early understanding in favour of peace in Central America. This endeavour must be complemented by the international community, which should make an exceptionally generous contribution to the economic reconstruction of these sister countries.\nIn spite of this commendable progress, there is a conflict which endures and is a source of concern to Latin America: the vestige of an outdated colonialism that affects the legitimate sovereignty of a sister nation, the Argentine Republic, in respect of its territorial rights over the Malvinas Islands. It is imperative, that the parties concerned re-open negotiations with a view to bringing about a just and peaceful solution to the problem; thus Bolivia supports General Assembly resolution 41/11, which declares the South Atlantic to be a zone of peace and co-operation.\nBolivia's support for the rights of the sister Republic of Panama over the Canal is unwavering, and proceeds from our spirit of pan-American ism. The Torrijos-Carter Treaty is an example of this spirit, and its unqualified implementation is an imperative for the Latin American and Caribbean community.\nThe world economic situation is of grave concern to my country. There is the threat of a major recession whose repercussions would be felt mainly in the developing countries. It would have disastrous consequences for primary-commodity producers and exporters like Bolivia. We view with amazement the unfair granting of subsidies, intolerable trade discrimination and reactionary protectionism. Those regressive factors impede economic exchanges between nations and cause irreparable harm, in particular to the developing countries which have imposed on them economic restrictions that strangle free international trade. Such a chain of reactionary nationalism leads to the existence of an unjust international economic order.\nWe now have a global economic system which, even in times of apparent peace, bears the signs of controversy. In this sense, there is a radical lack of symmetry, owing to the fact that some alliances within the system do not answer to any control or regulation machinery and because of their scope, strength and power exert a de facto influence over the entire system. Nevertheless my Government hopes that the decisions adopted by the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will be carried out. We should like to take this opportunity to extend sincere congratulations to the Secretary-General of UNCTAD, Mr. Kenneth Dadzie, who has worked so hard and effectively to promote international trade.\nBolivia wholeheartedly supports the Caracas and Buenos Aires Programmes of Action, which establish economic and technical co-operation among developing countries, in this context I should like to mention the recent agreements of fraternal co-operation between Paraguay and Bolivia, and between Peru and Bolivia, respectively, which we trust will in the very near future greatly benefit our nations.\nThe Uruguayan Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has given new hope to the developing countries. We believe that the item on natural resources deserves special consideration within that framework.\nMy country, in keeping with its new economic policy and its plan for reinvigorating domestic production, and having followed with interest the latest actions of GATT, has applied for membership in that body.\nExternal debt, to which we have referred so frequently both here and elsewhere, because of its ill-effects on the economies and the growth of debtor countries, is fraught with political and social dangers from which there is no escape. We view with profound concern that the so-called periodic adjustments do not contribute to finding a solution to this structural problem. They lead to a drain of financial resources from the debtor countries to those States having predominant financial centres that has reached the astronomical figure of some $200 billion annually. This amounts to a plundering of the poor peoples of the world. \nThe United Nations could become the appropriate forum for dealing with this complex problem, given the co-operation of all the countries concerned, both debtors and creditors, in a multilateral effort with positive effects for all States and public and private financial systems that have already tried various alternatives without achieving an adequate definitive solution. This is a concrete issue that requires the immediate consideration of the Organization.\nPermit me now briefly to speak on some particularly important aspects of the situation in my country. About two years ago Bolivia embarked on a new economic policy and a new style of development. At the same time, we began to put into practice the principles of authority, responsibility and morality within the democratic framework of the life of my country, so as to make of economic democracy a factor for social justice. In August 1985 the Government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro took over a country in the grip of runaway inflation at an estimated cumulative rate, for December of that year, of 40,000 per cent, accompanied by a 20 per cent drop in its gross national product - all that against the backdrop of a grave political and social disarray. It needed great political courage by the President and his Government to apply the necessary \\\"shock\\\" treatment in order to halt the runaway inflation by establishing control over finances, instituting tax reform and introducing a single, flexible and realistic exchange rate, as well as uniform tariffs. \nThese efforts were positive but short-lived. The attempt was frustrated in October 1985 by a blow to our foreign trade caused by a fall in the prices of primary commodities, minerals, particularly tin, and fuels.\nBolivia is facing a historic challenge. In order to preserve its democratic system we are pursuing a drastic anti-inflationary policy and there have been positive results. With financial stability, both internal and external, the annual rate of inflation has been kept below 10 per cent and the exchange rate reflects supply and demand. The amount of tax collected has risen from 1 per cent to 9 per cent of the gross national product and the budgetary deficit has been eliminated. Reserves have risen by over 100 per cent and we have established social discipline and full legal and constitutional order.\nIt should be recognized that an adverse effect of the success of our policy of stabilization has been a drop in real incomes and employment, problems which we are trying to remedy by re-stimulating production in the short term and by economic and social development over the medium and long terms.\nMoreover, our Government, in spite of serious economic and financial restraints, has not neglected the social area. In the belief that democracy can flourish only in conditions of social well-being, it has established an emergency social fund designed to provide temporary work projects for the unemployed. Similarly, we have established an emergency economic recovery fund and a national social policy council, as well as a national council for co-operatives and a public housing institute. We fully support the consolidation of social property and integral and participative co-operativism.\nPursuant to its effective stabilization programme, Bolivia has signed with the International Monetary Fund a stand-by agreement and a structural adjustment agreement, with expanded facilities over three years, thus becoming the second country to secure such an agreement, which enables it to obtain compensatory financing.\nWith regard to its external debt Bolivia has arranged with the \\\"Paris Club\\\" to reschedule its bilateral public debt and is now enjoying the co-operation of the members. Preparations are now under way for a new round of negotiations.\nIn brief, Bolivia is now economically and financially ripe for investment and international co-operation and that, together with its natural resources, justifies expectations of healthy political and social development. We would like to pay a tribute to the work of the United Nations Development Programme as a source of multilateral technical co-operation and pre-investment. Its activities help to expand economic co-operation among developing countries.\nOn this occasion I should like to say on behalf of our Government that we are emerging from the most serious hyperinflation in Latin American history and the seventh most acute hyperinflation to have struck any country anywhere. The people of Bolivia wish to resolve these problems within the framework of democracy and freedom and that calls for a great spirit of sacrifice and solidarity in order to avoid falling into the trap of totalitarianism which, unfortunately, in similar situations has been the corollary of transition in such fragile circumstances.\nMy Government, conscious of the magnitude of the problem of drug trafficking, has recently, in this very forum, condemned that criminal activity and taken the initiative, along with other Governments of the region, of calling on the United Nations to proclaim drug trafficking a crime against humanity and to convene a world conference to examine the problem, a conference which would recommend concerted action to combat it at the international level. In pursuit of the same policy, Bolivia took an active part in the preparations for and work of the Conference held last June in Vienna on drug abuse and illicit trafficking. That Conference was a landmark and a testimony to the unanimity of purpose of our peoples and Governments. Its results will benefit future generations. The documents unanimously adopted there constitute a valuable basis for harmonizing the legislation of the different countries, and that will make more effective humanity's fight against this criminal and perverse activity.\nBolivia has also concluded an agreement with the United States of America for the eradication and replacement of the coca plant, with a precise timetable for both the voluntary and the forcible elimination of the crop as well as punitive action against the crime and rehabilitation of the offenders. This step taken by the Government of Bolivia is a clear expression of its determination to fight this scourge of universal dimensions, in spite of the political, social and economic problems involved in carrying out these plans for countries which bear the misnomer of producers.\nHowever, it is an inconceivable paradox that action such as that just mentioned, which has been launched from the highest political level in Bolivia, should not be fully understood by certain agencies of the United States Government, which still show biased and short-sighted understanding of so vast a problem. Bolivian democracy, which is slowly emerging, has just had imposed on it, by the unilateral action of the Government of the United States of America, a \\\"sanction\\\", which only encourages drug trafficking, since the budget cuts recently decided upon seriously weaken the national will to banish from out territory this terrible transnational of organized crime. Whether with or without the economic co-operation of the United States of America, Bolivia will not cease its efforts to eradicate the trafficking in drugs. \nOnce again we must emphasize the solid emergence of multilateralism in the fight against drugs. The spirit of the Conference in Vienna and the dynamic action of courage and efficiency of the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control are the only firm hope that States have of restoring the honour of their peoples, the health of their youth and the efficient co-operation to build a common united front to put an end to this nefarious crime without political manoeuvring.\nThese steps have been accompanied by the implementation of domestic policies designed to combat drug trafficking. On 25 July last we created the National Council against the Abuse of and Illicit Traffic in Drugs, charged with the task of formulating and establishing the policies of development/ crime prevention and rehabilitation within our overall plan for crop substitution and for development. My Government wishes to reiterate before this Assembly its determination to continue its unrelenting fight against drug trafficking, in compliance with the Declaration and the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Plan of Future Activities adopted in Vienna.\nOn numerous occasions the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and worship of Bolivia have made reference to the maritime problem facing my country, a problem which for over a century has seriously affected its economic and social growth. I feel I should now briefly refer to that matter, which is one of the issues of conflict which afflict Latin America. Since the Ninth General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS), in 1979, the hemisphere's regional organ has insistently recommended and exhorted Bolivia and Chile to find a peaceful, just solution to Bolivia's landlocked situation. This has been embodied in a variety of resolutions adopted by the organization's General Assembly in Washington in 1980, Saint Lucia in 1981, Washington in 1982 and 1983, Brasilia in 1984, Cartagena de Indias in 1985 and Guatemala in 1986. \nThe substantive part of that OAS resolution states\u00b7. \n\\\"The General Assembly,\n\\\"In a spirit of fraternity and with a view to the integration of the Americas,\n\\\"Declares that it is of continuing hemispheric interest that an equitable solution be found whereby Bolivia will obtain appropriate sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean, and \\\"Considering that it is necessary to achieve the foregoing objective and to consolidate a stable peace that will promote the economic and social progress of the area of the Americas directly affected by the consequences of the landlocked status of Bolivia, and Resolvesi\n\\\"1. To recommend to the States most directly concerned with this problem that they open negotiations for the purpose of providing Bolivia with a free and sovereign territorial connection with the Pacific Ocean. These negotiations shall take into account the rights and interests of the parties involved, and might consider, among other things, the inclusion of a port area for integrated multinational development, as well as the Bolivian proposal that no territorial compensation be included.\\\" \nAs a consequence of this continental concern and Bolivia's unbending determination to recover its access to the Pacific Ocean, in 1986 Bolivia took the initiative of arranging a new process of negotiations with the Government of Chile with the sole objective of achieving its access to the Pacific and proposing adequate compensation, to our mutual benefit. After a series of informal consultations between the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Bolivia and Chile, there was an official meeting between the Ministers representing their respective states on 21-23 April 1987 in Montevideo, thanks to the generous hospitality of the Government of Uruguay. There and then the Bolivian Minister gave his Chilean counterpart a proposal, on the basis of which the negotiations began. At that meeting the Bolivian delegation replied to various questions posed by the Chilean delegation, confident that a formal round of diplomatic negotiations had been initiated and that it was obviously being carried out seriously and in good faith by the two countries.\nA few days later the atmosphere of favourable expectancy created by a policy of mutual friendliness and accommodation was disrupted by an abrupt and rude declaration by a member of the Chilean naval forces, whose statements certainly did no credit to his uniform. Those comments were both incoherent and aggressive, thus bringing to a halt the course of negotiations aimed at finding a solution to the strained relations between the two brother countries.\nOn 9 June 1987 the Bolivian representative in Santiago was abruptly summoned to the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he was handed an official communiqu\u00e9 containing a rude rejection of the Bolivian proposal, thus unilaterally breaking off the negotiating process.\nAt the same time the Government of Chile launched a well-planned publicity campaign aimed at convincing the Chilean people and the international public that\nBolivia had never had access to the Pacific Ocean. A flood of fallacious and erroneous historical \\\"facts\\\" were thus used in an attempt to distort and invalidate Bolivia's historical, moral and political right to its own coast and a port area on the Pacific.\nBolivia has repeatedly submitted the irrefutable documented proof on which it bases its historical right to its own outlet to the Pacific Ocean, which was impetuously seized by Chile in a war of aggression in 1879 - an attack brutally and unexpectedly unleashed not only against my country but also against Peru. I do not wish to burden representatives with the details of that documentation. I shall refer only to the most categorical admission by Chile to the effect that the Bolivian littoral was taken by force during the 1879 war. That admission is contained in an official dispatch sent by the Chilean representative Mr. Abraham K\u00f6nig to the Bolivian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 13 August 1900. The relevant parts read;\n\\\"... Chile has occupied the littoral and has taken possession of it in the same way as Germany annexed Alsace and Lorraine to its empire ... Our title is born of victory, the supreme law of nations ... that the littoral is rich and worth millions, we knew. We keep it because we value it if we did not value it, we would not be interested in keeping it.\\\"\nThat official declaration has never been disavowed by Chile, nor has it been argued that Mr. K\u00f6nig, the author, was not authorized to make it. The terms of Konig's note were the basis of the Treaty imposed by Chile in 1904.\nFrom the memorandum presented by Bolivia during the Ninth General Assembly of the Organization of American States I shall extract only a few brief points pertaining to the economic impediments from which Bolivia has been suffering as a consequence of the Chilean occupation so brilliantly described by the Chilean diplomat K\u00f6nig. The territory in question has an area of 158,000 square kilometres, an area larger than the state of Pennsylvania, with a coastline of more than 400 kilometres\u00b7, it includes four ports and seven coves. The copper exported by Chile since 1979, amounting to more than 20 million tons, came from this region. That is the equivalent of the reserves of the entire Asian continent plus the reserves of the Soviet Union. Chile has thus become the world's primary exporter and the second-ranking producer of copper, after the United States- In addition, other natural resources, such as guano, saltpetre, sulphur and so on, are still being extracted from that area.\nThe basic acknowledgement of the serious juridical, moral and material damage inflicted on Bolivia and the concept that this problem is both detrimental and dangerous to the harmony and social development of the region have prompted the repeated appeals of the OAS for a peaceful, negotiated settlement of this situation. That is why Chile's infamous, inexplicable refusal is so offensive not only to Bolivia but also to the Organization of American States, which seeks to foster Bolivian-Chilean understanding.\nWe are only too familiar with Chile's arguments: \\\"Chile owes nothing to Bolivia\\\", \\\"There is a Treaty in force between the two States\\\", and so on. These are all feeble arguments designed to paper over a reality which is charged with conflict. We do not seek to denounce or ignore existing treaties, even if they did arise out of military defeat. We are asking the international community to help us to find, through negotiations in good faith, an agreement that will be a contribution to the peace, integration and development of the area, which requires realistic, imaginative and long-lasting solutions that will promote the common well-being of both our nations.\nTo conclude what I have to say on this matter, I reaffirm the determination of the Government and people of Bolivia to press their claim in the Organization of American States, to which we owe our gratitude for the sense of justice and equity it has shown in supporting Bolivia's search, through serious bilateral diplomatic negotiations conducted in good faith, for a peaceful solution to its maritime Problem. At the same time the Government and people of Bolivia wish here in the General Assembly, the supreme forum of world opinion, to voice their protest over an unjust situation.\nThe international community has reiterated here its support for efforts made in the context of multilateralism, an instrument of modern international law and practice, which seeks to build and guarantee a civilized way of life of benefit to all the peoples on earth.\nHowever, some Member States appear to be vacillating over honouring their commitments. Delay in the payment of contributions, as a means of exerting pressure and not because of economic difficulties, represents a serious threat to the United Nations. I therefore reiterate the Bolivian Government's full support for the United Nations system, including all its agencies and bodies. On this basis, Bolivia will continue to co-operate in the further democratisation of the United Nations bodies and will insist on just and equitable geographic representation, free from any vestiges of feudalism.\nAnother threat to the normal functioning of the United Nations system is the disregard for commitments made with regard to it.\nThe public conduct of Governments comes under the spotlight when it harms or violates positive multilateral laws of which States are the substantive beneficiaries, as in the recent case of an unspeakable incident provoked by the Government of Chile, when it gave offence to a high official of the Bolivian State. In a politically and ideologically motivated repressive action, the Government of Chile in whose territory the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) has its seat, denied the Bolivian Vice-Minister of Social Defence and head of the Bolivian delegation an entry visa he required to participate in the first Latin American meeting of heads of national drug law enforcement agencies, which is being held this week at the ECLAC headquarters,\nThat reactionary police action, which fully reveals the morality of that Government, characterized by ostentatious display of power, was an attempt to prevent the participation of a Bolivian representative in a multilateral meeting - a representative who has always been involved in the struggle for democracy and social justice. I thank the office of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Executive Secretary of ECLAC for successfully demanding that the Government of Chile meet its international obligations by granting the visa.\nBecause of that incident, together with many other acts that, have interfered with ECLAC's work since September 1973, Bolivia will take steps within the competent United Nations bodies to have the Commission's headquarters moved. The issues on the agenda of this memorable session deal with problems of concern to all mankind. We should try not to discuss modalities, points of view or interpretations of crises and their diverse forms but to concentrate on real substance; the question of freedom or irrational force. We must be prepared to identify the opponents of freedom, with the aim of uniting the majority of nations to preserve and strengthen it- For that, it is essential to give priority to spiritual values, which in some tragic circumstances ate ignored or treated as being of secondary importance.\nPerfecting the social order consists in combining force and the law. However,\nit is essential that force be directed by the law otherwise, at dramatic moments in the life of States unilateral arguments are advanced, authoritarian power is exercised and fratricidal violence occurs, reducing to mere chimeras the universal laws and morals of peace and interdependence.\nThis year's session of the General Assembly coincides with the anniversaries of two events which, both instructively and controversially, have contributed to the development of human society. I refer to the 200th anniversary of the legal adoption of the Constitution of the United States, a document whose ideas have borne much fruit elsewhere in the political development of the world, particularly among those of us whose public institutions are rooted in democracy/ freedom of the individual and the independence of States. This year also marks the 70th anniversary of the Russian revolution, a historic milestone indispensable to an understanding of the social changes of the 20th century which have led to the overcoming of those excessive individualistic injustices that obstructed the integral development of the economic expectations of our societies.\nThe lessons of both those events/ and both approaches to supporting the development of the human being, together with other products of the human spirit aimed at reconciliation, must converge towards a synthesis of peace, freedom and economic justice and love and understanding between individuals and nations. In that way the 21st century will combine the light of individual freedom with social security and international justice, to turn the planet into one world/ where the State and the free marketplace of ideas, services and goods will once and for all put an end to violence, tyranny and the dogmatism of the ideologies of hatred/ and where love and peace will prevail among all God's creatures, including all humanity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe current session of the General Assembly is taking place two years after our commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, and at a time when the international community continues to face many complex problems, that are the logical consequence of the overlapping of interests in the various issues we must consider in order to realize the principles and provisions of the United Nations Charter.\nI wish to express our satisfaction at the outstanding election of Ambassador Florin to guide the work of the General Assembly at its forty\u2014second session; we congratulate him warmly. We are certain that his great talent and ability, together with his country's traditions of freedom and co-operation, will help ensure the success of our work.\nWe wish also to convey our congratulations to the other Assembly officers; we hope that their experience and concern will help improve the decisions and resolutions the Assembly is to adopt. I assure them of my delegation's willingness to co-operate fully in the task of furthering our work and achieving tangible results. We appreciate also the intensive work carried out by the President of the Assembly at its forty-first session. His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasneed Choudhury, who, along with all the other officers of the Assembly at that session, earned the respect and admiration of everyone because of their sense of responsibility and dedication.\t\nThe number of items on the agenda of this session; the complexity of some of the questions we must deal with? the exacerbation of, or the stagnation in the search for solutions to, some problems whose solution is not merely necessary but imperative - all attest to the need to appeal to the conscience of mankind. So, far from limiting our work to well-intentioned decisions and resolutions, we must move from the bureaucratic phase to the phase of concrete action in conformity with the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations.\nIn nature, the process of evolution involves a certain differentiation depending on the phase in question. If all countries lived in peace and harmony with the same access to development opportunities; if professions of mutual respect lived up to the principle of the sovereign equality of States; if non-interference in the internal affairs of States, the right of every people to choose the form of government most suited to its national interests and other principles were truly reflected in international relations and in peaceful coexistence; if certain States did not exploit their advantageous position compared with other States to place conditions on assistance that might be used for those in need - then we might be able to realize the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations in word and indeed. But an objective assessment of the varied interests that generate the problems facing countries will explain the true situation, and we must strive to bring that situation into conformity with the law. \nI wish at this stage to convey our warm congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, on the efficient and outstanding manner in which he carries out his great responsibilities on behalf of peace and understanding among peoples. His brilliant career of commitment to the highest guarantees the Organization a promising future.\nThe Secretary-General's extensive report on the work of the Organization sets forth the grave problems of concern to the international community at present. When millions of human beings still struggle to survive and overcome the effects of hunger, misery, poverty, endemic disease, and so forth - in a word, when some are s ill struggling to survive by overcoming the most basic problems of underdevelopment - others more fortunate are worsening the lot of those struggling f r survival by using their surpluses to do things without which the world might be a more peaceful, harmonious and secure place. Equatorial Guinea cannot conceive of the world without this great Organization, the United Nations. Serious problems detract from its credibility and effectiveness, and, if we interpret current phenomena correctly, they are the result of the risks the international community runs when an Organization such as this is undermined, neutralized or immobilized. Here, the will of Members States, large and small, and their ability to settle disputes are being put to the test.\nIn times of tension and crisis, it is necessary to speak unambiguously, dispassionately and objectively; this will inevitably lead us to the conclusion that things cannot continue as they are and that the community of nations must adopt resolute and constructive attitudes in order to give a new direction to international life, one that can be translated into political evolution, economic and social progress and equal opportunities. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea calls for innovation in international life and in inter-State relations, innovation that can resolve the great paradox of the world in which we live; this is an era of contradictions, a time of unprecedented scientific and technological progress, but a time when there is little will to turn it to the benefit of mankind or to satisfy the fundamental desire for the peace, justice and dignity that are among the essential elements of the human condition.\nIt cannot be denied that at its past session the United Nations played a positive role in helping to solve the problems of concern to the international community. In spite of different political orientations and economic systems the interdependence of the world has led various countries to begin to deal by consensus with questions of common interest. Fortunately, some countries, through dialogue, have set an example by settling their disputes by means of peaceful negotiations.\nAs a third-world country the Republic of Equatorial Guinea is concerned at the proliferation of conventional weapons, which unjustifiably diverts resources for the development of peoples, lessening their possibilities of living a life in dignity in keeping with their right to social and economic well-being.\nIn their ongoing negotiations the super-Powers must seek to conclude agreements and to adopt measures aimed at achieving arms limitation. They must seek to achieve that goal not only in order to devote more resources to development but also to put an end to the enormous profits being earned by arms dealers, who do not hesitate to provoke conflicts and disputes between nations and peoples.\nThe military budgets in every country ace steadily growing, in some of them in order to strengthen their domination and hegemony and in others merely in order to survive. However, the ideals of freedom, human rights, healthy coexistence and so on can be implanted and take root in peoples if they are accompanied by appropriate assistance to reduce the trade imbalance that exists between countries, some of which grow wealthier by the day through the impoverishment of others.\nThe continuing arms race accentuates the threat of conflagration, which would, in the worst of cases, lead to nuclear confrontation with disastrous consequences for mankind. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their possession and use, should be limited in so far as possible and they should, in the best of cases, be completely eliminated and the relevant resources used to improve the social conditions of the most underprivileged. The constant insecurity the world is experiencing at the present time should be the subject of profound reflection in which the great Powers, because of the role they are called upon to play at this time, have a special responsibility.\nThe persistence of many hotbeds of tension in various parts of the world is a great concern to the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. It advocates dialogue as the best way to settle differences.\nIn Africa, the border disputes that are setting Libya and Chad against each other have caused great human and material losses, and we appeal to the conscience of the leaders of both countries and those supporting them to impose a cease-fire and to enter into peaceful negotiations leading to respect by each party of the borders inherited from the colonial period, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity and of the United Nations.\nIt is inconceivable that, given the world's current state of development, there should still exist a political regime as arrogant as the one holding sway in South Africa. The people of South Africa are living in their own land without the slightest possibility of being able to enjoy the most fundamental human rights. The South African regime is illegally keeping the Territory of Namibia in a colonial status, despite the relevant resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. The independent States of southern Africa live under the constant threat of destabilization and South Africa's constant violation of their sovereignty.\nUnless all States Members of the United Nations take appropriate measures to exert their influence to put an end to the heinous regime of apartheid once and for all, to gain respect for the human rights of the suffering South Africans and for the rights and sovereignty of all the countries of the region, to ensure that South African abandons its illegal occupation of Namibia and that the people of that Territory are able to enjoy their inalienable right to freedom and independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) , peace and stability will still be far from being achieved in that region.\nThe intransigence of the minority apartheid regime of South Africa not only poses a threat to peace and stability in that important area of the African continent; its persistence, which creates such violence and suffering, could also unleash irreparable disaster for the entire world. For at the current level of development it represents an affront to mankind and an unspeakable attitude in that prestigious countries with special responsibilities for ensuring respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter, out of economic, strategic or other interests, are supporting the continuation of a regime which, by its very nature, must inevitably disappear.\nIn Western Sahara the population has been afflicted with great human and material losses in recent years. We appreciate the commendable efforts made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and by the Organization of African Unity (OAU); we support the relevant resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations that would enable the Sahraoui people to exercise their right to self-determination. We support the efforts being made in Central America by the leaders of the region to achieve peace and stability there through peaceful means and dialogue. The various initiatives that have recently led to the agreements reached at the summit known as Esquipulas TI, Guatemala, deserve the fullest support and respect. We are sure that their implementation will enable all the countries of the region to live in harmony, that it will strengthen the spirit of solidarity, which is so necessary, and that the respective peoples will be led by regimes that are more interested in their national and political purposes.\nWe trust that reason and the path of dialogue will prevail in solving the dispute over Argentina's claim to sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. A solution to the question would not only be welcomed by the international community, but would enhance the prestige and authority of those who have to decide these matters between the parties in conflict.\nTension continues in South-East Asia, particularly over the situation in Kampuchea. It is vital that there be a comprehensive political solution, taking into account the great interest of the countries of the region in economic development, reconstruction and peace. The Kampucheans should be able to enjoy the fruits of their own land, benefiting from what nature has given them, without foreign interference.\nThe stagnation in the talks aimed at reducing tension in the Korean peninsula is prejudicing the encouraging atmosphere created when contacts between representatives of North Korea and South Korea gave reason for hope with regard to proposals for the peaceful reunification of the Korean people. The division imposed on the Korean people requires that the leaders of both Governments make efforts to ensure that their proposals for talks be more pragmatic and flexible. That would increase their credibility within the international community, instead of the proposals seeming to be a covert expression of the defence of opposing, foreign interests, which do not take account of the aspirations of the Korean people.\nWe support the principle of the peaceful reunification of Korea, and are confident that when it occurs the international community will welcome its admission to, and participation in, the entire United Nations system.\nIn Afghanistan the people have been suffering for eight long years the effects of a war that should be over by now. The talks on solving the conflict should lead not only to the return of the refugees but also to the participation of all Afghans in the country's political affairs, which in turn demands a wide-ranging reconciliation, without foreign pressure or intervention. Prolongation of the current situation would increase the social, political and economic problems, which have become unbearable for the people concerned. It is therefore necessary to resolve the conflict once and for all in a such way that all parties can be certain there will be an independent, sovereign Afghanistan.\nIn the Middle East the Arab-Israeli conflict has claimed so many victims and caused so much material damage that its continuation is harmful to the aspirations of the peoples of the region. Only a comprehensive solution leading to the establishment of a just and lasting peace satisfactory to all the parties concerned will do. Equatorial Guinea believes that a military solution would give no guarantee of peace and stability in the region. Accordingly, the conflict can be settled only through negotiations, taking into account the rights of all the peoples of the region, including the Palestinians, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nThe fratricidal war between Iraq and Iran has been going on for eight long years, causing more than a million casualties and  totally illogical. The persistence of the conflict and the dimensions to which it has grown endanger the region's peace and stability, and it is becoming an international problem. The adoption of stubborn attitudes can in no way solve differences; rather, it exacerbates them. We therefore appeal to the conscience and reason of the leaders of the two countries to impose a cease-fire and pave the way for negotiations through dialogue.\nThe world's economy is today passing through a difficult period, as we know not only from a wide variety of facts and figures, but from the situation as we experience it. It has a particularly severe impact on the less developed countries. With few exceptions, the countries deeply in debt are continuing to record very slow growth. Commodity prices are dropping at a dizzy pace, and there is still no sign of any general improvement coming in the immediate future. However, the national income of the developed countries has increased, owing to the improvement in their terms of trade.\nThe countries less affected by changes in international markets are those with large, diversified economies. They do not include the African countries, whose economic situation is critical. The opening up to the international economy of the African States, which have an un diversified system, has brought us more disadvantages than benefits, particularly in recent years, when the prices of the basic commodities on which our economies largely depend have dropped sharply.\nAlthough the authorities in, and leaders of, the world's economic and financial Powers say that the economic situation of Africa south of the Sahara gives cause for concern, and that it is absolutely necessary to increase the volume of real resources to assist those African countries, \u03a4 am sorry to have to say that slowness and hesitation have characterized the response of the donors and creditors on how to solve the problem of the continent's economy recovery. Many African countries have implemented readjustment measures, agreeing to huge, far-reaching sacrifices. However, the international community's reaction has so far been timid.\nIf our economies are to overcome the difficult situation in which they now find themselves, the most important economies must adopt a more positive position. If the problems of the indebtedness of the majority of developing countries are to be solved, the international community must study more innovative solutions, including the conversion of part of the debt into grants and long-term rescheduling of the debt on less onerous conditions. Such solutions should in no way reduce the trend towards concessions for the low-income countries, including those that are implementing structural adjustment programmes. It is essential that multilateral development institutions increase their support. The declaration adopted by consensus at the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (\u00dcNC\u00cfAD), concerning trade, indebtedness and commodities, could, if implemented, guarantee a new era of co-operation between the developed and the developing countries. The fact that the various groups and trends represented at the Conference reached a consensus is a sign that there was positive and pragmatic multilateral economic co-operation, despite the negative forecasts that had been made previously.\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea, in accordance with resolution 34/123, adopted by the General Assembly on 14 December 1979, undertook, with the United Nations system, a programme of special economic assistance. Various friendly countries and international organizations and institutions gave their support in the implementation of that programme. Since that time, the Government has drawn up a broad programme which includes the rehabilitation of the economic and administrative infrastructure, the reactivation of productive activities, the organization of State institutions, and a process of democratisation within the framework of a State based on law, where respect for the traditional values of the people must be harmonized with the protection and guaranteeing of fundamental human rights, in accordance with the modern concept thereof.\nIt is correct to state that my country has effected positive organizational changes and has put into practice a public administration and a State organization which include institutions that make it possible to carry out the tasks with a clear separation among the three branches of power of the State. There has been considerable progress in regard to human rights, and Equatorial Guinea is a party to the main international instruments governing human rights.\nThere has been a prolonged crisis in Equatorial Guinea's economy because of the destruction of its productive capacity; the external trade and financing conditions have made it impossible for us to overcome that crisis. National and international efforts have been made to alleviate the social and economic situation, and it has been possible to restore peace and the normal functioning of our society, to rebuild international relations and a system of external co-operation and assistance, and to rehabilitate and put into operation a new political and constitutional order-\nHowever, similar results have not been achieved in the economic sphere. There is an obvious contradiction between, on the one hand, the position of certain countries, organizations and international institutions that impose a scheme or conditionality on a country with the special features of Equatorial Guinea without giving due consideration to its social, political and institutional priorities and, on the other hand, the broader and more effective spirit of international assistance that has been advocated by the political and financial authorities of the world Powers.\nWe appeal to the United Nations to do what it has done in similar circumstances - that is, in this situation of stagnation to make its own judgement of Equatorial Guinea's conditions and policies and to propose acceptable alternatives in order to overcome the impasse with donors, so that the necessary measures may be taken to ensure that the development strategy drawn up by the Government for the Round-Table Conference can be submitted without delay to the donor countries and organizations and can have the greatest chance of success.\n"

I take this opportunity to put on record our appreciation of the strenuous efforts exerted by the Secretary-General and his assistants to strengthen the role f the United Nations in safeguarding and promoting international peace and security and creating better conditions for co-operation among States.\nThe world is now moving towards an era of co-operation and d\u00e9tente, following period of tension and confrontation, and a wave of optimism therefore prevails on the international scene. While we join the international community in welcoming his trend, we sincerely hope that it will lead to the achievement of just solutions to issues afflicting some of the world's peoples, foremost among which are the usurpation of peoples' rights, racial discrimination, occupation, foreign hegemony, economic exploitation and the ever-widening gap between developed and developing countries.\nThe principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, the aim of which is to create a human society in which justice and security reign, ushered in new hope for a better future for mankind. It has been impossible, however, totally to fulfil those noble principles owing to the escalation of aggressive tendencies, the use or the threat of the use of force in international relations and the suppression of the will of peoples with a view to dominating them and their potential.\nIn the international domain, the arms race poses the gravest dangers to humanity. Foremost among those dangers is the possibility of a nuclear world war, whether triggered by accident or by a sense of superiority. We therefore regard every effort to reduce nuclear weapons with a view to eliminating them completely an important factor that would help to strengthen international peace and security. Accordingly, we support the agreement in principle between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America with respect to the intermediate-range nuclear forces and tactical weapons. We consider it to be a positive step that could have considerable significance if it were followed by wider steps that would eliminate strategic nuclear weapons and lead to comprehensive and complete nuclear disarmament.\nIsrael's possession and development of nuclear weapons and its participation in the \\\"star wars\\\" programme pose a direct and constant threat to security in the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. It has become imperative to declare the Middle East region a nuclear-free zone in order to ensure peace and security there. The obstacle to the attainment of that objective is Israel's constant refusal to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to place its nuclear installations under international control, as well as its rejection of the system of international safeguards.\nThe Syrian Arab Republic is well aware of the connection between disarmament and development. It is axiomatic that the world cannot continue to incur the enormous costs of the arms race while simultaneously investing, in an adequate manner, the necessary funds in programmes of economic and social development. Therefore, my country would support any agreement by the international community to embark on an ambitious disarmament programme that would release sufficient funds for investment in programmes of economic and social development in the world, particularly in the developing countries. Furthermore, Syria shares the conviction that the United Nations has a role to play in promoting disarmament and development, and hence in creating a general feeling of collective security. \nWe support the initiative of the group of socialist countries calling for the establishment of a comprehensive system of international security. Such a system would be based on strengthening the role of the United Nations in the adoption of practical measures that would guarantee compliance with the provisions of the Charter and ensure their implementation. That is essential to respect for the sovereignty of States, their national independence and their territorial integrity and to the non-use of force in relations among States, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the right of all peoples to self-determination, the elimination of colonialism, racism, racial discrimination, apartheid and foreign occupation and domination.\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict remains one of the most explosive regional conflicts and the farthest away from a just and lasting solution, despite the overall favourable international climate and the world-wide support for the convening of the International Conference under the auspices of the United Nations. That should not seem strange, since other regional conflicts, regardless of their intensity and destructiveness, can come to an end and just, realistic solutions can be found to them so long as neither of the parties claims to have God-given territories and rights - as is alleged by Israel.\nBy retaining the occupied Arab territories and annexing some of them, and by building settlements there, Israel in no way adheres to the principles of international law or of the United Nations Charter. Instead, it acts - as is evident from the overall attitudes of its successive leaders - on the basis of metaphysical convictions and legendary tales backed by extremely reactionary and fundamentalist concepts.\nIt is naive to believe that the often-spoken-of differences among the rulers in Tel Aviv are differences between those who accept giving up the occupied Arab territories and those who refuse to do so. Rather/ the difference is between, on the one hand, those who want to extract a formal Arab signature on a document relinquishing most of the occupied Arab territories as well as usurped Palestinian rights and, on the other, those who do not even admit the existence of occupied Arab lands and usurped Palestinian rights. In fact, there is no substantial difference among all the rulers in Tel Aviv in regard to maintaining Israel's voracious appetite for devouring Arab lands and building more settlements thereon. The ultimate objective of the rulers in Tel Aviv is to establish Greater Israel and impose its undisputed hegemony over the countries and peoples of the region. \nIt is our conviction that the Israeli attitude to the international conference on peace in the Middle East should be interpreted only in the light of those facts. We ought to proceed sincerely from an objective assessment of Israeli intentions and not from illusions or the attempts of some to justify their support for or dealings with Israel. The international community can thus easily realize why Israel's rulers reject a genuine International conference and why the Israeli faction that accepts the idea of an international conference stipulates that it should be a mere umbrella for direct bilateral negotiations and have no authority whatsoever. The Tel Aviv rulers are all agreed on not establishing a genuine, just peace in the region.\nIsrael's rejection of peace based on justice is inevitably a source of constant concern to the entire world, no matter how calm conditions may appear on the surface. It must also be a source of true concern also to the Israelis themselves, because violence generates violence, and Israel's extremist doctrine in fighting and attempting to humiliate the Arabs will in turn give rise to more violence and extremism. Israel's bitter experience during its invasion of Lebanon still lives in the memory and will remain an irksome nightmare for the Israelis for many years to come.\nIsrael will never enjoy peace in our region, irrespective of its military might, so long as it continues to occupy any part of the Arab lands. Israel cannot for ever be protected by the unlimited support of the United States and the strategic alliance between them. Israel's imposition of its peace terms on Egypt did not and will not achieve true peace between Israel and the brother people of Egypt, no matter how hard the rulers in Cairo and Tel Aviv try to obscure these facts and mislead world public opinion. \nSyria believes that the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace depends on the total withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories and on guarantees of the national rights of the Palestinian people within the framework of an international peace conference, to be held under United Nations auspices, provided that the conference is genuine and has authority.\nThe economic and social institutions of our sister country, Lebanon, have suffered grave disruptions. The people of Lebanon have suffered greatly from a devastating civil War and the brutal Israeli invasion, both of which brought tremendous destruction of property, acts of terrorism and the forcible evacuation of citizens.\nThere is no question but that many have lost confidence in the Lebanese regime as a result of the assassination last June of Lebanon's Prime Minister,\nRash id Karami, a man who stood for dialogue and national reconciliation, and the failure so far to find the killers and those who backed them. It is regrettable that the Lebanese regime has not tried, as it should have, to benefit from Syria's great help and immense sacrifices, whose purpose was to save Lebanon from fighting and chaos and place it again on the path of dialogue and national reconciliation. Nevertheless, Syria - which is bound to Lebanon by family ties, a shared destiny security, history and common interests - will spare neither toil nor sacrifice to assist our Lebanese brothers in their effort to emerge from this dark tunnel. Moreover, Syria will continue to support the heroic Lebanese resistance until the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and the liberation of the last inch of Lebanese territory.\nThe tense situation in the Gulf region is a cause of grave concern, particularly in the light of the enormous concentration of foreign military fleets. Of particular note is the flocking of the military vessels of Western countries, one after the other, in the wake of the arrival of the United States fleet, after the majority of their Governments had initially voiced reservations about sending them.\nThe Syrian people in particular, and the Arab people in general, have the right to ask whether those huge concentrations of vessels are intended to ensure freedom of international navigation in the waters of the Gulf or are there to secure military bases in the region and restore the policy of spheres of influence, is the purpose of those military concentrations in the Gulf region to prevent the expansion of the war and limit its damage, or is it to embroil the other countries of the region in order to deplete all their resources and distract them from their essential national role of liberating the occupied Arab territories and recovering the usurped rights of the Palestinian Arab people?\nWhile posing those legitimate questions, we reaffirm our support for freedom of international navigation for all in the waters of the Gulf. We reaffirm our denunciation of attempts to expand the war and involve other countries in it and our belief in the importance of good-neighbourly relations and understanding between the Arab States of the Gulf and the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as our demand that all foreign military fleets be withdrawn from the region.\nWe all know that in recent years the international community has devoted a major part of its attention to the phenomenon of terrorism. I have previously stated from this rostrum our views on this subject. In our statement at the last session of the General Assembly we set out our views on terrorism and the distinction between terrorism and the legitimate struggle of peoples for freedom. We also exposed the deliberate attempts to confuse terrorist acts - which are totally rejected and condemned - and the struggle of peoples against foreign occupation, colonialism and racism. We said also that the international community\nis as much the victim of State terrorism as it is of terrorism by individuals. We have called upon the international community through the United Nations to engage in a joint effort to set rules and norms by which to draw a distinction between terrorist acts and the legitimate struggle of peoples for national liberation as provided for in the United Nations Charter and in numerous General Assembly resolutions. Accordingly, we have proposed the convening of an international conference to define terrorism and to differentiate it from the struggle of peoples for national liberation. We appreciate the positive attitude to that initiative adopted by regional and international bodies such as the League of Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement. \nWe are pleased to note that the General Assembly has adopted the Arab position submitted by Syria for the inclusion of a new item on the agenda of this year's session of the Assembly with regard to the convening of an international conference to define terrorism and to set norms and standards to distinguish between terrorism and the struggle of peoples for national liberation. My delegation would be pleased to co-operate with other delegations in preparing a draft resolution on this subject for submission to the General Assembly for debate and adoption.\nThe Group of Non-Aligned Countries, to which my country belongs, was established at the very outset on the concept of persistent work to ensure respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and to observe the application of those principles in dealings among States. On several occasions the Group exerted a constructive effort that had a positive impact on the international scene. We should like, therefore, to express our firm support of the Non-Aligned Movement and of its activities. We fervently call upon all States in the various groups to extend support and encouragement to the Movement, since it has proved on several occasions that it is a positive factor of benefit to the international community as a whole.\nSouthern Africa still suffers from a tragic colonial situation due to the continued occupation of Namibia by the Pretoria regime in violation of United Nations resolutions, in particular Security Council resolution 435 (197\u0398), which includes the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. Also, the Pretoria regime continues to carry out acts of oppression, persecution and killing, and to impose the apartheid regime on the majority of the inhabitants of southern Africa. \nWe should strongly condemn the close collaboration between the regimes of Pretoria and Tel Aviv, which is designed primarily to suppress the will of the Arabs and the Africans and to undermine the aspirations of their peoples. Those two racist regimes should be isolated in the international arena, and an end must be put to their racist and expansionist policies.\nThe international community is duty bound to confront the challenges of the Pretoria regime. Likewise, the Security Council must adopt a resolution imposing on that regime the mandatory and comprehensive sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.\nIn this context we laud the Organization of African Unity and its resolutions and decisions adopted at its successive conferences, the latest of which are the resolutions and the declaration of the twenty-eighth Summit Conference of the Organization of African Unity, held in Addis Ababa, which reaffirmed the practical measures to be taken by States in various fields in order to isolate and eventually eliminate the apartheid regime.\nThe question of Cyprus remains a source of concern to the Mediterranean countries. Any solution to this problem should be based on the implementation of all relevant United Nations resolutions so as to safeguard the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus. We welcome the idea of convening an international conference on this subject under the auspices of the United Nations.\nWe support the efforts of the Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea to reunite the Korean peninsula by peaceful means and to achieve the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea. We also support its call to transform the Korean peninsula into a zone of peace free from military bases and nuclear weapons.\t.\nWith respect to Afghanistan, we support the independence, sovereignty and non-alignment of that friendly country. We hope that the efforts exerted to solve the difficulties existing between Afghanistan and its neighbours, to which we are linked with close historical ties, will be successful. Likewise, we welcome the cease\u2014fire declared by the Afghan Government, as well as its initiative to achieve national reconciliation. We also commend the praiseworthy efforts of the representative of the Secretary-General with respect to the Afghan question, and we hope to see a quick solution to the problem.\nWe express our grave concern over the external pressures exerted upon Nicaragua and the interference in its domestic affairs. We regard as positive the measures agreed upon by the States of Central America in the capital of Guatemala on 7 August 1987 concerning the establishment of a firm and durable peace in Central America, measures which could contribute to enhancing the efforts of the States of the region to safeguard their independence and sovereignty. On this occasion, we commend the efforts exerted in this regard by the Contadora Group and the Latin American Support Group.\nThe United Nations General Assembly exerted considerable effort in 1974 with respect to the adoption of a resolution on the establishment of the new international economic order. That order sets forth the structural changes as a policy based primarily on the concept of interdependence among the peoples of the world, rich and poor, to realize international security and global welfare. However, all of us know that this new international economic order has not been implemented because of the lack of political will on the part of most of the developed countries. Recommendations were adopted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development aimed at achieving some structural changes in the system of international economic relations, in general, and in trade and financial relations, in particular. Those recommendations, however, were not given due attention by the group of rich countries, while other recommendations that were translated into resolutions have not been implemented.\n The main cause of this painful state of affairs in international economic relations lies in the fact that the group of rich countries, while advocating the concept of interdependence among all nations, in practice do not act upon it. Their primary concern is rather to realize the maximum and most expedient profits, which is the extreme opposite of the concept of interdependence among peoples.\nIt is strange that this policy, characterized by greed and short-sightedness, often backfires against the interests of the group of rich countries themselves, sometimes leading to controversies, protectionist measures and trade wars among them. We have already seen this take place on many occasions. The major losers in this unjust situation, however, are the developing countries, which still suffer from the deterioration of the prices of their raw materials and from the enormous burden they shoulder due to their international indebtedness, as well as from the protectionist measures imposed by the developed countries on their exports. \nSufficient proof of this grave imbalance in current international economic relations is the fact that the developed countries control the fixing of prices of raw materials produced by the developing countries according to their own interests. At the same time, they are free to fix the prices of their manufactured goods according to their own interests too. As a result, unequal and unfair trade exchange relations ensue, to the detriment of the developing countries.\nThe peoples of the world always look to the United Nations full of hope that the international Organization will meet its commitment towards issues of justice, peace and development. The United Nations role is highly significant and will have a profound effect if efforts are directed to the achievement of objective, non-selective solutions for chronic conflicts, foremost among which is the Arab-Israeli conflict, which poses a continuous and far-reaching threat to peace.\nSyria affirms its continued commitment to support and promote the role of the United Nations as a collective world instrument for fulfilment of the hopes pinned on it.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe Soviet delegation has instructed me Sir, to congratulate you on your election to the honourable post of President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\nOne of the rules of procedure of this Organization reserves a minute for prayer or meditation. Each session of the United Nations General Assembly is an occasion for reflection on the future of the world. Today the world is on the threshold of great changes and our thoughts are about that. For the first time in history, the idea of nuclear disarmament is close to the beginning of fulfilment. It is not a new idea. What is new is that this is proving to be possible. Only yesterday, all we could see ahead of us was a blank wall: today we can see far ahead.\nTwo thousand warheads are but a small part of nuclear arsenals, but that is a big enough part forbids disappearance to give to the world a new vision. The agreement on these weapons is only a small part of what has happened. Something much more important has taken place; the Soviet Union and the United states have finally spoken together the first word in a nuclear-free vocabulary. When that word becomes deed, the world will also gain new knowledge. It will become convinced that nuclear weapons and security are not synonymous and that security becomes stronger when those weapons disappear.\nFor the present, that principle is being established in a specific case, but it is already being established in practice. The whole question now is whether we shall be able, proceeding from the same logical premise, to abandon the entire nuclear arsenal rather than just a part of it, to scrap all weapons of mass destruction.\nThe Soviet Union is convinced that we shall be able to do so. The launching pad is small but it provides a boost to a great undertaking. The recent agreement may be followed by an accord on the reduction by as much as one half of strategic weapons - provided, of course, that the Treaty limiting anti-ballistic missile system is preserved.\nToday there is an increasingly realistic prospect of a convention on the prohibition and complete destruction of chemical weapons. We can expect a productive development of the parallel process of reduction of conventional weapons based on the concept of sufficiency. There is a possibility of making headway because we have bold ideas and willingness to remove the remaining obstacles.\nAn affirmative answer to the question of whether it is possible to scrap nuclear arsenals will become a reality if the international community once again helps us.\nThere is no need to compete here for the palm of victory, which does not go well with the olive branch of peace. I could describe how the Soviet Union has worked towards the global double zero, but let others claim the credit if they wish. For that matter, if we have to compete in something it should be only in nuclear disarmament. What is important for us is that what was sought has now been achieved and the outcome is not at variance with the will of the majority.\nWe are moved by the enthusiasm with which the world has welcomed the agreement. It convinces us once again that we are on the right track. Listening to the voices of approval and solidarity, which drown the morose and solitary voice of the nuclear profiteers, your Soviet colleague, without sharing the euphoria and yet without curbing the optimism  keenly feel that today all of us here are truly United nations - United not merely by formal membership in this Organization but by a common destiny and a shared objective. We thank you for this wonderful feeling. It should be treasured and carried further. Thank you for the atmosphere of unity of thought, co-operation and support which alone could have produced an agreement.\nIn this sense the agreement is yours. And the fact that it belongs to everyone is, as we see it, the best guarantee of its implementation.\n\\\"We were born to live together. And our community is like an arch which holds up precisely because Its stones prevent each other from falling ...\\\" One is amazed by the ability of human thought to establish the supreme ethical law for all times. \\\"We were born to live together\\\", so wrote Seneca to Lucillius many years ago in his Epistles, but it is only today that this idea is being understood as the imperative of our time.\nToday, Lenin's Decree of Peace is perceived as a message of supreme morality addressed to our time. The repudiation of secret treaties, open and public conduct of International affairs, the immediate withdrawal from the war and the rejection of War as a method of resolving conflicts reflected, even as far back as 1917, a common need, which has now become the will of the entire International community.\nA long and difficult road must be traversed for human thought to become action, but it does happen sooner or later. When, in Washington, we were discussing the techniques of the destruction of nuclear warheads we were suddenly struck by the fact that only a year ago this had seemed something well beyond our grasp. Our American partners can confirm this. It is hard to find words to express this. Let us just say that the past gives a powerful impetus to the present, and the present gives guarantees to the future.\n\\\"The reality and the guarantees of a secure world\\\" is the title of Mikhail Gorbachev's article published before this session began, and it conveys the gist of our thinking today.\nA secure world is possible. It Is possible because anything else is too dangerous. The possibility of a secure world is commensurate with the need for it This is the reality. As for guarantees, we see them in a comprehensive system of security. It is the natural task of the United Nations to give inspiration to and take the lead in building such a system.\nThis, reduced to a concise formula, is the logic of that article, which develops the doctrine of a secure world. It stems from the history of our country and is the fruit of political thinking that honestly analyses the entire preceding period.\nIn this context I would venture to remind the Assembly that its forty-second session coincides with the eve of the seventieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. This is our celebration and we are not imposing it on anyone. The feelings aroused by the birthday of our State are ours. Nevertheless, I would venture to share with representatives my thoughts on some of the international implications of that date.\nI do not think that it can be disputed that the October Revolution was one of the major events of this century and has had a tremendous impact on the destinies of peoples, not only those of the former Russian Empire. We think that the process of renovation which is under way in our country is more than just a strictly domestic affair of the Soviet Union, It is impossible to describe as purely the concern of the Soviet Union its desire to do away with one of the products of the cold war, which is the splitting of the world into hostile alliances.\nAll this, naturally, is also part of the objectives of perestroika - our process of change - while glasnost - openness - and dialogue are, as logically, its instruments, in both domestic and foreign policies. Between these two there exists a direct and open relationship and one cannot be implemented without the other. This, and this alone, allows me, when speaking about the seventieth anniversary of our revolution, to invite you all to take thought together.\nIf we have a concept of a world revolution, which is most closely linked with the process of revolutionary change in our country, we make no secret of it. It is this: organizing the entire human community on the basis of recognizing peace as the supreme value of existence, human life, freedom and dignity as a general yardstick, and peaceful coexistence as a universal principle of relations among States. This concept, proclaimed in the Political Report to the 27th Congress of our Communist Party, has been substantiated by a series of practical steps taken by the Soviet Union,\nPerestroika has also heralded major changes in international affairs. It should not be obstructed. But, of course, unlike the position in 1917 or 1918, in 1987 no external action could halt our revolution. Today we live in different times, and it is a different country. And that could be one of the greatest achievements of the October Revolution. The price of this was enormous. It was set by the foreign intervention and the civil war; the ruined economy and the economic blockade; terror and the attempts to subvert the foundations of our multinational State; Nazi aggression and the cold war, which was imposed on us; nuclear blackmail and constant attempts at political diktat. Not a single day passed without our having to pay the highest price.\nUnlike many other revolutions, the October Revolution was almost bloodless. Unlike many others, its architects never Intended to build their temple on blood; they never thought, as had many before them, that cruelty, violence and fear were the best glue for cementing their ideal.\nIt was the policies of conspiracy, terror and intervention against Soviet Russia that made it shut and lock its doors and cut itself off from a hostile world. \n\nIn order to survive it was necessary to do the maximum within the historically minimum space of time. A chronic lack of time and unending pressure on all fronts also helped create the conditions which resulted in innocent victims and irreparable losses. We are saying this for all to hear: there is not and there cannot be any justification for that. We do more than just say it. As heirs to both victories and defeats, achievements and mistakes, we are doing our utmost to consolidate the victories and to prevent even the slightest possibility of the errors being repeated In either domestic or in foreign policies. \nThis is a distinctive feature of our perestroika, its dominant trend, any indicator of the vigour and health of our society, a guarantee of Its future, of its profound internal democratism, openness and integrity. And there is no need to engage in linguistic research to try to provide listeners with an English equivalent of the word glasnost. One might go astray in a foreign language, as has indeed already happened with the same speaker, who claimed that there is no word meaning \\\"freedom\\\" in the Russian language. It is generally dangerous to play with words in this forum in which by no means everyone is ready to applaud insults summarily flung at entire countries and peoples. Freedom does indeed serve peace - but it is not the freedom that is interpreted as licence to interfere in the affairs of others and to finance counter-revolution as a most profitable business.\nAs for our perestroika, no one should be a prey to illusions. We shall not turn aside from the main road or borrow from others their norms and rules of democracy. We thank them for their advice, but we shall conduct perestroika according to our own design, on our own socialist basis. Allow us to determine for ourselves what the Soviet Union is going to be and that will be what the Soviet people want it to be.\nThose who want to support us will also support the project of rebuilding international relations on a broad democratic basis. They will support the concept of a nuclear-free world and all actions to resolve the knottiest issues of world politics. For here the interests of most members of the community fully coincide.\nThis rostrum is not a pulpit for preaching \\\"free enterprise\\\". This Hall is not a schoolroom or a university auditorium in which one can teach lessons in rhetoric or lecture the international community on the manners of \\\"good political behaviour\\\". it is even less worthy to adopt the tone of pastoral admonition and tell the Organization that \\\"sometimes it has strayed\\\" and \\\"it is time for it to come home\\\". One can say, however, that this rostrum and this Hall are the very place where new political thinking should be expressed.\nHowever much the world is split by confrontation and hatred, it is United in facing the need to preserve itself and to perpetuate mankind.\nProm this objective reality there emerges another guiding light for new political thinking; in our time, the correlation between the national interest and the interest of all mankind has changed. It has changed in the sense that truly national interests cannot be opposed to common interests.\nIf, on the pretext that something is contrary to the interests of national security or to considerations of national prestige, one rejects everything that is born of the political thinking of the systems or governments that one does not like, then, sooner or later, this will boomerang on the genuine national interests of one's own people and State.\nNew political thinking must put an end to that. New political thinking will put an end to it if it is put into action. And there is no doubt that it will be, for action, unity of concept and implementation, of thought and its realization, of word and deed, are crucial conditions for the existence of mankind.\nNew political thinking will inevitably make its way, for it is nourished by some remarkable elements: by the accumulation of progressive political experience  by strictly scientific analysis, evaluation and forecasting of contemporary realities} and, ultimately, by the freedom of new political thinking from national narrow-mindedness that provokes animosity towards countries, groups of countries or social political systems.\nIn this regard, let me say that the policy of hostility towards socialism is now bankrupt, both in theory and in practice. The very fact of the establishment of the United Nations contained the embryo of the new political thinking. Even at that time its principles were embodied in the articles of the United Nations Charter  which is undoubtedly one of the greatest statutory instruments of all time and of all nations.\nThe fact that our Organization has been functioning for over 40 years now is testimony to the triumph of mankind's common interests over narrow-minded nationalism and great-Power attitudes. In fact, all the post-war decades have been nothing but the history of the struggle between outdated political concepts and the new political thinking that was born in the agony of war.\nWhen life on earth depends on one's ability to destroy it 20 times over, there is something wrong either with oneself and one's trust in such a guarantee of life, or with the very idea of deterrence. Most likely, it is both. New political thinking exposes the absurdity of the idea of safeguarding anyone's security with nuclear weapons.\nHowever, a question immediately arises: Is it possible to ensure peace by other methods and, indeed, do such methods exist at all? New political thinking answers: Yes. And here again I should like to focus on a comprehensive system of international security.\nAs emerges clearly from Mikhail Gorbachev's statements, we envision its formation as a multilinear process extending over time and implemented through collective efforts. In essence, its objective is that peace should be ensured exclusively by the United Nations and its Security Council on the basis of strict observance of the principles and provisions of its Charter. I anticipate a question here: If that is your objective, then what is the meaning of your proposal? After all, the Charter of the United Nations already exists and the universal organization for peace is functioning.\nLet me remind the Assembly that the United Nations was established for a world free of nuclear weapons and that its Charter was, naturally, designed to solve the problems of such a world.\nNuclear weapons gave rise to a different reality which, in the final analysis, made it impossible to use the United Nations fully as the principal mechanism for the maintenance of peace and security. It so happened that the nuclear tumour limited the scope of, and the possibilities for applying the Charter. Now the prospect of militarization of outer space threatens to erode its principles even further. There should however be no question of adapting the Charter to the realities of the nuclear and space age or, still less, of wrecking it. The Charter is a great document, which even today contains all the necessary provisions to enable mankind to live and solve its problems without war.\nHowever, even the Charter cannot do the impossible. No organization, no set of rules, no code of behaviour can save the world in the few minutes between the launching of a missile and a nuclear holocaust. If and when the implementation of the \\\"Star Wars\\\" programme begins, the \\\"shagreen leather\\\" of that time interval will shrink even further. And yet that programme has been touted here once again as a way \\\"to ensure a safer world\\\".\nThis is not so. And here I will refer to a person whose statements have been quoted so readily by the President of the United States - even the day before yesterday. That person is academician Andrei Sakharov, who said:\n\\\"My opinion as regards this programme is different from that of the Reagan Administration... it is also wrong to assert that the existence of the SDI programme has made the Soviet Union negotiate on disarmament. To the contrary, the SDI programme impedes the negotiations.\\\"\nIf we are to believe an academician in one area, why should we not believe him in another, in which he is really a qualified expert and a professional?\nLeave the ocean of space to peaceful vessels, so that future generations - our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren - will not have to build space minesweeper s.\nExcluding the nuclear and space component from the security equation is the only path towards real security. We regard a comprehensive system of security as a kind of interim programme for reasserting the role of the United Nations and its Charter as the primary instruments for peace.\nWhat, then, are the practical aspects of a comprehensive system? Throughout the past year the sponsors of the resolution on this question have held consultations with Members of the United Nations and discussed their proposal in international forums. As a result many things have now become clearer, our ideas have become more concrete, and an atmosphere of teamwork has arisen. The system is taking precise shape in all its four aspects: politico-military, economic, environmental and humanitarian.\nIn the politico-military area, it comprises the obligation of Governments not to be the first to use nuclear weapons or any force or threat of force making military doctrines exclusively defensive in nature) making public data regarding defence expenditures and calendars of exercises and manoeuvres) the adoption by all of the principle of non-offensive defence} and instituting a reliable system of verification.\nWe are convinced that a comprehensive system of security will also provide the key to the settlement of situations of regional conflict. That may be one of the roost difficult tasks of today.\nIn this connection I shall venture to make a brief digression to address some ideas presented here the other day. I am referring to the statement made here by the President of the United States the day before yesterday. I am not going to relish engaging in polemics with him. The emotions aroused by the agreement we have reached, ray status as a guest and respect for seniority restrain  e from taking up, point by point, allegations and arguments that are groundless in the extreme. But since the President mentioned the human heart - claiming, as it were, a monopoly on having a heart while denying it to others - I should like to say the following.\nIt is heartless to declare regions and continents zones of special interest for the so-called free world out of which it pumps into its own economy resources belonging to other peoples. It is heartless to recruit and arm mercenaries, to proclaim them freedom fighters, and to pay millions of dollars for the murders committed by them. It is heartless to put into the hands of bandits weapons they use to shoot down civilian aircraft. The human heart is an extremely sensitive organ, and it shudders at such treatment.\nThose who have not suffered have no compassion for anyone, we know what war on our own territory means. Therefore it is not for the sake of rhetorical effect that we declare our support for the efforts of the United Nations.\nIt plays an extremely important peace-making role in Afghanistan, where the mission of the Personal Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General organically combines with the policy of national reconciliation. It is now becoming increasingly clear that the Afghans themselves are able to decide the future of their own country and indeed are doing so. This new encouraging trend is in keeping with our sincere desire to withdraw Soviet forces from Afghanistan as soon as possible, and in this we are meeting with the full understanding of the Afghan leadership.\nIn Central America, the States of the region themselves have made impressive headway towards a long-awaited peace. Their success is shared by members of the Contadora Group and the Support Group and by all Latin American countries.\nDialogue between the countries of Indo-China and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has revealed promising elements. The policy of national reconciliation is also beginning to work in Kampuchea.\nReal possibilities exist for the settlement of the Korean problem. The yearning of the Korean people for an easing of tension in the peninsula and the withdrawal of foreign troops and nuclear weapons cannot but evoke sympathy.\nThe United Nations has a detailed plan for giving effect to the resolution on the granting of independence to the Namibian people. Its implementation would also constitute a major step towards a settlement of the situation in southern Africa. A consensus is emerging in favour of convening a conference on the Middle East problem. In Cyprus, our Organization and its Secretary-General have also been taking vigorous action and refusing to retreat in the face of obstacles.\nHere is our view of the situation in the Persian Gulf. It has become critically dangerous and might get out of control. We are not at all pleased that the development of events - which we warned was quite possible from the very outset - shows that we were right. The greater the military presence, the higher the probability of yet another conflict and the involvement in it of a State not belonging to the region. This is a source of great anxiety to us; it also strengthens our resolve to act in a sober and carefully considered manner and leads us once again to emphasize the question of removing the danger of a massive military presence.\nIn the circumstances, it is extremely important to preserve the unity in the Security Council. That is not an end in itself, but a prerequisite for implementing resolution 598 (1987) . In their individual actions, each member of the Council must abide by the resolution's requirements and not violate them.\nThe safety of navigation in the Gulf can and must be ensured by the entire world community, on whose behalf the United Nations will be acting. If necessary, appropriate and sufficient forces should be made effectively available to it, and the Soviet Union would agree to such a decision.\nIt is necessary to secure, concurrently and immediately, a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and to work for the fulfilment of the Secretary-General's mission with respect to an impartial body to investigate the question of responsibility for the conflict. The Security Council should receive a report within a clearly established time-frame. This would also make it possible painlessly to withdraw foreign naval and other armed forces from the Persian Gulf.\nIt is very important now, in our view, to keep our composure and render every assistance to the Secretary-General and the Security Council.\nIn the economic field, a comprehensive system of security seeks to promote co-operation that would be free of confrontation and would cover the entire system of co-ordinates of international economic relations. A failure to resolve issues in this area is fraught with an explosive potential which, if detonated, would spell catastrophe for mankind. The picture of prosperity painted here the day before yesterday fades in the harsh light of reality, it is hard to imagine a \\\"march of democracy\\\" in the developing countries saddled as they are with a trillion-dollar debt. It is Impossible to talk seriously of equal opportunities when a new, technological, variety of colonialism is at work.\nIt is imperative to act.\nWe believe that the international community could reach agreement to reduce interest payments on bank credits, institute further benefits for the least developed countries, limit the annual debt-service payments of each developing country to a fixed portion of its annual export earnings, accept export products of debtor nations as payment for their debts and remove protectionist barriers to their imports, and refrain from charging additional interest for loan-payment rescheduling and debt refinancing.\nThese, of course, are only suggestions for discussion, but even now consideration could be given to devising a programme of Immediate action to ease the debt burden of the developing world.\nOver the long term it is also necessary to restructure the entire international monetary system. And, of course, nothing would be more conducive to the economic development of nations than the most far-reaching programme of disarmament.\nWe are familiar also with a different viewpoint which does not acknowledge the relationship between disarmament and development. There are some who explain poverty by the inability of people to work and build their own lives. This is but another form of outright racism. No people is without talent or incapable of creating material and spiritual wealth. It is just a matter of different conditions that either help a people to realize its potential or thwart its efforts to do so. The elimination of economic discrimination creates favourable conditions for people to prosper economically and spiritually.\nThe environmental aspect of the proposed concept reflects the evolution of thinking about the relationship between man and nature. The achievement of mankind's environmental security is as imperative as the threat of an ecological disaster facing it is real. Today we must realize that the protection of the environment must be ensured on a world-wide basis. Confrontation narrows the scope for concerted action, while co-operation can expand it. Our concept provides for a set of measures in this area.\nThe human dimension is the primary yardstick for a comprehensive system of security. Nations can and must co-operate in establishing the best international conditions for safeguarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual everywhere, democratising internal conditions and building trust and harmony on that basis.\nWe should together begin to devise a broad range of practical steps in the humanitarian area, promote co-operation in eradicating apartheid, racism, chauvinism, nationalism and discrimination on those bases, deal jointly with the problems of national minorities and refugees, and safeguard the rights of emigrants.\nWe submit that for States and nations trust begins at home and that to a large extent it is based on the unity of words and deeds and in complete accord between political declarations and actual positions. Our domestic and foreign policy is and will continue to be guided by that principle, and we reserve our right to demand the same of all other Governments/ our partners. The political, social, economic and cultural rights of the individual should be safeguarded on the basis of generally accepted international instruments. That is the way it should be everywhere.\nThe countries that have put forward this proposal do not claim a certificate of copyright. The system of security grows out of what has already been accomplished in the process of the peaceful coexistence of nations in the post-War years. It grows out of the activities of the United Nations, It is rooted in a broad legal foundation and the treaties which restrain the arms race. It is rooted in the negotiations on the central problems of our time and the codification of human rights standards/ in regional security-building processes and in the Non-Aligned Movement.\nAs a logical result of the development of mankind's common culture in this century, that system promises to become in the future a framework for the collective application of the creative efforts of all countries and peoples. Today, when 2/000 weapons can be removed from the face of the earth/ when a historic breakthrough has been achieved in a 42-year-long trend/ such a system reflects what we believe to be a genuine, irreversible process; a product of will and perseverance. For we are indeed born to live together and we shall stand together if we become an arch in which we support each other.\nOur Assembly session provides the best occasion for reflecting on this. Its time should not be taken up with confrontation and hostility, I tell you frankly that the world is tired of that. There have been too many quotations intended to prove that you are dealing with the spawn of Hell. That is simply not serious or well founded. There have been too many accusations that detract front the dignity of nations. It is time for us to proceed to earnest dialogue; time to get down to business.\nIn these moments, as we stand face to face with the past and the present, we are keenly aware that when this pause for reflection is over we shall once again have to act, and again act.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, it gives me great pleasure to convey to you our heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. Your election to that high office is the best testimony to your qualities as an experienced diplomat. I am convinced that your vast knowledge and experience will ensure the success of our deliberations. My delegation will spare no effort in making its modest contribution to the performance of your task.\nI am also happy to convey the appreciation and gratitude of my delegation to your predecessor Mr. Choudhury, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, who demonstrated ability and devotion in the performance of his duties as president of the General Assembly at its last session.\nIt also gives me pleasure to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the tireless efforts he has made in promoting co-operation and understanding among nations.\nThe economic situation of Africa has become very alarming. It has been marked, inter alia, by a reduction in the gross domestic product, a drop in export earnings, a drop in income, and a high rate of population growth. At a time when the African countries most need it for implementing their recovery programme, we are witnessing a net drain of capital from the developing countries to the developed countries. Many African countries, especially those of sub-Saharan Africa, are facing debts that considerably hamper their development. Inadequate social services in such areas as health, sanitation, education and housing have become sources of constant concern in these countries. The tragic consequences of drought have been exacerbated also by the large number of refugees and displaced persons.\nAll these factors jeopardize economic, social and political stability and undermine the economic reforms that Africa has undertaken since the adoption in 1585 of Africa's Priority Programme for Economic Recovery 198\u042c-19\u04230 and the adoption by the General Assembly in 1986 of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-199U. The outlook for increased investment in development projects has become far worse.\nAfrican countries have undertaken a long-term programme of economic and social development to deal with that economic situation. We are convinced that the international community will support the programmes for the recovery and economic development of Africa, since African economies must achieve a higher growth-rate so that Africa can reverse the current trend and overcome its underdevelopment.\nIt goes without saying that African countries must promote inter-regional co-operation in all the spheres deemed necessary for improving their economic and social situation in conformity with the Lagos Plan of Action and Final Act.\nIn this connection, it should be noted that the countries of east Africa - Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda and Djibouti - have combined their efforts to confront the adverse effects of drought and other related natural disasters, and have established the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development. Those countries have adopted a plan of action for financing specific sectoral programmes and well-defined projects necessary to strengthen their national and regional capability to combat the effects of drought and promote economic and social development. We believe that these pro9rammes can be successful only with the total support of the international community.\nI wish to inform the General Assembly that the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development held its first conference of donors in Djibouti in March 1987. At that conference the donor countries. United Nations specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations recognized the serious work done by the\t\u00b7\nAuthority in submitting to them coherent programmes and projects in keeping with Africa's Priority Programme for Economic Recovery 1986-1990. The international community showed interest in these projects, which related to food security, water resources, combating desertification, agronomic research and infrastructures.\nI take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to all Member States, agencies and organizations that have contributed and given their assistance at this difficult time, when the countries members of the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development are trying to mobilize the necessary financial, material and technical resources.\nThe nations of the Horn of Africa have always worked to promote regional co-operation. We believe that the establishment of regional intergovernmental organizations will help to create conditions conducive to tolerance and good-neighbourliness, thus making possible the development of real co-operation in commercial and cultural exchanges. Such co-operation can help to establish a climate of mutual trust that will enhance the well-being of the peoples of the region.\nThe Republic of Djibouti is situated it one of the most arid regions of the world. The scarcity of rainfall and other adverse climatic conditions continue to be the main obstacles to development and self-sufficiency in food. Poor agriculture and livestock production have made Djibouti a net importer, at extremely high prices, of nearly all the food needed for local consumption.\nIndustry is practically non-existent, owing mainly to the high cost of the electricity available. The Government of Djibouti has given high priority to the development of new and renewable sources of energy that could form the basis for viable industrial development, and in particular to exploration for and exploitation of the geothermal energy that we believe exists in sufficient quantity to meet a substantial part of the country's energy needs in the near future. But exploitation of geothermal energy requires technology, capital investment and qualified professionals, which at present we lack.\nNevertheless, the development and expansion of the service sector, which is now the basis of our national economy, must be maintained. However, the maintenance of this sector at a viable level requires structural adjustment, the training of a work-force and major financial resources.\nIn addition to these difficulties, the Republic of Djibouti must deal with the precarious economic and financial situation resulting from several adverse factors caused by the foreign debt, inflation and unemployment. The repercussions of the last drought and the presence of a large number of refugees are a heavy burden on the State budget.\nIn the light of these social and economic difficulties, my Government hopes that Member States and international agencies and organizations will provide Djibouti with the assistance needed to support its efforts and enable it successfully to carry out its development programme.\nThe situation in the Middle, East continues to be the most worrying threat to international peace and security. Israel, which is pursuing an expansionist policy, has constantly defied international public opinion and spurned the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, the provisions of the, Charter and the principles of international law, which state that the acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible. According to Israel, the solution of the Middle East problem is not a just and lasting peace, but rather expansion and the acquisition of territory to the detriment of its neighbours, and the denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\nEver since its creation Israel has shown by its actions that it will not give up the expansionist goals set by the Zionists. Since the creation of the State of Israel by the adoption of General Assembly resolution (II), of 29 November 1947, the Zionist regime has waged a campaign of terror, involving massacres of the civilian population, including women and children, and resulting in a massive exodus of Palestinians. Thus, terrorism has been introduced in our time into the Middle East as a means of achieving political goals. Since 194b Israeli acts of aggression have caused several armed conflicts that have endangered international peace and security.\nThe Palestinian- question is at the core of the Middle East conflict. There can be no solution without taking account of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people. That crucial fact was stressed in the Arab peace plan adopted at the Fez summit conference. The international community has stated on many occasions that the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the total, unconditional withdrawal of Israel from Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, are the essential elements of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The international conference On peace in the Middle East, which should be convened in accordance with General Assembly resolution 38/58 C, under United Nations auspices and with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, would be the most appropriate forum for establishing a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\nWe commend the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts to speed up the preparations for the conference and hope he will overcome all the obstacles in the way of his initiatives. Israeli intervention in Lebanon, the unjustified massacre of civilians and the destruction of property continue to worsen Lebanon's economic and social structure which has already been seriously affected by internal conflict. Under the pretext of the so-called buffer zone, Israel continues to occupy southern Lebanon to impede the process of national unity and the country's reconstruction. We call upon the United Nations to ensure implementation of Security Council resolution 5U9 {1982) and to assist Lebanon to regain sovereignty over its entire territory in order to undertake the difficult task of reconstruction and recovery.\nNotwithstanding resolutions of the United Nations, the OAU and the Non-Aligned Movement, as well as world public opinion, the South African regime continues to intensify its oppressive practices through acts of violence, intimidation and massacres perpetrated against the black majority. However, South Africa's campaign of terror, police brutality and violence will only strengthen further the resolve of those fighting for their freedom and national independence.\nWe express profound concern at the lack of progress in negotiations to find a solution to the problem of the political, economic and social emancipation or the African black majority at a time when atrocities perpetrated against the South African people by the apartheid regime still continue.\nWe believe that in the circumstances the only way to force the apartheid regime to negotiate is through concerted specific international pressure and the immediate imposition of comprehensive sanctions. There will be no peace and tranquillity in that region so long as the apartheid system has not been totally dismantled and destroyed, and all international efforts likely to disable that regime's repressive machinery must be supported of all peace-loving countries. International action must also support the efforts of the South African majority to end racism and racial discrimination and eliminate the repressive policy of the Pretoria regime.\nThe illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa and the latter\u2019s refusal to recognize the rights of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence despite United Nations resolutions, are a serious source of concern. As long as the Pretoria regime continues to occupy Namibia, as long as military and police repression are used to subjugate the Namibian people, and as long as the apartheid system plunders the enormous natural and mineral resources of the Territory in the interest of the minority and foreign allies, peace in that region will be jeopardized.\nThe acts of violence committed by the forces of apartheid have gone beyond the borders of Namibia and South Africa. Indeed, a few moments ago the Head of State of Zambia and current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) referred to the latest events that have occurred in that region. The Pretoria regime has many times perpetrated acts of aggression against the independent front-line States to destabilize and disorganize them. In view of that situation, the front-line States need proper political, material and financial support to enable them to defend themselves against South Africa's repeated attacks.\nAny negotiations seeking to find a political solution to the problem of Namibia should lead to a complete cease-fire followed by the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the South African occupation forces from that Territory, so that the Namibian people can exercise their inalienable rights to self-determination and independence, in keeping with the United Nations plan approved in Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which is the genuine basis for finding solutions leading to peaceful independence for Namibia.\nThe international community must give the Namibian people every necessary assistance to deal with South African aggression to enable it to win its legitimate struggle for freedom and independence, under the wise guidance of the South West Africa People's Organization.\nFor seven years and a few days now a destructive conflict has been going on between Iran and Iraq, two Muslim neighbouring countries - a conflict which, according to some estimates, has resulted in a million dead and wounded and incalculable material damage. The conflict is now taking on dangerous dimensions, including the risk of its becoming internationalised. Aware of those developments, the international community adopted practical measures contained in Security Council resolution 598 (1987) of 20 July 1987 in an attempt to end the conflict.\nUnfortunately, the carnage and destruction continue to be intensified either through bombing civilian centres or endangering international snipping. We urge the international community to increase its efforts and take the necessary steps to end that conflict. All initiatives undertaken bilaterally and multi laterally must be pursued to bring about genuine peace between the two countries. The recent efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General must be supported so that the two countries can agree to negotiate on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) of 20 July 1987. We greatly appreciate Iraq's positive response to find a negotiated solution to the conflict.\nThe mediation process undertaken by the Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State of the OAU to find a solution to the Chadian problem deserves support. We must support all efforts likely to lead to peace and security in that region. The international community must give every assistance to the people and the Government of Chad in their reconstruction effort.\nFor almost eight years now the Afghan people has been suffering from occupation by foreign armed forces and several millions of them have been forced into exile to escape massacre. That situation requires an urgent political solution on the basis of the principles of the Charter and the obligation of States to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty and-territorial, integrity of any State. The international community's repeated appeals for the withdrawal of foreign troops, have still not been headed.  The international community must redouble its efforts to relieve the suffering of the Afghan people by guaranteeing the withdrawal of foreign forces to enable that people freely to choose its political, economic and social systems without any foreign.\u00b7 interference.\nSouth-East Asia is another region of tension since the foreign armed intervention against and occupation of Democratic Kampuchea. We hope that peace will be restored to that region by finding a just political solution to the Kampuchean problem and guaranteeing the withdrawal of all foreign forces, thus enabling that country to enjoy its sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-aligned status.\nIn the Korean Peninsula, since the start of the conflict in the early 1950s, the situation has been a permanent source of tension. The only way to lessen tension is to create the necessary conditions to enable the peoples of South and North Korea to establish a dialogue making possible the establishment of a climate of mutual trust so as to resolve differences without any foreign interference.\nWe are living in a world where interdependence has increasingly become an absolute necessity, we note with satisfaction the efforts undertaken by the United Nations to encourage the developed and the developing nations to co-operate to establish a new just equitable international order. The United Nations promotes understanding and co-operation in the broadest meaning of those words. The United Nations must redouble its efforts to find solutions to eliminate abject poverty, hunger, malnutrition and disease.\nIn conclusion we firmly believe in the United Nations for the safeguard of international peace and security. We reiterate our support for the noble ideals embodied by the United Nations, for it offers the best forum for finding solutions likely to lead to understanding, tolerance and co-operation in international relations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt is a great honour and a source of legitimate pride to address the Assembly today on behalf of the Military Council of National Reconstruction and the Government of the Republic of Guinea, led by His Excellency General Lansana Conte, out of a political determination to provide it with my country's modest contribution to the finding of solutions to the many problems of concern to our peoples and States.\nBefore discussing the burning issues of the day, Sir, I should like, to discharge a pleasant duty, that of congratulating you very sincerely on behalf of my delegation on your outstanding election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that your skills as an experienced diplomat coupled with your authority and impartiality will guarantee the success we expect of this session of the General Assembly,\nI should like also to thank your predecessor, the representative of Bangladesh, His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, for the outstanding way in which he conducted the work of the last session of the General Assembly.\nHow could I fail to convey to Secretary-General Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar the profound gratitude of my people for the tireless efforts he constantly exerts to bring about a climate of peace, security and prosperity among all nations in an international situation that is so confused and precarious.\nThe Secretary-General's report to the General Assembly rightly stresses that the interdependence of all States forces them to exercise greater co-operation within strengthened multilateralism; it is through this co-operation, for which each State is responsible, that the ideals of the Organization may be achieved. I am convinced that the goals of this co-operation can be achieved only by strengthening the United Nations, the primary instrument for the establishment and maintenance of a climate of confidence and understanding among all States and a powerful tool at the service of peace and development.\nAs we meet once again in this Assembly to assess, as we traditionally do, the work of our Organization, we must say that since the last session the world has remained beset by many areas of tension. International relations, both political and economic, have continued to worsen, and the victims of this situation are, unfortunately, the third world countries - the weakest, most vulnerable entities.\nThe dramatic and sometimes tragic events of recent months, which we have witnessed powerless to do anything, must make us aware that ours is an interdependent world. We see the extent to which conflicts and tensions may impact on general security, and we increasingly appreciate the links between the economies of various regions. That is why my country is committed to the idea of establishing a mote just, more equitable international order.\nThe many pockets of tension throughout our world continue to be of concern to my country. Among the major problems of our Organization there is the heart-rending situation prevailing in South Africa, where each day the anachronistic racist regime of Pretoria steps up its obstinate determination to perpetuate injustice, misery and suffering of the black majority, which it has deprived of its basic eights, is there any greater challenge to the international community than the pseudo-elections in which only whites may participate, the total gagging of the South African media and the absurd maintenance of a state of emergency? Truly, the supporters of apartheid continue to flout the universal conscience through the inhumanity of their domestic policies and the incessant acts of aggression they perpetuate against the front-line countries and neighbouring States.\nGiven the resurgence of acts of State terrorism, a new attitude is necessary, one requiring our unswerving commitment. That is why the Republic of Guinea adds its voice to those of all justice- and freedom-loving States calling for increased assistance in various forms for the victims of apartheid to enable them to deal with the crimes, the destabilizing actions, of the racist Pretoria regime. We welcome here the bold decisions taken on behalf of Africa at the recent summit of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa on the situation in that region. Strict implementation of those measures will certainly help to eliminate apartheid and to bring about the triumph of right and justice, resolutely defended by the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC), the national liberation movements, which my country firmly supports.\nWith regard to illegally-occupied Namibia, there still continue dilatory manoeuvres to sabotage implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). With regard to its neighbours, South Africa continues its policy of aggression, destabilization and intimidation. Given the horrendous cycle of violence that has for some time marked the situation in that part of Africa, it is time to go beyond mere condemnation. The minority Pretoria regime has proved to all peoples and Governments of goodwill how bigoted and intransigent it is, and how it totally disregards international law and universal ethics. More effective means of exerting pressure must be adopted to support the struggle of the oppressed peoples of South Africa and Namibia as well as the front-line States. \nThe immediate effective implementation of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter Vii of the Charter will certainly make it possible to force the South African regime to abide by the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations, grant independence to Namibia and promote the advent in South Africa of a democratic multiracial society in which freedom, equality and the dignity of all are guaranteed.\nWestern Sahara is also a source of concern and we are optimistic that the parties to the conflict will proceed to a cease-fire, in keeping with the resolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations, a prerequisite for the free self-determination of the Sahraoui people. In this respect, a well-deserved tribute should be paid to the Secretary-General for his discreet but effective efforts to find ways and means to prevail upon the protagonists to show the flexibility necessary to lead to an appropriate and lasting solution to the crisis. With regard to Chad, my delegation takes this opportunity to make an urgent appeal to the sons of that country, which has been drenched in blood by many years of fratricidal war, to complete the work of reconciliation. We call upon Libya and Chad to create the conditions for the speedy establishment of a climate of peace and brotherly co-operation in the region.\nThere have not yet been any positive developments regarding the conflict in the Horn of Africa despite many attempts at mediation. Dialogue should be continued to dispel the dangers that still threaten relations between the countries o\u00a3 the subregion.\nThe alarming situation in the Middle East, which gets worse every day, and the potential danger of a flare-up of the conflicts underscore the urgent need for the international community to proceed to a comprehensive, effective settlement of this Question, in this connection, the proposal to convene an international conference on peace in the Middle East, under United Nations auspices and with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, should be encouraged.\nMoreover, it is clear that it is more necessary than ever to find a negotiated solution to the distressing conflict between Iran and Iraq, which is becoming more alarming every day with the escalation of violence, death and desolation. Unless there is the common and persistent will to end this devastating war, the security of the entire Gulf will be dangerously compromised, and with it an entire system of values to which we remain deeply committed. That is why the efforts of the United Nations, through its Secretary-General, should be pursued and supported with a view to ensuring the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) as a first step in the search for a just solution to this problem.\nThe initiatives taken by the Secretary-General in the efforts to find a solution to the conflict in Afghanistan must be encouraged and continued with a view to promoting a political solution to the conflict, while respecting the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Afghan people and its right to determine its own future without foreign interference.\nRegarding the Korean question, only the peaceful reunification of the country, without foreign interference, and the denuclearisation of the peninsula can remove the threat of war and overcome the obstacles blocking the way to the unity of the Korean nation.\nThe complete withdrawal of the foreign troops stationed in Kampuchea is also necessary. The return to a free, democratic, non-aligned Kampuchea is a sure guarantee of the defusing of the situation in South-East Asia and the advent of an era of peace and security. The development of the crisis throughout Central America also gives rise to great apprehension. We welcome the commitments made at the recent meeting in Guatemala of the principal leaders of the region and have great hopes that they will be respected by all the parties and will contribute to a relaxation of the tension in the region and to the establishment of a climate of confidence and good-neighbourliness, which would be an expression of the determination to safeguard the democratic principles and sovereignty of all the States of the region.\nWe take this opportunity to express from this rostrum our deep appreciation of the remarkable efforts made by the Contadora Group to transform this part of the American continent into a zone of peace and co-operation.\nTo these conflict situations we must add other challenges which, unfortunately, do not contribute to the establishment of a climate favourable to international peace and security. Among these challenges is the serious, profound and prolonged crisis affecting the world economy in general and the economies of the third-world countries in particular.\nNever has the economic situation of the developing countries been more unfavourable. Furthermore, the situation of the African countries is steadily worsening under the combined impact of internal and external factors. Indeed, their economies are being hard hit by the consequences of the worsening of terms of trade, the enormous fluctuations in exchange rates, the increase in interest rates and the flight of capital. Protectionist barriers are blocking their exports, thus causing a fall in the cash flow and reducing their ability to honour their commitments to creditors.\nWith regard to the African continent, the constant deterioration in the terms of trade caused a fall of almost $19 billion in their 1986 export receipts, whereas coat of the debt servicing approached $200 billion for the sane year. To this must be added persistent drought and other natural disasters.\nIt is quite clear that the effort necessary to restore the economy must be made above all by the third-world countries. They are fully aware of this and have, for the most part, undertaken courageous reforms to revitalize their economies. But if these efforts are not followed by a substantial financial input, coupled with a rational understanding of the debt problem, it goes without saying that the sacrifices made will be without effect in the long terra and will result only in unfulfilled hopes. Indeed, without this complementary outside support, it would be pointless to undertake the various projects and programmes of development conceived within the framework of the structural adjustments for the purpose of banishing the spectre of hunger and poverty.\nTherefore the problem is both political and financial, because the present state of international economic relations, which affect the lives of millions of human beings hardly gives cause for optimism.\nIt is hardly necessary to recall that the negative trends in the world economy will be eliminated only on the basis of a co-ordinated, realistic approach, without selfishness and or narrowness. The North-South dialogue and South-South co-operation provide the appropriate framework for the establishment of greater international economic justice.\nPeace, security and development, which are indissolubly linked, occupy a central place among the concerns of our time, because they are indispensable factors in the general progress of mankind. In assessing the work done by our Organization in this vital sector we note with regret the absence of significant results in the implementation of many agreements and resolutions.\nThe escalation of the arms race and the exacerbation of hotbeds of tension, abetted by the will to dominate shown by certain major Powers, are creating a true war psychosis among the peoples and imperilling their sovereignty and survival. That is why we welcome and encourage the disarmament negotiations undertaken by the two super-Powers, in the firm hope that they will gradually achieve the complete and absolute denuclearisation of our planet.\nAs was so rightly emphasized by the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, the implementation of these two processes, which are distinct, yet at the same time linked, will create favourable conditions for the progress and prosperity of peoples. Meanwhile, thanks to scientific and technological achievements. Immense resources are wasted in the arms race, while, paradoxically, millions of people are languishing in poverty and suffering from illiteracy, hunger and disease. However, with general and complete disarmament, part of the resources freed could be designated for the purpose of the economic and social development of third-world countries.\nThat is why my delegation is convinced that lasting peace can be achieved only when there is a reduction in the gap between rich nations and poor nations. Thus, all of us without exception, faced with the threat of a nuclear apocalypse and with urgent economic needs, must work together to lay the foundations for a total peace and security, which are pre-conditions of progress and understanding among peoples. Finally, I express the hope that our work will be crowned with success; I am convinced that all nations will ensure scrupulous respect for the principles of the Charter and work untiringly towards the realization of its noble goals of peace, justice and progress.\nSuch an undertaking will demonstrate that we are substituting love for hate and that we are abandoning the perilous path of unreasonableness for clear thinking, and the adolescent anger of the past for a frank and fruitful dialogue.\nMoreover, we shall thereby have shown our sincere will to look resolutely, all of us together, to a future built on hope and serenity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nOn behalf of the Government and people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas and on my own behalf, I extend warm congratulations to you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of this Assembly. My delegation, aware of your competence and experience in diplomacy, is confident that important agreements can be reached on many of the problems facing our Member States. I take this opportunity also to commend Foreign Minister Choudhury of Bangladesh for the skilful manner in which he conducted the business of the forty-first session of the General Assembly.\nOn 19 June the Bahamas electorate returned my Government to an unprecedented sixth term of office. This vote has given my Government a strong mandate to continue to promote effective programmes for the economic development and political stability of the Bahamas. As a result of this vote, my Government can continue to use its voice and energies for the advancement of this great world forum.\nMy Government therefore takes this opportunity to encourage our Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, in his leadership role in this Organization, to implement measures that would elicit greater co-operation among States, thereby minimizing confrontation.\nThere are perennial problems on the United Nations agenda, such as those of the world economic situation, the debt, drug trafficking and abuse, disarmament, regional conflicts and, in Africa, apartheid, political unrest, economic stagnation, drought and famine which beset much of the continent. The African Problems defy easy solutions because of an unwillingness to join fully in the war on apartheid on the part of those countries which could do the most to effect change.\nI shall, however, be focusing only on those issues in respect of which my delegation feels it can offer some suggestions or practical observations which will contribute to progress in their resolution. In this vein, I should like to address first the issue of small States, especially their economic viability and security. \nIn the final analysis  the question is not whether small States are viable entities, history has already answered this question in the affirmative. The crux of the matter, in fact, is that if ambivalence continues to prevail in respect of small States they do then become burdens. All of us have heard the wise observation give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach a man how to fish and you feed him for life. Small States need only understanding, patience and productive assistance. We, in the category of small States have identified goals and projects in respect of which such requirements should be met. We have some of the tools to attain our goals and fulfil our projects. What we now need is the means to improve these tools and the forbearance to let us work out our own destiny.\nWithin the special category of small States is an even more specialized grouping of States that require particular attention and understanding on the part of the international community. This is the grouping of island developing States, to which geography has bequeathed more constraints in relation to their size than blessings. In addition to economic and social burdens, such as dependence on one or a few commodities, external debt and a shortage of administrative personnel, which beset other developing States, island States face not only smallness of size but remoteness and sometimes great distance from market centres, constraints in transportation, a limited internal market and general lack of natural or traditionally viable natural resources. Nevertheless, if permitted to enjoy an effective level of self-reliance as well as internal stability, small States can strengthen rather than threaten international order, peace and collective security.\nAnother year has passed and the abhorrent apartheid regime of South Africa persists, despite increased pressure by the international community, as well as the private sector, through resolutions, calls for divestment, demonstrations, sanctions and embargoes. World public opinion has swung firmly to our side? it is clear that the Botha regime has lost the struggle in psychological terms, but there are still many obstacles to overcome. The poison of Pretoria continues to affect the neighbouring country of Namibia, which cries out for its rightful place as an independent State in the international community.\nIt is time for us, the people, to face the effects of complicity when it comes to South Africa and Namibia. If we do not, we all become as guilty of oppression and murder as those States which back away from exercising economic pressure and political influence on South Africa.\nIn 1985 the Commonwealth Heads of Government, meeting in Nassau, came to grips with South Africa's intransigence with regard to dismantling apartheid. Under the chairmanship of Sir Lynden Pindling, Prime Minister of the Bahamas, the Heads of Government appointed the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group on Southern Africa. For six months in 1986, in which its members travelled extensively in southern Africa, the Eminent Persons Group worked to promote a process of dialogue for change, ending apartheid and establishing a genuine non-racial democracy in South Africa. Sadly, the Government of South Africa listened, but did not hear: acknowledged, but did not act. Consequently, the Commonwealth convened a mini-summit of seven countries in London to attempt to place increased pressure on South Africa.\nWith Sir Lynden Pindling as Chairman, the Governments of India, Canada, Australia, Zimbabwe, Britain, Zambia and the Bahamas reaffirmed a commitment to the Commonwealth accord on southern Africa concluded at Chogm in Nassau. Because of Pretoria's unwillingness to negotiate, the group of seven, with the exception of Britain, agreed to adopt economic measures against South Africa as a moral and political imperative. \nWhen Commonwealth Heads of Government convene in Vancouver next week, the Bahamas assuredly will be in the forefront of the fight for racial equality and freedom in all southern Africa.\nIn the view of the Bahamas there must be unqualified acceptance of the urgent need for action to dismantle apartheid in South Africa. Meaningful measures must also incorporate practical commitment to infrastructural issues such as the abolition of discriminatory education. In that context, the Bahamas Government welcomed and supports, through contributions to the Commonwealth Secretariat, the Commonwealth South Africa Scholarship Fund, which administers the Commonwealth Nassau Fellowships established at the 1985 meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in the capital of the Bahamas to help educate South Africans disadvantaged by apartheid, so that they can acquire the skills likely to be required for the progress of a post-apartheid South Africa. The Bahamas Government has also consistently supported United Nations programmes for oppressed and refugee South Africans, including the United Nations Fund for Namibia and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\nAlso, to curb significantly front-line States' economic dependence on South Africa and to safeguard their security against South African aggression it is imperative that assistance to these States be increased. Apart from the question of economic dependency on South Africa, the security of front-line States is constantly being violated by South Africa either by direct aggression or by material assistance to armed opposition within front-line States. It has been ascertained not only that South Africa uses internal and external aggression to frighten front-line States into abandoning their support for the black majority, but also that it exploits their economic dependence through the jobs given to nationals of front-line States. Further, the provision of those jobs ignores mass unemployment among black South Africans, depresses the general wage level and enables the South African Government to maintain control of the labour force. To assist in curbing front-line States' economic dependence on South Africa, the Bahamas has contributed financially to United Nations programmes as well as to the non-aligned fund for the front-line States.\nTo ignore the elements just enumerated is to nullify the sacrifices, personal and financial, which many nations, organizations and individuals have made with a view to dismantling apartheid. It could contribute to the fire of revolution, which could make ashes of the achievements of the billions of dollars from Western developed nations invested in South Africa. Moreover, it could cause the poison of Pretoria to suffocate forever the independence and freedom of Namibia. Therefore, despite the attention now being focused on the internal situation in South Africa, renewed emphasis must be placed on the blueprint for the independence of Namibia contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1970).\nIn 1985 the world economy slowed down, and in 1986 aid so again. That, of course, was to the detriment of many developing countries, particularly those in Africa. Developing countries with the least amount of economic diversity have suffered the most as a result of this worsening situation. Overwhelmed by foreign debt, many of these developing countries find themselves in unstable domestic situations and with negative growth entrenching itself as a way of life.\nCompare that debilitating economic scenario of developing countries with the situation of the developed market economies, which experienced growth in per capita income in 1986. This is a picture that does not say much for the implementation by the United Nations of the economic principles of its Charter.\nThe correct path was indicated to us at the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The consensus document that emanated from that session can serve as a significant guiding light for the international community in efforts to rectify the world economy. I wish to underscore here its prescriptions for sustainable and non-inflationary growth in developed countries and an environment conducive to accelerated growth for developing countries. Those prescriptions are a co-operative and flexible strategy on the question of international debt, a halt to protectionist policies and the shouldering by industrialized countries of their responsibility to foster a more stable and predictable economic environment, especially in the area of commodity prices.\nThe Bahamas Government continues to direct a strong appeal to the super-Powers to work together to reach mutually satisfactory bilateral accords. These should be supported by complementary arms-control agreements extending to other nuclear, militarily significant. States. Serious efforts at arms control must also be accompanied by such meaningful acts as the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and the abolition of the use of chemical weapons. The World Disarmament Campaign and the world disarmament conference proposed in paragraphs 15 and 122, respectively, of the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, constitute golden opportunities for challenging the people of the world, young and old, to make a concrete contribution to disarmament, or at the very least to global agreement that arms at their lowest quantitative and qualitative levels must be only the last resort in conflicts among nations.\nThere are at present encouraging signs that the United States and the Soviet Union, aided by the courageous and historic commitment of Chancellor Kohl of the Federal Republic of Germany, are on the verge of an agreement which could draw the world back from the threat of the use of nuclear weapons. My Government applauds these rare acts of political will in the interest of national and international security. The benefits to the world of reduced spending on armaments are incalculable. The Bahamas would support all measures aimed at disarmament-fuelled development, especially those that would enable the expertise and technology now expended on the arms race to be applied to global problems such as pollution control, prevention of disease and other projects which only await funding. The Bahamas supports disarmament-fuelled development to bring all people everywhere an acceptable standard and quality of life.\nThe situations in Afghanistan and in Central America, to cite two glaring examples, are instructive in that they both illustrate that rigid adherence to spheres of influence by the two super-Powers in the context of balance-of-power politics does not contribute to a stable world order.\nThe Bahamas, therefore, continues to call for the total withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan and additionally submits that the negotiation of agreed guarantees for the restoration of non-alignment to Afghanistan is perhaps the only enduring solution to the internal suffering and political stalemate which the conflict in that beleaguered country has produced. The Bahamas is heartened by the demonstration of political will in the Central American sub-region, which has followed the direction and the intensive efforts of the Contadora Group and its Support Group to find a peaceful solution to the intra-regional conflict.\nThe Bahamas, therefore, welcomes the Central American Presidents' plan on procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central America, signed on 7 August, and the act of installation of the International Verification and Follow-up Commission, signed 15 days later by their Foreign Ministers, the Contadora Group and Support Group countries and the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States. \nBoth these initiatives merit maximum international support as evidence of genuine commitment to the restoration of peace in Central America. In this context, the Bahamas therefore encourages relevant United Nations organs, such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to offer every practical assistance to Central American Governments at every stage of the implementation timetable for the peace plan. Given the serious economic and social problems which are to a large extent the root causes of conflicts in Central America, international assistance is a crucial element if peace is to result from a return to the path of progress through economic and social justice.\nThe resolve of the international community to counteract the devastating and destructive phenomena of drug abuse and illicit trafficking has resulted in unprecedented drug control initiatives. The most significant effort in recent years was the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (ICDAIT) held in Vienna earlier this year, ICDAIT successfully brought together those in the forefront of drug control - representatives from the United Nations system. Governments and intergovernmental organizations. Of equal importance was the spirit of compromise and co-operation that guided the work of the Conference and resulted in the adoption by consensus of its principal documents - the comprehensive multidisciplinary outline and a Declaration.\nThe momentum of ICDAIT also had a positive effect on the work of the intergovernmental group of experts which met immediately after the Conference to begin work on a new convention against illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.\nThe success of efforts such as ICDAIT and the new convention ought not be measured simply in terms of consensus documents. The level of success will become evident with time as Governments exercise the political will expressed in the Declaration and implement through regional and national legislation and practices, the measures recommended in the comprehensive multi-disciplinary outline, as well as the Treaties and relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations on drug abuse control.\nThe Bahamas will remain part of this struggle against drug abuse and drug trafficking because it believes that in the interests of domestic, social and global stability the war against drugs must be won.\nBy way of conclusion I wish to remind members that we are living on a shrinking planet, made so by technological breakthroughs in communication, transportation and science. It is self-evident that decisions taken at the United Nations can be transmitted technologically and through direct personal intervention to all parts of the globe within seconds or a maximum of a few hours. Therefore no member can continue to plead ignorance or helplessness with respect to the plight of our brothers and sisters on this planet. We are either victims or beneficiaries of our own actions. It is thus essential to accept that we are our brother's keepers and cannot sit idly by when he suffers. I am convinced that under your guidance, Mr. President, some if not all of the issues confronting our community will be fully aired and resolved.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, on behalf of the European Community and its member States I take pleasure in congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this forty-second session,\nI should like also to express the Community's appreciation to your predecessor for the leadership shown by him on so many occasions during the past year.\nThe 12 States members of the European Community wish also to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General and to express our deep appreciation of his patient and tireless efforts to solve the problems facing us, including those within this very Organization.\nI last had the honour to address the General Assembly on behalf of the European Community and its member States in 1982. At that time, I began with words that vividly reflected the difficulties we then faced:\n\\\"The world today presents a bleak picture. It is becoming Increasingly difficult to remain optimistic about the future.\\\" (A/37/PV.8>pp.18-20)\nHow does the situation look today, five years later? X am happy to say that in the period since I last addressed the General Assembly, there have been a number of encouraging developments. Fortunately, the worst fears expressed at that time have not been realized, and there are grounds for looking to the future with guarded optimism. Difficulties remain in many parts of the world, but it should be noted that international tension has to some extent been reduced as a result of improving relations between East and West.\nNumerous challenges remain, however. And the United Nations continues to have a central role to play in meeting them. It is striking how the United Nations is now seen as having a major role in finding acceptable solutions to so many of the serious international conflicts that face us - Afghanistan, the Iraq-Iran war, the Arab-Israeli conflict, Lebanon, Cyprus, Kampuchea and southern Africa. After a period in which the United Nations was too often seen as marginal to the great issues of the day, the Twelve welcome the Organization's increasingly central and active role.\nThe 12 States members of the European Community are willing to contribute fully and constructively to the efforts being made by the Secretary-General, the Security Council and this Assembly. It is important that all the nations of the world should work together as truly United nations. The French philosopher Pascal once wrote;\n\\\"Plurality which is not reduced to unity is confusion, unity which does not\ndepend on plurality is tyranny.\\\"\nLet us all try in the coming months, here in New York, to work together and to settle our differences in a constructive and far-sighted atmosphere. This is what the many millions of people whom we represent expect of us.\nWe live in a world of interdependence - a world in which few, if any, major problems can be resolved by one nation alone. The very existence of the European Community reflects the Twelve's acknowledgement of this fact. Our collective efforts to meet the challenges facing Western Europe in the past 30 years highlight our fundamental commitment to international co-operation and collaboration. Since the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, the Community has faced difficulties and disagreements. It has taken time to develop the habits of instinctive partnership among the European Community's member States. But we are in no doubt about the benefits that our peoples have enjoyed as a result of the creation of the European Community. \nWith the entry into force of the Single\u00b7 European Act this year the European Community has entered into a new phase of close collaboration. Our own experiences have made us all the more convinced that such regional co-operation within the wide global framework is essential if lasting solutions are to be found to the world's problems.\nThe Twelve naturally attach particular importance to the development of East-West relations. As Europeans, we cannot ignore the artificial barriers that divide our continent, and have for over 40 years. The Helsinki Final Act laid a solid foundation for overcoming those barriers. Unfortunately, much still remains to be done adequately to translate the provisions of the Final Act into reality. The Twelve have played a central role in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process since its inception, and we are determined to press for continuing progress. The commitments freely entered into in Helsinki and elsewhere must be fully implemented by all States participating in the CSCE. Their peoples must be able to enjoy the real benefits, including, in particular, respect for human rights, which they were promised in 1975.\nAt the current follow-up meeting in Vienna the Twelve have therefore submitted major proposals within the main areas of the CSCE process, especially concerning its human dimension. We wish, in particular, to increase the impact of the CSCE for individual Europeans by facilitating contacts between East and West, by creating and strengthening guarantees of individual rights and freedoms and by ensuring the free flow of information, ideas and people. Our ideals and proposals must be adequately reflected in any concluding document of the Vienna meeting. That document would thus promote full compliance with existing commitments and represent substantial and balanced progress across the full range of CSCE subjects. The CSCE process cannot stand still, it must be dynamic and responsive to the needs and wishes of our citizens.\nWe are following carefully recent developments in the Soviet Union. We note with interest that new words have been used by the Soviet Union that could point towards a more open society. Improved mutual awareness and understanding between States are both desirable in themselves and have a crucial role to play in reducing mistrust and fear.\nHowever, we look to the Soviet Union for deeds that will match its words. Afghanistan is a case in point. Soviet policy in Afghanistan is a concrete test of the Soviet Union's goodwill and intentions. More than 110,000 Soviet troops remain in Afghanistan against the will of the Afghan people. Seven years of indiscriminate warfare have brought immense suffering upon the civilian population, created the world's biggest refugee problem and imposed considerable burdens on neighbouring countries, in particular Pakistan.\nAs expressed in the annual resolutions overwhelmingly endorsed by the Assembly, the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan continues to be as unacceptable to the international community as was the case in 1979\u0161 The rapid and unconditional withdrawal of all Soviet troops according to an irrevocable timetable and respect for the legitimate right of the Afghan people to decide freely their own future and system of government are the key elements in a lasting peaceful solution. The Twelve support the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to bring about an early negotiated settlement based on the principles contained in United Nations resolutions.\nThe Twelve welcome improved relations between the super-Powers and, in particular, indications that agreement is near on the global elimination of land-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles with a range of between 500 and 5,500 kilometres. This would be a major achievement. The Twelve hope that such an agreement would help to reduce tensions and enhance international security. The Twelve also hope that success in negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces will give a new impetus to United States-Soviet negotiations on other nuclear-missile and space systems. Priority should next be given to reaching early progress towards limitations and substantial reductions of the strategic nuclear arsenals of the two super-Powers. We call for further intensification of efforts aimed at reaching agreements which are fair, balanced and effectively verifiable.\nUrgent progress must also be made in other fields of arms control and disarmament. \u00c0 global ban on chemical weapons should enhance international security and lead to the removal from countries' arsenals of a particularly horrifying and inhuman instrument of war. We cannot forget that it is conventional weapons that have caused millions of deaths around the world since 1945 and continue to do so. The Twelve want to use this opportunity to underline the importance of the process started in Stockholm towards building greater military confidence in Europe, the first result of which constitutes a success recognized by all. We hope to see further progress in this field at the CSCE follow-up meeting in Vienna. The Twelve underline their strong interest in the discussions in this connection on further steps to promote the establishment in Europe of a secure and stable balance of conventional forces at a lower level and an increase in military transparency. We also strongly support efforts within the United Nations to tackle the problem of conventional disarmament. In this field, as in many others, the third special session on disarmament presents an opportunity to make a further contribution to progress in the arms-control and disarmament process, including effective steps towards the establishment of the necessary transparency of military budgets according to objective standards.\nOne area that carries deep scars of regional tension and armed conflict is the Middle East. The conflict between Iraq and Iran has now lasted for seven terrible years and continues to cause widespread death, destruction and suffering. This conflict represents an increasingly serious threat to security and to freedom of navigation in the Gulf. As expressed in their declaration of 3 September this year, the Twelve are seriously concerned by the continuation of the Iraq-Iran conflict and the resulting increase in tension in the Gulf. The Twelve whole-heartedly support Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and call for its early implementation in full. Noting the positions of the two parties as expressed to date, we call urgently for speedy implementation of the resolution and the immediate observance of a cease-fire on land, on the sea and in the air.\nWe fully support the Secretary-General in his efforts to achieve this end and appeal to both Iraq and Iran to co-operate fully with him. We reiterate our firm support for the fundamental principle of freedom of navigation, which is of the utmost importance to the whole international community. \nThe Arab-Israeli conflict remains an issue of concern to us all. It lies at the heart of continuing tension in the Near East, and further efforts are urgently needed to achieve progress towards a just, global and lasting settlement of this conflict. The Twelve's views on the key elements which must make up a solution to this conflict are well known. In accordance with the Venice Declaration and other declarations, two principles are fundamental: the right of all States in the area, including Israel, to exist within secure frontiers\u00b7, and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, with all that this implies. We call upon the parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict to open the doors to peace by recognizing each other's rights. Against the background of their long-standing contacts with the region, the Twelve are following closely current diplomatic efforts to revitalize the peace process. In our declarations of 23 February and 13 July this year, we have stated that we are in favour of an international conference, held under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of interested parties as well as any other party able to make a direct and positive contribution to the restoration and maintenance of peace and to the region's economic and social development. Such a conference provides a suitable framework for the necessary negotiations between the parties directly concerned and seems to us at present to be the only formula to allow the peace process to move forward. We are in close contact with all the parties concerned and we shall do all in our power to encourage them to bring their positions sufficiently close together to allow such an international conference to be held - and to achieve worthwhile results.\nThe Twelve are increasingly concerned about the situation of human rights in the occupied territories. We renew our call on Israel to fulfil its obligations a; the occupying Power, pending its withdrawal, to lift restrictions on political and economic activities and, as we have reiterated recently in our declaration of 14 September/ to put an end to the illegal policy of settlements. In order to help improve the living conditions of the Palestinians in the occupied territories, the Community and its member States will continue to provide economic assistance directly to the Palestinians/ assistance designed to allow the territories to enjoy the fruits of normal economic development. This assistance is in no sense an alternative to a lasting political settlement - but we hope nevertheless that it may help in a small way to bring such a settlement nearer.\nAs to the tragic fate of Lebanon we remain firmly committed to Lebanon's sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity. We welcome the vital work being done by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and call on all involved to support the UNIFIL force and allow it to carry out its mandate fully and in the best possible security conditions.\nTurning now to the question of Cyprus/ a member of the European family I cannot disregard the fact that the situation remains unchanged. The tragic division of the island continues. The Twelve attach great importance to a just and viable solution of this problem. To that effect, we reaffirm our strong backing for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. We stand fully by our previous statements and reject any action which purports to establish an independent State within Cyprus. We also express our support to the Secretary-General in his mission of good offices and ask those concerned to co-operate with him in the search for a solution to this problem of international concern and to refrain from words or actions that might adversely affect the prospects of a solution by peaceful means.\nTurning to South Africa, we face a situation which none of us can view with equanimity. The Twelve have always made clear their unequivocal condemnation of\n apartheid, an immoral and unacceptable system which breeds hatred and violence. \nWe remain convinced that what is needed in South Africa is a genuine national dialogue. Only broad-based negotiations, involving the genuine representatives c the various components of the South African population, can bring about a lasting settlement. The aim of the negotiations should be the emergence of a free, democratic, non-racial and United South Africa which takes into account the diversity of its society. The longer the Government delays, the more difficult this exercise will become. The longer the Government relies on repression as it\u00a3 main response to demands for change, the stronger will become the position of the in the majority who argue that only force can end apartheid. An increasing majority of South Africans will conclude that there is no way in which apartheid can reform itself through the parody of democracy practised in their country.\nOn the face of it, the outcome of the white elections in May was a victory for those in the minority community opposed to fundamental change. But in reality it was a defeat for everybody. The white minority community voted for the continued exclusion of the majority of the South Africans from having any say. For the tin being, the South African Government may be able to suppress opposition by force. But it cannot stop the clock of history. Apartheid is doomed the sooner the Government in South Africa comes to terms with that fact, the better. President Botha has the necessary majority in Parliament to abolish apartheid, and start paving the way for peaceful development in South Africa.\nThe meeting in Dakar earlier this summer between a courageous group of individual South Africans and leaders of the African National Congress (ANC) leaders illustrated the fact that common ground can still be found between the two communities.\nWe have frequently made clear the sort of steps which we believe the South African Government should take in order to allow a process of peaceful change to begin. We do not believe that a dialogue can take place while leaders of the majority are imprisoned or in exile, their political organizations are proscribed, and the state of emergency continues. Yet Nelson Mandela, probably the most respected political leader in South Africa, has now been in prison for more than 25 years.\nAt the same time, we shall continue to provide assistance to the victims of apartheid, inside South Africa as well as in the neighbouring States. The latter continue to suffer from South Africa's destabilization and armed incursions. We shall continue to monitor every aspect of the effects of apartheid, including human-rights violations and other abuses committed under cover of the state of emergency. The Twelve will continue to use pressure to bring about peaceful change, In the absence of significant progress in the abolition of apartheid, the attitude of the Twelve to South Africa remains under constant review.\nWe call once again cm South Africa to allow Namibia to become independent without delay on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). There is no justification for any other conduct.\nThe Twelve are concerned by the continued of the conflict between Chad and Libya. They believe that Chad has the right to decide its own destiny free from interference from neighbouring countries. They note that there is a territorial dispute between the two countries. Conscious of the dangers inherent in the Present situation, they hope that this dispute can be resolved peacefully, in accordance with international law and as rapidly as possible. They therefore wish to see either a direct agreement between the two parties or recourse to a process of international arbitration. The ad hoc committee created by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in order to deal with the dispute and the International Court of Justice seem the most appropriate bodies. In Western Sahara, we appeal to the parties to respond positively to the Secretary-General's efforts to find a peaceful solution.\nWe note with concern the continued tension in the Horn of Africa and look forward to peaceful negotiated settlements among the countries concerned. We urge them also to take further steps to achieve the peaceful settlement of internal conflicts and to ensure respect for human rights in their countries. We are seriously concerned at the likely extent of food shortages, especially in Ethiopia. We attach particular importance to appropriate policies to help prevent further famine and to promote food security. We recognize the immediate need for humanitarian relief in the region, and are playing our part.\nAs to the division of the Korean peninsula and the continuing tension there, we see a resumption of the suspended direct dialogue between North and South as t e only way to reach a solution by peaceful means. It is our hope that, on the basis of the principle of universality, the people of Korea may soon gain full membership of this Organization. We have been encouraged by the progress made towards democratic reforms in the Republic of Korea. We extend our best wishes for the success of the forthcoming Olympic games.\nThe continued Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea, in violation of the fundamental principles of the United Nations and international law, remains an issue of the greatest concern to the international community. Kampuchea must be free both of foreign troops and of any prospect of a return to the appalling activities of the Khmer Rouge. The Twelve call upon the new leadership in Hanoi o end the Vietnamese military intervention in Kampuchea in order to contribute to a rapid peaceful solution placing the fate of the hard-tried Kampuchean people in its own hands. To that end, we support a settlement of this tragic conflict in accordance with repeated United Nations resolutions, while expressing our firm support for the constructive efforts made by the Association of South-East Asian Nations.\nWe have seen this year In Sri Lanka encouraging proof that, where opportunities are grasped with courage and determination, conflict can be resolved. The Twelve warmly welcomed the agreement signed on 29 July between Sri Lanka and India for a peaceful solution to the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka, a solution which we have long advocated. But such agreements can work only with the good will of all concerned; we urge them to continue to comply with the provisions of the agreement.\nThe Twelve reaffirm the particular Importance they attach to the strengthening and development of relations with Latin America, foe historical, political, economic and cultural reasons. Recent developments in Central America give cause for optimism. We warmly welcome the agreement signed at the Central American summit at Guatemala City on 7 August and supported by the Contadora Group and its Support Group. That agreement offers a historic opportunity to end armed conflict and bring peace and genuine democracy to the region. We have always believed that any lasting solution to Central America's problems had to emerge from within the region itself, and we urge the five countries, as well as all countries with links and Interest In the region, to co-operate constructively in implementing the Guatemala agreement within the time-frame prescribed. The Twelve remain committed to helping them, both by intensifying our political dialogue with the region, which is due to be carried forward by ministers at a meeting in the Federal Republic of Germany early next year, and by using our economic assistance to encourage and strengthen regional co-operation and Integration. \n\nI should like now to turn to a problem from which none of us can be confident of remaining free: international terrorism. This is a scourge that can threaten any of our citizens at any time. The strength of the Twelve's commitment to combating terrorism whenever and wherever it appears is well known. We believe that effective international co-operation is indispensable in responding to the terrorist threat. In that connection, maintaining the consensus in this Assembly represented by resolution 40/61 is in the interest of all. All involved must be made to realize that acts of terrorism can only damage the causes they purport to help. For our part, the Twelve have left third countries in no doubt about our collective determination to take action in this field. No country which lends support to terrorism can expect to enjoy normal relations with the Twelve. When we have clear indications of government support for terrorism we shall not hesitate to act. We are working hard in partnership with other like-minded countries to ensure that the perpetrators of such acts are brought to justice. We think that any Government supporting them should be strongly condemned by the international community.\nIn their approach to the rest of the world, the Twelve continue to attach the utmost importance to respect for human rights. For us, human rights are not a minor byway of international relations) they are of central importance in our dealings with all countries. The concept of human rights is not a convenient catchword to be used in attacking those with whom we disagree. It involves the acceptance of a set of fundamental standards of civilized behaviour by which \u0438 should all be ready to be judged. Over the years, the United Nations has plaid a key role in establishing such internationally accepted standards in this vitally important area. We naturally expect all Members of the United Nations to live up to those standards. We welcome any efforts designed to strengthen existing mechanisms established to ensure that nations' words are matched by deeds. We feel free - indeed obliged - to raise these issues with others when human rights are ignored or abused. The entering into force in June this year of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was an important step in the tight direction.\nWe feel obliged to alleviate the plight of those who suffer from abuse of human tights, not least those who have been forced to leave their country. We think efforts should be made, on the basis of the concept of international solidarity, to improve the protection of the world's refugees. The Twelve reaffirm the role of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as the International focal point for the promotion of durable solutions for refugees in all parts of the world, such as voluntary repatriation, regional integration or resettlement in third countries.\nThe International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, held at Vienna in June this year, was of primary importance to the Twelve. The European Community and its member States participated actively in it.\nThe present overall economic situation is characterized by moderate growth, accelerated and profound changes in the world economy, shifting policy concerns and the persisting difficulties of many developing countries- Among the serious problems facing the world economy are the severe debt problem of many developing countries, continuing protectionist pressures and major changes in the relative weight of the commodities sector. Looming behind these problems is the deteriorating state in some areas of the global natural-resource base upon which economic development depends considerably. \nHowever, there is sometimes a tendency to focus on uncertainties and overlook positive developments, and despite the present uncertainties there is cause for some optimism. Efforts are under way to foster vigorous national economies and a more stable and growth-oriented world economy. Most countries ate endeavouring to combine effectively macro-economic and structural policies, to extend the role of the market and to develop their human potential.\nEqually important is the recognition of the joint responsibility for the functioning of the world economy, with each country contributing to the fostering of an expanding world economy in accordance with its ability. Most recently, this was demonstrated through the adoption by consensus of the Final Act of the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\nIt is indeed a major achievement that all 140 countries participating in the Conference agreed on a common assessment of the relevant economic trends and of their policy implications, as well as on policy approaches and measures to deal with debt problems and resources for development, commodities, international trade and the problems of the least developed countries.\nIn the true spirit of interdependence and partnership, all countries recognized their responsibility, collectively and individually, to contribute according to their capacities and weight in the world economy to attainment of the common objective of revitalizing development, growth and international trade.\nHopefully, the constructive and co-operative approach taken at the Conference will constitute not only a new beginning for UNCTAD Itself but also a milestone in international co-operation. \nThe European Community and its member States worked actively towards this result. We fully support the Final Act of UNCTAD VII and will contribute constructively to the\\\" fulfilment of these undertakings in all the relevant international forums. We expect all other countries, developed and developing alike, to do the same, and look forward to a continued co-operative effort. The financing of the development efforts of the developing countries requires enhanced mobilization of domestic economic and human resources as well as increased external financial flows.\nOfficial development assistance will continue to play a decisive role for a large number of developing countries, particularly on highly concessional terms for the poorer and least developed countries. The European Community and its member States are already large donors. We realize that further efforts are needed to increase the effectiveness of aid and to achieve as quickly as possible the official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as adopted under the International Development Strategy and the official development assistance target of 1.5 per cent of gross national product for the least developed countries as adopted in the Substantial New Programme of Action.\nThe multilateral institutions should be enabled to play a greater part in promoting more satisfactory growth, effective adjustment and mobilization of resources by providing concessional and non-concessional finance and by catalysing additional private capital flows.\nAccordingly, we support a capital increase for the World Bank. We favour an early agreement on a substantial increase. We also welcome the proposal of the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a significant increase in the resources of the IMF's Structural Adjustment Facility and are ready to work actively towards reaching a conclusion of discussions thereon this year.\nHandling the problems of debt facing many developing countries is one of the\nmost important tasks confronting the international community. There has been an evolving response by the international community to the debt problems. There is recognition of the need for enhanced co-operative action on a case-by-case basis by the parties involved and further progress was achieved at UNCTAD VII. In this respect, resolution 41/202, adopted last year, may also be recalled as a positive step. We are convinced that the agreement at UNCTAD VII constitutes an important contribution to discussions of the debt-servicing problem, which will continue in the coming months in the relevant international forums.\nThe debt-service burden of the poorest countries, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, is particularly constraining. We fully accept measures adapted to the needs of these countries, which are undertaking adjustment efforts. Intensified deliberations in the Paris Club have already resulted in larger repayment and grace periods with respect to rescheduled official credit for certain countries in support of their far-reaching economic reforms, proposals for lower interest rates have been put forward.\nTurning to the field of international trade, the European Community worked hard for the launching of the new round of multilateral trade negotiations, and we intend to work vigorously towards its successful and balanced conclusion within the agreed time-frame.\nIn recognition of the importance of trade in tropical products to a large number of developing countries, we are preparing a proposal to be presented at an early stage of the negotiations in the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).\nThe Community remains firmly committed to the objectives and undertakings of the Punta del Este Declaration. As the developing countries progressively develop and improve their trade situation they should participate more fully in the framework of rights and obligations under the General Agreement, thereby allowing positive measures to be taken to meet the needs of the least developed countries.\nLiberalization and expansion of trade are in the interest of all countries and require concerted efforts. We take the agreement at UNCTAD VII as clear evidence that all Uruguay round participants are ready to shoulder their responsibilities. All parties concerned must undertake to adhere to the principles of multilateralism.\nAgriculture remains a major political issue and this field has witnessed major progress in recent months.\nGiven the scope of the problems - for which all countries bear some responsibility - and their urgency, the Ministers of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development agreed in May this year on the principles for a concerted reform of the agricultural policies of their countries, to be implemented in a balanced manner. Reforms of agricultural policies in industrialized countries on the basis of these principles will also be of benefit to developing countries. The European Community reaffirms its commitment to this important agreement and stresses the decisive importance of the Uruguay round in this context.\nThe agreement reached at UNCTAD VII on international co-operation between producers and consumers in the field of commodities drew on past experience, on a recognition of the complex circumstances affecting individual commodities, and thereby laid down the basis for working in the future towards constructive results in this field.\nA similarly realistic approach should be taken with regard to the Common Fund, which might now enter into force after the recent signing by several countries.\nThe need for intensified international co-operation was also highlighted in the recent report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. The report gives us a timely reminder of the fragile ecological balance on which economic development is based. \nThe World Commission has presented a strategy for sustainable development, which includes valuable guidelines to be used by the international community. The Environmental perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond also constitutes a basis for further discussions.\nThe debate on the report of the Group of 18 High-Level Intergovernmental Experts and the adoption by consensus of resolution 41/213 clearly shows the determination of all Member States to reform and improve the Organization. The Twelve hope that the work prepared by the Committee for Programme and Co-ordination (CPC) will be successfully concluded during this session. The Secretary-General has demonstrated his determination to follow up seriously the reform process, and I can assure him of the full support of the Twelve in these efforts.\nIt now remains for the Special Commission undertaking the in-depth study of the United Nations intergovernmental structure and functions in the economic and social fields to show the same kind of determination. The Twelve will continue to work actively for a positive outcome. It must be in the interest of all Member States to ensure that the intergovernmental machinery functions as effectively as possible, in accordance with the Charter. Furthermore, we strongly believe that, together with progress in other parts of the reform process, progress in this respect will contribute significantly to restoring confidence in the ability of the United Nations to deal effectively with issues entrusted to it.\nReform is necessary to restore confidence in the merits of the Organization, but no reform can be completed if the Organization is deprived of the means to fulfil its mission. The Twelve emphasize again the need for all Member States to comply fully with their statutory financial obligations. There have been sufficient examples in the history of the United Nations to prove the value of multilateralism. The Twelve share the view expressed by the Secretary-General in his annual report that a pragmatic approach to the problems of an interdependent world provides a promising basis for broadened multilateral co-operation and for increased effectiveness of the United Nations. The Twelve firmly support a strong and effective United Nations, and trust that this objective is shared by all Member States. However, if we are to reach our common goal deeds must follow words.\nThe forty-second session of the General Assembly started its work last week. The coming months will be characterized by a multitude of meetings in many committees. Let me finish by quoting Piet Hein, a Danish philosopher, who gives the following advice on the arithmetic of co-operation;\n\\\"When you're adding up committees There's a useful rule of thumb: Talents make a difference. But follies make a sum\\\". Let us all add up our talents in order to settle our differences. The net result should be a better world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nThe forty-second session of the General Assembly takes place against the background of some encouraging developments in international relations. It is Guyana  hope that the Organization will be able to Play its part in accelerating this positive trend. We are confident that during Comrade Florin's presidency he will deploy his well\u2014known skills and tact in guiding our deliberations so that we may together reach conclusions which will be to the benefit of mankind as a whole. In offering Comrade Peter Florin an eminent son of the German Democratic Republic, our warmest congratulations on his unanimous elect ion \u0159 I pledge the ready co-operation of my delegation in our search for global understanding and agreement\u00b7\nLet me take this opportunity also to extend felicitations to his predecessor in office# the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, for his admirable conduct of the Assembly  business during the past year.\nAs we contemplate the many major issues which are before the Assembly, we cannot but be struck by their interrelationship and by the fact that the solutions to them must be based on a global approach\u00b7 This is in acknowledgement of the reality that we live in an increasingly interdependent world, one in which it should be the aim of this Organization to advance in an equal way the interests of all Member States.\nPeace, as we all know, is indivisible. So too, I contend, is development. Many of the issues related to development, some of which are topical, affect us all, rich and poor. Debt, drugs and disease are not indigenous to any one people. They are ubiquitous. If we are to ensure global stability, it would be foolhardy to seek their eradication in certain areas while they flourish elsewhere- There are after all no frontiers or boundaries that can halt their wider proliferation. Whether the issue we consider is political, economic or social, whether it pertains to peace, underdevelopment or the environment, national or unilateral action alone would not suffice\u00b7 The action to be taken must be concerted and must involve all States.\nSince last we met, the dialogue on nuclear disarmament has advanced. Unhappily, however, the expectations that had been engendered with regard to international economic co-operation have not materialized; and the principle of multilateralism remains to be fully embraced. It is salutary to observe, however, that the willingness of regional States to solve conflict situations in their areas and to promote economic and functional co-operation, has strengthened.\nIf the results of our efforts have been uneven, one thing remains constant. It is the yearning of the vast majority of mankind for a peaceful international environment and for the creation of conditions that can best secure and sustain their economic development.\nIn the area of the international economy, world output last year, as a measure of our combined productive effort, remained positive; and inflation continued its downward trend. These developments encouraged the expectation of further improvements in the performance of the world economy and of a better quality of life for the many in the developing countries. Sadly, these favourable indications have not been maintained, as output is not growing at the anticipated rate. As a consequence, there is increased concern over the prospects for developing countries and the ability of the world economy to withstand further stress.\nCurrent trends therefore leave us little option but to maintain a troubled view of the condition of international trade? a factor which is so critical to sustained recovery. Not only is its rate or expansion disappointing but there is the real possibility of its contraction, in the light of the intensification of protectionist measures. Indeed, Guyana knows only too well of the damage that protectionist measures could cause to exports. It has seen the access of one of its major exports, sugar, to an important market, progressively reduced in a short period of time\u00b7 The intensification of these measures by industrialized countries is inevitably injurious to the best efforts of development- I venture to say that those who harbour the thought that they are protected from its worst repercussions may awaken too late to its real adversity. Similarly, as regards the terms of trade for primary commodities, the situation is still far from hopeful, despite the upturn in the prices of some commodities and the recent multilateral attempts to salvage international co-operation in this area.\nLast year, in one of its resolutions, the General Assembly placed in its proper perspective the requirements for resolving the debt problem. Those decisions represented an attempt to grapple with a difficult and politically sensitive problem and promised a more positive outlook. Current economic trends, however, especially those relating to output and trade, reinforce apprehension about the extent to which the goal of alleviating the debt burden can be realized. Despite this, we need to build on that determination in the light of the emerging appreciation of the full dimensions of the effect of the problem on national and international policies.\nBeyond that, the current difficulties in the global economy warrant a more concerted approach by the entire community. Indeed, what is required now is the urgent realization that, in economic and social matters, prosperity is very much like peace - integral and indivisible. It is clear that, unless the international milieu favours equitable development among all nations, the welfare of all of us is in jeopardy. Yet the imperatives of co-operation have not been fully heeded. Policies continue to be pursued by some without full consideration of the situation prevailing in the rest of the world- Nowhere is this more evident than in relation to the international monetary system. There remains, unfortunately, an avoidance of global solutions. Instead, selective but limited reforms are pursued. Some of these are in the right direction. \nIn relation to the International Monetary Fund, for example, the mix of policies should be more widely varied in recognition of differing conditions between countries. Where unanticipated or unavoidable factors give rise to adverse growth trends, resources should be made available to support growth programmes; and finally, more flexibility should be employed with regard to quantitative targets and longer periods allowed for demand adjustment policies to take effect.\nThe reforms, however, need to be extensive. Unless this happens, the principles of interdependence and mutual responsibility would be further eroded. A  re-commitment to multilateralism is essential to any solution of the current economic crisis.\nOne positive development in this respect has been the resolve of developing countries to encourage and expand economic co-operation among themselves. Progress in this direction is appreciable, as was evident at the recent Pyongyang meeting of non-aligned countries. The United Nations system can play a valuable role in assisting the promotion of economic co-operation among developing countries. We urge it to do so. \nThe threats to international peace are manifold. These include not only underdevelopment, to which I have alluded  but also regional conflicts and  importantly  adversarial relations between the super-Powers. That is why the improvement in relations between the super-Powers constitutes a significant step towards the diminution of tension and the creation of an atmosphere propitious to the improvement of interstate relations. In this regard, we applaud the efforts being made by the United States and the Soviet Union to agree on the removal from their arsenals of certain categories of nuclear weapons. Such an accord may not be significant in quantitative terms. It can, however, if pursued with sincerity, represent the beginning of a process which could lead to further agreements on nuclear disarmament. Hopefully, it can also usher in a new relationship between the two States, based not on confrontation but on healthy competition within the framework of collective international co-operation, and based upon respect for each other's social system.\nThe United Nations must however maintain total and complete disarmament as an issue of central concern. Preparations for the third special session on disarmament must proceed apace to benefit from the current momentum and to ensure that the outcome goes beyond the meagre results achieved in the past.\nIf all these efforts are successful, resources which are allocated to the preparation for war would naturally be released for other purposes. Such resources should be used for development, especially of the developing countries. In this context Guyana believes that, limited though they were, the results of the recently concluded Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development provide a basis for further dialogue and agreement. We urge all, each Member State, to join in that dialogue. \nIn the meantime, however, conflicts continue to prevail in several regions of the world. Some of them have so far proved intractable. Others offer solutions on the basis of dialogue and negotiation which take into account the interests of the concerned States.\nTo speak of the region to which Guyana belongs - Latin America and the Caribbean - the process of a political negotiated solution is now in the ascendancy. That this is so is due in no small measure to the undaunted diplomacy of the Contadora and Support Groups. The agreement signed by the five Presidents of Central America in Guatemala, following the initiative of President Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica, if scrupulously implemented and universally respected, will offer a reasonable chance for peace in the region. We therefore urge all concerned parties, both inside and outside the region, to respect the Guatemala agreement and to co-operate fully in its faithful execution. The agreement is of transcendental significance, and we believe that the United Nations can play a helpful role in the process of implementation.\nEarlier this year the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, at a special ministerial meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau held in the capital of my country, devoted much attention to the situation in Central America and issued the Georgetown appeal for peace in the region. In his welcoming address, the President of Guyana, Comrade Hugh Desmond Hoyte, observed that \\\"peace in Central America is essential to the security of the whole region\\\". Guyana therefore welcomes the positive developments that have since taken place.\nIt is not without interest that in their attempt to implement the various accords the parties have issued an appeal for immediate economic and technical assistance. This call is in clear recognition that the situation in the area stems not from ideological differences but from the chronic social and economic condition which the States in this region have for so long endured.\nCentral America is therefore in .many ways a microcosm of the third world which, by and large, suffers from structural deficiencies and which, as a consequence, is generally prone to upheaval. The linkage between stability and underdevelopment is, in Guyana's view, self-evident. It is not difficult to see that many political crises originate from essentially volatile economic and social conditions.\nThe search for political negotiated solutions to conflicts is being pursued in other regions. The Involvement of the United Nations in such negotiations is a source of satisfaction to Guyana. In this regard, we commend the Secretary-General of our Organization for his tireless efforts in the discharge of the many mandates with which he has been entrusted. We wish him every success.\nThe continuation of the war between Iran and Iraq is a source of distress to us. We support the most recent resolution of the Security Council, which calls inter alia for a cease-fire, and other efforts which enlarge the prospects for peace in the region.\nAs regards the Middle East, the quickening of the process towards the convening of the international peace conference, involving the Palestine Liberation Organization, is urgently required if peace is to come to the region. For this peace to be just and durable, the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland in Palestine must be respected, as must the principle of the non-acquisition of territory by force, and the right of all States in the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries. \nLikewise, Guyana wishes to encourage the Secretary-General in his patient search for a settlement in Cyprus. The causes of strife, including the continuing presence of foreign troops, must be fully addressed.\nSimilarly, in Korea, where a long divided people yearn for peaceful reunification, efforts must be intensified to pursue the promising signs of an eventual reconciliation.\nGuyana also supports the efforts of the United Nations in bringing about political negotiated solutions to the situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. These solutions must be in consonance with well-known principles of this Organization, especially those relating to sovereignty, territorial integrity and self-determination.\nTurning to the situation in South Africa, I am reminded that during his trial on the trumped-up charge of treason. Nelson Mandela declared that he was fighting \\\"for a society of equal opportunity\\\". That still remains the objective of the oppressed masses in South Africa. For 75 years they have maintained a resolute and passionate struggle, first seeking change through peaceful means, but later driven by the intransigence of the racist regime in Pretoria to engage in armed struggle. The overall struggle of the South African people has been supported by various States and other sectors and forces in the international community.\nSince the last major initiative by the Commonwealth to bring about peaceful change was contemptuously rebuffed and sabotaged by Pretoria, there has been no amelioration of the situation. In fact it has worsened. And the state of emergency has become the norm.\nAn increasing number of erstwhile supporters within South Africa of so-called separate development are now challenging the efficacy of the system of apartheid. Its collapse is inevitable. At this particular conjuncture, it therefore becomes even more Important to support fully the South African freedom fighters and to continue to give material support to the front-line States, against which Pretoria is prone to unleash its military machine. It is also necessary to strengthen and expand existing arrangements, including sanctions, in order to further isolate South Africa, and weaken and eventually eradicate apartheid.\nThis same abominable system o\u00a3 apartheid and plunder also holds the people of Namibia captive. This Organization has long determined the steps to be taken for Namibia's liberation. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will, if implemented in all its aspects, speedily and effectively achieve that objective. The scoff laws in South Africa have however remained intransigent. Unfortunately, this attitude is not being discouraged by other States which have a vested interest in the exploitation of Namibia's rich resources and in supporting South Africa's so-called strategic position. Victory for the struggling masses of South Africa and Namibia is not in doubt. We owe it to them, both in this Organization and outside it, to bring the strongest pressure to bear on the racist regime of Pretoria for an early demission from power. In anticipation of the peoples\u2019 victory, we should seek as well, as my President counselled at the eighth Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement, in Harare, to assist the people of South Africa and Namibia in preparing themselves to take their rightful place in the international community and to enjoy the full fruits of their independence.\nThere are also other issues which lend themselves to concerted global action if realistic solutions are to be found. One of those is the protection of the environment. The report of the World Commission on Environment and Development now before the Assembly calls for an immediate return to multilateralism. As the Commission's report states:\n\\\"The unity of human needs requires a functioning multilateral system that respects the democratic principle of consent and accepts that not only the Earth but also the world is one\\\". (A/42/427, para. 53)\nThe awareness of the fragility of the eco-system which has been so dramatically demonstrated in the report must, in Guyana's view, inevitably give new meaning to the concept of collective economic security. The arguments are persuasive and should lend urgency to joint action in resolving the overwhelming problems now confronting us.\nIn devising appropriate programmes for action, however, there is a need to ensure that developing countries are not penalized for their co-operation; nor should their right to a balanced economic growth be sacrificed. Indeed, when it is considered that the eco-system of the developing countries is necessary for the welfare of the developed world, it is not far-fetched to contemplate some form of compensation for this clear benefit. I urge the relevant committee of the Assembly to give due consideration to this idea as we endeavour to manage the environment properly and thereby ensure the survival of the human race.\nAnother issue of concern to all of us has already proved susceptible to global co-operation. I refer here to our efforts to combat the dangers of drug abuse, a matter which needs to be addressed in all its aspects - production, trafficking and, importantly, consumption. The results achieved at the Vienna Conference earlier this year demonstrate the value of collective action. The follow-up measures which these results require should not be allowed to languish. We must reinforce joint and national endeavours to find disincentives to the continued production and use of noxious substances.\nWe have begun the task of reform of the Organization in acknowledgement of today's realities. The prime objective must always be efficiency and the need to make the best use of resources in the interest of all Member States, what will create difficulties is if the process of adjustment is used to achieve or maintain narrow political advantage. Adjustment must be in the interest of mankind; it must be done with a human face, sensitive to the needs of suffering people and responsive to the imperative of equitable development.\nOver the years there has been a maturation of the concept of an interdependent world. Nation States themselves are undertaking programmes of structural adjustment, not only to promote the welfare of their own people but also to harmonize their relationships in the wider international community.\nFor this process of structural adjustment to be fully effective, new concepts of national and collective security would have to be formulated. In such a scheme of things, confrontation should give way to co-operation, and the needs of humanity should be our foremost concern. Put another way, the war ethic must be replaced by one rooted in peace, multilateralism strengthened and greater reliance placed on dialogue and negotiation for conflict resolution, in this context the importance of sovereign equality cannot be overstressed since it should be the axis on which a democratic system revolves.\nEnormous obstacles will be encountered in furthering the process. We should not however desist from pursuing our objective, which indeed has become imperative. Guyana is fully committed to this goal. The prospects are exciting. Let us go forward together.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like first to express my sincere congratulations to Your Excellency on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. I am confident that, with the wealth of your experience in the conduct of United Nations affairs, your superior wisdom and able leadership, you will guide this session to a successful and fruitful conclusion.\nAt the same time I wish to express my sincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury for his excellent work as President of the Assembly at its forty-first session, and especially for the co-ordinating efforts he made in launching the administrative and financial reform of the United Nations.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express my profound respect to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the painstaking efforts he has been making to resolve difficult international problems, in particular the Iran-Iraq conflict.\nAt the outset I should like to welcome most heartily the agreement that was reached in principle last week between the United States and the Soviet Union on the total elimination of intermediate-range nuclear forces and on holding a third summit meeting between the two leaders this autumn. I wish to pay a high tribute to them for the political determination that has made this possible. Speaking from this same podium nearly two years ago, at the meeting for the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, I stressed that a new global ethic, together with the systems to support it, is necessary if we are to save the earth from the gravest perils of destruction it has ever faced and ensure mankind's very survival. To that end, I expressed the need for an attitude whereby we acknowledge the diversity and value of the world's cultures and civilizations, as well as mutually appreciate and respect them. I argued that the United Nations must become a vehicle for creating, on the basis of that attitude, a global civilization for all mankind.\nEncouraged by the favourable response to my remarks, I should like today to share with you some of my thoughts about the practical means for pursuing my ideas, as well as Japan's position and the role it can play in this regard.\nWe are now little more than a decade away from the twenty-first century. And as we look back, the twentieth century has been a tumultuous age, full of dramatic events and upheavals, unprecedented in human history.\nIn the first half of the century, mankind endured two world wars and experienced the tragic explosion of nuclear weapons. Since then, we have suffered and agonized over the existence of growing stockpiles of nuclear weapons. The two nuclear super-Powers have each now deployed an enormous number of intercontinental ballistic missiles, to the extent of overkill, which could strike directly at the other's vital areas. While both sides recognize the paradox that, inherent in their guest for security through deterrence, is the danger of catastrophe, they have not yet been able to agree fully on arrangements for the reduction and elimination of nuclear arms.\nOn the economic front, less than three decades into the century the world gave way to a rampant protectionism, inviting the disastrous Great Depression that preceded the outbreak of the Second World War. The world economy recovered from the ravages and impoverishment caused by the war f and subsequently attained unparalleled growth and prosperity. However, it was again thrown into turmoil by two oil crises - turmoil from which it has yet to fully emerge. The global economic problems we continue to face, particularly the disparities between North and South, global trade imbalances and instability in international finance, are extremely serious. \nOn the other hand, the scientific and technological advances of this century truly dwarf those of the Industrial Revolution in the latter half of the eighteenth century, and have ushered in a new historical era. From the vast outer limits of the universe to the microscopic matter from which life itself originates, advances in human knowledge in many fields have contributed greatly to improving mankind's material well-being. Applied wisely, this knowledge can dramatically advance the information age and tremendously benefit human society. Applied unwisely, and not properly controlled, it could imperil the dignity of human life or irreversibly destroy the earth's environment, upon which all mankind depends.\nThis century has also witnessed the birth of many independent countries as peoples everywhere, and particularly in Asia and Africa, have sought to exercise their inherent rights and freedom. One after another, these new nations joined the United Nations. The number of independent countries world-wide doubled almost overnight, imbuing international politics with new vitality and marking in world history a new era in which the ideals of freedom, equality and universal brotherhood are pursued. Mankind has not, however, eliminated poverty and hunger in some of those new countries, nor has it done away with regional conflicts.\nMeanwhile, as telecommunications and the means of transport continue to develop, the nations of the world are becoming ever more interdependent, and world unity is growing ever stronger. As this eventful century of tragedy and of hope draws to a close, and we look ahead to a new century, we must ask ourselves what we have learned from the traumas of the Great Depression and the two world wars, as well as subsequent experiences, and what are the lessons we should pass down to succeeding generations.\nHas humanity no choice but to live constantly under the threat of nuclear weapons - a sword of Damocles suspended by a single, slender thread? Have we no choice but to bequeath to posterity a planet that, in an increasing number of regions, is being stripped of its precious air and its verdant foliage, which have evolved over the course of four billion years? Can we really do no better than to pass along to the next generation a world with a burgeoning population and with countries of extreme poverty, untouched by science, technology and modern Industry?\nIf we are to resolve these fateful issues confronting mankind, I believe it is necessary for all of us, all the countries and peoples represented here today, to reaffirm basic principles for joint action in three priority areas.\nOur first priority must be to secure and strengthen world peace. The State must not only serve its own people but, more important, must strive to respect and protect universal human values which transcend national boundaries. This means respecting life and human rights, protecting the irreplaceable natural environment, and preserving those cultural traditions that are the product of human wisdom and labour over the course of many centuries. These values must be respected under any system of government or ideology. This does not of course imply that a State may unjustly expand its power beyond its own borders.\nOur second priority must be to provide vastly expanded guarantees for the free flow of people, information and culture across national borders. I have speculated elsewhere that the Second World War would probably not have occurred had there been  satellite television broadcasts that were freely received, so that peoples everywhere could have identified with each other as members of the same human race, indeed, I believe that the guaranteed freer movement of people and information would provide an important safeguard against a third world war, for avoiding a repetition of atrocities, and for enabling peoples everywhere to share in the joy of living together, amid the rich cultural diversity the world offers.\nOur third priority must be to rectify regional disparities and protect the global environment. For this purpose, each State must refrain from exercising its sovereignty merely for its own self-interests, and must strive to strengthen a framework of international co-operation centred on the United Nations. As we approach the twenty-first century, we must find new ways to enhance the capacity of a global authority.\n\u0389. G. Wells once said that \\\"our true nationality is mankind\\\". As members of the global village that transcends national boundaries, each of us should be challenged by our conscience to apply all the wisdom we have reaped during this century to find solutions to the problems facing us.\nIn my statement here two years ago, I called for a 'global ethic\\\". And just now, I referred to the \\\"global village\\\". These are terms that will surely come into common world-wide use in the twenty-first century, for it is clear, on the one hand, that exchanges and interdependence among countries and peoples will increase dramatically, and, on the other, that all mankind will increasingly face the danger of total annihilation, should the fruits of modern civilization be misused. Men and women of the twenty-first century will simply have to think of themselves as citizens of the global village. A basic principle of life in the village is mutual help. In my home village, if someone did not have a bowl of rice, others would share their rice with him. The same philosophy holds true for the global village. John and Ivan belong to the same village, where there are no distinctions. It is precisely for this reason that the United Nations Charter admonishes us \\\"to practise tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours\\\" as a first step towards realizing its lofty purposes.\nThus far I have stressed the goals that we should pursue, as well as some rather idealistic principles to guide us as we cross the threshold of the 21st century. I should now like to discuss some issues posed by the harsh realities of today's world.\nFirst of all, it is essential to strive to build the confidence needed for the eventual total elimination of nuclear weapons and realization of peaceful coexistence. The agreement reached in principle by the United States and the Soviet Union last week to conclude a treaty on the total elimination of intermediate nuclear forces constitutes the first accord In history for the reduction of nuclear weapons and is a major step forward in this field. As one who has been strongly advocating the complete global elimination of Intermediate nuclear forces, I sincerely welcome this good news. I hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will, as a next step, realize promptly and steadily the plan to reduce strategic nuclear weapons drastically, by 50 per cent, while maintaining a balance of deterrence.\nThe success of such efforts will engender feelings of affinity among the peoples of both nations and win universal support for those efforts. Further V progress can then be made on disarmament and nuclear and conventional weapons, as well as chemical and other weapons, and on strengthening the regime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This in turn will surely lead to progress in resolving regional problems and open up new avenues towards world peace. I believe that a world truly at peace is the greatest gift we can bequeath to posterity.\nI have taken every opportunity to urge both the United States and the Soviet Union to make genuine progress towards nuclear disarmament as quickly as possible. For my part, I shall continue to co-operate towards the success of those efforts.\nIt is very likely that in the final stages of the negotiations on these difficult issues a range of obstacles will arise as details are scrutinized and the formal texts of agreements drafted. It is precisely at this point that the solution to problems should not be left to bureaucrats or military personnel, but must be entrusted to the political wisdom of statesmen who have a far-sighted sense of responsibility to mankind. I sincerely hope that the leaders of both countries, as true statesmen, will make wise political decisions that will long be remembered.\nI should like on this occasion to express the strong hope that the Soviet leadership will take a constructive stance in its policy towards Asia and, with regard to Japan in particular, will work with determination to settle the territorial problem and other pending issues, acting in such a way as to build a genuine relationship of trust.\nThe problems that have been created in the 20th century are our responsibility) we must not pass them on unresolved to the 21st century.\nThe second urgent issue is the need to mount concerted efforts to resolve the grave problems confronting the world economy. In order to promote world economic growth and prosperity, it is essential that the policies of all countries be harmonized and, in particular, that protectionism be resisted. The Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has been  launched as a means of combating protectionism, and we must work diligently to ensure that its goals are achieved.\nWe must not regard the many difficulties confronting the countries of the South simply as the fate of mankind and become resigned to them. While self-help efforts by their leaders and their peoples are obviously essential for the solution of their problems, certain problems, such as recent debt accumulation and export difficulties, are due in part to changes in the world economic and industrial structure for which the countries of the South cannot be held solely responsible.\nWhenever economic failure occurs in any part of the world it is incumbent upon all of us, for the sake of the people in the region as well as of world economic stability, to address the problem and promptly devise all possible means of co-operation in order to avert a crisis. Such co-operation is already evident in the activities of international financial organizations and in various joint efforts among many countries. We should reaffirm our determination to promote these effective efforts even more clearly. Only in this way will all the peoples of the world be able truly to consider themselves members of one human race joined together in a solidarity that transcends national boundaries. At the same time, the nations of the South will be greatly encouraged in their self-help efforts.\nRecognizing that there can be no prosperity for Japan without world prosperity, my country is making every effort to revitalize the world economy and provide assistance to developing countries, while at the same time promoting the internationalisation of its own economy. Deeply aware of its tremendous responsibilities, Japan is determined to make even greater contributions to the international community.\nSince last year Japan has been pursuing a programme to recycle up to $30 billion and has been implementing a plan to provide $500 million in grant assistance to sub-Saharan and other African countries over three years. I look forward to discussing the further implementation of these projects with the countries concerned. On the question of economic co-operation, I believe that it is especially important to promote exchanges among young people and among young business managers, together with the concomitant transfer of technology. At the same time, looking ahead to the 2l8t century, we believe that human resources development and human interaction are all-important in order to achieve progress in public administration and education, and Japan is fully co-operating towards this end \u00b7\nA third issue concerns the settlement of regional problems \nThe roost urgent of the tasks facing us today is to end the conflict between Iran and Iraq which is entering its eighth year, and to re-establish peace in the land that is the cradle of world civilization and return calm to the waters of the Gulf.\nRecently, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 598 (1987) .\nThis resolution was drafted paying the greatest possible attention in the circumstances to the positions of the parties concerned\u00b7 The Council expects the Secretary-General, who enjoys the trust of both parties, to play a key role in its implementation in the belief that there is no other way to resolve this Issue, I strongly urge both parties to put an end to the conflict as soon as possible and establish lasting peace, as called for by the resolution. For its part, Japan has been working to the best of its ability for the restoration of peace, and now in the context of its membership of the Security Council as well# is making every effort in good faith towards that end. At the same time, my country intends to continue to support the vigorous efforts of the Secretary-General. The people of the world earnestly desire to see the Iran-Iraq conflict ended, and I am steadfast in my hope that both countries will respond to that desire and act with sound judgement.\nMoreover, I must emphasize that as a general principle it is of utmost importance for the termination of any conflict and the establishment of peace that all countries strictly refrain from providing weapons to either party.\nElsewhere, it is most regrettable that no concrete progress has been made towards a satisfactory solution to the problems in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. All foreign military forces should be withdrawn completely and without delay from both regions. Japan strongly supports the establishment there of sovereign States that are truly democratic, independent, non-aligned and neutral.\nThe apartheid policy of the Government of South Africa flagrantly violates the principle of racial equality and respect for human rights and roust be abolished promptly and completely. On the Korean Peninsula  parties from the south and the north should, through direct negotiations, seek to ease tensions and achieve peaceful reunification. I support, as one step towards reunification, the admission of both the south and the north to the United Nations. I fervently hope that at next year's Seoul Olympics all the nations of the world will join together in full participation to make the Games once more a truly global festival and that through sports East-West friendship will be promoted and, in particular, tensions on the Korean Peninsula eased.\nFurther, mankind has not been able to escape from the feat of conflicts and wars resulting from human rivalry   nor has it been able to avoid the devastation of major natural disasters. On this occasion, I should like to stress the need for the United Nations to improve and strengthen its capacity to help expeditiously and effectively to prevent natural disasters and render rescue services.\nNext, I should like to say a few words about how we can brighten the prospects for the world as it approaches the 21st century and how Japan can co-operate in realizing these aspirations.\nVery briefly, I feel that we will see emerging a world-wide trend in which people free themselves from the fetters of the dogmatic ideologies of the 19th century, in part this will happen because the earnest desire of people everywhere to escape swiftly from the persistent threat of nuclear weapons transcends all ideologies. Also, people everywhere, regardless of the political and social systems under which they live, are increasingly aware that fundamental economic logic, which is based on freedom and creativity, is stronger than ideology.\nThis trend is manifested in the strong global support for the prompt holding of a United states-soviet summit meeting and the fight against excessive central control and protectionism in the economic policies of East and West. As this emerging trend comes to fruition in both democratic and socialist countries and becomes universal, the influence of rigid ideologies will Inevitably decline and the world will move from confrontation to reconciliation, from conflict to co-operation. Then the potential will become apparent for nurturing the creation of a harmonious world order of a new dimension in which a realistic and practical approach is valued.\nNow I should like to say a little more about my views on overcoming the East-West impasse. The present East-West confrontation is, unfortunately, largely rooted in the structural constraints of the International community, which consists of sovereign States. When we talk to one another face to face we find that, people of every country belong to the same human race and are basically of good will. Yet, once within the framework of a State, it seems that people often change as they are manipulated by State institutions and stand in the front lines of confrontation and rivalry between States. In this sense, one cannot but conclude that in today's international community confrontation and discord between the State and the Individual will never be completely overcome.\nIt is by no means easy for those entrusted with the actual responsibilities of national government to escape this reality. Inherent in nuclear weapons is the dilemma that, although they have the potential for catastrophic destruction, one side feels it must possess them as long as the other side does in order to maintain mutual deterrence. We must find a way out of this impasse so that we can free ourselves from suspicion and fear and return to a world of security and trust. Indeed, would this not once again make our conscience our central guide?\nThe convening of the United States-Soviet summit in Reykjavik in 1986 and the progress achieved there towards an agreement were, so to speak, bright rays of hope for escape from the karma that has prevailed ever since the end of the Second World War. This historic collaboration on disarmament has stirred a fresh breeze of harmony and co-operation world wide, and I am hopeful that it will help generate energy that can be directed in particular to assisting the poorest countries, the developing countries and those with accumulated debts, as well as to preserving the global environment. As the history of Indo-China and the present situation of Afghanistan both so graphically testify, war does not solve problems  on the contrary, it destabilizes the societies of the countries concerned. But have we not reached a crossroads in international politics where through the wisdom of statesmen from every country the course of history can be redirected?\nIt has been about half a century since the systems of the East and West blocs emerged. People in both camps have had pride and confidence in their own systems, but there must also have been times when they experienced doubt. It is high time that we made a greater effort to get to know the realities of the different societies that our fellow men have created. Given the fact that it is now possible to use satellite telecommunications for real-time exchanges of information, should not both sides frankly and honestly open their hearts and show each other the realities of their own countries?\nIt is in this sense I am convinced that, if President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev as responsible individuals belonging to the same human race, can through their third meeting establish a genuine relationship of trust, it will pave the way for all mankind to enter a new era of peaceful dialogue and competitive coexistence throughout the four corners of the globe. Moreover, a phenomenon that transcends the East-West confrontation is now emerging in the economic management of many countries throughout the world. I am referring to the fact that the trend, for example, towards liberalization and the strengthening of market economy principles is spreading. The fact that these terms are gaining common currency everywhere demonstrates that economic logic is being applied increasingly all over the globe. Recently, in developing regions throughout the world and particularly in the Asia-Pacific area near Japan, newly industrialized countries with spectacular growth rates have been emerging. I believe that this has been possible because the countries there have taken advantage of these economic principles and are pursuing policies that tap the energies of their peoples. I am thus most interested in seeing what will be the actual changes in the foreign and domestic policies of the Soviet Union as a result of the perestroika and glasnost is undertaking, and of China as a result of its policy of opening up to the outside world.\nIt is our mission to make this planet Earth, the only home mankind has, a verdant place of peace and freedom. While it is incumbent upon all international organizations to serve this goal, the United Nations is the only global forum that is active in maintaining peace, protecting human tights and enhancing the well-being of all peoples. The responsibilities of the United Nations are tremendous and its continued existence is crucial.\nIt is unfortunately true that the United Nations has not fully lived up to the expectations of it at its founding. It is thus easy to criticize the Organization. Yet, were there no United Nations, how could we possibly maintain order and enhance our common well-being in today's complex international arena? Where else could we find a forum for reflecting the opinions of States all over the world, for bridging the gaps between East and West, North and South? It is precisely at these times of difficulty for the United Nations that we should consider what would happen if it did not exist, and devote ourselves to defending, strengthening and improving the Organization. The United Nations roust become a true United nations. Above all is the need to strengthen its peace-keeping functions. For its part, my country has been malting active efforts to support United Nations peace-keeping operations, mainly through financial assistance. Japan intends to study further how it can contribute even more to strengthening them in the future. \nEver since its admission, Japan has made the United Nations a central pillar foreign policy, and has been making earnest efforts to strengthen and improve the Organization. However, enormous changes have taken place in the international situation and in the United Nations in the years since it was founded. The number of Member States is now far greater than was envisaged at the time of the Organization's founding, and this has not only resulted in making it a colourful mosaic of distinctive characteristics, but is also presenting new and unforeseen issues for its agenda as we enter a new era of civilization. If the United Nations is to be able to respond expeditiously to these changes, it must constantly be reformed. I also believe that in specialized fields, such as economics, the tendency unduly to politicise issues should be corrected.\nI hope all Member States will join together to consider these problems with a view to determining the kind of organization the United Nations should become in the future.\nIf the twentieth century has been an age of destruction, with two world wars and the tragedy of the first nuclear explosions, the next century must be one bathed in the radiant sunshine of peace. Until now peace has prevailed only intermittently, between successive wars. Maintaining and managing peace, and ensuring that it is lasting, will of course be an extremely complex and difficult task. But is it not the obligation of today's statesmen to confront squarely such epochal challenges? The United Nations is, after all, a hall of peace, where statesmen gather and, with the establishment of lasting peace as their common goal, work together with determination and tolerance to nurture and preserve diverse values and cultures, and to enhance the dignity of mankind. On this occasion I pledge that, together with representatives here, I shall shoulder the grave responsibilities placed upon me as one of the statesmen gathered here at the United Nations\u00b7\nThe current session of the General Assembly, in anticipation of the United States-Soviet summit for the reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons, is filled with hope for the future of mankind. Indeed, this is the most significant session in the history of the Organization for ensuring peace and coexistence. Let us work together in the earnest hope that rich blessings will be bestowed upon our children and upon the Earth in the twenty-first century. )\nThe American poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, taught us in his poem, \\\"A Psalm of Life\\\", to act so that each tomorrow finds us farther along the road than today. I should like to conclude my remarks with the closing stanza of that poem:\n\\\"Let us, then, be up and doing,\nWith a heart for any fate;\nStill achieving, still pursuing.\nLearn to labour and to wait\u00b7\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nStates Members of the United Nations have faithfully adhered to a well-established tradition and come to their annual meeting arranged so that they can together consider in a constructive dialogue the problems facing the international community. Every session of the General Assembly constitutes an ideal opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the fundamental purposes and principles of our Organization as set forth in the Charter. The Charter charges Member States with the mission of working for peace and contributing to the development of international relations for the purpose of promoting the prosperity and economic and social progress which all peoples desire. This Assembly provides the framework within which efforts to improve the lot of mankind on the basis of the ethical standards shared by all countries that cherish peace, freedom, equality, justice and progress are harmonized.   On joining the United Nations as its 97th Member, on 18 September 1962, the Republic of Rwanda solemnly expressed its determination to abide by those ethical standards, which are based on equal rights for all peoples and the ideal of peace and co-operation expressed in San Francisco in 1945. The Republic of Rwanda hopes that this ideal will take ever more concrete form and that the efforts of all Member States will ensure that our Organization can carry out the mission assigned to it, Rwanda will always be among the countries eager to work in this sense. At this session the commitment we entered into in this respect, in 1962 takes on a particular significance, for this is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Rwanda and its admission to the United Nations family. \nIn recalling this dual anniversary I wish to reaffirm on behalf of the Government of Rwanda the Republic of Rwanda's support for the objectives laid down in the Charter. This support is accompanied by the hope that the negative factors that imperil the attainment of these objectives will gradually disappear. One of those negative factors is the policy of certain countries which are reluctant to accept the principles based on universal legality} other such factors are the oppression of peoples who legitimately desire respect for their inalienable rights and the persistence of sources of tension and conflicts in the world. These factors cause acute concern at the present time when the world community should be devoting its main efforts to meeting the challenges brought about by the economic imbalances that afflict the developing countries.\nFar from decreasing, the economic difficulties, on which the General Assembly puts growing emphasis, are increasing and taking on new dimensions that bode ill for the progress that all peoples desire. The world economy is still experiencing a crisis which threatens the very survival of the countries of the third world and could thwart their arduous development efforts. The crisis is essentially structural in nature for it affects the mechanisms which govern international economic relations at the present time and has an increasingly negative effect owing mainly to the instability of financial markets, the continuing deterioration of terms of trade, the stagnation in the raw materials markets and the debt problem.\nThe persistence of these forces is a serious obstacle to the development efforts of the countries of the third world, which are thus caught up in a complex and dangerous spiral of the constant deterioration of the world economic situation and the inexorable reduction of their resources, their purchasing power. They are therefore in danger of falling into a state of chronic underdevelopment. \nAt every suitable opportunity the international community emphasizes its concern over this situation, stating that lasting growth for the countries of the third world depends upon increased financial flows to them, more balanced trade and a realistic, concerted approach to solving the problem of indebtedness.\nConsideration of development and economic growth viewed in these terms was a feature of the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which took place in Geneva last July. The pragmatism and realism that characterized that Conference should give a new Impetus to the resumption of the North-South dialogue.\nAmong the results that give cause for optimism regarding the likelihood of finding satisfactory solutions to the most urgent economic problems facing the international community are the provisions made to Implement the Common Fund for Commodities.\nThe developing countries whose economies depend largely on the export of their raw materials ate Indeed pleased that UNCTAD has attributed so much Importance to this question and is considering it from the angle of reducing the negative Impact of successive fluctuations in commodity prices. The international community refuses to accept the inevitability of the decline in and instability of prices confronting third-world producers which must deal with the combined effects of the acts and the fall In their revenue in international markets, where raw material prices have collapsed and ate now lower than they have been for 50 years.\nUNCTAD VII showed that the time has come not for resignation but for realism, the kind of realism that should lead to new efforts to ensure development, taking into account the changes caused by an increasingly obvious interdependence which demands that there be solidarity and complementarity in the promotion of universally shared prosperity. \nThe challenges the third world must face require such an approach, which should be geared towards solutions expressing the collective will to bring about growth and development for the benefit of all parties. In this content the commitments endorsed in UNCTAD should now lead rapidly to concrete actions with a view to overcoming, in solidarity and complementarity, the ongoing crucial problems in the area of international economic relations.\nThe current session of the General Assembly provides an excellent opportunity to bolster the optimism aroused in this respect by the consensus that emerged from the debates at UNCTAD VII and to spell out the priorities that were adopted with regard to improving the lot of the poorest countries.\nIn this spirit, with regards to the clearly expressed desire to channel a larger share of development aid to the least developed countries, the Assembly is called upon to carry out a more thorough debate with a view to having the international community clearly define the ways and means to be mobilized to overcome the obstacles standing in the way of the development of third-world countries. In particular, production capacity must be increased, as must financial resources devoted to development aid; and the constraints inherent in the external debt burden must be alleviated.\nThe debt problem has caused the most acute concern for the third-world countries, in particular African countries. For Africa, the external debt is a heavy burden, a bottle-neck in the development process, for it is one of the many negative factors that are undermining its ability to pay, while the imbalances m international economic trade from which it suffers are being exacerbated.\nAfrica hopes that its partners will take measures to alleviate its external debt burden, which is primarily linked to the economic and financial constraints flowing from deterioration in the terms of trade, together with a deteriorating raw materials prices that create chronic deficits and heighten the crisis in the entire continent, where growth has collapsed.\nThe international community is now well aware of the need to create a more stable economic environment in order to promote development in Africa. More than a year and a half ago the General Assembly adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery 1986-1990. The adoption of that programme was not an end in itself, but an important step in efforts to strengthen active solidarity with a view to restoring African economies.\nSince that time African countries have, and at great sacrifice, made certain structural changes. Africa has thus demonstrated its willingness to deal, in a responsible manner, with the serious problems jeopardizing its development. It is comforting to note that our partners, for their part, have decided to support the efforts of African countries. This commitment must now take the form of concrete action with measures making it possible to improve the international economic climate and establish development programmes enjoying a significant increase in financial resources originating from both bilateral co-operation and institutions specializing in multilateral co-operation.\nThat is how the constructive dialogue that marked the special session devoted to the economic problems of Africa will - above and beyond enhancing the awareness of priority aspects of the development problems facing an entire continent striving for survival - help to generate efforts aimed at promoting a more active form of solidarity. \nThe Government of Rwanda attaches great importance to the efforts the international community is called upon to make in this connection,\tin particular to foster co-operation based on consultations with mutual respect for\teach partner and taking into account the needs, realities and interests of everyone in order to reach a genuine contract of solidarity that leads to meeting the challenges of the times and those flowing from the expectations and aspirations that regulate the progress of Individual countries and peoples on the path to development! and provides a constantly renewed dynamism adapted to the needs of the future.\nAgainst the background of the concerns arising from the persistent economic crisis, the international community must also deal with political problems that engender Insecurity, tension and even open conflict.\nThis Is true of the explosive situation in southern Africa, which is the result of the practices of the racist minority regime in Pretoria - a regime continually at odds with the international community because of its policy of apartheid, its illegal occupation of Namibia and its acts of destabilization and intimidation against the front-line States.\nThe Pretoria regime stubbornly clings to its outmoded anachronistic policies. It has shown an unwillingness to change that is unacceptable and stubbornly refuses to take into account the legitimate aspirations of the South African majority. It has engaged In stalling manoeuvres to delay the Independence of Namibia and made of Its neighbours targets of its State terrorism.\t.\nThe intransigence and arrogance of the champions of the policy of apartheid is an outrage to all countries that cherish peace, justice and freedom and are convinced that the Namibian people must exercise its right to self-determination, that the South African people must be allowed to realize its aspirations to democracy and that the countries of southern African must be allowed to enjoy a climate of security conducive to stability and development.\nWith regard to the problem of Namibia, in particular the Rwanda's Government believes that the settlement plan contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the only appropriate framework for a solution in keeping with the need to realize the right of the Namibian people to live In freedom and dignity. In the firm belief that the ethical standards based on the principles of international law will overcome the unacceptable claims of the Pretoria regime, I cannot fail to reaffirm the unswerving support of the Rwanda's Republic for the freedom fighters who are battling this retrograde regime. Similarly, we continue to support the front-line States, which the South African leaders are trying to subdue by making them the victims of blackmail, destabilization and economic sabotage.\nApart from the situation in southern Africa, where the odious system of apartheid gives rise to oppression and violence, there are sources of tension elsewhere on the African continent and elsewhere in the world. Notwithstanding the constant appeals made from this rostrum for respect for the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, which all States Members of our Organization are committed to respect and promote, international peace and security are endangered by the tendency to support the principle that might is right.\nFor certain peoples - in particular the Sahraoui people and the Palestinian people - the implementation of the principle of self-determination is still but a pious wish, while non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and the peaceful settlement of disputes are principles that continue to be violated.\nThe situations Lebanon, Afghanistan and Cambodia, as well as the war between Iran and Iraq, thus continue to be of grave concern to the Organization. Regarding especially the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq, the international community must persist in its solemn, repeated appeal to the belligerents to seek an appropriate solution, in keeping with the provisions of the United Nations Charter, to their conflict.\nThe Republic of Rwanda believes that, faced with situations such as these, the establishment of a genuine climate of peace in the world depends on efforts by individual States scrupulously to respect the provisions of the United Nations Charter, while encouraging mutual trust and collective security and rejecting confrontation and violence.\nAt each session the debates in the General Assembly reflect the anxiety of the international community caused by the uncertainties that loom over the future of mankind because of the dangers inherent in the arms race. At the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development stress was rightly laid on the need to promote peace, security and disarmament in the interest of increasing the resources available for the struggle for social and economic progress.\nThe Rwanda delegation hopes that, in keeping with the conclusions reached at the end of that Conference, specific provisions will be adopted to remove the threat to mankind posed by the arms race and to carry out the transfers that would make possible spectacular scientific conquests and impose awareness of the correlation established between disarmament and development, between the needs of security and the expectations of peoples in search of progress and prosperity.\nIn this context, the Government of Rwanda attaches great importance to efforts to intensify the constructive dialogue that will give effect to the conviction that security needs demand ever closer co-ordination with the stakes of development considered in the light of the solidarity and complementarity that are a necessary part of international relations.\nWhenever appropriate the Government of Rwanda recalls the fact that the Organization recognizes that divided nations are entitled to seek ways and means to regain their unity, without outside interference or pressure. In this spirit, I should like to emphasize once again the Republic of Rwanda's interest in and the importance that it attaches to efforts to further the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. We hope that those efforts, supported by the collective conscience of the German people and responding to their ardent desire to keep that conscience steadfast, will enable them to recover the unity to which they aspire as an integral part of their heritage. \nMoreover, and still with reference to the United Nations Charter, the Republic of Rwanda supports initiatives aimed at bringing about the independent, peaceful reunification of the Korean nation.\nThe United Nations embodies the sublime ideal of promoting within the international community the values and virtues inherent in aspirations to peace, freedom, justice and social and economic progress. As an institution, it is at the service of peoples which share those aspirations and of Member States, so that they may maintain and develop relations based, above all, on equality and mutual respect, as well as on the awareness that they must act together, co-ordinating their efforts to bring under control the factors and events that influence the future of humanity.\nI-t is in this spirit that the Republic of Rwanda solemnly reaffirms its unswerving devotion to the principles of the United Nations Charter, in the hope that the dialogue and the concerted effort of Member States will give concrete expression to those principles and reinforce the role of the Organization.\nIn this context, we assure the Assembly that the delegation of Rwanda will play its full part in ensuring that the forty-second session of the General Assembly will contribute to the attainment of the objectives of the Organization.\nIn addressing to you, Mr. President, as other speakers before me have done, heartiest and warmest congratulations, I stress our conviction that your prestige, your long experience and your eminent qualities will help guarantee the success of the work that will be conducted by the Assembly under your leadership.\nThe delegation of Rwanda wishes also to pay a tribute to your predecessor, who directed the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly competently and tactfully. I pay a tribute also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the steadfast commitment he has shown in carrying out his functions in such a way that our Organization can continue to serve the interests of peace, solidarity and co-operation between nations. His commitment has earned him the great appreciation of the Government of Rwanda.\nOver and above the success of the work of a session of the General Assembly, the success that the United Nations has in carrying out its mission is and will remain dependent upon the determination of all Member States and of each Member State. There must be a determination to work for a new international order, which can come about only through a policy of entente and co-operation among States, nations and people. There must be a determination to participate in the building of a community based on world-wide solidarity and on co-operation that promotes mutual enrichment and development thanks to the sharing of knowledge and skill, thanks to fruitful exchanges in the spheres of the economy, education, culture, information, science and technology, and thanks to the will continually to broaden the dimensions of international relations, giving priority to those factors that foster balance and harmony. \nThat determination must find concrete expression on every level of the relationships each State hopes to maintain and develop on the international scene, and in signing the United Nations Charter the Republic of Rwanda evidenced it. Guided by the Charter's inherent spirit, Rwanda will always play its part in efforts to bring about the triumph of the ideal to which we subscribed 25 years ago, an ideal that put the world on the path of dialogue, solidarity and complementarity with a view to fulfilling the aspirations of all peoples for peace and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nLast week the General Assembly unanimously elected Minister Florin to the presidency of its forty-second session. I congratulate him warmly, especially since his diplomatic experience is the best guarantee of the harmonious unfolding of our work. The relations between his country and my own, which have been excellent for a long time, are undergoing a remarkable development. My delegation will be happy to contribute, within its means, to the full success of his difficult task.\nI should also like to thank his predecessor, Minister Choudhury, who guided the work of the forty-first session with exemplary efficiency.\nI wish also to pay a particular tribute to the Secretary-General, to his professional qualities, his diplomatic talents and relentless dedication. His efforts to resolve international problems, in particular the conflict in the Gulf, deserve our support and gratitude. In his report to the General Assembly, the Secretary-General affirms his conviction and hope that there will be improved multilateral co-operation, facilitated by a new vision and the necessary pragmatism on the part of Member States. I fully share these conclusions.\nAs in previous years, I wish to make a plea for true universality of the United Nations system. I cannot, therefore, fail to mention the question of the Korean peninsula. I should Like to reiterate that Belgium is in favour of the admission of both Koreas to the United Nations, and in this context, my country expresses the hope for a positive conclusion of direct dialogue between both parties.\nIn his capacity as current President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community, my Danish colleague, Mr. Ellemann-Jensen, has eloquently presented from this rostrum the way in which the 12 member States of the European Community approach the international questions on our agenda. I wish to thank him warmly) and I hasten to stress that Belgium closely associates itself with the statement he made.\nI should like to focus my remarks on a theme which is particularly dear to me namely, the human dimension of international relations. Two years ago we solemnly celebrated the fortieth anniversary of our Organization. It gave us an opportunity to reflect on the purposes of the United Nations, as inscribed in the Charter, and to evaluate their implementation in all fields. Possibly the picture we drew then of the world situation was not an encouraging one, but all Member States did, nevertheless, renew on that occasion the pledge they had made when adhering to the Charter.\nIt was indeed a pledge, a profession of faith. The peoples of the United Nations have declared in the Preamble of the Charter their determination:\n\\\"to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small\\\".\nThe Preamble, which contains the entire philosophy of the United Nations, speaks of social progress, tolerance, common interest, justice and peace; the constituent elements of a universal faith. We made this pledge with conviction, some in 1945 and others as they gradually attained independence. Belgium, for its part, enthusiastically joined the founding Members of the \\\"United Nations for a better world\\\" as early as at the San Francisco Conference.\nIn past centuries my country had the sad privilege of being the battlefield of European Powers. Successive foreign occupations have fashioned the personality and way of life of the Belgians: we are deeply attached to freedom and democracy; we love our common sense, our spirit of tolerance and conciliation are such that our adherence to the Preamble of the Charter is today as in 1945, marked by fervour and great sincerity. Nobody has expressed those feelings better than my illustrious predecessor Paul-Henri Spaak, who presided over the first session of the General Assembly.\t-\nBut reality falls considerably short of pledges. The United Nations may indeed have prevented the outbreak of a third world war. None the less, numerous wars or conflicts continue to plunge families into mourning; millions of individuals suffer from malnutrition and lack of basic health care; fundamental freedoms are flouted in many States Members of our Organization, economic imbalances are not being reduced) and the totalitarianism of some and the fanaticism of others have swollen\u00b7 the flows of refugees, who are unprovided for and often unwelcome.\nHence public opinion is asking some questions and wants to know how the United Nations is endeavouring to implement the credo of San Francisco. Young people, who are the driving force of the better world we all await, are anxious and restless. They realize with bitterness that international relations are not founded primarily on respect for the individual but are essentially inspired by exacerbated ideological considerations, fanaticism and State selfishness, which have little concern for individual and family welfare. In these conditions it comes as no surprise that a sometime sizeable segment of public opinion turns its back on the United Nations.\nTwo years ago we embarked together upon collective self-examination, but I cannot shake off the impression that debates in the United Nations, in New York and in Geneva, sometimes take on an unreal form and often disregard the human dimension without which all multilateral co-operation is condemned to remain sterile.\nMy experience of international relations goes back far enough to keep my optimism intact. This optimism is warranted, I sincerely believe, by a certain number of recent developments on a few essential issues East-West relations, regional conflicts, world economic problems, and human rights. Allow me to dwell upon some of them.\nThe Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which I was honoured to sign on behalf of my country in 1975, is, in so far as it concerns East-West relations, a balanced achievement that tries to overcome the divisions built on the ruins of the last war in Europe. As the emanation of the will of 35 States to foster and develop in mutual respect and tolerance a Europe free from violent conflicts, the Final Act of Helsinki also embodies the hopes for peace of mankind as a whole, since it is true, without a doubt, that a European war would inevitably lead to world tragedy. The Final Act demonstrates our common will to proceed in a particular direction - towards harmonious relations between States, it shows also that for my country and its partners it is essential that in the field of human rights, as in humanitarian matters, the idea must prevail that States exist to serve their citizens, not the other way round.\nFor us, the human dimension is the essence of relations in Europe. True to its long-standing tradition of struggle in the name of human liberty, from the beginning of CSCE Belgium did everything to ensure that in what became the Helsinki Final Act there were appropriate commitments ensuring the improvement of the conditions of life of the individual.\nThe debates at meetings in Belgrade, Madrid and Vienna have demonstrated that the implementation of the provisions of the Final Act in the field of human rights and human contacts has not as yet fully lived up to the hopes of the signatories. Certainly there has been some progress, but it is insufficient  as is clear from the number of violations that have been denounced.\nThe basic principle that laws must be made for man is too often forgotten and supplanted by the concept of man as servant of regulations. That is what guided Belgium's action in the drafting of the Final Act and, later, in the implementation of that instrument and its corollary documents.\nThe Vienna meeting, which opened on 4 November 1986, gave Belgium the opportunity to make its views known and to take appropriate initiatives. In this spirit, Belgium, in agreement with its partners and allies, prepared a proposal the concept and eventual implementation of which should lead to considerable improvement in respect for human rights among all 35 States members of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. That proposal is based on the actual text of the Final Act. It envisages a system of information and representations to Governments in which the individual, as such, has a role to play. Furthermore, it proposes the convening of bilateral meetings to consider litigious cases and a notification procedure for cases or particularly difficult situations, it also offers the possibility for all States to ask for and obtain special meetings of the Thirty-five to discuss and resolve situations or specific cases. \nThis system is completed by the convening of meetings and conferences on the human dimension of CSCE, which will evaluate the implementation of the system, assess the circumstances and possibly recommend new measures. This text constitutes a logical and coherent set of proposals, the driving force for progressive action.\nIn the chapter on the \\\"Third Basket\\\", the Final Act, in addition to the general provisions on \\\"principles\\\", also went into specific themes of fundamental and immediate interest for the free and entice fulfilment of the human being: human contacts, information, culture and education.\nAt the meeting in Vienna, Belgium was also very active in those fields. It submitted proposals pertaining, inter alia, to the right of the citizen to be aware of his rights, a ban on arbitrary arrests, and the rights of national minorities. In the same spirit Belgium has shown its desire to foster progress in matters of freedom of religion, thought, conscience and conviction, freedom of information and working conditions for journalists. Proposals such as those should, in our opinion, be supported unanimously by all signatory States.\nBelgium has also contributed to proposals aimed at improving economic co-operation among participating States while at the same time stressing the part that the individual can and must play in such relations, which also contribute to his personal fulfilment.\nFinally, in conformity with its traditions, Belgium has also used the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to foster new progress in the fields of confidence-building measures and conventional armaments balance. I shall elaborate later on this subject, in which the human element is predominant. In dealing with these important issues of security, disarmament and arms limitation I shall restrict myself to a few points of priority interest to my country since the essence of our views has already been stated by ray Danish colleague, Mr. Ellemann-Jensen, on behalf of the Twelve.\nThe first point that must be made is that the international context and climate are more relaxed than before. We have witnessed over the past few months a series of developments that are unquestionably positive in terms of both East-West relations and disarmament and arms limitation. The odds in favour of meaningful agreements are better than at any other time in recent history. This is the case in particular with regard to intermediate-range nuclear missiles, as shown by the developments of last week, it is true also in respect of the questions of a total, comprehensive ban on chemical weapons.\nThe agreement in principle on the global elimination of intermediate-range nuclear missiles reached in Washington by the United States and the USSR has historic import, as was rightly pointed out by one of the protagonists. It will, indeed, be the first time that negotiations will have led not merely to the beginning of a reduction of nuclear weapons but also to the effectively supervised elimination of an entire category of such weapons.\nBelgium and its allies have done everything possible in the efforts to arrive at this agreement. Since it is directly affected by the question of intermediate-range missiles, my country has a particular interest in it.\nAn agreement of this kind is clearly to be sought on its own merits, given its importance in both the European and the global context. Without seeking to establish a direct link, the agreement on intermediate-range missiles augurs well for speedy and positive result in strategic arms reduction talks. Like its partners, Belgium favours a 50 per cent reduction in the strategic capacity of both super-Powers, so long as this is carried out in conditions that maintain balance and stability.\nIn this context, the problem of the use of space for military purposes clearly remains. We do not think that the possibility of including a defensive element in the strategic balance should be ruled out a priori. The essential point is to retain what we have already achieved: the anti-ballistic missile Treaty. Clearly this requires a common interpretation and a readiness to envisage to the future, if need be, on the basis of a mutually agreed transitional regime. Here too, we should guarantee stability at the lowest possible level of forces.\nIn agreement on intermediate-range nuclear missiles would have a considerable impact on the overall handling of arms limitation and disarmament questions, especially if it could be followed by a strategic arms reduction treaty. A substantial reduction in the nuclear arsenals of the super-powers leads inevitably to questions about the balance of conventional forces.\nIt is certainly possible to dream of a nuclear-free world, but we should begin in a more realistic way by creating simply a less nuclear world, on the understanding that, for Europe at any rate, any progress in this field must be through a balanced reduction in the level of conventional forces.\nFor this reason, my country looks forward to the beginning next year of new negotiations on conventional stability at a reduced level of forces in Europe as a whole.\nReverting to nuclear Issues, the question of a test ban must not be seen as a goal in its own right but rather in the overall context of nuclear disarmament. Belgium believes that realism and a gradual approach are required.\nAt the last session of the General Assembly, I suggested that, while conducting negotiations on a total halt to nuclear testing, the nuclear Powers, in the first place the two super-Powers, should agree to systematic prior notification of all tests and to an exchange of technical data which would make possible progress towards a solution of the remaining problems with regard to verification. It would be useful to couple such exchanges of information with the gradual implementation of a system of verification which, having been tested during nuclear tests could ultimately ensure reliable verification of a general and complete test ban.\nThe most recent round of talks between the United States and the Soviet Union, in Washington, confirms that their differences of opinion have narrowed. Negotiations are soon to begin. The advantages of a gradual approach now seem to be recognized, and we welcome this.\nAnother priority for Belgium Is the speedy conclusion of a convention on the total prohibition of chemical weapons. The urgent need for such an agreement was unhappily underlined once again this year by the use of these horrifying weapons in the Iraq-Iran war. For the first time in that conflict, civilian populations were the victims. Belgium notes with satisfaction the progress made on this subject in the Conference on Disarmament, thanks to the positive attitude of all the countries concerned. The acceptance by the Soviet Union, after that of several other countries, of the principle of challenge inspections made it possible to eliminate a major obstacle. We may thus hope that the Conference on Disarmament will soon succeed In formulating a coherent set of measures to prevent violations by making them detectable.\nIn our opinion the international verification organization will be the cornerstone of a system of verification of chemical disarmament. It should be enabled to begin its work as soon as possible after the entry into force of the convention. I announced during my statement at the Conference, and I am pleased to repeat here, that my country would consider favourably acting as host to that international organization should the Conference request it to do so. In that way my country  the first on whose soil these terrible weapons were used  more than 70 years ago, would place itself at the service of the international community and all mankind in order to contribute to the total elimination of these inhuman weapons.\nOur delegation  together with its partners  will redouble its efforts to attain its goal of eliminating chemical weapons as quickly as possible  and appeals to all the other participants to help to resolve the problems, the technical aspects and complexity of which I do not underestimate.\nAlthough questions of disarmament and arms limitation are global in nature  I have tried to show that our approach  both world-wide and in Europe  is one and indivisible.\nThe International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development concluded its work with the adoption of a final document. Belgium welcomes that positive outcome of a Conference that was called upon to analyse for the first time the complexity of the link that might be established between those two concepts that dominate international relations.\nFor Belgium  both two concepts have their own purposes and logic, and should not be considered as mutually dependent. The link that might be established does not have an exclusively financial dimension. Realism compels us to take into account also the right to security, which is essential for the fulfilment of the aspirations of mankind. Security needs should, however, be evaluated as objectively as possible. Without a doubt, underdevelopment is not only a severe threat to the security of States hut also an impediment to the thriving of individuals and societies.\nHence solutions to such a serious problem must be found world-wide. In this search for solutions, it is not advisable. In my view, that we should try to draw a distinction in the world between the guilty and the innocent parties. Belgium insists on allowing an open-minded, scientific and realistic spirit to prevail. Numerous regions in the world are badly shaken by bitter conflicts some of which have lasted for 40 years.\nIn the Middle East, suffering and violence are daily realities. The parties concerned, opposed to one another for far too long, are unable to apply in their relations the principles and purposes of the Charter. Civilian populations are the first victims of this situation.\nHowever, the idea of an international conference on the Middle East has made progress. My Danish colleague has voiced here the views and aspirations of the 12 Member States of the European Community in this regard. At the beginning of this year I had the privilege to make, on behalf of the Twelve, a trip to the countries most directly involved in the painful Middle East problem. On behalf of my colleagues, I tried to bring positions closer to one another, while recalling the necessary human dimension of a peaceful, just, global and durable settlement. I thought I could detect goodwill on the side of my interlocutors. This made me very happy and restored my hopes.\nThe large number of. victims of the Gulf war cannot leave us indifferent, whatever the political, strategic and economic interests at stake. Let us, however, leave it to the Security Council to try to humanize this conflict, and then to resolve it. Its cruelty and inanity have shocked and outraged the international community. While maintaining strict neutrality in the conflict between Iraq and Iran, Belgium has decided to participate in a purely defensive operation of minesweeping in order to ensure respect for the principle of freedom of navigation in international waters.\nIn southern Africa, positions are polarized to the detriment of the populations involved. It is urgent to establish a genuine dialogue in South Africa and to allow the Namibian people to exercise its right to self-determination.\nIn Central America, rays of hope are appearing. With all my heart I call for an agreement between the countries in the region, based on co-operation, tolerance, non-interference, democracy and the humanization of relations between States and between individuals. I shall not restate the European Community's wish to make a contribution to this effect; my Danish colleague dwelled on it yesterday in his statement on behalf of the Twelve.\nFinally, in Asia, the Afghan and Cambodian peoples are still unable to determine freely and sovereignty their destiny, and this in spite of repeated appeals by the overwhelming majority of Members of our Organization. The Afghan refugees, whose fate I have witnessed during a recent visit, Reserve, in our opinion, more attention from the international community.\nWhen we consider these various conflicts and their consequences, it is not surprising that numerous men and women in the world should ask; What meaning do we give to the obligations Governments have accepted under the Charter? What does the goodwill we proclaim in all circumstances stand for? why are we sometimes brought to trample underfoot the principles of international law though we have reaffirmed them in many resolutions and statements of our Assembly? Mankind needs peace, security, justice and economic and social progress to survive. We need finally to have our deeds match our words. \nIn the economic field, the interdependence of nations has become the leading issue of our debates, and I welcome this. I note, however, that the North-South dialogue is not making progress, that more and more countries have a tendency to withdraw within themselves, or even to wage bitter economic wars. Markets are closing, monetary relations remain unstable, export earnings of developing countries are decreasing, foreign indebtedness rises. The standard of living of populations remains a constant preoccupation. How can we in these conditions preserve human dignity?\nWorld economic recovery is still too slow and uncertain. But it is the urgent duty of us all to co-operate, in solidarity, in creating the necessary conditions for a resumption of genuine growth of the world economy, which would benefit in a fair and balanced way both the industrialized and the developing countries. Like other speakers before me, I welcome the consensus which was reached last July in adopting the Final Act of UNCTAD VII. This consensus, remarkable in itself, augurs well for the outcome of the multilateral trade negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).\nThese expressions of international solidarity are all too rare; that is why I should like to express my real satisfaction on this occasion. Indeed, it is common knowledge that there is very often a direct link between economic stability and peace. Together they form the basis for the advancement of the human person, something to which we have committed ourselves when adhering to the Charter.\nI have tried to put the emphasis on the human dimension in international relations. No one will be surprised therefore if I now also touch upon the problems of terrorism, drugs and AIDS - acquired immune deficiency syndrome. In spite of their fundamental differences, each of these problems is directly related to the preservation of the physical integrity and the life of human beings. I mention there as instances where international co-operation aimed at the individual must be strengthened urgently, in conformity with the respective fields of competences of the institutions of the United Nations system and leaving aside any narrow political considerations.\nThe human rights situation around the world is far from satisfactory. Much remains to be done. Belgium acknowledges the unity and interrelation of all human rights - political and civil on the one hand; economic, social and cultural, on the other.\nMy country has stressed the importance of the latter category of rights when it voted in favour of the Declaration on the Right to Development (resolution 41/128), adopted by the Assembly last year. We cannot, however, accept pre-conditions for the exercise of civil and political rights.\nBelgium considers that respect for these universally recognized and accepted rights is given to varying interpretations depending on geo-political systems, ideologies and cultural environments. For this reason, I stressed five years ago, from this rostrum, the importance my country attaches to the promotion and protection of human rights at the regional level.\nIn 1986 Belgium again became a member on the Commission on Human Rights, where it is contributing to the fullest extent possible and with the utmost impartiality, to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Commission on Human Rights should be given the means fully to carry out its mandate, its action should not be hindered by extraneous considerations.\nMy Danish colleague presented the views of the Member states of the European Community on reform of the procedures and structures of our Organization, following General Assembly resolution 41/213.\nIn my view, the ultimate goal is to restore a climate of confidence between the Organization and all its Members, so as to enable the United Nations to assume its mission with renewed efficiency, in keeping with the Charter's preamble. Let us not forget, however, that such confidence presupposes the full support of our countries' public opinions, media, non-governmental organizations, and all men and women, above all, youth. Indeed, for the realization of their profound aspirations young people rely more and more upon fair and dependable international co-operation\nMan's happiness is indeed linked to the humanization of international relations. My statement today has no other purpose than to recall this truth, which is too often overlooked.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI should like to congratulate you most sincerely. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We are confident that you will guide our deliberations with care and competence.\n1 should also like to congratulate Ambassador Joseph Reed on his assumption of the post of Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs and to welcome him warmly.\nOur grateful thanks go to Mr. Humayun Choudhury of Bangladesh for the wisdom and skill with which he conducted our proceedings at the last session of the General Assembly.\nWe are delighted that the Secretary-General remains in good health, and we express our gratitude and respect to him for his tireless and patient efforts to resolve difficult international problems. \nThis past year has been a year of rejoicing and celebration for our nation, which commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its independence. It was a year of pride and an occasion for reflection and reaffirmation; an opportunity for re-examination of our national values and ideals and reassessment of our aims and aspirations, it was, in fact, a chance to look forward to our future in the light of lessons learned over the past 25 years.\nWe see great merit in this process of slowing down and taking stock of our successes and failures at appropriate times, and that is, of course, what the United Nations did when it celebrated its fortieth anniversary two years ago, which provided an occasion for us all to reflect on its history and Its future. Ringing reaffirmations of faith in its ideals were given that year, and a searching re-examination of how best to achieve those ideals was begun. It has resulted in a realistic assessment that has set in train a process of reform that we are certain will have far-teaching beneficial effects not only on the actual performance of the United Nations and its Members but also on how the United Nations is perceived by the world community. \nThe Secretary-General has noted in his annual report that the adoption last year of resolution 41/213 on the review of the efficiency of the administration and financial functioning of the United Nations was a step that could signify a major turning-point for the United Nations. We agree and, while acknowledging the problems and dangers that remain, we are much encouraged. This then we feel is a year for optimism not only as far as practical matters and reforms are concerned but as far as political will and co-operation within the United Nations process are concerned as well. It seems to us that a generally more co-operative and conciliatory mood is permeating the United Nations, and we hope that this is not only an acknowledgement of renewed faith in the United Nations and its goals but also a revival of the spirit of multilateralism and a recognition of our global mutual interdependence.\nWe see in various situations, which at times may have seemed hopeless, evidence that solutions are possible and in some cases may not be far off.\nThe Iran-Iraq war - that disastrous conflict between brothers - rages on, but we have seen determination and unanimity in the Security Council in its pursuit of a cease-fire and brave persistence on the part of the Secretary-General in trying to bring an end to this tragedy. These efforts must continue, and whatever measures are deemed necessary must be taken to achieve a cease-fire and to stop the fuelling of the fires of this war by the sale of arms to both sides.\nIn Afghanistan, while foreign troops still occupy the land, the negotiations to bring about their withdrawal are at an advanced stage, and we are encouraged to hope that a solution will soon emerge ensuring early withdrawal and enabling the refugees to return home and all Afghans to choose freely their government and to participate in the rehabilitation of their war-torn land.\nIn Kampuchea, while foreign forces also remain and the conflict persists, the Secretary-General states in his report that he has recently detected some signs of movement that he hopes will develop in the right direction, and we are encouraged by this. We note that the Foreign Ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in their meeting in Bangkok on 16 August 1987 have called for a cocktail party\\\" in which the Cambodian factions and Viet Nam can start a dialogue. We applaud ASEAN\u2019s efforts to find a solution to the Kampuchean problem and to promote peace in South-East Asia. We encourage acceptance of the eight-point proposal of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, which calls for national reconciliation leading to a quadripartite government in which all parties would participate and which would be headed by His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, who is widely respected.\nIn Central America, until recently a solution seemed far off; but we see now, with President Arias' ten-point peace plan, the prospect of peace and settlement of problems becoming a more possible reality and we are heartened by the conclusion of the Guatemala accord among the Central American States, an agreement to establish peace in accordance with the principles of sovereignty, common security, non-interference, democracy and development. We must now hope that all parties involved maintain the momentum of the peace process.\t\nOn the Korean peninsula, the reduction of tension between the two parts of Korea is the most essential step towards resolving the Korean question and ultimate peaceful unification through dialogue and negotiation. We hope that dialogue will soon be resumed in the interest of peace and security in the region. As a step towards reconciliation and reunification, we support the admission of both the North and South to the United Nations. The principle of universality leads us to support accession for all those countries that wish it and are prepared to abide by the principles of the United Nations Charter. We consider that the Republic of Korea is already an active member of the international community and that it fulfils those requirements. The Republic of Korea's capital city, Seoul, is to host the 1988 Olympic Games. We hope that the spirit of sportsmanship engendered by participation in next year's Olympics in Seoul will help not only to bring all countries of the world together in harmony but, in particular, to create an atmosphere which will be conducive to the improvement of relations between North and South Korea. We extend good wishes for the success of the Olympics.\nThough the problems in Lebanon and the Arab-Israeli conflict may seem Intractable, there are glimmers of hope. Faint hopes for a peaceful settlement in Lebanon flicker from time to time but, unfortunately, fade before they come to fruition. Outside Interference in Lebanon must cease, foreign forces must withdraw and Lebanon's sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence must be respected. The United Nations Interim Force must also be respected to enable it to fulfil its mandate and carry out its important peace-keeping mission without harassment. We must give it our full support. \nIn the Middle East there has been some progress with regard to the idea of convening an international conference under United Nations auspices, and we feel that with the participation and approval of all parties this would be a most positive development. Any solution to the problem must guarantee both the right of Israel to a secure existence within internationally recognized boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, indeed, to live in their own territory with the authorities and form of government they choose.\nThere is one area of the world where there seems little hope at the moment - South Africa. The South African Government's continuance of the abhorrent system apartheid is completely unconscionable, as is the unjustified delay in the transition to independence of Namibia, which South Africa still illegally occupies and exploits. South Africa's extension of the state of emergency and continuous cruel repression and violations of human rights involving even very young children have made it a pariah among nations, as have its attacks on the front-line States. These States need and should be given international assistance and support. The pressure on South Africa must be sustained, and we support the efforts of the United Nations and the Commonwealth in this regard.\nOne of the most promising rays of hope on the international scene is the proposed summit meeting between the leaders of the United States of America and the Soviet Union, and the agreement between them to work towards the dismantling of intermediate- and short-range missiles. This is the first time in history that there has been a proposal for an agreement that will actually eliminate nuclear weapons, and we see it as a most positive and significant initial step towards the preservation of our planet. We applaud it.\nAnother important step in this direction has been the report of the Brundtland Commission, entitled \\\"Our Common Future\\\", which in its strong and very forthright exposition stresses the urgency of protecting our resources and our environment. Our survival, and that of the Earth's environment, depend on our paying heed to the urgent ecological concerns that scientists throughout the world are bringing to our attention. The Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme has acted most appropriately in submitting to the General Assembly this report and another major report of great significance, \\\"The environmental perspective to the year 2000 and beyond\\\". Countries of the world can no longer ignore the proliferating and worsening threats to our environment, such as the thinning of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect, desertification, deforestation and the ever increasing pollution and poisoning of the earth, sea and sky by waste and chemicals. Acting under the provisions of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer of 1985, Member States have taken a small step by agreeing gradually to phase out chlorofluorocarbons but there is much more to do and it must be done urgently. Our very real concern about the environment is reflected in the recently concluded Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region.\nIn addition to the work on the environmental front, essential work is going on under United Nations auspices in several other fields that urgently affect our chances of survival, and bring us some hope that we might eventually overcome the crisis the world now faces.\nThe International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, which was held in Vienna in June, under the most able presidency of the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mr. Mahathir Mohamed, was an important step forward in attempts to curb this scourge and also a significant example of successful international co-operation. The 35-point programme drawn up by the Conference is a comprehensive battle plan in the war against drugs. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) is continuing its efforts to combat disease and poor health conditions throughout the world. The global tragedy of AIDS (acquired immune-deficiency syndrome) and the commendable response to it made by WHO through its special programme on AIDS has highlighted the importance of international health co-operation under United Nations auspices. WHO will take an essential leadership and co-ordinating role in AIDS prevention, control, research, education and public awareness, and in an information campaign.\nAlthough predictions had been gloomy, the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) proved to be a most significant and important meeting. There was a revival of international economic dialogue and a realistic reappraisal of world economic problems. The Final Act, adopted by consensus, demonstrated that the developed and developing countries can listen to one another and work towards constructive multilateral interaction. We are encouraged by the resolve of the stronger economies to take concrete steps to revitalize development, growth and international trade. In this connection, Japan's decision to channel some of its external surplus to developing countries is most welcome. The serious plight of the least developed countries and the breakdown of the development process in them was acknowledged. The Final Act stated :\n\\\"There was a consensus on the need for full and expeditious implementation of the SNPA and of the recommendations of the Mid-Term Review as adopted.\\\" (Final Act of UNCTAD VII  para; 110)\nSamoa gives its full support to this thrust and trusts that the positive mood engendered by the Conference will continue. \nThe important work being carried out by the United Nations Development Programme in promoting development deserves increasing support. The Programme's input into the development activities of underdeveloped countries is a valuable component of the overall assistance they are given. The United Nations Development Programme must be encouraged to play to the fullest extent the role that it is uniquely placed to play most effectively and efficiently in the delivery of overall development assistance.\nAlso of importance during the UNCTAD VII Conference was the signature or ratification of the common fund for commodities Agreement by many more countries. These were significant steps towards bringing the fund into operation, and the decision by the Soviet Union to sign it was of particular significance.\nSouth-South co-operation is also most important to the world's future, and the convening of the South Commission, which has begun its work, is a promising sign in this area. It is encouraging that many developing countries support the establishment of this Independent Commission of the South on Development Issues, as it is officially titled, and we feel it could not be under more able chairmanship than that of Mr. Julius Nyerere. We hope all countries of the South will support its work.\nThe International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, held recently at United Nations Headquarters, focused attention on the priorities of today that have allowed expenditures on armaments to get completely out of proportion to expenditures on development. Given economic and social underdevelopment, and the misery and poverty afflicting more than two thirds of mankind - to say nothing of the homeless, who are the focus of special United Nations attention this year - the extent of spending on military budgets throughout the world is almost beyond belief. However, some promising developments, such as China's programme to reduce its army by a million soldiers, give us reason to hope that change may come and that it may eventually be possible for the world to focus its attention where it should: on the health and welfare of the peoples o\u00a3 the world.\nSeveral other areas of disarmament show promise. The success of the Conference on Confidence Building Measures in Stockholm in 1986 was gratifying, as is the progress towards a chemical weapons convention. While we are encouraged by these developments we are alarmed by the continuation of nuclear testing and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We view the completion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty as of the utmost urgency, and we place great importance on universal acceptance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nI shall conclude by turning to our own region of the world, and speak in my capacity as current Chairman of the South Pacific Forum.\nI wish to raise a matter which the United Nations members of the Forum have brought before this Assembly and which is of deep concern to us all in the region. It is the situation in New Caledonia.\nThe South Pacific Forum is, as the General Assembly may know, the regional organization of the independent and self-governing peoples of the South Pacific. The Heads of Government of the South Pacific Forum countries meet annually to deal with matters of concern to the region. It was at those meetings that careful consideration of the increasing severity of the problems in New Caledonia led the Heads of Government to their conclusion that United Nations involvement was essential. We therefore sought the re-inscription of New Caledonia on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. It was also the wish of the Forum to pursue dialogue with France in an attempt to have it resume dialogue with all parties in New Caledonia. \nThus the Forum countries requested the re-inscription of New Caledonia in the firm belief that it would assist the progress of New Caledonia towards the exercise of a legitimate act of self-determination in co-operation with the United Nations. We recognized that the principles of decolonization/ including the inalienable right to self-determination established in the Charter and the Declaration on decolonization  applied to New Caledonia. We recognized also that New Caledonia is a Non-Self-Governing Territory in the terms of the Charter and the Declaration on decolonization. Gratefully aware of the constructive role the United Nations had played in the decolonization of the Pacific/ the members of the Forum felt that the United Nations should be involved in the continuation of that process/ as was right and proper.\nThose were our reasons for seeking re-inscription/ and we were gratified to know that the world community/ with valuable support from the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, had taken the same view when resolution 41/41 A received such strong support at the last session of the General Assembly. We are most grateful for that support, which paved the way for the United Nations to play a constructive and proper role in bringing New Caledonia to a genuine act of self-determination in accordance with United Nations practices and principles. We are also pleased at the heightened international interest that this has brought about, which focuses special attention on the plight of New Caledonia's indigenous people.\nSince re-inscription, the Special Committee on Decolonization has twice considered New Caledonia. In March, the Committee adopted a decision calling on France to co-operate with the Committee and to transmit information under Article 73 (e) of the Charter. It urged France to prepare the Territory for a free and genuine act of self-determination. Regrettably, French co-operation has not been forthcoming. In August, the Committee adopted a resolution on New Caledonia after a substantive debate. The resolution, inter alia, regretted that Prance had not responded to the call to submit information.\n\nIt declares that progress towards a long-term political solution in New Caledonia requires a free and genuine act of self-determination consistent with United Nations principles and practices. The resolution emphasizes that such an act of self-determination, in which all options should be made available, should be preceded by a comprehensive programme of prior political education in which all options are impartially presented and the consequences fully explained. Thus the Committee made clear to France what was required of it by the international community.\nThe Committee also provided a valuable forum for petitioners to be heard on the subject, especially the representatives of the indigenous people of New Caledonia. Their representatives will be here again when the question is further considered by the General Assembly.\nIt is clear from what I have said that the French attitude to the United Nations on New Caledonia has been one of consistent non-co-operation. There has been no response to communications from the United Nations on New Caledonia and no information has been transmitted as required under Article 13 e of the Charter.\nFrance has, in fact, not deviated from its unilateral path. It went ahead with its planned exercise - a so-called referendum on the future of New Caledonia - on 13 September. The General Assembly heard the French interpretation of the referendum as provided by the Foreign Minister of France in his statement on 23 September. We in the Forum cannot accept that interpretation. As I have indicated elsewhere, to pretend that the so-called referendum has legitimately determined the political future of New Caledonia is untenable. Given the circumstances, what other result could there have been? Indeed, it was the culmination of sustained efforts by the Government of France over the last several months to produce an outcome favouring continued French rule. In conducting the poll, France paid little or no regard to the established practices and principles of decolonization enshrined in the Charter. The referendum was a unilateral act devoid of any significance in this body.\nWhy do we consider it unacceptable? The basic fact is that it did not conform to the principles of decolonization. It was not conducted in co-operation with the United Nations; the options offered to the electorate were restricted; there was no political education regarding the options; punitive consequences were implicitly and, on occasion, explicitly, attached to the independence option; the administering Power campaigned hard for its preferred option; the opponents of the referendum were severely restricted in presenting their case; the presence of 8,000 French forces, together with police violence against peaceful demonstrations, were inhibiting factors. It was a hollow and sterile exercise.\nIt was no wonder that the great majority of the indigenous people did not take part in such a flawed process. In fact, over 80 per cent of Kanaks stayed away from the polls.\nThe only lesson to be drawn from this poll - and it is one which we must ell deeply regret - is that the basic differences in New Caledonian society remain and have only widened. In our view the referendum resolved nothing, merely aggravating the situation. It is clear that the future of New Caledonia can be assured only by the involvement of those who have long-term residence in and commitment to the Territory. We look to the administering Power to bring about a process of dialogue leading to a free and genuine act of self-determination, consistent with the universally accepted principles and practices of the United Nations.\nMember countries of this Organization, so many of whom have achieved their own independence with the support of this body, should not need to be reminded that all peoples have the right to expect the General Assembly to stand by them in their quest for self-determination. New Caledonia must be seen in this wide historical perspective. The principles that must guide the Assembly in this instance are the very ones it has followed in other colonial situations. They are contained in the draft resolution from the Special Committee of 24 the Assembly will consider later this session. The principles are clear and unambiguous. Attempts to side-step them do a disservice to us all. The Forum members will approach discussion of the New Caledonia item later in this session, guided by these principles.\nMay God guide you in your deliberations.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the people and the Government of Ghana, I extend to you. Sir, our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. Your election is testimony to your high personal qualities and an honour to your country. To your immediate predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, I extend sincere congratulations on the excellent work he did.\nA year ago to this day, the United Nations opened on a gloomy note. There was an unjustifiable questioning of confidence by some Member States as the Organization faced a serious financial crisis. However, the Organization has survived the threat to its future as a force for peace and multilateral co-operation.\t'\nPerhaps nowhere is multilateral co-operation more urgently required than in the solution of the critical economic problems facing Africa, And this was recognized in the adoption last year of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery, and Development.\nIn spite of the bold and politically risky economic reform programmes adopted by African countries prior to and in response to the Programme, there is little evidence yet that our developed partners are responding with the necessary resource flows crucial to the success of the Programme. The Secretary-General of the United Nations himself had occasion during the recent Economic and Social Council session to express concern about the inadequate support the international community has given to Africa's efforts.\nExternal factors that exacerbate the African economic situation remain unaddressed. The prices of primary commodities on which many African countries depend for their foreign exchange earnings have fallen to their lowest level. The anticipated growth in world trade has not occurred largely because appropriate policy measures to stimulate demand have not been pursued. Africa's efforts to expand the export sector through price incentives and the rehabilitation of infrastructure have been counter-productive because the increased volume of primary commodity exports has created an oversupply and exerted downward pressure on prices. Yet some powerful industrialized countries refuse to join multilateral schemes for stabilizing prices and earnings of developing countries from primary commodities.\nIn this context we welcome the decision of the Soviet Union to sign and ratify the Common Fund Agreement within the framework of the Integrated Programme for commodities. We urge all countries that have not yet signed the Agreement, particularly the leading industrial countries, to overcome their initial reticence and join the Fund.\nIf the current steady decline in primary commodity prices is halted, it will go a long way to redressing the deteriorating terms of trade between the developing countries and the developed countries. Losses suffered by the developing countries, including sub-Saharan African countries, from adverse terms of trade in 1986 alone amounted to $94 billion. This represents effective transfer of resources from poor countries to the rich industrialized countries} it is unconscionable and indefensible.\nThat there are severe constraints imposed on the development efforts of African countries by external indebtedness is recognized by all. The debt-service burden is severely hampering the ability of Africa to pursue growth-oriented adjustment policies. Figures supplied by the United nations system indicate that Africa's debt stood at $2U0 billion in 1986, while debt-service payments actually made by Africa between 1983 and 1985 averaged \u00cd6.4 billion annually, representing about 44 per cent of gross domestic product and almost 200 per cent of their export earnings. There are some countries with critical debt-servicing ratios of about 100 per cent of export earnings and above. For the next three-year period, debt-service payment per annum is expected to increase to $11.5 billion.\nThis huge transfer of resources from the most impoverished continent has been at a great cost to socio-economic development. Investment and import programmes have had to be curtailed drastically. No statistics can aptly describe the misery and deprivation that have been caused. Relief must therefore be swift and adequate.\nHowever, the strategy pursued by the donor community and the international financial institutions has primarily been geared towards averting any serious disruption in the financial system rather than alleviating the debt burden. In this connection we recall the consensus resolution adopted by the General Assembly last year on the sort of elements that must go into any strategy for a durable solution of the debt problem.\nThat resolution rightly recognized the vulnerable position of Africa. The international community, pursuant to the provisions of that resolution, pledged to take additional measures to alleviate the continent's onerous debt-service burden. We wish to express our gratitude to Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom and other countries which have converted some African debts into grants. We also note with appreciation the initiatives of the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Paris Club to get the creditor countries and institutions to grant significant debt relief. For a meaningful impact, we strongly urge greater debt-relief measures, including the spread of repayment over longer periods than the 20 years being suggested. We appreciate that national legislative and administrative procedures for granting debt relief have to be observed. But in view of the urgency of the need, we urge the international community to expedite action.\nAt the same time that this huge transfer of resources from developing to developed countries is taking place, the flow of resources and development finance to the developing countries has declined or stagnated. Private lending has dwindled to a trickle compared to the levels attained a few years ago. Only a few developed countries have attained the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product in development assistance to developing countries.\nThe theme for the recently ended seventh meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII), that is, revitalizing development, growth and international trade in a more predictable and supportive environment, through multilateral co-operation, could not have been more appropriate. It focuses on the main areas where new policy initiatives are required. In my delegation's view, UNCTAD provides a unique forum for building international consensus on the interrelated issues of money, finance, trade, resource flows and development.\nGhana wishes to emphasize today, as we did last year, that in an increasingly interdependent world, the rest of humanity will not remain for long insulated from Africa's misfortunes. We therefore renew, once again, our appeal to all to translate the international gestures of solidarity demonstrated at the special session of the General Assembly on Africa into practical support. I now turn to the political scene. Deserving of particular attention is South Africa's continued destabilization of the front-line States of Angola# Mozambique, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe, in utter disregard of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. This is intended to terrorize those countries into denying support for the liberation movements in South Africa and Namibia and to increase the racist regime's dominance of the sub region.\nNo display of brutal force by the apartheid regime will solve South Africa's mounting domestic problems, the solution of which lies in the adoption of meaningful steps totally to eradicate the apartheid system. The necessary steps include the release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners and the initiation of meaningful talks with the legitimate black leadership, with a view to sharing power democratically. The recent encounter in Dakar between a number of anti-apartheid South Africans, mainly white Afrikaners, and the African National Congress and their subsequent visit to some West African capitals, including my own, shows the way to a better future for South Africa.\nWhile the system of apartheid persists, the overwhelming majority of the international community supports the isolation of South Africa - economically, politically and socially - as a way of inducing change. We continue to believe that sanctions will hasten the demise of apartheid if the international community exerts co-ordinated and mandatory international pressure on the racist regime, as is possible under Chapter VII of the Charter. The choice has been made, because it is the only peaceful method left if that country is to avoid a major disaster. We appeal to those countries whose economic and other interests make them refuse to follow the rest of humanity to reappraise their positions. \nThe unsettled Question of Namibia's independence continues to pose a serious challenge to the international community, it is unacceptable that South Africa continues to occupy Namibia well over two decades after the United Nations declared its presence in that Territory illegal. This fact in itself seriously undermines the credibility of our Organization, a situation which we should all work to correct. For this reason, the failure of the Security Council to send a collective and unambiguous signal to the South African authorities after its debate of 6 to 9 April on the Namibian independence Question is a matter of deep regret. The negative votes cast by two permanent members of the Council and the several abstentions only served to strengthen South Africa in its continued stubbornness and refusal to co-operate in the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978 ).\nIt is even more regrettable for a permanent member of the Security Council to continue to link Namibian independence to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. The Namibian independence Question is a decolonisation issue and therefore cannot be linked with a domestic affair of an independent country. Ghana maintains that the people and Government of Angola have the legitimate right to make whatever practical arrangements they think fit for the defence of their country, particularly arrangements necessitated by South Africa's repeated acts of aggression and interference in Angola's domestic affairs. We therefore totally reject the linkage theory and reiterate Ghana's support for the conclusions of the 1986 special session of the General Assembly on Namibia, particularly the call for the isolation of South Africa economically and politically and the immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nThere are other areas of tension in Africa which deserve close attention, but let me single out Western Sahara and Chad. It is regrettable that, in spite of the decisions taken by the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity (OAO) and the Non-Aligned Movement and the 1975 World Court opinion upholding the primacy of the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, Morocco continues to hold on to the Territory. Ghana reiterates its support for the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic and for the right of the Republic to sovereign existence. We again call upon Morocco to enter into negotiations with the POLISARIO Front, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations, to resolve this matter.\nOn the conflict between Chad and Libya, Ghana wonders whether Chad's interest is best served by raising the matter here in provocative terminology that sets the tone for acrimony. It is as though Chad is repudiating the strategy of the OAU Heads of State or Government, which is aimed at avoiding escalation of the conflict through acrimonious debates, in favour of recourse to quiet diplomacy and mediation for the settlement of the dispute. We do not believe that the interests of Africa and the dignity and integrity of the OAU will be advanced by creating the opportunity for mischief by those whose interest lies in fanning conflict for their own national interests, unrelated to the Chadian or Libyan interest in preserving their sovereignty and territorial integrity-\nGhana emphasizes the need for the application of peaceful methods in the resolution of the question of sovereignty over the Aozou strip. This is a question that lends itself to adjudication by the World Court, and Ghana would urge Chad a 3 Libya to follow that course if the mediation efforts of the OAU prove ineffective There is a need for the conflict between Chad and Libya to be brought to an end. We must recognize that a situation of this nature gives Imperialist forces the opportunity to divide and weaken Africa and to subvert the course of the African revolution, of which Libya is a strong pillar of support. \nIn the Middle East the cycle of violence has continued unabated, particularly in Lebanon. Ghana has over the years been involved in United Nations efforts to help the Government of Lebanon to restore normality to the area. It is our hope that the Government of Lebanon will be successful in this uphill task. Meanwhile, we appeal to all the factions and countries involved to assist in bringing peace to Lebanon.\nThe situation in Lebanon is basically a reflection of the continuing problem of a homeland for the Palestinians. Peace in the Middle East will continue to elude us for as long as justice is denied the Palestinian people. Their aspirations can never be suppressed by force of arms. It is our view that all parties, including the Palestinians, under Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leadership, should participate in an international conference called for the purpose of settling the Middle East problem. We call once again upon Israel and its supporters to listen to reason.\nGhana is concerned about the continued stalemate in the Cyprus situation and pledges its support for the Secretary-General's efforts to resolve the conflict. We believe in a unified and independent Cyprus, free from external interference, and the resolution of inter-communal conflict through peaceful dialogue.\nI now turn to the regrettable war between Iran and Iraq. This war, which was occasioned by serious political and strategic miscalculations, is causing enormous human and material losses and has involved the use of chemical weapons and attacks on merchant shipping, in flagrant violation of international law.\nSecurity Council resolution 598 (1987), unanimously adopted last July, may not have met all the concerns of the parties, but it provides a basis for continuing the search for peace. We appeal to both sides to give the provisions of the resolution a trial. We also urge all Member States, particularly the major Powers, to refrain from provocation and the threat of aggression, which would aggravate tension in the area.\nThe situation in Central America, particularly the attempt to subvert the Nicaraguan revolution, continues to cause concern to the Government of Ghana. One would have thought that a region afflicted with serious economic problems would be left free to pursue development and the welfare of its people. Regrettably, the region has had to ward off constant interference in its affairs in a manner that leads one to ask whether the principles enunciated in the Charter, particularly those relating to non-interference in the internal affairs of States, have lost their meaning. \nAgain, in a constructive spirit, we say to our American friends that financial logistical support for the rebels, popularly referred to as contras, is ill-advised. That action, taken together with the covert assistance being channelled to the Savimbi bandits, poses a serious threat to the independence and territorial integrity of the countries of the third world. It is a new dimension in the attempt to undermine the right of the peoples of the third world to self-determination. Happily, there is hope that the countries of Central America are waking up to the need to take their destiny into their own hands and to avoid manipulation by external forces.\nGhana endorses the Guatemala agreement as the most enlightened development of late, we appeal to all parties to enter into serious dialogue within the framework of that agreement to establish peace.\nGhana's attachment to the principle of self-determination compels us to maintain an objective stance on the conflicts in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. We note with satisfaction that the ongoing mediation efforts by the Secretary-General's representative have resulted in a considerable narrowing of positions on the timing of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. It is our hope that the current momentum will not be lost and that intensive efforts will continue to arrive at an acceptable timetable. We also hope that the call for reconciliation announced by the Afghan authorities to encourage the return of refugees, to participate in the reconstruction of their country will be taken up by the opposition and that the supplying of weapons to the rebels will accordingly cease. Similar developments in Kampuchea would augur well for peace in that country, we appeal again to the parties involved in these conflicts to resort to the peaceful settlement of disputes. \nThe same attachment to the principle of self-determination compels Ghana to denounce the recent plebiscite held by the Government of France in New Caledonia. The result cannot be regarded as truly representative of the wishes of the people\u00b7 The regrettable events that preceded the plebiscite, the refusal by France to involve the United Nations in the event, the outright condemnation of the process by neighbouring countries, the alleged participation of residents whose commitment to permanent domicile in the Territory is questionable and, above all, the non-participation of the indigenous Melanesian population raise serious questions about the legitimacy of the outcome. We urge the Government of Prance to appreciate the fact that a peaceful solution, perceived by the international community as reflecting the wishes of the people of the Territory, is possible only within the framework of the United Nations and in accordance with the established guidelines and practices of the Organization\u00b7\nWe also believe that the problem of Korea should no longer be considered a peripheral issue\u00b7 It is a problem that should be resolved through peaceful dialogue by the Koreans themselves, without outside interference\u00b7 We are happy to note that some encouraging steps have been taken in this direction and we hope the two Koreas will adopt a flexible attitude to ensure the reunification of their motherland.\nI turn to arms control and disarmament, which are more topical than ever as a result of the conclusions just reached by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. Expenditures on the acquisition of arms have reached staggering levels. The spectre of nuclear annihilation hangs over our heads. The enormous resources now devoted to arms production could be used to narrow the gap between the affluent and the poor. The Final Document adopted a fortnight ago, shows us the way and therefore deserves the support of all nations.\nIn this regard, it is gratifying to note that an agreement between the United States and the USSR on the elimination of shorter- and medium-range nuclear missiles is within reach and that progress on other fronts seems likely. This is a great leap forward on the road to the achievement of one of the fundamental objectives of the United Nations - that is, a world without war.\nThe fiscal problems of the United Nations remain unresolved. This is surprising in view of the assurances given by several delegations following the unanimous adoption of a series of recommendations for administrative and financial reform of the Organization on the basis of the report of the Group of 18. That unanimous resolution was the result of intensive negotiations. It is even more regrettable since even before the adoption of the resolution the Secretary-General put into effect a package of measures to confirm his commitment to reform.\nAs we stated last year, the financial problems of the United Nations are politically motivated and directed at the weakening of multilateral co-operation, merely because some Member States are unable to manipulate the Organization in their own ideological interests. We appeal to those who for one reason or another are still withholding funds from the Organization to reappraise their positions. The United Nations - and, indeed, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and all the other affiliates of the Organization for that matter - does not claim perfection. But the answer, in our view, is to seek reform of these agencies, not to undermine their existence. We once again call upon all Member States, especially the founding and influential Members of the United Nations, to respect their pledges to uphold the principles of the Charter. \nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm my Government's commitment to the United Nations system and its ideals. We in Ghana continue to view the United Nations a unique experiment in human co-operation. We must secure its future.\n"

        "file_text": "The\tdelegation\tof\tthe\tByelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic extends its cordial congratulations to you, Comrade Florin, on your election to the distinguished and responsible post of President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-second session and expresses the hope that, under your guidance, the Assembly will reach fruitful decisions conducive to peace, 3-operation, and implementation of the lofty purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We are pleased to see the office of President of the Assembly held by a representative of a fraternal socialist State, a man who, weapons in hand, fought against fascism, in the territory of Byelorussia, inter alia.\nWe also extend our greetings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nMr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who this year paid an official visit to the Byelorussian SSR. That visit demonstrated a common desire to enhance the role and effectiveness of the United Nations as an instrument of peace and international co-operation intended to work in the interests of all States and to lay down guarantees of global security with equality for all.\nHopes and constructive efforts, skepticism and counteraction - those are the poles between which the needle of the barometer of political debate in this representative Hall has been oscillating for decades. Today, it is much closer to the point marking hope and positive prospects. Such a phenomenon has not been very frequent in the political climate in recent years. We welcome this favorable trend. There are sufficient grounds for it. International relations are beginning to move towards a qualitatively new dimension, one of constructive co-operation and broad and honest dialog.\nThe Great October Socialist Revolution was a powerful generator of new, positive processes in international relations. In the course of the World War it was the first in history to raise the question of a just and democratic peace without annexations or war indemnities, as well as complete renunciation of any forms of aggression. This year marks the 7 0th anniversary of the Great October Revolution - the most outstanding event of the twentieth century, which has changed the world. There is probably no sphere of social relations that has not experienced its positive effects. The right of nations to self-determination, the equality of great and small nations, the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems, and the goal of general and complete disarmament - these and other progressive political categories were brought into being by the ideas of the great Lenin and the ideals of the October Revolution. The Lenin Decree of Peace brought peoples to the front of the stage of history. It was addressed not only to Governments but also direct to the peoples of the countries at war, something which, incidentally, incurred the acute displeasure of vested interests. These days we hear appeals from the rostrum of the United Nations to the hearts of people and nations and this, too, shows the impact of the October Revolution.\nThe October Revolution made it possible for the people of Byelorussia to gain statehood, embark on a path of economic, social and intellectual progress in the interests of the working masses, and become a participant in international intercourse.\nOver the 70 years, which is historically a short time span, we have traveled a long roads from private property and the resultant exploitation of man by man, to free labor, which released the revolutionary creative energy of the working people? from national inequality to friendship and fraternal co-operation of people of different nationalities; from cottage industry to modern, multi-sectoral industry with highly advanced engineering, chemistry and electronics; from hunger to productive mechanized farming; from illiteracy to universal compulsory secondary education for young people, with numerous colleges and universities. It took tremendous effort and feats of arms to travel this path; for that reason we treasure its results all the more. It should not be forgotten that as a result of Hitler's aggression Byelorussia lost a quarter of its population and more than half of its national wealth.\nA direct extension of the cause of the October Revolution is the process of revolutionary renewal of all aspects of life, which is under way in our Republic and the other fraternal Republics of our country. Greater openness or qlasnost, more profound democratism, the new social and political atmosphere in our society, and the radical reform in economic management have re-galvanized the moral and creative potential of the working people and encouraged their initiative.\nWe are witnessing stable improvements in living standards. The rates of growth of industrial and agricultural production in Byelorussia have now reached more than 6 per cent. Not too many countries can currently boast such a dynamic rate of economic development.\nOur people look forward to the future with optimism. We have set ourselves the goal of doubling our national income and industrial potential by the end of the century, with particular emphasis on improving care of the people and creating all the conditions necessary for a comprehensive and harmonious development of the individual.\nPeace is essential for the achievement of these lofty goals. The First All-Byelorussian Congress of the Soviets of Workers', Peasants' and Red Army Deputies solemnly proclaimed in its appeal on behalf of millions of Byelorussian men and women the will to live in peace and friendship with all nations. The Byelorussian SSR has been invariably guided by that will in it's international activities, including here at the United Nations.\nReliable peace can result only from persevering national efforts and the collective reason of all States. In the current strategic situation no single State, however powerful, can hope to have total security without assistance from others. Such assistance can, clearly, be given only on a mutual basis.\nToday the collective reason of States is starting to mature. As a result of the efforts of recent years the international community has now come to what appears to be a common realization that nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. This is a very important stage, which mankind has not reached easily. Any thought, however, should be crowned with action, with a logical conclusion sustained in practice. The conclusion of this important premise is that nuclear disarmament is essential. In this context, of special importance is the agreement in principle reached recently between the Soviet Union and the United States of America to conclude a treaty on shorter- and medium-range missiles, which brings us closer to the first step towards real nuclear disarmament. The Soviet-American agreement is the most serious argument against the view held until recently that only armament, not disarmament, brings about greater security.\nThe significance of this step is not to be measured by absolute numbers of warheads to be eliminated or by their relative proportion in nuclear arsenals. It opens a door which, it has been proclaimed in the past in various political forums, is impossible to open.\nIt is essential that the movement that has begun should continue its momentum so that the Reykjavik accord between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America to halve their strategic offensive arms be put into effect, while retaining and strengthening the anti-ballistic missile Treaty regime.\nwith a subsequent move towards negotiations on further reductions. It is well known that the Soviet Union has declared that it is ready to relinquish, on a reciprocal basis, its status as a nuclear Power before the year 2000.\nThere have been times in the history of mankind when a transition to the next phase of development required new materials for manufacturing tools as well as requiring new kinds and sources of energy. Those transitions ushered in a new age. Today mankind has reached a time when in order to make a transition to the next stage of civilization - indeed, to ensure the survival of the human species - it is necessary to embrace above all a new way of thinking, which will also usher in a new age.* an age of shaping a nuclear-free and non-violent world, a world without wars or arms, an age of molding a comprehensive system of international security.\nWhen a year ago a number of socialist countries, including the Byelorussian SSR, suggested for the consideration of the community of nations the possibility of establishing such a system, we did not offer any ready-made prescriptions. This initiative is intended for a broad dialog, for the participation and contribution of all. At this stage the multi-faceted exchange of views has begun to crystallize distinct aspects of the general outline. The article by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Parry of the Soviet Union, Comrade Mikhail S. Gorbachev, entitled \\\"Reality and safeguards for a secure world\\\" (A/42/574), which was published at the beginning of this session, offers a basis for serious reflection on this subject, giving promising guidelines for joint work. The article has evoked a positive response among delegations. It is our hope that the current session will continue the process of shaping an agreed understanding of the mechanisms of such a system, a process comparable with the prescription of the great Michelangelo, who, in\ncreating a masterpiece of perfection, simply carved out of a piece of marble everything that was not needed. All the obsolete pieces should be discarded.\nThe interdependence of today's world makes it necessary for us to start building our common safe house simultaneously from all its corners, taking into account the main areas of international relations. Like a.supporting structure, the component areas and units should be permeated with the idea of humanism and the humanization of international relations, for in the final analysis the building is being constructed for the human being. Much has been said here about human rights and the rights of peoples. On the whole, this is undoubtedly a correct perspective. It is incontestable that the foundation of our edifice would be extremely shaky if it were not based on a guarantee of the primary right - the right to life in conditions of peace and freedom. A defect of vision that prevented one from seeing this should be remedied.\nThe retention and build up of armaments, above all weapons of mass destruction, are tantamount to a physical repudiation of the right to life, a kind of assertion of the anti-human right to take away life. Conversely, the fewer armaments the greater the chances of staying alive. The transition to a concept of \\\"reasonable sufficiency\\\", the complete elimination of nuclear armaments and other weapons of mass destruction while concurrently reducing conventional arms - this is what constitutes, from the standpoint of mankind's interests, the logical road to follow.\n\\\"Security through excessive armament\\\", whether quantitative or qualitative, offensive or defensive, constitutes a logic of a different, anti-human dimension. In particular, space weapons lend themselves to juggling with the destinies of peoples from outer space or underground hardened bunkers, but not to ensuring safe skies above our heads.\nThe words of Albert Einstein, a towering intellect in the nuclear age - \\\"You cannot simultaneously prepare for war and peace\\\" - are more than ever well founded. In the well-known Manifesto prepared together with Bertrand Russell, he stressed\n\\\"... that we should learn to think in a new way, we should learn not to ask ourselves what moves should be taken to gain a military victory over the camp to which we do not belong - for there are no such moves - but rather we should ask ourselves what steps should be taken to prevent an armed struggle whose outcome is bound to be disastrous for all its participants\\\".\nIn some areas the international community is already on the verge of taking arms-reduction and disarmament measures. We have already spoken about nuclear disarmament. What is needed now is merely to make several substantial additions.\nAt an appropriate stage it is essential that all the nuclear States, without\nexception, join this process. What is more, the very essence of the emerging Soviet-United States agreement on medium-range and shorter-range nuclear missiles would be undermined if there were attempts to \\\"make up for it\\\" through a buildup of armaments, both nuclear in related categories and conventional.\nThe goal of nuclear disarmament would be brought much closer if the nuclear States and their allies were to renounce the first use of nuclear and conventional arms and the use of force in international relations under any circumstances and in any conditions, as well as discontinue nuclear testing.\nIn this context, we welcome the agreed draft declaration on enhancing the effectiveness of the principles of renouncing the threat or use of force in international relations, which has been submitted to the Assembly for its consideration, and the Soviet-United States agreement on establishing nuclear risk reduction centers and on commencing before this December full-scale, stage-by-stage negotiations on nuclear testing.\nThe outline of a future convention banning chemical weapons is being fleshed out. The current phase of work is the result of extensive efforts, and this process must not be obstructed.\nThe question of eliminating weapons of mass destruction cannot be closed unless measures are taken to prevent the development of new types of such weapons. The lamentable record of abuses of the fruits of scientific and technological progress does not allow us merely to brush off this issue. At the forty-second session the Byelorussian SSR will continue its efforts of many years in this area, with due regard to the positions of other countries.\nThe important sphere of conventional armaments also requires new approaches.\nIn our view, the main principle is simple, namely, that if there are any imbalances they should be corrected. It is essential that this be done through appropriate\nbalanced reductions, rather than through a buildup or \\\"supplementary armament\\\". impart from arms limitation and disarmament measures, in the direct meaning of this term, serious steps of a different nature can certainly be taken in the military and political areas. The Warsaw Treaty Organization has proposed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that their military doctrines be compared. The goal is to ensure their strictly defensive nature. Hie military doctrine of the Warsaw Treaty member States has as its objective the prevention of war, nuclear and conventional. They have declared that \\\"never and under no circumstances will they launch military actions against any State or alliance of States, unless they themselves become the target of an armed attack\\\". To be consistent, one could go even further, that is, to organize armed forces in such a way as to permit defense but rule out offensive operations.\nConfidence and openness in the military field should go hand in hand with disarmament. I note that quite recently the exercises in the Byelorussian military district were subjected to the first United States inspection, on request, in accordance with the 1986 Stockholm agreement. The request of the United States side was met without any delay and the inspectors were able to see for themselves that we comply fully with the obligations under the agreement. That is how, through concrete deeds, step-by-step businesslike and productive relations can and should be built. The process of joint negotiation of agreements and documents teaches us the difficult science of mutual understanding and teaches us also to regard the opposite side as a partner rather than an enemy.\nSpeaking of the search for points of contact and common language on specific matters, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev has said:\n\\\"What is needed here is not only the faculty of speaking but also of listening. Not only of listening to but also of understanding one another, jointly searching for solutions to the most complex integrals of today's world.\\\"\nIn mathematics there is the notion of \\\"imaginary numbers\\\". It springs to mind while listening to some statements made from this rostrum since in many respects they appear to be based on imaginary concepts which, however, are offered to us as absolute. Thus, the term \\\"free world\\\" is enlarged to include several bloody dictatorships the notion of \\\"struggle for democracy\\\" is adapted to accommodate the maintenance of an army of cut-throats whose task is to overthrow the legitimate Government by committing violence against innocent civilians; and the phrase \\\"strict respect for the United Nations Charter\\\" is easily extended to the armed invasion of a small Caribbean nation, as well as to the all-round support of the aggressor which has seized land belonging to its neighbors.\nSurely one should not speak from this rostrum of freedom and at the same time deny in principle and deeds the right of peoples to self-determination and free choice of the means to bring about economic and social development.\nThe efforts of the Contadora Group and the goodwill of the countries of Central America have initiated a very important positive process of putting a peaceful end to the conflict. Yesterday the General Assembly endorsed by consensus those efforts. All parties concerned should create the best possible conditions for its development and must not impede it. Only then will there be a genuinely humane interest meeting the needs of the peoples in the region, rather than selfish interests. In fact, this was mentioned this morning by the President of Nicaragua.\nSomewhat similar and equally positive processes have also got under way in some other conflict areas on our planet. The sprocket-wheels of national reconciliation mechanisms in Afghanistan and Kampuchea have started to move. These are all very difficult and very delicate processes. If we are to heed the voice of reason emanating from the very hearts of the peoples in these countries, what would be more correct - to encourage those processes or to encourage bandit groups to.\nIt is also sufficiently clear that by joint and carefully considered efforts the community of nations can and must find a solution to the dangerous impasse in the Middle East, ensure human rights for the indigenous population of South Africa, ensure the independence of Namibia and all other Territories whose colonial status casts a dark shadow on the prestige of the end of the twentieth century, and find just solutions to the problems of Cyprus and Korea.\nWhat should be the ways of dealing with all these problems? We have repeatedly expressed our views on that, and we stand ready to search together for an answer in each and every particular case. The present situation in the Persian Gulf, however, shows what those ways should not be. The concentration of armaments instead of the concentration of goodwill leads only to the aggravation of the conflict and the escalation of the threat to the countries in the region and to universal security.\nHonesty and purity of intent are important not only in relations among human beings, but also in international politics. The prescriptions of Machiavelli, while they might have been deemed admissible in the distant past, hardly correspond to the notions of rules of conduct on the threshold of the third millennium. We should like the United Nations, this university teaching the science of how States can live together, to become also a school for the humanization of international relations.\nThe transition to this new thinking will not be easy, but this has become an imperative of our age. It is time to abandon State egocentricism and to move towards understanding the primacy of interests common to mankind.\nToday it can be stated, with cautious optimism, that the elements of new approaches and realistic policies have taken root in the world community and are now sprouting. That is borne out by documents of the Non-Aligned Movement. The Palme Commission has been developing a concept of \\\"common security\\\". The Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the Organization, stresses a new component:\t\\\"the\tgrowing commonality factor in international affairs\\\"\n(A/42/1, p. 2) . The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which took place before the opening of the current General Assembly session, emphasized in its Final Document that security comprises not only military but also political, economic, social, humanitarian, human-rights and ecological factors. The Conference noted the importance of a collective approach reflecting the needs of humanity as a whole. That unanimous conclusion drawn by a major conference has great significance and should become a universal guideline for practical action.\nIndeed, if the human being and his heart are our point of departure, then opportunities should be provided for material, financial and intellectual resources to be spent not for the preparation for war but for the improvement of the well-being of nations. One billion people in the developing countries live below the poverty line; 780 million suffer from malnutrition; 850 million cannot read or write; 1.5 billion have no access to medical services; and the same number are unemployed. Disarmament is an important and major source of ready resources for development, including that of developing countries.\nIn the sphere of economic relations, the world community faces immense, complicated problems. It would be, to say the least, an over-simplification to regard private enterprise and the free play of market forces, advocated by some people, as a universal magic wand. Their magic is not the same for everybody. For some it is white, for others it is black. This magic does not produce only shining limousines - a Western symbol of wealth. An army of unemployed, the stone pillows of sidewalks for the homeless, the annual multi-billion outflow of resources from poor countries into the safes of the transnational corporations, the external-debt traps that is what provides the assembly line that turns out those limousines.\nTo overcome underdevelopment, to solve problems of economic security, to establish a new international economic order, to remove everything that burdens world economic relations:\tthose\tare\tthe\tproblems\tthat must be urgently solved.\nThe United Nations is without a doubt the most suitable forum for finding mutually acceptable approaches to those problems on a truly universal and democratic basis, in the interests of all countries. We should like to see its role and effectiveness in this sphere increase in every possible way.\nThe problems of the protection of the environment have been attracting increasing attention. We have no right to live at the expense of succeeding generations. Elementary decency demands that we turn our Earth over to them fit for life at the very least, and flourishing at best. Meanwhile, dangerous levels of pollution of the oceans, rivers, lakes and air, and desertification, lack of fresh water, the disappearance of entire species:\tthose\tare not just warning\nbells; they are the tocsin sounding. For too long mankind has underestimated the scope of the problems, thinking that nature's potential is limitless. Experience has shown, however, that we cannot go on \\\"conquering\\\" it forever. It is time we learned to coexist peacefully with nature, since mankind is a part of it - the best, but also the most vulnerable.\nThe global magnitude of the tasks facing us in this area makes necessary the broadest possible collective efforts in order to carry them out. It is essential to ponder joint projects to protect the environment against the consequences of economic activity and jointly to work out waste-free and clean technologies. The struggle for a flourishing Earth can become a testing ground to teach States how to act together for the sake of highly humane common objectives.\nCo-operation in preventing and treating dangerous diseases is also a promising and necessary area for work. In 1958 the Byelorussian SSR initiated the General Assembly decision for international promotion of research into the treatment of cancer. Unfortunately, the international situation at that time made it impossible to implement the decision consistently. It is even more important now, given the emerging awareness of the commonality of human objectives, to intensify joint efforts for health protection, in particular for combating a disease like AIDS.\nHumanism, in the broadest sense of that word, is, as has already been noted, the main support of the common building of security; it is the cement that permeates all the component spheres of international relations. The new thinking requires that a fresh look be taken at the socio-humanitarian sphere, which should be cleared of the pollutants brought about by the cold war, ideological biases and the purely confrontational approach; it calls for finding an effective framework for international co-operation and for focusing efforts on the universal recognition and observance of the rules of international law and inter-State relations worked out in the United Nations system.\nSpeaking of the need for human contacts, we should also devote attention to the need for mutual understanding among peoples. To that end, it is essential to secure a flow of information that would bring peoples closer together, rather than antagonizing them, which would be objective and unbiased and which would be based on the image of the good neighbors, partner and friend, rather than the enemy.\nIn regard to individual rights, family reunification, a visa regime, and so on, let us all agree to be guided by the international rules that have been worked out. In Bern, the countries that participated in the Helsinki process jointly worked out an important document on this subject, and it was only the position of one State that prevented it from being translated into a joint international standard for the protection of human rights. Even in those conditions, the Soviet Union declared that it would be guided by the letter and spirit of the document. Others should have followed its example. If one pursues the goal of consolidating human rights, rather than some other political goal, one should not obstruct the convening in Moscow of an appropriate forum, as proposed by the Soviet Union, but, rather, should come to that forum with a constructive position.\nThere are many tasks to tackle, and the international community would be more than equal to them. The most important thing is to ensure that genuinely humane goals and ideals are not replaced by mere shams.\nThe United Nations has very lofty ideals and objectives. It is essential that both its status and its authority be at an equally serious level. Regrettably, we must acknowledge that the outdated, selfish stereotypes of politics which are predicated on narrow interests and which have caused the utmost exacerbation of the international situation have also affected the prestige of the United Nations. But the incipient wave of new approaches and the new awareness of realities will inevitably raise it to the proper level. The Byelorussian SSR will contribute to that end in every possible way.\nIndeed, there is no international forum more appropriate for finding a joint solution to the principal problems that face mankind than the United Nations system, which is universal in two ways - the States of which it is composed and the range of problems with which it deals. It should therefore become a real center for harmonizing the actions of States to save the present and succeeding generations from the scourge of war, as envisaged in the Charter, it should be a platform for international law and order. The United Nations possesses powerful machinery for maintaining peace and security which can be used effectively only through the unified political will of States.\nThe Security Council, its bodies, the Military Staff Committee, the negotiating mechanisms, in particular the Conference on Disarmament, the International Court of Justice, the specialized agencies and other institutions of the United Nations system can make our world much more secure and safe if they work at full capacity. In this process, the Secretary-General is called upon to play an increasingly important role. In addition, and in keeping with the challenge of our times, the United Nations can be charged with new functions, and new bodies may be established. The verification and monitoring of agreements which ensure security and disarmament, and the regulation of fruitful co-operation in a peaceful outer space are possible. Only one thing must be ruled out: attempts to influence undemocratically the course and activities of the United Nations. A financial blockade of United Nations activities is absolutely inadmissible.\nIn the process of shaping a comprehensive system of international peace and security, and in actively contributing to all the stages of reducing military potentials, the United Nations - especially in a nuclear-free world - should become a regulator for maintaining the balance at a level of reasonable sufficiency, with\na constant trend towards lowering it. In summing up, the following could be said of the future role of our common Organization; the United Nations must become a guarantor of comprehensive security.\nIt has been said, quite correctly, that wars begin in the minds of men. What should be said now is that genuine peace begins with a new way of thinking. The future belongs to a new way of acting.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI should like at the outset, Sir, to congratulate you on your assumption of the office of President of the General Assembly. I am confident that your experience and skill in various fields will be positive factors that will help to ensure the success of this session. I emphasize the readiness of my Government and delegation to co-operate with you and with the other members of the General Committee.\nI take this opportunity to congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, on the exemplary manner in which he conducted the business of the forty-first session. I wish also to express our pleasure at the re-election of the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, to a second term of office. That election demonstrates the extent of the international community's confidence in the Secretary-General as he administers the affairs of this world Organization.\nSince its inception the United Nations has not ceased to make every effort to contain each crisis as soon as it has arisen. If the United Nations has not yet been able to establish an international order free of the scourges of war, hunger and disease, as desired by the nations and peoples, that is not because of any lack of resolutions or instruments that have received the approval of States, any defect in the legal framework of the Organization or any lack of clarity in its purposes ' and principles. The most pressing need of the Organization is for faith in those purposes and principles and beneficial co-operation among peoples in the interest of all. The United Nations represents the best means through which to ensure peace, security and international co-operation. In the light of the heightened tension at both the regional and the international level, there is an increasingly urgent need for the United Nations to continue to play a leading role in the resolution of disputes and in arriving at peaceful solutions and settlements.\nWe are encouraged by the emerging signs of a possible historic agreement between the nuclear-weapon States to banish the spectre of the nuclear threat that has haunted our international community for decades. Liberation from the nuclear arms race would release enormous facilities and resources with which the International community could arm itself in its campaign against disease, hunger and poverty. It would also reduce existing tensions and restore tranquillity to international relations.\nAs positive signs emerge which promise the establishment of a better climate in relations between the two super-Powers, we hope that advantage will be taken of this climate to give greater, more vigorous and more effective momentum to efforts to solve problems that continue to threaten security and peace.\nThe international community has expressed its hope that a solution will be found to the war between Iraq and Iran, which has consumed more material and human resources than either of those States can afford. Security Council resolution 598 (1987), which received the approval of all the members of the Council, indicates that the right kind of action is being taken to address that conflict. The aim of that Security Council resolutions as we see it, is to bring about peace, harmony and co-operation between Iraq and Iran. Any subsequent steps taken by the Security Council to achieve that aim must be fully justifiable and must not take the form of measures that do not provide an appropriate climate for the achievement of lasting peace. We believe that the United Nations must take measures that inspire a sense of justice and fairness on the part of both parties to the conflict, as that would encourage all concerned to co-operate with the Secretary-General in his peace-making efforts. We in the Gulf are experiencing an extremely difficult and dangerous crisis and we are anxious to see practical solutions to this problem - not solutions designed to complicate and escalate the crisis, but solutions designed to calm the situation and bring about peace.\nThe Sultanate of Oman appreciates and understands the anxiety and concern of the international community regarding the safety of shipping in the Gulf. It recognizes the right of all the Gulf States to ensure the freedom and safety of shipping to and from their ports. Attacks on shipping in the Gulf cannot be justified; they constitute a danger to the interests of all the Gulf States. They also undermine the moat basic principles and laws of international shipping. The Sultanate of Oman! affirms once again that in fulfilling its national and international responsibilities in regulating shipping in the waterways of the Strait of Hormuz, it adheres to the regulations laid down in the Convention on the Law of the Sea and the rules and regulations on maritime safety adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), It calls on all States whose ships pass through the Strait of Hormuz to abide by those rules and regulations.\nThe Western States are making every effort to clear the mines which threaten the safety of shipping in the Gulf. Those efforts will be helpful so long as their action remains within a peaceful context and outside the regional conflict. In the long term the protection of shipping in the Gulf's international waters must be regulated in accordance with United Nations principles and within a framework of joint action and international legality, since this will prevent the extremely sensitive Gulf region from being converted into an arena of conflict between international Powers with apposing interests.\nThe Sultanate of Oman's position on the question of the conflict between Iraq , and Iran is clear and unequivocal. Our objective is peace and stability in the region as a whole. Ours is a State which has close ties to and shared interests with all States in the region. We cannot play a positive role in finding a solution to the current dispute in such as way as to serve the overall interests of the region other than through co-operation with both patties to the conflict. The ties which link us to both the Republic of Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran are ties of religion, good-neighbourliness, history and shared interests in the promotion of those ties would cement co-operation and stability in the region. In our view of our close links with both sister States and by virtue of our location in the Gulf, we have to make every effort to find appropriate solutions with a view to bringing about and ensuring peace and stability, restoring the spirit of co-operation between the Iraqi and Iranian peoples and involving them in the co-operation between all the peoples of the Gulf.\nAmong the issues which continue to threaten security and cause concern to the international community is the question of Palestine, which is the core of the Middle East problem. We welcome the trends and signs that herald the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and to be attended by all the parties concerned. Once again we urge those States which have close ties with Israel to use their influence to eliminate all the obstacles that still prevent the convening of the desired conference. In so urging and in giving our support to the convening of the international conference, we express the hope that it will provide an effective means through which to attain positive results.\nThe Palestinian people, whose homeland continues to be subject to Israeli occupation, continues to have great hope that this conference will enable them to regain its legitimate rights, including its right to self-determination in its own homeland and territory. All the peoples of the region want that conference to lead to a just, honourable and lasting peace. The present circumstances, in which all the parties to the Middle East conflict recognize the importance of peace, provide a significant opportunity which must not be missed. This is the first such opportunity since the conflict began. If it is not seized, the future may not afford any further opportunities for peace in the Middle East, which is one of the most sensitive and dangerous areas in the world. Any future move to abandon the realms of peace would expose the security of the whole world to the dangers of a destructive war. \nWe support the efforts of the Secretary-General, through his Personal Representative, Mr. Diego Cocdovez, to find a peaceful solution to the problem of Afghanistan and express our support for the position of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on this issue. We urge that further# rapid progress be made in the ongoing talks between the parties concerned, under the auspices of the United Nations, in order that the Muslim people of Afghanistan may attain their right to live in peace in their homeland under a system of government of their own choice, without any interference in their internal affairs. \nWe believe that the eight-point proposal adopted by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea on 17 March 1986 may serve as a basis for the solution of the Kampuchean problem. In this connection, we cannot fail to commend the efforts to solve it made by the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) , particularly the praiseworthy efforts of Mr. Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, on behalf of the States of the Association, to promote the peace process with regard to this problem. It is our hope that these efforts will be heeded by Viet Nam and all the other parties directly concerned so that the Kampuchean people may themselves choose the system of government which they consider appropriate. \nThe unstable state of the relations between North and South Korea is a factor which creates instability in the Korean peninsula. Peaceful dialogue between the two Koreas is the only means whereby the points of view of the two States may be reconciled. The admission of both North and South Korea as Members of the United Nations would provide a better climate in which to strengthen and expand peaceful dialogue between the two countries, leading to a reduction in the level of tension in the region. The Sultanate of Oman, believing as it does in the international character of the United Nations, would welcome any international effort to admit the two Korean States to membership of the Organization .\nThe fact that economic, political and social justice has not been achieved in South Africa is a threat to peace and stability in the whole region of southern Africa and, furthermore, a major challenge to the will of the international community. The deterioration of the political and social situation in southern Africa is an inevitable and direct result of the policy pursued by the Government of South Africa, which casts aside the most basic rules of human behaviour. We condemn the arbitrary measures taken by the Government of South Africa against the black majority and cannot help but join with those who call for the immediate Independence of Namibia through the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). South Africa's prolongation of its military occupation of Namibia and its stubborn adherence to the system of racial discrimination will only lead to the shedding of more blood and the undermining of security and stability in that important part of the world.\nThe Sultanate of Oman, In an effort to maintain equilibrium in the region in which we live and to keep that region free from super-Power rivalry, has repeatedly called for the speedy implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI), of 1971. Developments in that region show that implementation of the Declaration would be a major step towards the establishment of international peace and security. There can be no doubt that the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean is long overdue and that it must take place in order that the essence of the Declaration may become the practice. We regret that the Conference has been postponed once again and hope that the resolution of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean, adopted by consensus at its last session and calling for the Conference to be convened not later than 1990, will constitute a final decision.\nThe crisis in Central America has an effect on the harmony among, and the security and stability of, all the peoples in the region. The peace plan adopted , by the Central American Heads of State is an appropriate and significant step in :, the region's peace process. It strengthens and complements the continuing peace efforts of the Contadora Group. We hope that the agreement will mean the beginning of peace and stability for the peoples of the region.\nEncouraging signs of accord are emerging. It appears that the two super-Powers are about to take decisions to eliminate their nuclear stock piles from Europe. This agreement will certainly be of major importance since it will lead to the mutual withdrawal and destruction, for the first time, of operational weapons systems. Another of the most significant results of the agreement is the mutual feeling of emerging trust between the two States and of the need for such an agreement. We hope that any agreement on medium-range nuclear weapons will constitute not an end in Itself but a step towards a comprehensive programme of disarmament and the total elimination of all nuclear weapons.\nWe take advantage of this opportunity to express our satisfaction at and support for the results of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, held in New York from 24 August to 11 September 1987. We believe that the convening of this Conference - the first such under United Nations auspices - strengthens the confidence of the international community in this Organization, increases integration among nations and boosts solidarity in the solution of international problems.\nDuring the 1980s the world economy has undergone structural changes which have had long-term effects on the economies of all States, industrialized and developing alike. Among the main reasons for these numerous changes we cite technological advances, the increasing internationalisation of commercial and financial markets, and the overall economic policies of the major industrialized States, in particular. These changes have had negative effects on growth and development performance in the world in general and developing countries in particular.\nThe world is at present passing through a severe economic crisis, the most evident manifestations of which are the collapse of prices of commodities; the deterioration in the terms of trade, to the detriment of the interests of those States which produce such commodities; the worsening of the debt crisis; the further proliferation of protectionist tendencies; the instability of exchange rates for major currencies; and a marked reduction of economic growth in  the developing countries. All this is accompanied by a slowing down of world economic growth and a decline in the average real per capita income in developing countries. If the affluent countries permit these policies to continue it will mean the developing countries will return to a state of backwardness and poverty and be denied the opportunity to achieve higher levels of growth and revive their economies.\nOpposition to increasing commodity prices, including the price of oil, on an equitable basis with the prices of industrial products will undoubtedly have negative consequences for the economic performance of developing countries and create new complications in the problem of the third-world debt. We call for a genuine reform of the balance of payments and terms of trade, on the basis of justice and balance, to serve the interests of both sides. We reaffirm the importance of the resumption of a serious and constructive dialogue between the nations of the North and the South in order to achieve this objective.\nThe need for a world in which justice and peace prevail among all nations, regardless of size or economic, military or political strength, is today greater, than ever. We firmly believe that the United Nations is the structure within which that objective must be achieved. For that reason we must make greater efforts to strengthen the functioning of the United Nations and increase its effectiveness in maintaining international peace and security. This can be done only if Member States play the role they are called upon to play in promoting the Organization by adhering to its Charter, in order that the Organization may attain its noble \u03ba purposes and preserve its achievements. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPermit me, on behalf of the delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic and on my own behalf most warmly to congratulate Mr. Peter Florin on his election to the high post of President of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its forty-second session. This great honour confers on him by the international community is a recognition of his rich experience as a diplomat and also a tribute to the prominent role of the German Democratic Republic in world politics and in the cause of strengthening universal peace and security. We are confident that under his skilful leadership this session of the General Assembly will achieve fresh success and concrete results in its work. At the same time I should like to express our gratitude to your predecessor, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Mr. Choudhury, for his skilful conduct of the proceedings of the previous session of the General Assembly.\nOur delegation would like to take this opportunity once again to wish the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, good health and every success in his tireless work.\nThe general debate at this session of the United Nations General Assembly naturally mirrors the complex world situation and the most urgent problems of our time. Deep anxieties over the destiny of mankind are juxtaposed with guarded hopes for a turn for the better in international relations.\nA confrontational approach arising from the policy of duress, neo-globalism and the settling of old scores still dominates the statements by representatives of the leading Western Power and some of its closest allies. In this way history is deliberately distorted and truth is unscrupulously trampled underfoot.\nOn the other hand, it is clear that a constructive and responsible approach, a spirit of dialogue and negotiation, which takes into account the realities of the nuclear age is steadily gaining ground. Such an encouraging change is the result of the tireless efforts of the socialist countries, the non-aligned nations, and all other peace-loving forces that advocate a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world.\nToday these forces can only feel satisfaction and optimism at the recent agreement in principle reached between the Soviet Union and the United States on the elimination of their medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles. The realization of such an agreement will constitute an important break in the vicious circle of the arms race and a first step towards genuine nuclear disarmament. An important supplement to this is the Soviet-American agreement on the establishment of centres for the reduction of the risks of nuclear war.\t \nThe joint soviet-American statement of 18 September 1987 gives us hope that the two sides will make further efforts to work out a treaty on the reduction of strategic weapons in the spirit of the talks at Reykjavik while preserving the anti-ballistic missile Treaty. Similarly there is a prospect of full-scale and step-by\u2014step negotiations on the prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests.\nThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic hopes that ell these changes will pave the way for realization of the Soviet programme on the step-by-step elimination of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction by the year 2000. Such a hope is strengthened by the tangible progress being made at the negotiations on the prohibition of chemical weapons.\nIn our view, progress in these directions will give real impetus to the efforts for the implementation of the proposals put forward by the State  parties to the Warsaw Treaty for a substantial reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments from the Atlantic to the Urals, The carrying out of the initiatives advanced by the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia and other European States for the establishment in the centre and other parts of Europe of corridors and zones free from nuclear, chemical and other weapons, and free also from the concentration of armed forces, has now become a matter of immediate urgent and practical significance as a first step towards the attainment of this goal.\nThe article by Comrade Gorbachev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Onion, \\\"Reality and safeguards for a secure world\\\", contains a comprehensive programme of measures for the elimination of the danger of war and for the establishment of a reliable system of international security through the collective efforts of all states under the auspices of the United Nations. To our mind, this document further elaborates and develops.  \nIn the new circumstances, the ideas and objectives of the historical Decree of Peace proclaimed on the day following the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, the seventieth anniversary of which is observed this year by progressive people everywhere. This major event of the twentieth century ushered in an era of freedom, independence and social progress of peoples. It has made peace and peaceful co-existence a State policy. Further testimony to this is the military doctrine of socialism proclaimed by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty. The process of restructuring and the acceleration of socialist construction currently under way in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries strengthens the material foundations of universal peace and security.\nThe Mongolian Peopled Republic holds the view that the implementation of practical disarmament measures will pave the way for the creation of a crucial component of a comprehensive system of international security, namely, in the military and political fields. Another element of such a component is the removal of hotbeds of tension and conflict.\nMy Government is in favour of enhancing the emerging positive trends towards convening an international conference on the Middle East, and of an immediate and just settlement of the situation on the basis of ensuring the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied since 1967, and an effective guarantee of the national independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon and other States of the region. We believe that United action by Arab countries and cohesion in the ranks of the Palestinian resistance movement are of crucial importance in the attainment of this goal.\nThe policy of national reconciliation and the constructive international action set in motion by the Governments of Afghanistan, Kampuchea and Nicaragua have created favourable conditions for a political settlement of the situations caused by the intrigues of imperialist forces and their regional accomplices against these countries. The right of the peoples of these countries to develop along the path they have chosen must be respected by all. Good will and realism should be matched by a positive response and must not be exploited for selfish and imperialistic ends.\nThe Mongolian People's Republic has consistently supported the constructive efforts exerted by the countries of Indochina, the Contadora and Lima groups, and the Sandinista Government, and by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his representatives to bring about a political settlement of the situation in these hotspots. My Government also supports the steps taken by the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, in pursuance of the Security Council resolution on the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. Mongolia associates itself with the appeal for an immediate end to this fratricidal war. The Mongolian delegation has, on more than one occasion, stated from this rostrum that the collusion of imperialist and racist forces is the main cause of the aggravation of the situation in southern Africa. The Mongolian People's Republic condemns their subversive acts against Angola, Mozambique and other front-line States and supports the struggle of African countries and of the Organization of African Unity for the strengthening of peace, independence in the continent, and social progress.\nMy delegation is in favour of the immediate granting of independence to the people of Namibia and of the eradication of the apartheid regime in South Africa. We resolutely reject attempts to link the solution of the question of Namibia with the withdrawal from Angola of the Cuban internationalist servicemen.\nMongolia favours the strengthening of the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and the immediate removal of the foreign military presence in its territory.\nDisarmament measures and an improvement in the international situation in different parts of the world create favourable conditions for the solution of the problems of economic and social development. That truth has been abundantly proved by the outcome of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development held recently under the auspices of the United Nations.\nThe possibility of ensuring the economic and social security of States on a global scale depends, in our view, on transforming their economic interdependence into genuinely equal and mutually beneficial co-operation among all countries in the interest of solving the cardinal problems of human progress. The Berlin declaration of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty, of 29 May 1987, envisages ways and means of solving these problems, in particular the most pressing issues; the overcoming of the underdevelopment of developing countries and the establishment of a new international economic order. Within the context of advancing those objectives, Mongolia takes a favourable view of the results of the extraordinary ministerial conference of non-aligned countries on South-South co-operation.\nProposing that concerted efforts be made towards the creation of the foundations of a comprehensive system of international security, the socialist countries urge the world community to work for a common response to the challenges of the nuclear age. There is no alternative to collective and equal security for all and to peaceful coexistence on the basis of respect for the right of peoples to choose their own way of life and for the right to peaceful and constructive work.\nWe do this in the spirit of the United Nations Charter and in the awareness of the need for the development and practical implementation of its provisions under new conditions. We are also drawing on the experience accumulated so far in international relations. The Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Harare declarations of the non-aligned countries ace important assets in this regard. We believe that those documents, among others, can serve as important basic sources for working out a concept and the content of a comprehensive system of security.\nThe report of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues, set up by the United Nations General Assembly in 1982 and headed by the late Olof Palme, deserves greater attention. That report, entitled \\\"Common security -a programme for disarmament\\\", draws the conclusions that the well-worn path of military competition is a blind alley and that, in the nuclear age, nations cannot achieve security at each other's expense and must begin to organize their security policies in co-operation with each other. \nIn its foreign policy, the Mongolian People's Republic proceeds from the assumption that the strengthening of trust, mutual understanding and co-operation in the Asia-Pacific region has become extremely significant and important for the creation of a comprehensive system of international security. The vast network of economic, scientific and technical potential of the Soviet Union, the United States, Japan, China, India, Australia and the so-called newly industrialized States provides a unique material basis for the development of multifaceted co-operation for the benefit of all, in the interests of strengthening peace and security in the region.\nThe Soviet Union in its 1986 Vladivostok initiative and in the replies by Mikhail Gorbachev to the questions of the Indonesian newspaper Merdeka in July 1987, put forward wide-ranging proposals for building regional international relations precisely along those lines. Those proposals are designed to remove hotbeds of tension and conflict by peaceful means, to reduce the intensity of political and military confrontation in different parts of the region and to develop mutually beneficial co-operation on an equal footing.\nStressing the broad practical significance of the Soviet initiatives, our leader, Comrade Batmunkh, has pointed out that the realization of those initiatives undoubtedly would not only promote the strengthening of the security of the States of the region and the achievement of the universal aspirations for a nuclear-weapon-free world, but would also reduce tension, mistrust and the danger of the outbreak of new conflicts and would make sea and air communication routes in vast areas of the Pacific and Indian Oceans safer. \nPeaceful proposals by the socialist countries and other countries are of particular urgency in the light of the deteriorating situation in the Asia-Pacific region. Militarist and revenge-seeking circles are seeking to turn the region into a new breeding-ground for confrontation with socialist countries and other peace-loving States. Here, the United States first-strike nuclear and missile weapons are being built up increasingly on land, sea and under water and a dangerous partnership is taking shape in plans for the miniaturization of outer space. Attempts are being stepped up to destabilize the situation in progressive and peace-loving States, as is interference in their internal affairs.\nOn the other hand, we have observed many events, many trends, which would indicate that ideas of improving the situation and expanding peaceful co-operation in the region are making headway.\nThe realization of the agreement, in principle, on the elimination of Soviet-American medium- and shorter-range missiles on a global double zero basis, will have an exceedingly favourable impact on the situation in the region.\nThere has been further noticeable improvement in the relations between the USSR and the People's Republic of China in the political, economic and other spheres and this is of great significance for an improvement of the international situation.\nVietnam, Kampuchea and Laos have added new impetus to their efforts to improve relations with the People's Republic of China and with the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and for turning South-East Asia into a zone of peace, stability and co-operation. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward a number of new initiatives designed to eliminate tension on the Korean peninsula and in the Par East and to create the conditions necessary for the peaceful reunification of Korea. We consider particularly timely its proposal for a stage-by-stage reduction of armed forces of the North and South along with the simultaneous withdrawal of American troops and weapons from South Korea. My delegation associates itself with the view that only a reunified Korea could become a Member of the United Nations.\nThe entry into force of the Rarotonga Treaty, which consolidates the process of converting the South Pacific into a nuclear-weapon-free zone, is a significant event in the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons in the Asia-Pacific region. The Mongolian People's Republic calls upon the United States, the United Kingdom and Prance to follow the example of the Soviet Union and China, which have signed the relevant Additional Protocols to the Treaty. My Government supports the struggle of the countries of the region to put an end to nuclear tests in the Pacific.\nThe movement to turn South-East Asia and the Indian Ocean into a nuclear-weapon-free zone and a zone of peace has been intensified. Our country supports the efforts made by India, Indonesia and other States to that end. The Soviet-Indian Declaration of Principles for a Nuclear-Weapon-Free and Non-Violent World represents a major political step in the promotion of new political thinking. Broader application of the spirit of that Declaration in the relations between States of the region would be of great significance for the cause of strengthening international security.\nThe Mongolian People's Republic is endeavouring to promote confidence and mutual understanding and the development of good-neighbourly relations among countries of the Asia-Pacific region and actively supports all constructive initiatives to that end. Mongolia, in its turn, is taking concrete steps to promote its idea of establishing international machinery designed to rule out effectively the use of force in the relations between the States of Asia and the Pacific.\nThe withdrawal by mutual consent in April-June this year of a substantial part of the limited contingent of Soviet troops temporarily stationed in Mongolia at the request of my Government serves to strengthen the atmosphere of trust and mutual understanding in the region.\nA number of important international meetings of State and public representatives of countries of the region have been held recently in ray country on the problems of strengthening peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region. Our relations with the countries of the region have been considerably expanded and the level of political dialogue with many of them has been raised. My Government will continue to make efforts to promote the strengthening of mutual understanding, good-neighbourly relations and co-operation among the countries of the region.\nThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic believes that the role of the United Nations has increased as never before as an instrument for the maintenance of international peace and as a centre for harmonizing the efforts of States with a view to finding appropriate solutions to universal problems. It reiterated once again its consistent support for the activities of the United Nations during the memorable visit of the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, to my country in May this year. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic attaches great significance to the broad range of ideas and concrete proposals contained in the article I have mentioned by Mr, Mikhail Gorbachev on enhancing the role of the United Nations in strengthening world peace and in establishing the foundations of a comprehensive system of international security. \nIn the opinion of my delegation, the proposal of the United Nations Secretary-General on the establishment in this Organization of a multilateral centre on the reduction of the risks of war and his ideas concerning regional centres for the promotion of peace and disarmament are timely. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic shares his view that outer space should remain free of weapons. We maintain that while developing international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space it is imperative to pay particular attention to the strengthening of international instruments prohibiting the use of space for military purposes, especially the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States In the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies.\nThe Mongolian People's Republic considers that the time is ripe for our Organization to deal with matters relating to the prevention of an extremely dangerous potential type of terrorism, namely, nuclear terrorism, by adventurist elements.\nThe adoption at this session of the General Assembly of the declaration on the enhancement of the effectiveness of the principle of non-use of force in international relations would constitute a practical contribution by the United Nations to the reinforcement of the concept of equal security for all. It would also promote the practical implementation of the provisions of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security and of the Declaration on the Right of Peoples to Peace, previously adopted by the United Nations. My delegation hopes that this session of the General Assembly will mark an important milestone towards the achievement of the goals of enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations in implementing the provisions of its Charter. For its part my delegation will do its utmost to promote the success of the work of the session.\nIn conclusion I should like to announce that the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic, as a token of its consistent support for United Nations activities, has decided to make a voluntary contribution of $US 20 U0U during 1987 and 1988, bearing in mind the financial difficulties the United Nations is at present experiencing. Certainly, the sum is very modest; nevertheless I hope the motives behind the gesture will be clear to all who are conscious of the need to lend every support to our Organization. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, your election to guide the work of this session honours you and gives us cause for rejoicing for, given your qualities as an experienced diplomat and your great experience of the United Nations system, we know that you will lead us to our objective. Moreover, coming from the German Democratic Republic, a country with < rich history, and belonging as you do to a rather special generation, you have a special sensitivity that will enable you to help us in finding the compromises necessary to resolve the many problems that confront us. My delegation, which is particularly pleased at your election, will give you and the other officers of this Assembly all possible assistance.\nWe join other delegations in extending our sincere thanks to your predecessor Mr, Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, for the work he accomplished during his term of office. We pay a tribute also to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, our Organization's Secretary-General, for his untiring and increasing work in the service of the international community.\nBefore stating my country's views on some of the items on our agenda, I should like to extend to the Assembly the greetings and best wishes for the success of our work of the President of the Military Committee for National Safety and President of the Republic of Burundi, Major Pierre Buyoya.\nI shall also venture to explain briefly the reasons that led the armed forces of Burundi, supported by patriotic forces, to take up the difficult but noble and inspiring task of guiding our country's destiny.\nThe regime that was overthrown on 3 September 1987 had been guilty of many violations of our citizens' rights and fundamental freedoms, flouting the cardinal principles enshrined in and guaranteed by our laws and the Constitution, Thus, freedom of expression and thought were no longer tolerated, and this had led to the arbitrary and prolonged detention of innocent persons. \nSimilarly, a watch was being kept on freedom of religion and worship. As a result, disputes between the State and the Catholic Church emerged - sterile wrangling designed only to cover up the mistakes being made in overall policy. National unity, built up so patiently and re-established with such difficulty, was threatened. Finally, the worsening of relations with neighbouring countries and other friendly nations naturally had an impact on co-operation.\nIt was for all those reasons - and many others that it would take me too long to set out here - that President Buyoya, with the support of other dynamic forces in the nation, took over the country's leadership without bloodshed, in an atmosphere of calm and dignity characteristic of the people of Burundi.\nIn his speech on his programme made on 3 October this year. President Buyoya reaffirmed that the new regime would guarantee fundamental rights and freedoms and the safety of foreigners living in our country, so that our country might regain the characteristics for which it was noted: a welcoming and hospitable land where it is a joy to live.\nThat is why I would highlight, among the measures already taken to recover our national health, the release of all political prisoners, amnesty for some prisoners under common law, the opening of churches that had been closed and resumption of the right to worship.\nThe President also declared;\n\\\"Burundi will continue to work with other African countries within the Organization of African Unity to find solutions to the serious political and economic problems that face our continent. The resolve of our political will, with respect for our commitments to neighbouring countries and other countries of the subregion, is the basis of ail our hopes for a future improvement in our relations. Burundi's presence at and participation in deliberations within United Nations bodies will be assured ...\\\"  \nBurundi's position on the major international problems of the day, and more specifically on the items now before the Assembly, is based on our analysis of them in keeping with the principles of our foreign policy: good-neighbourliness, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, positive non-alignment, international co-operation and solidarity and support for genuine national liberation movements.\nBurundi's position will also be based on those well-known objective criteria with regard to disarmament, the relationship between disarmament and development, the economic and debt crisis, political problems such as the illegal occupation of Namibia, apartheid in South Africa, the situation in Central America, the wars in Asia and the tragic problem of the division of the Korean people.\nIn my delegation's view, one of the challenges facing the United Nations, to whose solution it must give priority if it wishes to retain its credibility, is that of southern Africa, where a Territory for which our Organization has direct responsibility is illegally occupied; where independent countries Members of out Organization are constantly being attacked, without being given any breathing space; where armed bands are supplied and financed at great cost to destroy the infrastructure and sow death and devastation among the peoples; and where an inhuman regime denies millions of men and women the right to participate in running their country.\nIn addition to our duty of solidarity to the front-line countries, Burundi has genuine reasons for being interested in what happens in that region. After all, we are not fat from the theatre of those deadly operations, and their impact is felt on our economy in one way or another. Therefore, we are interested in a solution to the region's problems being found as soon as possible. \nWe regard the tragic and anachronistic situation of the Namibian people as a thorn in the flesh of the people of Africa, an insult to the United Nations Council for Namibia, a challenge to the Security Council and a cause of shame to the United Nations. What has not been done, or attempted, in order to drive South Africa out of Namibia? And what has been the result?\nDespite resolution 2145 (XXI) of 27 October 1966, ending South Africa's Mandate; despite the advisory opinion given by the International Court of Justice on 21 June 1971, declaring that South Africa had an obligation to withdraw its administration from Namibia and end its occupation; despite Security Council resolution 435 (1978), setting forth the plan for Namibia's independence; despite innumerable resolutions, conferences and seminars - the international community still finds itself powerless in the face of South Africa's continuing refusal to withdraw from Namibia, where it continues to plunder and exploit the wealth of the Namibians on the land and underground.\nFaced with this situation, the delegation of Burundi believes the international community must mobilize to take up the challenge and give the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the sole, authentic representative of the Namibian people, all the assistance it needs in its day-to-day struggle against the South African occupier. The actions that must be taken urgently include the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter, because South Africa's illegal presence is a permanent threat to the neighbouring countries in the region and to international peace and security.\nAs for South Africa itself, this Organization has on many occasions condemned and criticized the system of Government that the authorities of that country have imposed by force on their citizens. The apartheid regime of Pretoria, which is the very negation of the universally recognized principle of the equality of all human beings, has no right to rule, and it must disappear\u00b7\nThat is why my delegation supports and encourages the nationalist movement, the African National Congress (ANC), in the struggle against the inhuman racist apartheid regime  and calls for the unconditional release of the nationalist leader Nelson Mandela and his comrades\u00b7\nThe acts of aggression and destabilization constantly carried out by the racist Pretoria regime against neighbouring independent States - Angola, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe in particular - call for total condemnation by our Organization. \nNot only must we condemn the Pretoria regime for its underhanded actions against the front-line States; we are also duty bound to call for compensation for the losses incurred and to demand that adequate measures be taken to prevent any further acts of destruction.\nIn the northern part of the African continent there is a situation which/ despite the efforts made by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations, has not yet been satisfactorily resolved. Members will have guessed that I have in mind the case of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic. A number of States represented here have recognized it, while others consider that its territory should be an integral part of another State, itself a Member of the Organization. That is a situation which, to say the least, is paradoxical, and legal niceties have not been able to give the advantage to one side or the other on this question, which is a question of puce decolonization. We urge the parties directly involved in the situation to demonstrate great political flexibility and by carrying out the referendum advocated in resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations.\nAs for the conflict between Chad and Libya, we call on these two brother countries, these two neighbours, to demonstrate African wisdom by avoiding a situation that would once again paralyse the pan-African organization, which has not yet recovered from the Western Sahara conflict. Burundi hopes that a peaceful solution to this problem will be found through negotiations within the context of the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU, or else through arbitration by the International Court of Justice at The Hague.\nIn the Middle East, where the problems are as old as this Organization, the situation is far from being a pretty one. When the Israelis deny a homeland to the Palestinians, when the Palestinians swear to destroy the Jewish State, when the friends of both do not urge them to practise moderation and to seek viable political compromises, when Lebanon remains occupied and divided, we have to realize that the chasm is indeed wide and that peace is hardly imminent.\nWe for our part would advocate that the Palestinians' right to a homeland be recognized and that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) , the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, should participate on a footing of equality with the representatives of other States in the region in the search for a lasting solution to the Middle East problem.\nThat region, of strategic importance to the entire world, is, alas, despite the tireless efforts made by many statesmen - most recently by the Secretary-General, Mr, Javier Perez de Cuellar - still the scene of one of the most devastating and deadly wars of our age. The conflict between Iran and Iraq may, if we are not careful, provide additional proof of the impotence of this Organization, and particularly of the ineffectiveness of decisions taken by its principal organ, the Security Council. If resolution 598 (1987) , adopted unanimously by the Security Council in July last, suffers the same fate as its resolution 435 (1978) , which established the plan for Namibia's independence, it will be difficult to restore our Organization's credibility. We call on those who have special responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security to pay heed. \nAs for the situation in Afghanistan, my delegation believes that the sons and daughters of that country, if left to themselves, without any pressure from foreign forces, can find a solution that is in their own interests. The same approach is valid for the situation in Kampuchea, in the South-East Asian region. The Kampuchean people can achieve national reconciliation, and the eight-point proposal submitted by the Coalition Government can serve as a basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict.\nAlso in the Par East region, my country is concerned at the unjust fate imposed on the Korean people by the division of their territory into two parts. North and South, and by the presence of foreign troops. It is our view that without outside interference the two parties can achieve peaceful reunification. In that spirit, we welcome the contacts that have occurred between North and South and we trust that they will be continued and even extended to all levels, in order to achieve the full and peaceful reunification of the Korean nation.\nTurning to the situation in Latin America, my country supports the diplomatic efforts of the Contadora Group and the Support Group to find a peaceful, mutually acceptable solution to the crisis in Central America. That is why we welcomed the signing, on 7 August 1987, of the Guatemala agreement between the five countries of Central America, which are resolved to create a better future for the Central American region. We call upon all those who have interests in that part of the world to make a positive contribution to ensuring the success of the implementation of the treaty signed in Guatemala City, so that peace and stability can be restored to that region.\nAlthough my statement has dealt primarily with political issues, it is my delegation's view that they are far from being the only, or indeed the most important, hindrances to international peace and security. Indeed, in Burundi we believe that the survival of our planet Earth depends also on solutions being found to such thorny problems as poverty, hunger, overpopulation, the worsening economies in the majority of our States, over-armament, indebtedness and so on.\nAccording to figures published in the Final Document of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which took place only recently in New York - from 24 August to 11 September - it is estimated that in the developing countries about 1 billion people live below the poverty line, 780 million suffer from malnutrition, 850 million are illiterate, 1.5 billion have no access to medical care, 1,5 billion are unemployed, and 1 billion do not have adequate housing. Those statistics speak for themselves and, alas, the projections for the future are not encouraging. On the contrary, it is forecast that most of our countries are simply not economically viable. That is a euphemism for saying that these States should simply disappear.\nWithout a doubt, those are matters of concern. The analyses that led to these alarmist conclusions are based on the deterioration of the economies of those States. But this deterioration is not necessarily to be attributed to the leaders of, or the policies followed by, the States whose disappearance is being predicted. In fact, the prices of the commodities and services that these countries provide by producing, exporting and selling their commodities and agricultural goods are set in bureaucratic offices that are unaware of the concerns of those States. A reorganization of all aspects of the international market is the only way to correct the economic disparities in the world today. The debt problem of many of our countries is simply a logical result of the policy of price fixing and the fluctuations in the abilities of our countries to pay. An equitable solution can be found only in the context of global negotiations on the implementation of decisions on the international economic order.\nWhen the President of the United States of America, Mr. Ronald Reagan, addressed the Assembly on 21 September, he confirmed that the United states of America and the Soviet Union had, four days earlier, agreed to conclude an agreement before the end of the year on the elimination of medium- and short-range missiles. This was confirmed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze, when he spoke on 23 September in the Assembly.\nWhile we welcomed this communication of historic significance, my delegation would have been even more delighted if we could have been assured that this agreement would enable us to tackle the economic and financial problems facing the world.\nThe resources made available in this way should be directed towards the sectors of economic and social development to enable us, particularly the least developed countries, to catch up in this area.\nThose who are well versed in disarmament matters tell us that the arms that are to be eliminated relate primarily to Europe. They apparently account for 20 per cent of global military expenditure and so far have never been used. The destruction that has occurred to date has resulted from the use of conventional weapons, which account for the remaining 80 per cent of global expenditure.\nWe cherish the hope that this move to reduce and eliminate the instruments of death will continue and be extended to all categories of weapons. In this connection, my country welcomes the convening here of the first International Conference on the Relationship Between Trade and Development which highlighted the close interrelationship of disarmament and development. We express the hope that the Final Document adopted by the Conference, which is a first step in the right direction, will generate positive effects, so that the world can move towards total and complete disarmament and devote more attention to development, justice, peace and international security.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nComrade President, the delegation of Viet Nam wishes to express its warm congratulations to you, as representative of the fraternal German Democratic Republic, on your election to the presidency of this forty-second session of the General Assembly. We are confident that, with your talent and experience, you will guide our deliberations to a fruitful conclusion, marking a new evolution in United Nations activities in response to the demands of the present world situation. On this occasion my delegation would like, through you, to convey its warmest greetings to the fraternal people of the German Democratic Republic, whose great accomplishments in all spheres have more and more enhanced their fatherland's stature in the international arena and made their country an important factor for peace and peaceful coexistence in Europe.\nAs a result of the birth 70 years ago of the first socialist State in the world, international relations of a new kind have emerged, together with the objective need for peaceful coexistence among countries with different socio-political systems. World history for the past seven decades, and particularly since the Second World War, has been one of a strenuous and complex struggle for peace and peaceful coexistence in the world. In the wake of the stormy years of cold war and attempts in recent years to revive a cold war atmosphere that threaten to drive mankind to the brink of nuclear annihilation, never has the aspiration of nations to live in peace and peaceful coexistence welled up so powerfully as today.\nPeaceful coexistence is an objective law of our times. We live today in an interdependent world where, under the impact of the scientific and technological revolution. States are confronted with a host of urgent major problems that they cannot solve on their own. In such a world, dialogue instead of confrontation, and co-operation instead of enmity, in order to achieve peaceful coexistence among countries with different socio-political systems, have become a necessary trend of our times.\nWe are at present witnessing a promising evolution in the world situation in the direction of dialogue and peaceful coexistence. General Secretary Gorbachev's well-known initiatives have given a strong impetus to the process of easing tensions, driving back the danger of nuclear war and strengthening world peace and security. The recent Soviet-American agreement on the elimination of medium-range missiles and on the holding this fall of the third summit meeting between General Secretary Gorbachev and President Reagan constitutes an important step forward on the road leading to a reduced risk of nuclear extermination and an improved international political atmosphere. The meeting between President Honaker of the German Democratic Republic and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of the Federal Republic of Germany marked a new advance in the endeavour to build relations based on dialogue, mutual understanding and co-operation between the two German States, in consonance with the spirit of the 1975 Helsinki Act, which was reaffirmed at the 1986 Stockholm Conference.\nIn spite of those encouraging signs, which have to some extent improved the overall world outlook, factors causing tension still prevail. By intensifying the arms race, especially the nuclear arms race, both on Earth and in space, in the hope of regaining their lost military superiority, those most hawkish forces which hanker for an historically irretrievable past still represent a defiant challenge to humanity.\nIn the face of such dangerous, adventurous schemes and deeds, an imperative for each and every nation is to persevere in acting resolutely for the safeguard of peace and the establishment of peaceful coexistence.\nNever before has the world been the scene of such a vast mass movement for world peace as in recent years. True to its lofty ideals, the Non-Aligned Movement has grown into a significant component of this struggle. Nor have initiatives in response to the exacting demands of the nuclear and space age, and out of a high sense of responsibility towards the fate of mankind, ever elicited such prompt and wide approval and support from the international community as today. I refer to the Harare appeal issued by the eighth summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement; the Joint Declaration by the Heads of State or Government of India, Sweden, Greece, Tanzania, Mexico and Argentina; and the New Delhi Declaration on the principles of a nuclear-free and non-violent world. I also have in mind the comprehensive programme set forth on 15 January 1986 with a view to eliminating nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction before mankind enters its third millennium, as well as ensuing initiatives aimed at making a reality of that programme; the initiative regarding a comprehensive international system of security put forth at the forty-first session of the General Assembly; General Secretary Gorbachev's 28 July 1986 Vladivostok Declaration on establishing a system of peace and security in Asia and the Pacific; the initiative for the signing of a treaty on the non-use of force or the threat of force among States of Asia and the Pacific; and the proposals for setting up nuclear-free zones in Africa, the Mediterranean, Scandinavia, the South Pacific, South-East Asia and the Korean Peninsula.\nBy dint of their tireless exertion, the forces of peace have made a decisive impact on the atmosphere of dialogue and detente in the world. The present situation calls for a new effort on the part of the world community in order to consolidate and build upon the gains achieved on the long road leading to a firm peace on our planet.\nPeace is an indispensable prerequisite for development. Conversely, as long as poverty and backwardness continue to exist on earth, instability can hardly be avoided. At present the world economy, and more particularly the economies of the developing countries, are beset with extremely serious difficulties. The gap between the rich and the poor is steadily widening, with the per capita income of developed countries 12 times that of developing nations. The letter's external debt now exceeds 3\u00f6S 1 trillion. Primary commodity prices have fallen to their lowest level in the last 50 years. Balances of payments are plagued by acute deficits. Several developing countries are standing on the verge of economic collapse. In our interdependent world such a collapse would affect to no small extent the whole world economic system. In view of this situation, priorities at this forty-second session have to be based on ensuring long-term objectives, namely, the reform of international economic relations so as to move towards a new international economic order and an international system of economic security, and pressing immediate demands such as the burning issues of indebtedness, money and finance, as well as trade. All this requires from the international community, and in particular from developing countries, the most United and resolute action.\nWhile the wholesome breeze of dialogue and d\u00e9tente has begun to blow away the dreadful spectre of a nuclear catastrophe in various regions of the world, the efforts of nations to tally their forces in order together to settle, through dialogue, problems facing individual countries as well as whole regions have come up against major obstacles. Forces that are wont to look upon various parts of the world as their \\\"backyard\\\" and as \\\"areas of vital interest\\\" to them, are increasing their aid to their surrogates and other actions such as economic blockade, embargo and political isolation aimed at undermining and countering the peoples' struggle to achieve and safeguard their independence, to the detriment of peace and stability in various regions of the world.\nIn southern Africa, the apartheid regime, confident in the protection of some imperialist and reactionary forces, still persists strong-headedly, while in the throes of agony, in its bloody repression of the struggle waged by the South African people under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and by the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). At the same time the Pretoria regime undertakes acts of aggression and destabilization against neighbouring countries, especially Angola and Mozambique. Now more than ever before the world community needs to extend to the just struggle of the peoples of South Africa, Namibia and the front-line States the most resolute and powerful support in order to bring about the prompt eradication of apartheid, that stain on human civilization.\nIn Central America, the Republic of Cuba, the first revolutionary State in the Western hemisphere, has weathered innumerable hardships and trials resulting from the fierce opposition of its foes and has achieved many accomplishments in all spheres. The revolutions in Nicaragua and El Salvador are still standing firm on their soil and growing with every passing day. Thanks to the considerable efforts exerted by Nicaragua, the Contadora Group and the Lima Support Group, important progress has been made in the peace process in the region with the signing of the Act on the establishment of a stable and lasting peace in Central America at the summit conference of the five Central American States. This is an important document reflecting the earnest aspirations to peace of the peoples of that region and the overall trend of the world situation today.\nTension continues to prevail in the Middle East as a result of Israel's policies of aggression and expansion. We condemn these policies and extend our vigorous support to the just struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples for the realization of their fundamental national rights and the recovery of occupied Arab territories. In order to reach an early, comprehensive and just solution to the regional situation, an international conference on the Middle East will have to be convened without delay with the participation on an equal footing of all parties concerned, including the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\nThe Iran-Iraq war, which has raged for several years now, has caused both countries heavy losses. We reiterate our wish to see that war between two member States of the Non-Aligned Movement brought to an early end through peaceful negotiations, and we endorse international efforts aimed at helping those two countries achieve a fair political solution based on respect for the legitimate interests of each country and conducive to peace and stability in the region and the world. We express our concern that some forces are taking advantage of the situation in the Gulf area to reinforce their military presence there, thus aggravating tension in the region and rendering it explosive. Such actions must be brought to an immediate end.\nWith the failure of the undeclared war against the Afghan people and the tireless efforts of the Afghan Government in carrying out its policy of national reconciliation and in the search for a political solution to the problems around Afghanistan, the situation there is undergoing fully support the efforts of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan towards holding open dialogues throughout the country so as to achieve national reconciliation, as well as the Soviet-Afghan agreement on the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan within the framework of a political solution to the situation around Afghanistan based on the cessation of all interference in the internal affairs of the Afghan people and on respect for the independence and sovereignty of that country. We denounce all hostile action against this evolution.\nViet Nam supports the constructive, fair and reasonable initiative of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea aimed at achieving the peaceful and sovereign reunification of Korea, especially those regarding the reduction of existing armed forces and the holding of high-level political and military talks between the North and South of Korea.\nWe hold in high regard the Indo-Sri Lankana agreement and welcome India's contribution to peace and development in its region and throughout the world.\nFrom this rostrum we reaffirm once again the Vietnamese people's staunch support for the Puerto Rican people and the peoples of other small territories struggling for independence and freedom, for the people of Western Sahara struggling for their self-determination, and for the people of Cyprus in their struggle to safeguard the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of their homeland. We endorse the initiatives aimed at convening an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations with a view to finding a political solution for the question of Cyprus-Our people's deep sympathy and support goes to the people of New Caledonia who, under the leadership of the Front de liberation nationale Kanak socialiste (FLNKS) are struggling for the right to live in independence and freedom. The referendum recently held under conditions known to all is an impediment to the realization of this sacred right.\nFor the past 40 years, while the world was enjoying the longest period of peace in this century, South-East Asia has been the theatre of the largest, longest and fiercest wars; and although these wars have now ended, that region of the world is still deprived of peace and stability. As a result, it is now more than ever an imperative need, and in their essential interest, for the peoples in the region to secure a framework of peaceful coexistence wherein confrontation would no longer prevail, problems would be settled through peaceful negotiations and good-neighbourly relations established without external interference.\nThe search for a political solution to the Kampuchean problem and the shaping of South-East Asia into a zone of peace, stability and co-operation constitute important objectives of Viet Nam's foreign policy. Together with the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Viet Nam has set forth numerous well-meant proposals with a view to finding promptly a fair and reasonable political solution to the Kampuchean question on the basis of the independence, sovereignty and national reconciliation of the Kampuchean people, which would ensure that the land of the brilliant Angkor civilization would never again go through the nightmare of the genocidal Pol Pot regime, and which would establish a framework for lasting peace and stability in South-East Asia. Viet Nam has declared that it would withdraw all of its forces from Kampuchea by 1990 as it did twice before, after it had sent voluntary forces to help the Kampuchean people in the common anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist struggle for the independence and freedom of the two countries. We regret to say, however, that we have not yet received a response to our peace effort and our good will.\nTo try to settle the Kampuchean question without linking it to the solution of the larger issue of peace and stability in South-East Asia would amount to resolving only one aspect of the problem: the settlement would lack substance. The history of the struggle of the three Indochina's peoples shows that the peace of these three nations is closely linked to peace and stability in South-East Asia. In the course of the 40 years of war in Indochina, three international conferences have been held to put an end to the war, namely the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina, the 1962 Geneva Conference on Laos and the 1973 Paris Conference on Viet Nam. Following each of these conferences, however, one war would hardly be ended before a new war would begin, for the conferences only settled the war and failed to draw up a framework for peaceful coexistence in South-East Asia. If a durable and lasting peace is to be secured in the region, the settlement of the Kampuchean issue needs therefore to be linked to a solution of the issues of peace and stability in South-East Asia.\nThe wish to impose the position of one side on the other is hardly fair or realistic. Until now two opposite stances and approaches have prevailed with regard to the issues of Kampuchea and of peace and stability in South-East Asia. The other side demands that Viet Nam withdraw its forces from Kampuchea while the Indochina's countries insist on the removal of the genocidal Pol Pot clique. With the steady growth of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the three Indochina's countries have declared that Vietnamese forces would be totally withdrawn in 1990 if a political solution of the Kampuchean question could not be reached. Each year since 1982, Viet Nam, in consultation with the People's Republic of Kampuchea, has withdrawn part of its voluntary forces, and before the end of this year another important partial withdrawal will be carried out in the presence, for the first time, of foreign observers. The Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea has made public its policy of national reconciliation whereby it is prepared to meet with the other groups of Khmers and their leaders, except the criminal Pol Pot and his close associates, in order to conduct discussions on national reconciliation based on the non-recurrence, ever, of the scourge of genocide and to join hands with the whole people in defending and rebuilding the country in peace and stability. This is a fundamental long-term policy aimed at uniting all Kampucheans in the endeavour to build an independent, peaceful, non-aligned Kampuchea that would entertain friendly relations with neighbouring countries. Meanwhile, the other side insists on demanding that Viet Nam withdraw its forces and accept the eight-point proposal, which is in fact aimed at bringing about the return of the genocidal Pol Pot regime under cover of the \\\"Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. A fair solution must respect the positions of both sides. Initiatives beneficial to one side but detrimental to the other and supporting one side against the other can only hinder the peaceful settlement of the issues of Kampuchea and of peace and stability in South-East Asia.\nIn such a situation, consistently persevering in the search for a political solution to the question of Kampuchea and for peace and stability in South-East Asia, the three Indochina's countries, together with a few other countries in the region, have tirelessly endeavoured to break the deadlock. Last July, Viet Nam and Indonesia representing respectively the Indochina's and the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), agreed on the holding of a \\\"cocktail party\\\", on the understanding that it would be an informal meeting of the two sides of Kampuchea on an equal footing, without pre-conditions and with no political label, and that, at a later stage, Indonesia would invite other concerned countries, including Viet Nam, to participate in it. They also agreed to reconvene the joint working group as soon as possible to discuss the problems of Kampuchea and of peace and stability in South-East Asia.\nThe People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Lao People's Democratic Republic have expressed their appreciation and endorsement of the above-mentioned agreements between Viet Nam and Indonesia. The three Indochina's countries are of the view that at the above-mentioned \\\"cocktail party\\\" the positions of all sides should serve as the basis for discussion. It may be said that the first rays of hope have begun to dawn.\nThe agreements reached between Viet Nam and Indonesia have opened up the possibility of solving the problems of Kampuchea and of peace and stability in South-East Asia on the basis of equality, respect for the interests of all parties concerned, and without pre-conditions. This is an opportunity not to be missed if a fair and reasonable solution of the problems of South-East Asia and Kampuchea is to be found in conformity with the correct resolution on South-East Asia, adopted by the seventh summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in New Delhi and reaffirmed by its eighth summit Conference in Harare, and with the general trend of the world and regional situations. That is precisely why these agreements were widely welcomed by public opinion so quickly. The People's Republic of Kampuchea declared its readiness to enter talks with opposition groups, and Prince Sihanouk's statement on 18 September last concerning a meeting between the opposing sides of Kampuchea is in keeping not on with the People's Republic of Kampuchea's policy of national reconciliation but also with the 29 July 1987 agreement between Viet Nam and Indonesia.\nViet Nam and the other Indochina's States regard the agreements between Viet Nam and Indonesia as agreements reached between the Indochina's countries and the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the search for a political solution to the question of Kampuchea and of peace and stability in South-East Asia. Therefore, there should not be differing interpretations for the sake of anyone's expediency; rather, both sides concerned are duty bound to respect and implement these agreements. Otherwise it will be impossible to give credibility to any future agreement. It is regrettable that at present some force: inside and outside the region should be trying to play down the significance of these agreements, impede their implementation and prevent dialogue towards a political settlement, thus going against the legitimate aspirations of the Kampuchean people and other peoples in the region.\nWe should like to take this opportunity sincerely to thank those countries, organizations and individuals that have contributed to the shaping of a new conjuncture in South-East Asia propitious for dialogue in the region, and we call on them to continue doing their utmost for the promotion of substantive dialogue towards a political solution to the problem of Kampuchea and of peace and stability in South-East Asia.\nWe highly appreciate the considerable efforts exerted by the Secretary-General, in his personal capacity, to encourage dialogue between the two groups of countries in the region, and we hope that he will persevere in his efforts in that direction.\nIn connection with the search for a political solution to the problems of Kampuchea and of peace and stability in South-East Asia, eventual relations of friendship and co-operation between the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of China would play a very important role. The Vietnamese people treasure their traditional friendship with the Chinese people. The two peoples used to unite and support each other in their respective revolutionary endeavours for national independence and socialism. The aspirations of both peoples as well as the long-term interests of both countries are not mutually exclusive. Moved by the desire to restore normal relations with China, Viet Nam has repeatedly stated its readiness to negotiate with China wherever, whenever and at whatever level it may choose so as to settle substantive matters in their mutual relations as well as questions of mutual concern, for the sake of peace, friendship and co-operation between the two peoples and among the peoples of South-East Asia and of Asia and the Pacific.\nThe United States has an important role to play in ensuring peace and stability in South-East Asia. The Vietnamese people are prepared to turn to a new chapter of history and to facilitate the development of relations of friendship and co-operation between the two peoples. The recent visit to Viet Nam of General John Vessey, special envoy of President Reagan, together with the understanding reached, has created an atmosphere conducive to the solution of humanitarian concerns of both the Vietnamese and the United States sides.\nHistory confronts the men of today with a heavy responsibility that cannot be shirked - namely, how to create firm premises for development in peace, friendship and co-operation among all nations in the remaining years of this century and the early years of the twenty-first century. To discharge that lofty mission there is no alternative to dialogue and co-operation in good faith. Let us hope such a spirit will prevail not only in the settlement of international and regional issues, including those of South-East Asia, but also in the work of this forty-second session of the General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI should like to express my congratulations to Mr. Peter Florin on his election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. I am sure that our work will benefit greatly from his Presidency, I should like also to avail myself of this opportunity to thank his predecessor for his able leadership of the forty-first session-\nThis forty-second session of the General Assembly convenes at a very important juncture in world affairs. For the first time for many years there is the prospect of significant arms control\u00b7 Agreement between the two super-Powers is now under way. The agreement in principle that was announced last week is very welcome as an important first contribution to what we hope will be a continuing disarmament process. We were reminded very recently at the Conference held here on disarmament and development of the extent to which the existence of excessive armaments across the whole spectrum is a burden on the international community as a whole. It is a burden which must be reduced. We are encouraged by the readiness of the super-powers to begin the process of disarmament, which we believe will serve as a step towards a more general easing of international tensions.\nWe cannot, however, lose sight of the many elements of instability which continue to mar the international scene. The agenda for this session is composed of as long a list of conflicts unresolved and disputes unsettled as any of its predecessors. In addition to regional conflicts we are faced with a lack of respect for human rights; the emergence, or in some cases re-emergence, of famine conditions and ever increasing expenditure on armaments Including in particular expenditure by those nations which can least afford it\u00b7 These remain the sad realities for far too many of the world's inhabitants.\nHow well equipped is this Organization to tackle this particular agenda? We are all aware of the criticisms which are made of the United Nations and its affiliated bodies. It is said that the United Nations is selective in the topics with which it chooses to deal, that it is partial in its criticisms and that it has been wasteful of its resources. Of course it is an imperfect institution operating in a very imperfect world. Friends of the United Nations, among which my Government would wish to be regarded, must admit that there has been and remains an element of truth in those claims. We are just as conscious of the flaws in this Organization as any, but we are dedicated to remedying those flaws.\nAt the same time it is also essential to emphasize the genuine achievements of the Organization. How can one ignore the contribution of the United Nations to the process of decolonisation; its part in the protection and promotion of human rights throughout the world; its work and that of the specialized agencies within its framework for development and for the eradication of disease and hunger; its efforts to promote the goal of disarmament, including in particular the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty; and the part which its peace-making and peace-keeping machinery has played in resolving or sometimes defusing conflicts which could have escalated much further?\nThe value of the mechanisms offered by the United Nations to Member States as an alternative to the threat or use of force should not be underestimated. In this regard the major Powers, which have been given very special rights under the Charter, have a particular responsibility. If they take the lead in co-operating to make the United Nations systems work more effectively and live up to the hopes of its founders they can be confident that they will have the support of the great majority of the Members of the Organization.\nThere are grounds, especially in recent times, for cautious optimism. In particular, developments in the past few weeks encourage my delegation to the view that the United Nations will continue to occupy the central place in the conduct of world affairs assigned to it by its Charter. \nFirst, I would refer to the Security Council. The recent initiative taken by the Council, with the support of all its members, in the long-running conflict between Iran and Iraq has shown a willingness on the part of the members of that body to discharge the responsibilities vested in them by the Charter. The unity of purpose manifested on that occasion offers the hope that those provisions of the Charter conceived as central to the functioning of the United Nations as a world Organization can be implemented for the effective maintenance of international peace and security.\nSecondly, in a somewhat different order of ideas, the adoption by consensus at last year's session of a comprehensive resolution on the reform of administrative and budgetary procedures in the United Nations marked a significant stage in the Organization's development. It is important that the unity and spirit of compromise shown then should not be a transient phenomenon but should influence the ongoing implementation of these measures of reforms. Those measures safeguard the essential functioning of the United Nations as an organization of sovereignty equal States committed to the purposes and principles of the Charter, The role played by the Secretary-General in promoting the updating and streamlining of the Organization has been a key factor in the progress made to date\u00b7 It is essential that he be given the fullest possible support in managing the financial and human resources of the Organization,\nWhile a beginning has been made in establishing a basis for sensible budget-making within the United Nations, the financial situation of the Organization remains precarious. All Member States have, in subscribing to the Charter, committed themselves to meet their mandatory financial obligations in full. The payment of such contributions Is therefore a legal requirement, binding on the Member States in the same manner as their other international obligations.\nMy Government attaches a central importance to the peace-keeping activities of the United Nations and is proud that Ireland has been able to contribute to most of the Organization's peace-keeping operations. Responsibility for the establishment of a peace-keeping force rests with the Security Council. It is therefore in the first instance to the members of the Council that troop contributors look for support in the discharge of the tasks which they have been mandated, and have agreed, to undertake. That support is essential if the mandate of an operation is to be implemented in full and if its financing is to be assured. In addition, a peace-keeping force can, of course, succeed in its tasks only if It enjoys the full co-operation of the parties to the conflict.\nJudged against those criteria, the situation of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) gives cause for some disquiet. Over the past 14 months three members of the Irish contingent have lost their lives while on duty in south Lebanon. Other contingents there have also suffered casualties. It is unacceptable that co-operation continues to be withheld from the Force and that the mandate which has been renewed at regular intervals since it was first adopted in 1978 remains inoperable. My, Government continues to call for the complete withdrawal from southern Lebanon of Israeli troops, the dismantling of the so\u2014called security zone and an end to harassment of United Nations peace-keeping troops by irregular forces.\nThe Secretary-General, too, has repeatedly called for the necessary co-operation to be extended to UNIFIL so as to allow it to complete a mission which has been undertaken in the interests of peace and with the backing of the international community. My delegation strongly endorses that call and supports the Secretary-General in that particular matter. The Secretary-General has also pointed to the unsatisfactory financial position of the Force caused by the continued withholding of contributions due in respect of both the present and previous mandate periods. If troop contributors are to continue to undertake these onerous responsibilities, all concerned must decide to act in full conformity with the Security Council's mandate to the Force.\nSince the founding of this Organization, East-West relations have been a central preoccupation of the international community. The capacity of the Security Council to discharge its primary responsibility for International peace and security is clearly influenced by the state of super-Power relations. This is a reality. Recent indications of positive developments In East'-West relations are therefore of considerable interest to all Members of the United Nations. Ireland welcomes these indications and hopes that a secure foundation for a lasting dialogue will now be laid, in the belief that more secure and stable International relations can result from a process of comprehensive and realistic dialogue between the super-Powers.\nWe attach importance in particular to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process as a significant aspect of East-West relations. This established framework for dealing with security and co-operation between East and West in Europe has brought notable improvements in the conditions of all of the people of Europe, East and West, as well as facilitating relations between the participating States. My Government hopes to see further developments in the process, leading to greater contacts between the peoples of Europe, more sustained co-operation at the level of States, and more effective recognition of human rights, so that the impact of agreements reached can be felt by all Europeans. We hope to see a successful outcome in the course of this year, in the shape of a balanced and substantive final document as a follow-up to the meeting taking place at present in Vienna.\nSuccessive sessions of the General Assembly have underlined the need for serious and sustained efforts to check the arms race. I have said already that we welcome the improved prospects of agreement for the first time between the United States and the Soviet Union to reduce the number of nuclear weapons on both sides. The agreement in principle to the global elimination of intermediate-range nuclear weapons is welcome in itself, but also as a step which will, we hope, lead to more general disarmament, and we must regard it as a first step in that direction. We hope, therefore, that it signals the beginning of a process conducive to the easing of international tensions more generally throughout the world. There is, I believe, a universal and deeply felt desire that these negotiations should continue with a view not only to preventing an arms race in space and terminating it on earth but also to bringing about a further reduction of nuclear weapons in all categories.\nThe conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty would be an obvious and practical step in inhibiting the further technical development of these weapons, thus helping to reduce reliance on these particular weapons by the nuclear-weapon States. A ban on testing, accompanied by the reduction in nuclear weapons that now appears imminent, would provide important and timely reassurance on the intentions of the nuclear-weapon States. Ireland is convinced that there are no technical obstacles in the way of such a ban, if the will exists.  \nThe International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development has only recently concluded its deliberations in these very halls and we are happy that the participants agreed on a Final Document by consensus. The subjects of disarmament and development are at the very core of the concerns o\u00a3 this Organization. Ireland is persuaded that the need of all States for security can be met by progress in both disarmament and development. The international community should be alive to every opportunity to make use of resources freed by disarmament measures, undertaken for whatever reason, for the purposes of development.\nDespite widespread condemnation by the United Nations and other international organizations and improved co-operation in implementing measures to deal with it, the serious threat posed by terrorism to human life and to international peace and security remains. Ambivalence with regard to terrorism and its perpetrators still persists. Along with our European partners, we have repeatedly and unambiguously condemned all acts of international terrorism, irrespective of the identities of those responsible, or their motivations. We must all ensure that the obligations we have assumed under international conventions are fulfilled; we must also pledge ourselves further to intensify existing bilateral and multilateral co-operation on practical anti-terror ism measures. Much of this can be carried out within the framework of the United Nations and its agencies, as exemplified by the work currently under way in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) . It behoves us all to do our utmost to see that terrorism ceases to be a threat to the orderly conduct of international relations.\nAn area of United Nations activity with which public opinion in my country has strongly identified is the work undertaken in the field of human rights. On the eve of the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we recall the great debt owed to the framers of that document. Its assertion of inalienable rights to which every human being may lay claim represents a landmark in the struggle to secure freedom and justice for all. On the basis of that foundation, much valuable work has been done in the intervening years in the preparation of international instruments designed to expand and deepen the scope of the human rights canon. \nDespite the existence of this impressive framework, violations of human rights, often on a serious scale, continue to occur. We call for a renewed commitment of effort on the part of all Member States so that each individual can effectively enjoy those rights to which he is formally entitled.\nIn his statement to the Assembly on 22 September the Foreign Minister of Denmark, speaking on behalf of the Twelve member States of the European Communities, addressed many of the regional conflicts with which we are confronted. I should like today to comment on the situation in those areas which, in the view of my delegation, give cause for particular concern. \nFirst, the divisions and instabilities of the Middle East, on which I have already touched, remain a matter of consistent concern and high priority. We were greatly encouraged in the course of this year by the growing momentum towards the convening of an international conference, which we believe is the most timely and effective approach to bringing about a comprehensive and enduring peace in that area. We, in common with our European partners, have made clear our commitment to such an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations and our readiness to play an active role in assisting this process so far as we can. We urge all the parties concerned to renew and intensify their efforts to overcome those obstacles and difficulties which still stand in the way of the convening of a conference. We appreciate and support the Secretary-General's efforts to this end and with this purpose in mind.\nWe have followed with deepening concern the mounting toll of death and destruction as well as the growing threat to international peace and security posed by the conflict between Iraq and Iran. We appeal to the two belligerent countries to recognize the futility of continuing this war. We urge them to respond to the call of the Security Council for a cease-fire leading to a negotiated settlement. I would recall that we, the Members of this Organization, have conferred on the Security Council the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General in the exercise of his good offices, with the aim of ensuring compliance with the Security Council resolution.\nElsewhere in that region, in Lebanon, religious and communal antagonisms continue. We are among those countries whose citizens are innocent victims of the hostage-taking and kidnapping, which has been a particularly deplorable characteristic of the continued violence in that country. We unreservedly condemn this practice and appeal to all parties and forces in Lebanon to co-operate in securing the immediate release of all innocent victims\u00b7 We urge all parties to show restraint so that reconciliation, national dialogue and reconstruction can commence. The cycle of violence must be broken as a necessary pre-condition for a peaceful solution based on respect for the sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon.\nSouth Africa remains a source of serious concern to the whole international community\u00b7 The events of the last year have brought no comfort to those who hope to see the apartheid system dismantled and the emergence in South Africa of a multiracial democracy in its stead\u00b7 Massive repression continues unabated and censorship, in fact, has been greatly strengthened. Many thousands have suffered loss of freedom under the state of emergency, in addition to the iniquities that are inflicted daily on them by the apartheid system. The Government of South Africa continues to defy international opinion and has yet to demonstrate clearly that it is prepared to engage in genuine reform and to commence meaningful political dialogue with the authentic leaders of the majority community.\nThe steps which have been taken to maintain the apartheid system have had a malign influence elsewhere in the southern Africa region. Ireland has frequently condemned the continued activities of South Africa in seeking to destabilize its neighbours whether through armed incursions into their territories by its security forces support for paramilitary movements opposed to the Governments of its neighbours, or the application of economic pressure.\nOn Namibia, I call again on South Africa to desist from further obstructing progress towards Namibian independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). This resolution remains the basis for Namibian independence and the world community should continue to demand its implementation by South Africa. The Introduction of extraneous elements linking progress towards a Namibian settlement with developments elsewhere in the region is not acceptable.\nThe rapid withdrawal of Soviet troops, in accordance with an irrevocable timetable, remains the essential pre-condition if the long conflict in Afghanistan is to be brought to an end. A political solution must guarantee the Afghan people's right to self-determination, allow the return of the refugees and the re-establishment of Afghanistan's status as an independent and non-aligned country, we reaffirm our support for the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General and the principles set out in successive United Nations resolutions.\t-\nWe remain convinced that the basis for a just and lasting solution to the conflict in Kampuchea is contained in the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea, which calls for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the exercise by the Kampuchean people of their right to determine their own future. In the event of a withdrawal, effective steps should also be taken to prevent any armed group from seizing power by force or resorting to the threat of force to intimidate the Kampuchean people and thereby deprive them of their right to choose their own destiny. Kampuchea must be free both of foreign troops and of any prospect of a return to the appalling activities of the Khmer Rouge.\nThe agreement signed by the five Central American Presidents in Guatemala City in August has greatly enhanced the prospects of peace in that region and has given very real hope that the urgently needed improvements in the areas of human rights and social justice will be undertaken. We congratulate the Governments concerned on taking this Important step towards achieving national reconciliation and the strengthening of democracy and on their renewed commitment to the objectives of the United Nations Charter and of the draft Contadora Act. We look forward to the full implementation of the agreement while being keenly aware of the extent of the difficulties that have yet to be overcome. We urge the Governments Involved to maintain their efforts and call on all other States in a position, to do so to facilitate the peace process undertaken and now under way.\nI have mentioned some of the regional conflicts which are the cause of particular concern. However, for millions of people, the immediate threat to their security and well-being is not a military or a political one. Their well-being is being continuously threatened by a lack of development. Many millions still lack the basic conditions for a decent life. Their condition is as much the concern of this Organization as is any other aspect of its purposes and principles.\nThe present Insecure world economic environment - characterized by slow growth, sluggish trade and low commodity prices - provides a sombre background to our deliberations on global issues of development. The unfavourable economic environment affects us all. In my own country, the slow-down in world trade has contributed to high unemployment. A heavy debt-service burden has forced our Government to impose severe cut-backs on public expenditure. However, no country or group of countries has been as seriously and severely affected by the slow-down in world growth as have the least developed countries, particularly those of sub-Saharan Africa. In this regard I welcome the initiative which the Secretary-General has taken in establishing an advisory group to study and report on the balance-of-payments and debt crises as obstacles to the economic recovery of many African countries. \nThe Interrelated issues of resources for development, commodities, international trade and the problems of the least-developed countries were considered at the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in July. The discussions at the Conference showed welcome evidence of a readiness on the part of all countries to work together to improve the environment for accelerated and sustained development. The Final Act of the Conference reflects the broad understanding that was reached on the need for a number of policy approaches and concrete measures to address and deal with these problems.\nThe successful outcome of UNCTAD VII has also contributed to the restoration of confidence in our ability to tackle development questions within the framework of the United Nations. In an increasingly interdependent world, solutions to such problems can be found only through multilateral co-operation. The universal nature of the United Nations system confers a unique authority on the conclusions of conferences such as UNCTAD and complements the valuable practical work being carried out in developing countries by the United Nations Development Programme and by the specialized agencies. The indispensability of a global approach to development problems was further brought out in the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, published earlier this year. The challenge that faces the international community is to take the steps which we all agree are necessary in the interests of development and to make better use of the machinery of the United Nations to achieve our agreed objective.\nThe problem of Northern Ireland continues to be of major concern to the Irish Government. In successive years Irish Foreign Ministers have come to the General Assembly to describe the dimensions of the problem and to underline the urgency of finding a durable solution. Since the meeting between the British and Irish Heads of Government in 1980  it has become an accepted principle that a solution to the Northern Ireland problem is to be found in the framework of Anglo-Irish co-operation. Out of that process emerged the Anglo-Irish Agreement between the British and Irish Governments, signed in November 1985 and registered here with the United Nations.\nThe Anglo-Irish Agreement represents both a commitment and a challenge for the British and Irish Governments. For our part, the Irish Government which came into office in March of this year is determined to use the mechanisms of the Agreement to improve the position of all the people living in Northern Ireland and especially the members of the Nationalist community. Within our overall programme for action we have established certain priority areas where we believe change is urgently required. These areas include the achievement of fair employment practices and reforms in the administration of justice.\nAs indeed the United Nations and its specialized agencies have recognized in many pronouncements, equal opportunity in employment is one of the hallmarks of an acceptable society. The socio-economic rights of individuals must rank equal in importance with their political and other rights. The employment profile of Northern Ireland undoubtedly points to a legacy of discrimination against one community. It is the common objective of the British and Irish Governments to ensure the elimination of that discrimination in all its forms, some steps have been taken along the road but there is much further to travel. We regard the removal of discrimination in employment as both a moral and a political imperative in Northern Ireland and as a sine qua non of further progress in that area.\nPublic confidence in the administration of justice and good relations between the security forces and the community are other distinguishing marks of a normal society. When emergency measures are deemed necessary in order to protect the public from violence it is essential that the public security forces are even-handed and that the proceedings of the courts are impartial. In a divided society such as Northern Ireland, where a very large minority of the population has felt alienated from the institutions of government and especially from the forces of law and order and the system of justice, the importance of such public confidence is very acute. In Northern Ireland, therefore, it is necessary to consider what changes are required to remedy the damage done to public confidence in the past and to assure public confidence now and for the future. That is why, in the Anglo-Irish Agreement, of 15 November 1985, and in the communiqu\u00e9 which accompanied it, the British and Irish Governments agreed to seek measures which would give substantial expression to the aim of public confidence in the administration of justice and committed themselves explicitly to early progress in that area.\nIt is easy to be misled into thinking that the conflict in Northern Ireland centres upon irreconcilable religious or historical differences. In fact the challenge which lies at the heart of the problem is similar to many of the challenges posed by other areas of conflict throughout the world which are raised regularly in this Assembly. The need for peoples and nations freely to work out their own future, the accommodation of historical differences within such nations peacefully and by agreement and related human rights questions are basic to many of the tensions and much of the instability throughout the globe, no less than in Northern Ireland.\nThe role of the Irish Government under the Anglo-Irish Agreement offers support to Nationalists in Northern Ireland in ending that sense of exclusion under which they have lived and in finding solutions to the problems which beset both communities in that area. We also believe that the Irish Government's role reflects the recognition by the two Governments concerned and by the overwhelming majority of the populations of Britain and Ireland that the Nationalist and Unionist communities both share a common future on the island of Ireland which must rest upon principles of inclusion and accommodation of both traditions.\nIn saying this, my Government recognizes that the Anglo-Irish Agreement has not gained full acceptance in Northern Ireland. We recognize the rights and the identity of the Unionist population as well. There must, however, be a realistic acceptance that the Agreement is there as part of the political landscape in Northern Ireland and has been achieved by the two sovereign Governments involved in that island. Only in such a climate of realism can meaningful debate take place about future political developments.\nIn successive years we have called for an end to the campaigns of violence in Northern Ireland. The past year has, unfortunately, seen a continuation of that futile violence which has brought such misery and suffering to the people of the area. The perpetrators of that violence are a tiny minority of the population of Northern Ireland who do not act on behalf of anybody but themselves. Indeed, their unremitting campaigns of violence and assassination can only add to the mistrust and mutual fear between Irish people of different traditions. Such actions do not bring closer but postpone the day when unity based on reconciliation can take place in Ireland, leading to the coming together, under agreed structures, of all the people of diverse traditions in our island.\nWe, as the Irish Government, will continue to work the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in conjunction with the British Government. We will remain open to contact with all those in Northern Ireland willing to pursue peaceful constructive approaches to the problems of the area. We will seek to make progress on the practical level of economic fairness, even-handed treatment by the security forces and confidence in the administration of justice, all of which deeply affect the ordinary citizen in his or her everyday life. We realize that progress at the overall political level is indispensable to a durable settlement, by agreement, of the problems of our country as a whole.\nSimilarly, in the world at large regional problems of a similar kind can only be resolved by the exercise of positive political will on the part of the countries immediately involved. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nIt is a privilege and a great honour for me to address such a distinguished gathering. May I take this opportunity to congratulate most warmly Mr. Peter Florin on his unanimous election to the presidency, a fitting tribute to his personal qualities and to his country. My delegation has no doubt that with the benefit of his extensive diplomatic skills and vast political experience our deliberations will take place in a spirit of understanding and friendship.\nI wish also to extend my congratulations to his predecessor, Mr. Choudhury, for the skills and finesse with which he conducted the last session. We are grateful to him for his valuable contribution to the resolution of critical issues, so vital to the survival of the United Nations, which is the repository of the hopes and aspirations of mankind.\nI wish also to place on record our deep appreciation of the dedicated work of Mr. Perez de Cuellar in pursuance of the goals set by the Charter of the Organization. Thanks to his vision and statesmanship, the United Nations has played a key role in the maintenance of stability and world peace. The tasks ahead of the Organization remain as complex as ever. Although it has been said time and again that the United Nations has no teeth, yet the decisions taken by the Assembly have without doubt influenced the march of events. That goes to show that United Nations resolutions still matter, although more often than not only as a moral coercive force.\nDisarmament, and especially nuclear disarmament, is one of the major problems of our time. Should this vital problem not be resolved in the minimum lapse of time we face the prospect of mass destruction and annihilation. It is to this task, in my opinion, that we should address ourselves with all our energy and courage. It must be obvious that massive and sophisticated weaponry can be no guarantee of world peace. The alternative is too horrible to contemplate. I am confident that we are level-headed enough to promote collective security arrangements in the name of future, unborn generations. The positive contribution of the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations cannot be denied and it is my view that every effort should be made to strengthen those forces for the sake of stability in world affairs. Sanity dictates that course of action.\nWe have on many previous occasions spoken on the tremendous amount of resources and human ingenuity devoted to devising more and more elaborate and efficient instruments of death. Global arms expenditure is now close to $US 1 trillion annually - that is nearly $US 200 a year for every individual on earth today. The per capita gross national product figures of several of the least developed countries do not even match that figure, while other developing countries are hardly better off. This stark contrast must surely constitute one of the most profound paradoxes of our time. The adoption of the Final Document by the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development is an important step by the international community towards rectifying this anomaly. While we regret the lack of concrete financial commitments, we fully endorse all the measures contained in the action programme of the draft final document of the Conference and appeal to all Member States, particularly the major producers of arms, to implement them fully. Only a temporary and uneasy peace can be achieved through armaments; lasting peace is more likely to be established through economic development and the sharing of wealth and resources on an equitable basis.\nI feel it is my duty to refer again to the abhorrent system of apartheid in South Africa. The consensus is now universal that the system of apartheid as it stands today cannot be reformed; indeed, there is a growing awareness that the system should be dismantled. Mere moral exhortations or attempts at coaxing Pretoria into a genuine change of heart have failed so far to bring about any significant change. All the half-hearted pressures that have been applied by those who possess the economic leverage to have an effective influence on the South African regime have not had the desired effects. We therefore wish to reiterate the numerous declarations adopted at several international meetings and conferences to the effect that the Security Council should impose measures for comprehensive and mandatory sanctions as provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.\nPretoria still continues to stall and manoeuvre against the process of the emancipation of Namibia. Practically all the conditions required for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) have now been fulfilled, yet Pretoria, in its obstinacy in perpetuating its Illegal occupation, continues to hold the freedom of the Namibian people hostage to the resolution of completely extraneous issues.\nOnce again we are concerned that preparatory work for the conference on the Indian Ocean is still far from being completed. In fact the report of the Ad hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean seems to suggest that the holding of the conference could be postponed indefinitely. In the meantime the militarization of the region continues to be built up, thus increasing the peril to world security.\nIt is deplorable that there appears to be a definite lack of collective will and effort to turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace, yet the necessity for such a move is more than obvious. It is our view that only the full and active participation of all the permanent members of the Security Council and the users of the sea lanes for either trade or communications will ensure the convening of the conference, which is long overdue.\nI should like to remind this Assembly in this connection that the Chagos archipelago, which belonged to Mauritius, was excised from our territory before we obtained independence, in clear violation of the principles of the United Nations. Its inhabitants were coerced into permanent exile to clear the way for a military base in Diego Garcia. The key strategic role now assumed by Diego Garcia has brought the nuclear peril right into the heart of the Indian Ocean region. The loss of Chagos has also meant the denial to the Mauritian people of access to the significant ocean resources around the archipelago. We renew our demand for the rightful restitution of the Chagos archipelago to the national heritage of Mauritius. We are grateful to the States members of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, as well as to other friendly countries, for their strong and consistent support of our just claim. \nThe Iran-Iraq war now poses a new level of threat to peace in that region drawing to the recent entry into the Persian Gulf of military units belonging to several major Powers. This endless war has already had appalling consequences in terms of material and human losses, and the tally continues to rise on both sides. In a very rare and welcome show of unanimity. Security Council members recently adopted a resolution demanding the immediate cessation of hostilities. We appeal to both belligerents, with whom we are on friendly terms, to abide by the resolution's provisions as a first step towards a just solution of the conflict. The consequences of an escalation of the war and possible chain reactions at the regional and international levels have become so unpredictable in the face of the awesome display of foreign military forces in the Gulf that it would be horrifying as either side to raise the stakes.\nAs we near the end of the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless, we fish to highlight the special plight of those who are not only homeless but have also been driven from their own lands by foreign military occupation - the Palestinians, Kampucheans and Afghans, among others, who must wait for peace before :heir double objective can be attained.\nAll foreign intervention and military occupation must be brought to an end in Afghanistan and Kampuchea and their non-aligned status restored without further delay. For too many years, the incessant flow of refugees from those two countries has created tension and security problems in neighbouring States. Far too often in modern times, liberation has been used as an excuse to deny some people their inherent right to self-determination.\nAs has been stated here and in numerous other forums, by nearly the whole international community, the Palestinian problem is the central issue in the Middle East situation. There appears to be some indication that the idea of an international conference on the Middle East has recently gained ground. Such a conference, as we have often repeated in the past, must include the full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization. To be lasting, any settlement must include the full restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\nFor the first time in more than 150 years, the peoples of Central America were recently able to meet and discuss their common problems and succeed in achieving an agreement that has been welcomed overwhelmingly by the international community. That success of regional concertation must be given every chance to be implemented, and we sincerely hope that no extraneous constraints or pressures will be brought to bear on that indigenous Central American peace process.\nIt is heartening to note that a peace settlement has recently been achieved in Sri Lanka, a country that has known war and strife for many months. In this connection, I must particularly praise the role played by both the Indian and the Sri Lankan leaders and the display of statesmanlike qualities and spirit of compromise and conciliation so readily shown by the two sides.\nWe in Mauritius have always been proud o\u00a3 our record of living peacefully among groups of people of various ethnic origins, and we welcome the peace settlement in Sri Lanka as it reinforces our own conviction that people of diverse origin can successfully build up a peaceful and harmonious nation.\nIn regard to Korea, the Korean people have now waited almost 40 years for the peaceful reunification of their country. Hostile diatribes must give way to confidence-building measures. We have no doubt that all the people of Korea, both of the North and of the South, will eventually join the rest of the international community in the United Nations.\nThe world economy appears to be continuing its sluggish course, as some of the major industrialized countries still seem reluctant to stimulate their economies and generate demand and production. World trade has followed the same trend. It increased in volume by only 5 per cent last year, and by only 3.2 percent in 1985. Primary commodity prices have fallen to their lowest levels in nearly 50 years, and the majority of developing countries, which depend on trade of primary products for most of their export earnings, have seen a 30-per-cent decline in their terms of trade with developed countries. Protectionist measures by large developed countries have further compromised the creation of a more favourable environment for accelerated growth in international trade.\nThe recent adoption by consensus of the Final Act of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) represents a timely and essential contribution to the prospects of multilateral co-operation for resolving some of the aforementioned problems. It is noteworthy that this document spelled out the respective responsibilities of both the developing and the developed countries in this tremendous task, particularly with respect to the debt crisis.\nThe results of that conference, which followed closely the overall positive outcome of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the African economic crisis, thus reaffirm the spirit of equal partnership which should prevail between developed and developing countries in multilateral co-operation activities. Together, those two meetings represent a welcome and significant boost to the revival of the North-South dialogue.\nAlthough it may be premature at the present time to offer a meaningful assessment of the progress made in implementing the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery, it nevertheless appears that the pace and magnitude of the flow of resources required have fallen short of expectations thus far. Measures for clearing the books on official debts, for example, especially in the case of the poorest sub-Saharan countries, should be more comprehensive than is such measures, and other debt-relief plans, including more lending from banks, are among the key components of the international support action required to establish sufficient financial flows to reverse the negative trend in development of several African countries. And as UNCTAD VII has emphasized, action by developed countries on commodities and international trade is urgently required. Such action will assist African countries that are highly dependent on earnings from the export of primary products in restructuring their economies and honouring their debt obligations.\nHe in the developing world very much hope that a more favourable climate will be created to help alleviate the untold difficulties besetting us. In this connection, we appeal for improved trading opportunities with the industrialized countries for primary commodities and textile and other manufactured goods. Such action would help us to sustain the export diversification policies we are pursuing. While many developing countries are under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMP) to liberalize their exchange and trade systems at high political and social costs, industrialized countries are resorting to trade restrictions and subsidies in various guises. But we are encouraged by the glimmer of hope provided recently as the IMF and World Bank annual meetings ended with promises by some industrialized countries to take a more active role in reshaping the world economy.\nEvery year as we gather here and debate repeatedly the numerous protracted issues that still elude solution within the framework of the United Nations, we should also remind ourselves of the equally numerous problems, especially in the economic and social fields, that the Organization is continuously dealing with much more successfully.\nThe International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, held in Vienna earlier this year, constitutes perhaps the most important milestone yet in the concerted action by all Governments against this scourge. Until then, international co-operation in the war on drugs had been less effective as consumer and supplier countries shifted the main responsibilities for drug abuse control on one another. We are therefore grateful to the Secretary-General for his timely initiative to put an end to this sterile debate.\nAmong the measures for fighting against drug abuse and illicit trafficking, we wish to emphasize those which would improve exchange of information on narcotic trafficking, improve and harmonize extradition treaties and facilitate the disclosure, forfeiture and seizure of assets obtained from trafficking.\nAs we have often affirmed in the past, the smaller and weaker members of the international community have no other alternative than to turn to the United Nations in times of crisis. We are therefore very much concerned every time the principle of multilateralism becomes the object of assault by those who perhaps harbour nostalgia for earlier times when only a handful of nations controlled the fate of the world. The present financial straits of the Organization are the result of such attacks. But in the end, even those who are among the fiercest critics of the United Nations have occasionally to resort to this forum to draw international support for their own policies. We must therefore never fail to reaffirm our faith in the principles of the Charter and continue to strengthen its provisions on international peace and security.\nMay I conclude by reasserting that the United Nations is a vital forum for airing differences among nations of the world. It is a means of dialogue and communication and the surest safety-valve in a turbulent world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFor the community of nations, for the peoples of the United Nations and for our Governments, the annual session of the General Assembly is a source of annually renewed hope and a yearly reaffirmation of faith in the enduring validity of the ideals and principles of the Charter of San Francisco. Those ideals and principles reflect the deep-seated and legitimate aspirations of mankind for peace and harmony among nations, for freedom and for economic and social progress for all peoples and all individuals, without distinction. The election of Ambassador Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly is a symbol of that powerful and energizing faith shared in our brotherhood by all the peoples of the earth in our humanity and our common destiny. It is a symbol of the long road travelled since the end of the Second World War, giving true meaning to the uniqueness of our world and the universality of mankind.\nThis election honours him and also recognizes the positive contribution of his country, the German Democratic Republic, in the progress of world affairs. I should like to join my tribute to those already paid him and once again convey my delegation's compliments to Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, who conducted the work of our last session with flair, competence and a high sense of responsibility.\nI would be remiss were I to fail to convey here and now to the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, our praise and appreciation for the very useful job he is doing as head of the Organization. He is an attentive and skilful observer of the international scene, and we have seen him, whenever peace is at stake, travelling throughout the world and working actively, with patience and tenacity, to promote the dialogue that is so indispensable to the achievement of understanding among all parties. On behalf of Niger, I commend him for this.\nIn spite of the slow improvement to be seen here and there, the international political situation is still in many areas of the world the cause of grave concern for our Governments and peoples.\nThis is true of the southern part of the African continent, which the racist minority regime of Pretoria has transformed, through its stubbornness and arrogance, into a smouldering hotbed that imperils the security of the entire region, and indeed, world peace. The situation created and maintained in that part of the African continent by the racist minority regime of Pretoria is one of the most serious challenges to the authority of the United Nations and an intolerable affront to the conscience of mankind.\nHow can we accept the fact that, despite repeated calls by the General Assembly and the Security Council, South Africa continues illegally to occupy the Territory of Namibia, plunder its natural resources and systematically murder or imprison all those Namibians who reject the colonial status being imposed on them and struggle to regain their rights? How can we tolerate a situation in which South Africa is constantly carrying out acts of aggression against the front-line States and, with the assistance of armed bands created and financed for its own evil purposes, is continuing to organize assaults, assassinations, abductions and acts of sabotage? How can we accept the persistence of the loathsome system of apartheid, which is a negation of the very values that form the bedrock of peace and that this Organization was established to defend?\nNo, there can be no compromise with apartheid and its masters. There can be no compromise with that policy under which man denies man and through which ail the values that millions of men sacrificed their lives to defend are trampled underfoot, values the international community ardently champions. No one that desires progress, no one with a conscience, can sleep peacefully while that hateful system persists in that part of the world, a system under which men deny other men the mere right to exist.\nIn the light of the ineffectiveness of verbal censure and condemnations, the General Assembly and other international bodies have recommended comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa. The purpose of such sanctions would be to force the minority racist regime of Pretoria to abandon its inhuman policy of apartheid and implement the United Nations peace plan for Namibia's accession to independence. We have to note that all such actions have so far been thwarted by South Africa, which, strengthened by those that overtly or covertly aid and abet it, continues to defy the United Nations and the international community.\nI should like at this juncture to reaffirm Niger's and its people's support for and solidarity with the peoples of Namibia and South Africa in their liberation struggle and with the front-line States, the victims of repeated acts of aggression by the minority racist regime of Pretoria. Niger calls for determined action by the international community to speed Namibia's attainment of independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and for the dismantling of the system of apartheid.\nOf course, on the African continent Chad is another dangerous hotbed of tension that must be promptly eliminated. It calls for vigilant attention on the part of the Assembly, in conjunction with initiatives already undertaken within the framework of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). As a watchful neighbour, ready to help wherever possible, Niger has associated itself with many of the initiatives undertaken to restore peace to Chad. The return of peace to that country presupposes peace among all the people of Chad, in keeping with the ideals and principles of the charter of African unity non-interference in that country's internal affairs and respect for its independence and the unity and integrity of its territory. There is no other possible path towards peace.\nNiger welcomes the significant progress that has been made in the process of national reconciliation initiated and patiently pursued by the Chad Government. Similarly, we support the action undertaken by the Organization of African Unity through its Ad Hoc Committee under the chairmanship of El-Hadj Oman Bongo, President of the Republic of Gabon. In a new approach designed to find a solution to the problem of Chad, the recent summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity, held at Addis Ababa in July of this year, upgraded the membership of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on the Chad-Libyan conflict to Head-of-State level and urged all parties to co-operate with it. It is heartening that at the recent meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee at Lusaka there was for the first time effective participation by the two parties, thus consolidating the cease-fire declared on 11 September 1987 at the request of the then Chairman of the OAU. The Lusaka meeting also drew up and adopted a precise working timetable, including, inter alia, another meeting of Heads of States members of the Ad Hoc Committee with the Heads of State of Chad and Libya.\nIn our view, it is important for all of us to support and recognize the efforts of the OAU.\nIn the final communiqu\u00e9 issued at the conclusion of the Lusaka meeting the members of the Ad Hoc Committee expressed their concern at \\\"the risks of the internationalisation\\\" of the Chad-Libyan conflict. Such risks exist and must be averted at any cost. The international community must see to it that they are.\nChad and Libya, for their part, must understand that they cannot live in mutual exclusivity; they cannot remake geographical facts or redraw the map of the world to suit themselves. They are condemned to live together. As neighbours, they have a duty to respect each other, accommodate each other and live in harmony. They must ensure that their relations comply with the inescapable demands of good-neighbourliness.\nThe problem of western Sahara, too, continues to maintain a regrettable level of tension in the north-western part of the African continent. In a profound desire to see peace and understanding once again prevail among the countries of the Maghreb, Niger has resolutely supported all the efforts undertaken so far to achieve a just and lasting settlement of that problem. \nIn this connection we welcome the recent attempts to reach understanding at the meeting in Ujda, and we warmly congratulate His Majesty King Fahd Ibn Abdel-Aziz of Saudi Arabia on his tireless efforts to ease the tension in that part of our continent. At the same time, I must commend the Secretary-General for his discreet, patient and useful work. We encourage him to persist in his activities in order to establish in the Organization favourable conditions for a referendum on self-determination in the Sahara, which is the only way to find a lasting solution to that difficult question.\nElsewhere in the world other hotbeds of tension are causing anguish and concern and call for concerted action by the international community. One of these is the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq, two members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the United Nations that would normally have every reason to be in close association. That war, now in its eighth year, has in recent weeks undergone an escalation that has increased the danger and threat to the whole of the Arab-Persian Gulf. Only the cessation of hostilities and the acceptance of dialogue can lead to a just and lasting peace. Niger welcomes the adoption by the Security Council on 20 July of resolution 598 (19\u00ed(7) and urgently appeals to both patties to the conflict to accept its terms and co-operate with the Secretary-General in its implementation.\nThe chances for a negotiated, comprehensive and lasting settlement of the diddle East problem still seem remote. The fundamental and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people continue to be disregarded and denied. Israel persists in occupying Arab territories and, as part of its plan to present the international community with a fait accompli, is actively changing the demographic structure and the legal, cultural and religious status of the Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem. International opinion has often spoken out against these practices and demanded that Israel withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories, put an end to the mistreatment meted out to the populations of those territories and cease exploiting their resources. \nAt the same time, the Lebanese tragedy drags on amid a kind of general indifference on the part of the international community.\nIn both cases, Israel must understand that its own existence cannot forever be guaranteed by means of force but that it can be guaranteed by a peaceful, comprehensive and lasting solution or the Palestinian problem and, more generally, the Middle East question. It must accept that the question of Palestine is at the hub of the conflict in the Middle East and that peace in the region involves giving the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, the right to participate on an equal footing in any negotiation process aimed at finding a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East.\nCentral America, also, is a constantly troubled region, and the General Assembly should continue to give it close attention. For many years that region has been caught up in a grave crisis marked by military confrontation, social instability and manifold and complex inter-State tensions. There are now fresh grounds for hope with the drafting of the Guatemala peace plan by the States of the region, which Niger warmly welcomes.\nWe also continue to follow closely developments in the Korean peninsula, where the situation remains extremely tense. We encourage the efforts undertaken by the two Koreas to bring about the peaceful reunification of their great nation.\nWith respect to the situations in Kampuchea and in Afghanistan, Niger wishes once again to reaffirm the unacceptability of occupation by force of territories belonging to other countries in contravention of the norms of international law and the principles of the United Nations Charter. The international community must continue to strive to make it possible for each of those countries to decide on its political orientation fully and of its own free will and for its population freely to choose its future. It must also ensure that their status as non-aligned countries is safeguarded and respected. \nIt is generally accepted that the uncontrolled arms race is one of the most serious and daunting challenges facing our world. Everyone is aware that a nuclear conflagration would imperil the whole of human civilization and would annihilate all forms of life on Earth. It is therefore vital that the great Powers and all countries concerned abandon their nuclear programmes and embark on a bold and courageous policy of total disarmament. We are witnessing a historic moment for mankind - historic because it is crucial for the future of mankind on Earth, history would record the wise decision of countries possessing nuclear capability to abandon their programmes and destroy the apparatus of destruction installed in many areas of the world. Such a decision would enhance man's stature and bring him into harmony with his environment and with himself because it would prove he is capable of reason and knows how to stop something when he must.\nWe, the developing countries, close observers or this state of affairs, feel despair and revulsion at seeing colossal sums amounting to billions of dollars being swallowed up in this mad adventure whose sole aim, ultimately, is the annihilation of mankind, while in vast regions of the world millions of men and women barely subsist amid total destitution, struggling day to day merely to stay alive.\nThe agreement in principle reached just two weeks ago by the United states and the Soviet Union on the elimination of intermediate-range missiles is encouraging in this respect because it gives us some ground to hope for the advent of a world less ridden with uncertainty.\nThe political concerns I have just mentioned must be seen together with other pressing anxieties bound up in the grave, deep and prolonged crisis in the world economy.\nThe economic situation of the countries of the third world continues to be difficult - indeed it is more difficult than ever, and its most critical aspect is the mounting burden of debt. Thus, although the debt whole of Africa is quantitatively far less than that of other continents - and even of certain individual countries - it has become intolerable for most of the countries of Africa because of the economic crisis prevailing on the continent. For most of those countries debt servicing has reached 30 per cent of total export earnings, the level regarded as the maximum tolerable for any one country. For some of them, debt servicing is equivalent to 6 0 per cent of export earnings, while for others it simply equals 100 per cent.\nThe Assembly will agree with me that to pay debt servicing at such a level is economic madness. It is simply impossible. Thus, despite their sincere desire to honour their contractual commitments, many African States are today finding themselves unable to do so because of their economic situation.\nThe means that have been explored up to now have not been promising in terms of finding satisfactory solutions to this problem. These range from unilateral measures taken by debtors to rescheduling policies advocated by creditors. Niger takes the view that only dialogue and concerted action will enable us to find a solution to the dent problem. Creditors and debtors must get together to think about and discuss bold and innovative initiatives that might be taken in this regard.\nIn addition to the question of debt there arises the whole problem of the recovery of the African economies severely hit by the crisis. At the special session devoted to the economic situation on the continent, the international community recognized the reality, depth and gravity of this crisis. It acknowledged that Africa, despite its enormous potential, remains the least developed of all the continents. All the economic indicators set Africa far behind other continents. The crisis has led to a marked fall in per capita income and to stagnant or even negative rates of growth in many countries.\nAfter all the forecasts, the prospects for recovery, growth and development\nremain extremely precarious, unless the efforts now being undertaken by African countries receive full support from the international community. Africa received that support in May 1986 at the special session of the General Assembly, However, nearly a year and a half after adoption of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, we are bound to note that Africa's partners are at a standstill when it comes to meeting their commitments. \n\nMeanwhile, Africa, in the framework of this undertaking of joint responsibility, has adopted structural adjustment programmes and recovery measures at the cost of incalculable sacrifices. Despite the already encouraging results, African countries have not received from the industrialized countries the aid and assistance necessary for them to achieve true economic recovery.\nThis continent, which is filled with life and hope, deserves a more positive response from the international community. Africa, which was the cradle of mankind and has contributed very significantly to the development and flourishing of major civilizations, has also, at critical moments in their history, stood at the side of certain now major nations, which it helped to defend and preserve. It is thus only right and just that those nations should now help Africa to overcome its difficulties.\nAfrica urgently needs assistance, in particular to deal with the most critical agricultural and food situation that it has ever had to face. The recovery of African agriculture is a pre-condition of the development of the continent. Thus, for countries such as my own, the development strategy is based primarily on agricultural development. This option is clearly reaffirmed in Niger's five-year economic and social development plan for 19B7 to 1991, concerning which a round-table meeting of donors was held in Geneva last July. Niger's major partners welcomed the relevance and seriousness of the policies and strategies underlying the economic and social development programmes of my Government. A commitment was made to support them and help give effect to them. I reaffirm the deep gratitude of the people and leaders of Niger to all our partners. \nIn this key sector, agriculture, we have to face the adverse natural conditions, struggle against the disastrous consequences of drought and desertification in the Sahel and establish the hydro-agricultural infrastructures which are indispensable if we are to become self-sufficient in food. The effort we have to make is therefore considerable, but we are determined to make it. Among the many initiatives taken by the Government, which all reflect this determination, I have already mentioned the Maradi commitment, which marked the birth of the master plan for combating desertification and drought of the countries members of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS) and the organization of genuine mobilization of the people to combat the phenomena of degradation of the environment. \nNiger welcomes, in this respect, the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, under the chairmanship of Mrs. Brundtland, the Prime Minister of Norway. This report rightly notes the indissoluble link between protection of the environment and the well-being of mankind. It is impossible to divorce the problems of the environment from economic and development questions. We endorse the conclusions of the World Commission which are in keeping with those of the \\\"Silva\\\" conference held in February 1986 in Paris. It must be admitted that if we do not draw up here and now a really sustained policy of protection of the environment covering both agricultural production and livestock and action to combat desertification, we shall be endangering the very basis of the future of all of us. The tragic effects of desertification in the Sanel, and particularly in Niger, prove that every time the balance between man and his natural environment is disrupted the vicious cycle of drought and hunger become a constant fact of life.\nIt is in this context that we must consider the farming season this year in Niger, which is causing us great concern and giving us very little cause for hope. A very late rainy season and rainfall which was badly distributed both in area and in time have made it impossible for us to meet our food needs for the coming year. According to the estimates of our technical services, we shall have a deficit in cereals of approximately 350,000 tons at the end of the current farming season. However, provision to meet this deficit has already been made by my Government both using its own resources and through the generous support of the international community.\nThus, we need to buy seed, fertilizer and ploughing and irrigation equipment. Above all, in a country where more than half the land is desert, we need to mobilize all available energies to halt the advance of the desert, prevent sand storms from covering over the few oases that exist or destroying the scarce layers of fertile or cultivable soil.\nThese ate the concerns of the people of Niger. It is clear from all the speeches that I have heard since the opening of this session that they are also the concerns of many other nations of the world hungry for peace, freedom and progress. These hopes give particular value to the activities that we are pursuing here.\nPresident Seyni Kountche said from this rostrum: \\\"Together with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Charter is certainly the finest, the most noble and the most relevant resolution that mankind has ever adopted.\\\" (A/36/PV.25, p.27)\nIt is all this because it embodies all our hopes and makes this forum the irreplaceable setting within which to achieve them.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the delegation of Mali, I should like to join preceding speakers in congratulating you. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I have pleasure in paying tribute to you as a statesman and also a distinguished representative of a country with which Mali has excellent ties of co-operation. \nThe wealth of your long experience gives promise of real success in our deliberations here. I should like also to congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, who, thanks to his competence and dedication, presided so effectively over the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly.\n1 also pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the renewal of whose mandate to head our Organization shows the high regard in which he is held by the international community.\nArticle 1 of the United Nations Charter sets forth the objectives of our Organization. They are, inter alia, international peace and security, international co-operation, development and respect for human rights. Although the interdependence of these purposes has often been restated, over the last 20 years particular emphasis has been placed on priority to be given to development programmes. So there has quite rightly been a movement away from the drafting of standards to the application of procedures and the establishment of bodies. Development has become an integral part of all the relevant programmes of the United Nations system.\nYet, despite the United Nations capacity to manage multilateral co-operation for development, the world, in particular the developing world, has been characterized for more than a decade by a continuing deterioration in economic situations. This deterioration in the world economy has been discussed by many speakers, sometimes in a very moving way, and today it has become intolerable for the developing countries. \nThe present world economic system embraces relations between States and the internal regimes of those States. The division of the economic system between industrialized countries and developing countries is no justification for structural imbalance or exploitation.\nWhile the developed countries have had positive growth rates, the economies of the developing countries with rare exceptions# have continued to stagnate or even deteriorate. The combined impact of the constant fall in the export prices of commodities, the constant increase in the prices of imports, the increase in and instability of world interest rates, the excessive and unforeseeable fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies and the fall in development aid have led to a deterioration in the economic situation of the developing countries, in particular the less-developed of them.\nWhile for many countries exports guaranteed their ability to repay their external debts, creditors adopted protectionist measures and other discriminatory practices having a similar impact against exports from developing countries. These factors militated against the growth of the world economy in general and the economy of the developing countries in particular- To repay foreign debts, these countries have been forced increasingly to transfer abroad resources that should be available for development. Not always having those resources available, and in order to honour deadlines, they have been forced to ask for new loans, thus getting into a vicious circle, the outcome of which is difficult to foresee and which in any event will not help them to regain solvency. However, we have to recognize that most of those countries have made tremendous efforts towards achieving structural adaptations in their economies. Continuous rescheduling, the adoption of austerity measures and basically restrictive adjustments have not been able to slow down or ease the burden of foreign debt. Notwithstanding the heavy sacrifice, the expected results have not always been attained. Unfortunately, in many instances the situation has even deteriorated.\nIt is time for all those involved to consider the implications of the foreign debt of developing countries so as to arrive at solutions that are more just and humanely acceptable. Such an approach would involve initiating a real dialogue and effective consultations between debtors and creditors on the basis of shared responsibility and within the context of a strategy oriented towards growth and development. It is time for creditors to understand that strengthening national economies, improving collective negotiating positions and remedying the fundamental imbalances of all kinds are indispensable elements for economic and political security. It is only if those conditions are met that the advent of the just and democratic society so wholeheartedly desired by the United Nations can become a reality.\nMali endorses the idea of inviting the international community to consider, as soon as possible, the series of initiatives adopted by the Organization of African Unity, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 with a view to bringing an equitable solution to the debt crisis and to the imbalance in the international economic system. It reaffirms its commitment to the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development and the proposals to re-launch the North-South dialogue, including global negotiations, the programme on remediate measures and, lastly, the convening of a conference on currencies and finance.\nIt is essential to re-launch the global negotiations that are currently frozen, in order to arrive at a consensus on the establishment of a new international economic order that is more just and more equitable and that will put an end to its many current distortions. Today the North-South dialogue is, for developed and developing countries alike, an unavoidable imperative. In this connection the results of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) justify many hopes, provided that the conclusions and recommendations are followed by concrete measures of implementation.\nThe serious economic concerns have not made us forget the equally disturbing disruptions in the international political situation. Foremost among these is apartheid, that abominable practice which has accurately been declared a crime against humanity. The racists in Pretoria have already demonstrated to the international community that they are the enemies of peace, both in South Africa and throughout the region. While developments throughout the world show that it is time to recognize the legitimate aspirations of the black majority, the racist minority in Pretoria is stubbornly perpetuating the abhorrent system of apartheid.\nIn Namibia, as in South Africa, every day people are arrested, tortured and killed for the sole crime of having peacefully demonstrated against pass laws, forced displacement to bantustans and arbitrary arrests.\nTen years ago, when the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (197b), the world recognized that the process of independence for Namibia had entered a decisive phase, and more than one observer rightly thought that Namibia would soon ' regain its independence. Unfortunately the advocates of apartheid persist in linking independence for Namibia to questions having  nothing to do with it.\nMali stands in solidarity with the heroic struggle of the liberation movements in South Africa. We also support the struggle of the Namibian people, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), its sole, authentic representative. Hence we have always advocated the imposition of mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa and the immediate and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Those positions flow from Mali's conviction that peace and harmony can reign in southern Africa only after apartheid is abolished and Namibia has acceded to independence.\nIt is in the name of that peace and that harmony that my country encourages the steps now under way to find appropriate solutions to the other tensions and conflicts that disrupt Africa, in Chad and Western Sahara. In contributing to a positive solution to those various crises, the international community would be doing tremendous service to the peoples of those regions and to Africa as a whole.\nWith regard to the Middle East, Mali is concerned over the tragic fate of Palestinians and the situation in Lebanon. It can never be said too often that the Palestinian question is at the core of the Middle East problem and that peace can never reign in the region until there is a just and lasting solution to the question.\nAccordingly the international community advocates the convening of an international peace conference in the Middle East. Unfortunately, that proposal has encountered opposition because there is a desire to settle the Palestinian problem without the Palestinian people and the PLO, its sole, legitimate representative.\nVery near to occupied Palestine and martyred Lebanon, the brother peoples of Iran and Iraq are killing each other. Mali is profoundly concerned over that fratricidal war and repeats its appeal for an end to the tragic conflict. In terms context my delegation hails the recent peace mission of the Secretary-General to the region, and we urge him to persevere in his efforts. Similarly, dialogue must triumph over weapons, and war yield to peace, in Afghanistan and Kampuchea.\nOn the question of the Korean peninsula, Mali has often expressed its position on the matter and supports the peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean nation.\nMali is opposed to any partition in Cyprus. That is why my Government supports initiatives to safeguard the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country.\nCommitted to a return to peace in Central America, Mali welcomes the peace agreement concluded on 7 August 1987 in Guatemala City. Furthermore, it encourages the Contadora Group and the Support Group to continue their efforts to bring peace and co-operation to that region.\nOur peoples want to live in a world where peace will be guaranteed on a lasting basis through genuine disarmament. To that end, we must become convinced of the imperative need to limit defence systems and the geographical proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. My country welcomed the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development and prospects for continued dialogue between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The step-by-step approach to questions will help to establish the climate of mutual trust so essential in the search for appropriate solutions. What is at stake is of vital significance to the human race, to its very survival is in the balance. \nMy delegation welcomed the recommendations made last year to enhance the effectiveness of our Organization. While supporting those recommendations, we emphasize that criteria for choosing measures to implement them must take account of the universality of our Organization and its objectives, which can in no way be identified with those of a commercial enterprise. In this situation, marked by violence and by the continuing and disturbing deterioration in international relations, we must reaffirm that our Organization is an irreplaceable mechanism for the maintenance of international peace and security.\nWhether it be a question of collective security, dialogue between rich and poor countries, peace and disarmament, or the international economic crisis, our Organization has served as an appropriate forum for the reconciling of views, a place where many answers have been given to many questions.\nLastly, the international situation in the economic and political spheres continues to be a matter of serious concern\u0402 However, day by day man demonstrates that he is able to take action to affect his environment. Perhaps, alongside the prodigious scientific and technical developments, man must get down to dealing with another kind of development, namely, cultural development. We should not confuse such development with that of knowledge or of how to do things. What I refer to is developing our understanding of how to live so that people can accept one another, transcending their differences, so that generosity, solidarity, tolerance and freedom can inspire all people in their daily lives.\nIn any event, our Organization, because of its vocation, can play a role in this new cultural development. May I here reconfirm my country's belief in, and dedication to, those ideals of peace, security, democracy, equality and freedom. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am deeply conscious of the privilege I have today of addressing the forty-second session of the General Assembly and welcome this opportunity to bring to the Assembly the greetings of the Government and people of Pakistan, a country whose faith in the United Nations has never faltered and whose commitment to the purposes and principles of its Charter has never wavered. I have the honour of reaffirming that faith and renewing that commitment from this rostrum\u00b7\nI have great pleasure in extending to you, Mr. President, our warm felicitations on your election to the presidency of this important session of the General Assembly* You represent a country with which Pakistan has excellent relations. The exemplary progress achieved by the German Democratic Republic in all fields of national endeavour is a tribute to the quality and dedication of its leadership and the industry of its gifted people. We feel confident that with your great experience and diplomatic skills you will successfully guide the deliberations of this session of the General Assembly.\nI should also like to congratulate our brother, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, on the distinction with which he presided over the last session of the General Assembly. His outstanding performance was a legitimate source of pride for the Government and people of Bangladesh and, indeed, for Pakistan, which nourishes abiding goodwill and affection for Bangladesh.\nIt gives me special pleasure to avail myself of this opportunity of expressing to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, my profound admiration for the sagacious manner in which he steered the United Nations through times most testing for the Organization and its Member States. We has just returned from a difficult mission to two countries locked in a tragic fratricidal conflict. We are conscious of the strains which his awesome responsibilities impose upon him and assure him of our fullest co-operation and maximum support in the fulfilment of the stupendous task before him.\nPakistan is a young country, but it is steeped in history and heir to a proud tradition. It embodies the hopes and aspirations of 100 million people who carved out a national home for themselves after immense sacrifices. In their march towards freedom, independence and a democratic system of government the people of Pakistan have waged a long and hard struggle. I am deeply conscious of the honour of speaking for such a country as the Prime Minister of its elected Government.\nPakistan was born in a hostile environment. It faced internal difficulties and external dangers of a magnitude such as might have smothered it in its infancy. The inherent strength of the ideology on which it was founded, the faith and dedication of the people and the example of its founding father Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, ensured its survival and steered it safely through the most difficult period of its existence.\nDemocratic institutions are shaped by a nation's political and cultural ethos, in Pakistan the democratic process has been deeply influenced and enriched by the pervasive egalitarian spirit of Islam.\nWe are not only resolved to consolidate and strengthen the democratic process  it is out endeavour to free our people from the spectre of want, hunger and deprivation. Last year I initiated a five-point programme of socio-economic reforms encompassing bold and determined action to promote literacy, provide shelter to the homeless and eradicate inequality, rural backwardness and poverty. We hope to be able to achieve the broad objectives of this programme within the next three years. Last month we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of Pakistan's birth. The day after we achieved independence our founder, Quaid-e-Azam, proclaimed the following goals of our foreign policy;\n\\\"We want to live peacefully and maintain cordial and friendly relations without immediate neighbours and with the world at large. We have no aggressive designs against anyone. We stand by the United Nations Charter and will gladly make our full contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world.\\\" \nOur commitment to the ideals of the United Nations is embodied in our approach to every global and regional issue. Born to freedom by the exercise of the right of self-determination, Pakistan joined the battle against colonialism from its very infancy. We cannot forget those who have yet to win freedom. To them I pledge Pakistan's unflinching support in their struggle to achieve national independence and sovereignty.\nThe tragedy of Palestine is ever fresh in our minds. We share the pains and anguish of generation after generation of Palestinians who have been banished from their homeland and condemned to a desperate existence- This year in particular has a unique significance for the Palestinian people. Seventy years ago, the Balfour Declaration sowed the seeds of the Palestinian problem. Forty years ago the Palestinian homeland was forcibly rent asunder. Twenty years ago the remaining territory of Palestine was occupied by Israel.\nA peace settlement in the Middle East will be durable only if it is just and comprehensive; if it brings about Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, including the Holy City of Al-Quds-al-Sharif; and if it enables the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination and statehood in their homeland.\nIt is my fervent hope that a consensus will soon be achieved to convene an international conference to negotiate a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. The Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, must be enabled to participate on an equal footing in that conference.\nApartheid is a cruel and perverse creed, repugnant to the laws of God and a crime against the laws of nations. Many nations, including my own, maintain a stringent and comprehensive boycott of the racist regime in Pretoria. We appeal to the international community to agree to the imposition of mandatory sanctions against the perpetrators of apartheid.\nThe hour of decision is fast approaching. The oppressed people of South Africa have risen to defend their dignity. They have been subjected to untold misery and undergone great sacrifices. Common humanity entitles them to the political and material support of the world community. Pakistan will stand by the embattled people of South Africa until the pernicious system of apartheid has been dismantled and racial discrimination and domination have been demolished.\nI pray that Namibia will soon win its freedom. The demand for implementation of the plan for Namibia's independence, agreed on since 1978, cannot be resisted indefinitely. The right of a people to self-determination cannot be held hostage to global power politics. The freedom of Namibia cannot be made dependent on developments in neighbouring Angola. My Government has extended full recognition to the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and I assure it of Pakistan's unswerving support in its heroic struggle for liberty and independence.\nIn Afghanistan foreign military intervention represents an attempt to reverse the tide of history. A country that was historically independent, a founding Member of the United Nations, was overrun eight years ago. Its sovereignty was usurped its land desecrated.\nNo objective observer can deny that the intervention of the Soviet Union's forces in Afghanistan violated the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter; that the people of Afghanistan are waging a legitimate struggle for national liberation and self-determination; that the presence of Soviet forces in Afghanistan poses a direct threat to the security and stability of the entire region; and that, unless reversed, this intervention could set a dangerous precedent, giving encouragement to the forces of aggression and to the revival of the era of darkness and domination.\nPakistan has provided shelter and relief to over 3 million refugees from Afghanistan as our Islamic and humanitarian obligation to our neighbours. We could not have carried this burden alone. I should like to express our gratitude to all those who have joined the international effort to bring relief to this, the largest refugee concentration in the world.\nThe General Assembly has adopted a clear and unambiguous stand. It has called for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces, the restoration of the independent and non-aligned status of Afghanistan, respect for self-determination and the return of the Afghan refugees to their homes in safety and honour. The Islamic Conference, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and other international organizations have endorsed those principles. \nAfter eight years of the war in Afghanistan, it is clear that military force can never suppress the valiant Afghan struggle for national liberation. The situation in Afghanistan can be resolved only through a political settlement. Pakistan has participated constructively in the Geneva proximity talks, under the auspices of the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative, Mr. Diego Cordovez. The comprehensive settlement being negotiated through the Geneva process is virtually complete. The principal missing element is the provision of a time-frame for the withdrawal of the Soviet forces.\nThe demand for a short time-frame for the withdrawal of foreign troops is based on the decision of this Assembly. It also flows from the purpose and spirit of the settlement under negotiation. Its logic is irrefutable. Once a political settlement is reached under the Geneva Accords the Soviet forces must immediately abandon the military option. The insistence on an extended time-frame for troop withdrawal arouses legitimate suspicion of a lurking desire to pursue the military option to crush the Afghan resistance even after a settlement has been signed.\nNor can the demand for \\\"national reconciliation\\\" be made a pre-condition for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan. The Afghan resistance has rejected the proposal, because \\\"national reconciliation\\\" under foreign occupation would, by definition, be hollow and transitory. A people's right to self-determination cannot be exercised freely in the shadow of a foreign army.\nThe crux of the problem in Afghanistan is the presence of foreign forces. Throughout the history of Afghanistan, divisions among its people have arisen only when imperialist Powers have intervened in its internal affairs. Left to themselves, the Afghan people have always found a way to reconcile their differences. Once foreign forces leave Afghanistan, agreement on its future governance will be speedily achieved. Indeed, a short time\u2014frame for Soviet withdrawal would encourage all the Afghans to reach agreement on the way in which they wish to govern themselves.\nPakistan would welcome the return of normalcy in Afghanistan under any political arrangement acceptable to the Afghan people, including the five million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran, who constitute one third of the population of Afghanistan.\nContrary to our hopes and expectations, the favourable trends evident early in the year appear to have come to a stop. The military operations inside Afghanistan have been intensified. There have been heavy casualties on both sides. The outcome, again, is a stalemate. Refugees from Afghanistan have continued to flow into Pakistan, this year at the rate of 4,000 to 5,000 every month. Pakistan has also been subjected to repeated aerial attacks and a systematic campaign of terrorist bomb explosions in the crowded bazaars of its cities. Hundreds of innocent men, women and children have been killed or maimed.\nI may warn those responsible for these crimes that, while we are most anxious to achieve a political settlement, we will not falter in our resolve, nor submit to pressure.\nThe absence of a positive response from Kabul has stalled the Geneva proximity talks since March this year, then, a few weeks ago, Kabul suddenly asked for a new round of talks. Pakistan promptly agreed and the talks were held from 7 to 10 September. We shared a legitimate international expectation that Kabul would come forward with a reasonable time-frame. I sent the Foreign Minister of Pakistan to Geneva with instructions to respond positively to a genuine offer of a short time-frame for Soviet troop withdrawals.\nI must confess I was deeply disappointed by what transpired in Geneva. Kabul's representatives continued to insist on an unreasonable and lengthy period for foreign troop withdrawal. Consequently, the talks proved inconclusive. The conclusion is inescapable that Kabul's initiative for this last round was not motivated by a desire to reach a settlement. Its target was this Assembly, whose members, I am aware, have been deluged with false propaganda about the so-called national reconciliation programme and the imminence of the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan.\nThis Assembly, I am confident, will reconfirm its principled position on Afghanistan, By its consistent demand for the immediate withdrawal of foreign forces, the world community has contributed immensely to bringing closer the day when a just and lasting settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan will be achieved. \nThe Soviet Union is Pakistan's neighbour. My Government seeks to promote friendly and co-operative relations with the Soviet Union, despite our differences over Afghanistan. From this rostrum, I fervently appeal to General Secretary Gorbachev and the Soviet leadership to help resolve the tragic situation in Afghanistan on the basis of justice and equity. I assure the Soviet leadership of Pakistan's fullest co-operation.\nBy agreeing to the early withdrawal of its forces the Soviet Union would regain the good will of the Afghan people and earn the gratitude and appreciation of the Members of the United Nations. The withdrawal of Soviet troops would also contribute to the improvement of the global security environment, which is consistent with Mr. Gorbachev's noble vision of a new and peaceful world - a vision which I fully share, and which Pakistan would wish to see translated into reality.\nThe Kampuchean problem, too, is also the result of foreign military intervention. It is particularly distressing that this iniquity should have been perpetrated by a country which had suffered the long rigour of foreign domination. We urge an early end to the occupation of Kampuchea.\nPakistan cannot be tranquil while the Gulf is in turmoil. The tragic war between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq has entered its eighth year. This war has resulted in a colossal loss of life and caused immense destruction in both countries. Its tensions have already gripped the entire Gulf region.\nSince the war began we have made sustained efforts to bring it to an end. During the past tense months we have counselled caution and restraint to all the parties concerned. The growing involvement of the great Powers in the Gulf carries grave portents. The Third Islamic Summit, held in Taif in Saudi Arabia, declared that the security of the Gulf was the responsibility of the States of the Gulf themselves. Observance of this principle can help defuse the current confrontation and rebuild peace in the region. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) contains the elements which can serve to end the war and to ease current tensions. Following the Secretary-General's recent visit to the region, we are today closer than ever before to implementation of the resolution in a manner acceptable to both parties. Pakistan stands ready to assist in this endeavour.\nPakistan is closely linked to the States of South Asia. These countries confront many common challenges, the foremost being that of economic and social development. By establishing the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) they have acknowledged the value of regional economic co-operation, it is my hope that in the near future they will embark on a joint endeavour to build mutual trust and confidence, to enhance regional security, and to control arms expenditures, on the basis of SAARC1s agreed principles.\nPakistan desires peaceful and co-operative relations with India. We look forward to an early resumption of our dialogue. The conclusion of the non-aggression accord, which has been under negotiation since 1981, would strengthen mutual trust. Pakistan remains committed to a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir question, on the basis of the United Nations resolutions, which will usher in a new era of complete normalization and durable peace, as envisaged in the Simla Agreement.\nWe share the concern about nuclear proliferation in the South Asian region, where one country has already demonstrated a nuclear capability. Pakistan does not have that capability, nor does it have the desire to develop nuclear weapons. Pakistan does not wish to carry out a nuclear explosion.\nPakistan is prepared to go further and subscribe to a comprehensive test ban in a global, regional or bilateral context. In June this year I proposed to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi that Pakistan and India should conclude a bilateral nuclear- test-ban treaty. I look forward to a positive response. The conclusion of such a bilateral test-ban agreement between Pakistan and India would serve to assure each other# and the world, that neither country has any intention of pursuing the nuclear-weapons option.\nA regional approach offers the most promising avenue to prevent a nuclear-arras race in South Asia. Pakistan has proposed several equitable and non-discriminatory modalities by which this could be achieved. Our proposals include simultaneous acceptance by India and Pakistan of the Non-Proliferation Treaty or comprehensive International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards; mutual inspection of each other's nuclear facilities; a joint declaration renouncing nuclear weapons; and the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia. \nAlmost all the regional States, and a vast majority of this Assembly, support the objective of a South Asian region free from nuclear weapons. Surely, all legitimate concerns could be reconciled through dialogue and compromise. At least a serious diplomatic endeavour should be made to explore the possibilities of an agreement. For this purpose, I propose that, under the auspices of the United Nations, a conference on nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia should be convened, as soon as possible, with the participation of the regional and other interested States.\nThe growing nuclear weapons arsenals of the super-Powers pose an ever-present threat to the survival of mankind. We welcome the understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union on intermediate nuclear forces. I hope this will be a precursor of further accords between them to reduce drastically their strategic nuclear missiles and to refrain from extending the arms race to outer space. Their decision to open talks on nuclear testing should lead to the early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. In the Geneva Disarmament Conference, a convention to ban chemical weapons is now closer at hand. This must be rapidly finalized.\nAmong and within nations, extremes of affluence and poverty cannot coexist indefinitely. Economic inequality eventually produces strife and conflict. Injustice breeds inefficiency. This is the primary cause for the multiple economic crises confronting us today. If the world economy slows down, the developing countries will again be the principal victims.\nThe world's economic difficulties can be overcome only through simultaneous and co-ordinated actions by developed and developing countries, to channel trade surpluses for development, to revive growth in flagging economies and thus overcome debt difficulties; to expand export access to the developing countries and stabilize commodity prices, to regulate currency flows and exchange rates more closely, and to provide emergency relief and assistance to the poorest countries. Pakistan achieved statehood at a time when the hopes of mankind for peace and progress rested heavily on the United Nations, which has emerged as the authentic voice of justice and equity\u00b7 Its decisions - even those which remain unimplemented \u2014 constitute the criteria by which the conduct of States is judged.\nThe Charter is a precious document. It enshrines a new global ideology, and its principles and purposes re-emphasize the universality and immanence of the timeless virtues proclaimed by great religions and philosophies. The Secretary-General has repeatedly stressed the need for the renewal of our commitment to the Charter. We should heed his words.\nOn behalf of the people of Pakistan, may I say: We applaud the many accomplishments of the United Nations; we understand the reasons for its shortcomings; and we remain fully committed to its purposes and principles\u00b7 Now more than ever, we believe that the United Nations is indispensable for mankind's survival and progress.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly. Mr. President, I am pleased to extend to you France's congratulations on your election, which is testimony to the confidence all delegations have in you. We are convinced that under your presidency the work of the Assembly will be pursued with authority and efficiency. I wish you every success and assure you of our full co-operation.\nIn the time that has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly the international situation has been marked by three principal characteristics.\nFirst, there has been a disturbing lack of progress in resolving regional conflicts. Not only has none been resolved - either the situation is still blocked, as in southern Africa and Cambodia, or progress that had been announced, as in Afghanistan, or broached in outline, as in the Middle East with the proposal for a conference, has failed to be translated into action - but, even worse, in some instances the situation has deteriorated. That is the case with the conflict between Iraq and Iran, which, beyond the serious confrontations it periodically produces, threatens to spread to the whole of a strategic region whose equilibrium is Important for the entire world. \nThe second characteristic is the persistence of major economic and financial problems. In this respect too the period has not produced much to give rise to much satisfaction. The issue of indebtedness, despite some adjustments that have been introduced, continues to compromise the situation in a good many third-world States. Instability in the prices of many raw materials has continued to disrupt both International trade and, even more serious, the courageous efforts of countries whose fate is closely linked to the prices of those products. In these conditions, the development of those States continues to be handicapped, with demographic pressures still a factor even as the legitimate aspirations of the populations concerned grow. \nThe third characteristic that currently has centre place in international attention is the opening in American-Soviet relations. Along with the concerns and disappointments that I have just mentioned, 1987 will probably be marked as the year in which East-West relations were given renewed impetus. Each of us is naturally aware of the prospects that have been opened up, both in respect of an agreement on dismantling American and Soviet medium-range missiles, which new appears close, and in developing contacts among the peoples of Europe's divided continent, as witnessed - and you, Mr. President, are more aware of this than anyone - by Mr. Honecker's visit to the Federal Republic of Germany. In this same context is the work of the third meeting of the follow-up Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which will be able, we hope, to complete its work in Vienna between now and December with balanced results, including gains in the area of human rights and contacts among individuals.\nHowever positive, the improvement in relations between Washington and Moscow remains for the time being confined within precise limits: United States-Soviet talks on disarmament have yet to focus on reducing the huge strategic arsenals of the Soviet union and the United States, They have centred above all on Europe.\nGiven the world situation as it now stands, three important questions have to be asked; How far can United States-Soviet talks go towards improving the climate between East and West? Can the change in East-West relations affect regional crises? Will we be more capable of grappling with ways to resolve the economic and financial problems confronting the world?\nFrance believes that the international community must meet these three challenges: by encouraging progress but also by reaffirming the conditions for genuine detente between East and West) by bringing about conditions conducive to the search for solutions to regional crises by the countries concerned by bringing \nimagination and courage into play to devise new ways to help resolve the problems of indebtedness and development.\nA world of greater stability and interdependence must also be a safer world. France is well aware of the stakes, such as the ramifications of the present normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. We hope that this will not result in decreased security for other countries, especially in Europe. France has followed very attentively the preparation of the treaty to eliminate American and Soviet intermediate-range missiles. It has welcomed, as was fitting, the decisions by the Soviet Union to remove the obstacles that country had placed on the road to an agreement, whether concerning the link between the various aspects of the bilateral negotiations in Geneva, the claim to take into account British and French independent nuclear forces, or the request to maintain a number of SS-20s facing Asia.\nNevertheless, we must continue to keep our vision clear. More disarmament does not automatically mean greater security. We cannot, in particular, disregard the threats to Europe that come from the substantial imbalance in conventional and chemical weapons.\nThis is why as early as 1978 France took the initiative for a conference on disarmament in Europe and welcomes the gains made a year ago in Stockholm. Together with its partners in the Atlantic Alliance and in the context of the multilateral process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, it will spare no effort to enable the second phase of the Conference, which, we hope, will begin in 198-8, to advance towards greater stability in conventional arms on our continent. \nFor this reason also, we attach the utmost importance to the Geneva negotiations to ban completely the manufacture of chemical weapons in the world and to destroy existing stockpiles. But until there is progress towards the destruction of those stockpiles known to be the largest, it is advisable to maintain the option of a minimum stock for security. Western Europe cannot be disarmed in the area of chemical weapons 10 years before the Soviet Union itself completes the verified destruction of its stockpiles.\nWith the proposed elimination of medium-range nuclear forces we should not lose sight of the fact that Europe will continue to be subject, without limitation at this stage, to the threat of a far more considerable number of intercontinental systems, which are also capable of reaching targets on our side of the Atlantic. France, therefore, hopes that the United States and the Soviet Union, without neglecting those aspects related to defensive systems and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, will at long last return to the teal priority of arms control, namely, the strategic systems of the two countries.\nIn this spirit, France welcomed the goal of a 50 per cent reduction in Soviet and American strategic arsenals that was set at Reykjavik last year. Admittedly, halving these arsenals merely brings the Americans and Soviets back to the level prevailing at the end of the preceding decade when SALT II was signed. Nevertheless, this would clearly be a step in the right direction and would establish, as a real priority, not the illusory quest for denuclearization but the gradual and verified reduction of the excessively huge central arsenals. There is virtually no other serious alternative and it seems scarcely reasonable to envision the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within the foreseeable future.\nFrance will not decline to participate, when the occasion arises, in multilateral negotiations on nuclear disarmament. Such talks, however, would be justified only as a later phase of a process of nuclear-arms reduction in which the two super-Powers would already have made very substantial progress. The President of the French Republic, speaking here in September 1983, enumerated the conditions for his country's participation. I would like to repeat those conditions: Soviet and American arsenals must be reduced to a level at which the disparity between their arsenals and those of other nuclear Powers changes in nature  the defensive systems that could destabilize the current bases of deterrence must not be strengthened  the imbalance in conventional weapons must be eliminated  and the elimination of the chemical threat must become a fact.\nUntil such time as these conditions are met, France will not agree to its forces being taken into account, directly or indirectly, in negotiations to which it is not a party. As the Prime Minister, Mr. Jacques Chirac, indicated from this rostrum last years\n\\\"As long as French security rests on nuclear deterrence, the first requirement for my country is to maintain the credibility of its strategic forces at the necessary level. For that reason, France has naturally declined to go along with any form of planned obsolescence of its forces while other Powers retain a huge excess nuclear capacity. It will accept neither a quantitative nor a qualitative freeze on its arsenals nor will it halt its nuclear tests. That arsenal does not exceed the level considered\\\" indispensable for our security and our independence. The nuclear tests are being carried out in unquestionably safe conditions ...\\\" (A/41/PV. 8, p. 71). These have been acknowledged as such by independent experts from Pacific countries whose concerns for the environment we understand and share.\nIn the area of information, France is prepared to take a new step. After welcoming several Heads of State or Government from the region to the test site on Mururoa this year, it now invites the leaders of the Andean countries bordering the Pacific. Other States regularly carry out far more tests than France does, and have been doing so for a longer period. None, we believe, has so far offered such guarantees. The Improved climate of East-West relations has had no effect to date on the principal regional conflicts. Recognizing this fact, the international community must increase its attention and its effort, in particular to bring about conditions favourable to the search for appropriate solutions by the parties directly concerned. Yet we must make a distinction among the different types of crises confronting the world.\nIn some cases, the situation continues to be stalemated. This Is true of southern Africa. With Its sense of community with all of Africa, and especially with countries close to It because of history, language and exceptional human ties, France believes that new impetus can and should be given to the reduction of tensions, the resumption of dialogue and the restoration of peace in southern Africa. Prance has already taken action along these lines, for example regarding the unprecedented exchange of prisoners that recently took place following a French initiative and after the many contacts France had over a period of months with various States in the region. We hope that this exchange will be followed without delay by new developments as envisioned. The official visit to Paris at this time by the President of Angola, and the visit next week by the President of Mozambique, both of whom played a key role in effecting the exchange, will make it possible to assess the prospects that have been opened up.\nBut there can be no return to peace In the region in the absence of dialogue in South Africa itself among all the components of South African society that have together built that country. The release of political prisoners and the renunciation of violence and of preconditions are the prerequisites for this necessary dialogue. Its purpose can be none other than the dismantling of apartheid. The French Government whole-heartedly condemns the system of apartheid, which is intolerable. It has consistently supported, particularly within the European Community, he Implementation of restrictive measures designed to make the South African Government begin such a dialogue.\nSomewhat different Is the conflict in Western Sahara; although no visible progress has been observed. It does perhaps offer more promising prospects for a solution, given the mediation attempts under way. The combined efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the President of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and friendly Arab leaders should at last lead to a settlement within the framework of the right to self-determination of the populations concerned. No country would welcome more whole-heartedly than France a solution that brings closer together the countries of North Africa with which it maintains truly privileged relations.\nAt the other end of the Sahara, the conflict between Chad and Libya has gone through a dramatic change over the past few months, but the final outcome has yet to be determined. Combining determination, courage and audacity, the Chadian army succeeded, under the authority of President Hissein Habre, in liberating from foreign occupation almost all the provinces in the north. There remains the dispute over the Aouzou Strip. Clearly, this dispute, with which the OAU and its ad hoc committee have been seized, will find a lasting solution in the present context only when it has been settled according to law. France, which brought Chad to independence and thus bequeathed to it its borders, considers this territory to belong to Chad. It is ready once again to communicate the documents in its possession to bodies that so request. For the rest, true to its commitments,\nPrance will keep the purely defensive and deterrent military arrangements it now has there for as long as it believes necessary.\nIn Cambodia, despite the efforts of the ASEAN countries, the situation remains deadlocked. Nothing, however, warrants the foreign occupation which, by its continuation, has increasingly assumed overtones of colonization. Viet Nam should  understand the deadlock in which it now finds itself. It must try to find, together with its neighbours and with help from all, particularly Prince Sihanouk, whom Prance is pleased to be welcoming again, the paths towards a political solution. For the people of Prance, who are linked to the Khmer people by an old and ever-present friendship, such a solution can only be the restoration of a Cambodia that is free from all foreign occupation and free to determine its destiny.\nThere are other situations in which stated intentions have unfortunately not been translated into concrete actions. It is therefore incumbent on the international community to redouble its efforts and its firmness.\nCovering Afghanistan, certain Soviet statements led to the assumption that the new team of leaders in Moscow had perhaps understood that the invasion, followed by the occupation, of this independent non-aligned country, which was not at all hostile to the Soviet Union, was a grave mistake. It is a fact that eight years of fiercely waged war have not shaken the determined resistance of a courageous people. Their unyielding determination, the sweeping condemnation of the aggressor by the international community and the resolute support for the cause of Afghanistan, and also for Pakistan, which has generously welcomed on its soil 3 million refugees forced into exile, should convince the Soviet Union that it cannot rely on time to impose a solution by force. While the conditions for a settlement have already been largely defined, thanks to the efforts of the Secretary-General and his special envoy, Mr. Cordovez, the fact remains that the Geneva talks on a timetable for the withdrawal of Soviet troops have still not achieved their objective. If the Soviet leaders sincerely wish to embark upon the path to a negotiated solution, they should act accordingly and, in order to end promptly this conflict of another age, fully accept the right of the Afghan people freely to determine its future. That is what France and almost all the countries represented here expect of them. To a considerable extent the evolution of the international climate will depend on this.\nIn the Middle East, after years of deadlock, the Israeli-Arab conflict recently showed renewed and hopeful signs of progress towards a comprehensive settlement in the revised framework of an international conference which would bring together the parties to the conflict and the permanent members of the Security Council. Since the beginning. Prance has been favourable to such a project, in which it hopes to take an active part. To our mind, such a conference should serve for reflection and advice, without imposing itself on or taking the part of the parties themselves. It should serve to sanction and enrich the dialogue which, thanks to the bold initiatives of certain Arab and Israeli leaders, has begun to take hold. The movement towards peace, unfortunately, appears to be at a standstill at this time. It is essential for its momentum to be restored, naturally on the initiative of the parties directly concerned, but also with the encouragement of the international community as a whole, and particularly States that have special responsibilities and therefore special duties. After 40 years of confrontation, it is more than time to ensure Israel's right to live in peace within secure and recognized borders, and that of the Palestinian people to choose its future by means of self-determination, with all that that implies.\nAt the centre of this conflict, against its wishes, Lebanon, a torn and ravaged country, is paying an ever heavier tribute to the crises of the region on which it has no influence. To the tragedy of war are now added the effects of an unprecedented economic crisis. Prance has decided to continue its presence in Lebanon in spite of the risks and dangers. It continues to be a part of the United Nations Force which, despite its shortcomings, embodies the commitment of the international community to Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The entire world should now mobilize and make an exceptional effort on behalf of all the populations of Lebanon without exception. France, for its part, has Increased its aid again this year. It calls on everyone to contribute to the special fund set up by the recent summit of French-speaking countries. Lebanon, however, will find peace only in the reconciliation of the Lebanese themselves and the establishment of normal relations with the countries of the region. This is the position which we have consistently conveyed to each of Lebanon's leaders and each of the neighbouring States.\nLastly, one crisis, far from abating, seems likely to spread to an entire region. The devastating war between Iraq and Iran has been going on for seven years. In terms of the number of victims and ferocity of the fighting, this war must already be counted among the deadliest of this century. Forms of warfare have been resorted to that are particularly to be condemned, such as the use of chemical weapons and sending to the front children who are barely in their adolescence, today the fighting directly threatens other countries and seriously impinges on the principles of the freedom and safety of navigation endorsed by the international community. \nFrance, along with the majority of States represented here, calls for an end to a conflict that can be dealt with only in its entirety. Over and above the cruel suffering of the two peoples, France is particularly sensitive to the concerns of riparian States of the Gulf and intends to demonstrate in concrete terms its commitment to freedom of navigation. Some of our ships are present in the region where they are ensuring the protection of our interests. But we are deliberately maintaining this action within specific limits and have declined to participate in any multinational actions that could give the situation the overtones of an East-West confrontation.\nWith a tenacity to which I should like to pay a tribute, the Secretary-General nine months ago called on the Security Council to try new efforts. After close consultations among the five permanent members of the Council and a constructive debate among all the members, these efforts led, on 20 July, at a meeting at which I had the honour of presiding, to the unanimous adoption of resolution 598 (1987). This balanced resolution should be implemented in its entirety, starting with the decision on the cease-fire it imposes.\nTwo months have since elapsed. The Secretary-General has been to Tehran and Baghdad. It appears that one of the two belligerents has confirmed its acceptance of the resolution in its entirety while the other seeks to impose its own reading of the text and its own conditions. The authority of the Security Council, which has acted under Chapter VII of the Charter, and the authority of our Organization as a whole are at stake. Great firmness is called for because, as our Prime Minister, Mr. Jacques Chirac, emphasized a year ago from this rostrum the stubborn pursuit of this absurd war, beyond the suffering it imposes on the two peoples, threatens to shatter the equilibrium of a region of strategic importance for the whole world. \nOther regional crises in addition to those I have just mentioned remain unresolved and continue to retain our full attention. In Cyprus, a de facto situation, which France does not recognize, persists despite the efforts of the Secretary-General, who is in the best position to help bring forth a solution. In the Korean peninsula, where a remarkable process of democratization is under way in the south, we hope that direct contacts between Seoul and Pyong Yang will be resumed at an early date and that the Korean people as a whole will at last he represented in our Organization.\nI should like finally to mention the situation in Central America, of which Costa Rica's President has just underlined the hopeful aspects. After more than four years of persevering effort at the initiative of the Contadora Group, the Presidents of the five countries of the isthmus have reached an overall agreement. Admittedly, no one supposes that the road ahead is without obstacles.\nNevertheless, an important step forward was made with the summit in Guatemala. The Central American countries themselves have demonstrated their determination to break the cycle of confrontation and settle their disputes themselves. The hopes occasioned by that meeting should be sustained. The commitments made should, by involving all the interested parties, make it possible to extend democracy to the whole region and lay the foundations for a lasting peace.\nIt is obvious that the improvement in East-West relations does not, of itself, imply a solution to regional crises. Solutions can result only from the efforts of the countries directly concerned and action by the international community to bring about conditions conducive to the success of those efforts, Europeans, who in the past have been torn by fratricidal wars and are today resolutely committed to building a common future, know this well. France, for its part, is ready to contribute to any regional attempt to settle conflicts and to act in a way that may allow Europe to contribute.  The serious economic and financial problems besetting the international community reveal the extent to which all too often selfish, short-term responses still prevail over awareness of the necessary Interdependence and shared interests. In this respect the European experiment is showing the way.\nThe European Community is growing stronger. Its enlargement in January 1986 to include Spain and Portugal has enhanced the Mediterranean dimension of the Community. The Single European Act, in effect since July 1987, has opened up new areas for action, while setting for the Community a key objective; the completion in 1992 of a huge internal market. Since its establishment nine years ago the European monetary system has become a pole of stability in an international monetary system in crisis. Technological Europe, lastly, has distinguished itself by achievements that at times go beyond the Twelve, as in the case of Ariane and Eureka.\nEncompassing 320 million Europeans and open to the world, the Community is determined to acquire both a political and a security dimension enabling Europe to regain its rightful place.\nLike its partners, France is convinced that this movement towards Europe's unity would lose its significance and thereby its force, if it led Europe to turn inwards on itself. The Twelve have demonstrated their firmness in the face of rising protectionism and continue to favour the development of foreign trade. The world's leading exporter, the Community is also one of the most open markets. The majority of its imports are exempt from all customs duties or levies, the exemption being applicable to 90 per cent of the products from the developing countries. The Lom\u00e9 Convention, which governs the privileged relations with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, has established an exemplary form of North-South co-operation. The system of generalized preferences offers other countries important guarantees with respect to the flow of their products to the Community's markets. Finally, Europe has concluded association and co-operation agreements with regional organizations and numerous States, particularly Mediterranean States.\nWe are now prepared to go further, and accordingly the Twelve are entering on a new round of trade talks. These will include, as everyone knows, the sensitive area of agriculture. The Community, including France, are prepared to address seriously the imbalances of world agricultural markets, but we cannot be asked to call into question the principles and achievements of the common agricultural policy. The new round of trade negotiations that I have just mentioned offers an opportunity for considerable trade liberalization. World economic expansion is based on the further development of international trade, which should largely benefit the poorest countries, with each country or group of States doing its share.\nThere has been a greater awareness over the past year that the disorder in the international monetary system since the end of the 1960s has undoubtedly been one of the causes of the mediocre performance of the world economy. France has worked consistently for greater stability in exchange rates and the reduction of interest rates. In this respect 1987 has been characterized by changes in the right direction. The Louvre agreement, concluded in Paris last February and confirmed by the Venice summit, comprises, as we had hoped, specific objectives for the stabilization of exchange rates of the principal currencies and the convergence of economic policies. Such agreements have produced encouraging initial results, but clearly everyone realizes that much remains to be done to ensure a stable international monetary order.\nWe have long advocated concerted action in the area of commodities. Prices for these commodities continue to be unstable and low. Apart from sound market organization, diversifying the economies of the producer countries is a necessity. One of the headings of the Common Fund meets this objective. France hopes that this agreement will enter into force at an early date. 0f all the evils troubling the world economy, the most serious and the most fraught with danger is, of course, the issue of third world indebtedness. For some States the situation has become critical. Prance is aware of the difficulties they are encountering in this respect, especially in Africa; it is familiar with the adjustments and restructuring many of them have courageously undertaken, and the painful consequences that can result for the populations. These States should benefit most particularly from the international community's support, and the conclusions of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the African continent should not be allowed to remain a dead letter.\nFrance has made proposals regarding debt that would extend the grace period and time-frame for repayment in the case of the poorest countries. These recommendations have since begun to be implemented by the Paris Club. Financial flows to the developing nations should be substantially increased. All lenders should contribute, and the participation of banks is more necessary than ever, especially in Latin America. The multilateral institutions should also step up their efforts to help the third world. It is, therefore, indispensable for the resources of the World Bank to be enlarged and for the discussions on tripling the resources of the Structural Adjustment Facility to be completed before year's end so that concessional loans to the poorest countries can be speedily increased.\nIncreasing official development assistance remains an imperative need. In the case of Prance, it has been decided to raise aid for development to 0.54 per cent of the gross national product in 1988. We are continuing to move closer to the target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product for development assistance. Our effort will be directed as a matter of priority to the poorest nations, whose situation should be examined anew by the international community. Accordingly we have offered to host the next conference of the least developed countries in Paris in 1990. Without consultation and dialogue control of the international economic situation will not be attained. For this reason we welcome the results of the recent United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), at which the European Community made a substantial contribution, as my colleague from Denmark, current President of the Twelve, has recalled. That Conference revealed the existence of a general resolve to address the third world's problems realistically, in a spirit of openness and generosity. \nEfforts to come up with solutions to the problem of underdevelopment and, by the same token, to improve the material situation of the majority of human beings, cannot be separated from the international community's struggle to ensure greater respect for human rights in the world.\nHuman rights transcend East and West, North and South. At issue is the dignity of each man. It is inadmissible to say that one can look at the human person differently depending on place or circumstances, or to think that liberty may have several faces or that certain fundamental rights should have priority over others. France will never be silent so long as human rights ate trampled underfoot, whether it be in South Africa or Cambodia, Afghanistan or Chile. It will always be on the side of those who want democracy to live despite threats, whether in the case, today, of the Philippines or Haiti.\nPrecisely because Prance wishes to be above reproach on this score, it recently organized a vote on self-determination in New Caledonia. The New Caledonian population made a clear and indisputable choice, in conditions that were calm and beyond dispute, in favour of the territory remaining within the French Republic. In the spirit of open-mindedness that has always been its hallmark, the French Government is proposing, after broad consultations with all Caledonians, a statute for broad autonomy that should be acceptable to all.\nAmong attacks on individual rights, one of the most odious is terrorism because it systematically targets innocent people and resorts to the most cowardly actions - from a bomb thrown to kill in a place of worship or in a department store, to the taking of hostages, accompanied by blackmail for their lives, thereby submitting the victims to interminable torture and their families to unbearable anguish. Experience has shown dramatically that no State, however powerful, no person, however well protected, is safe from this scourge. No struggle, however legitimate, can Justify resorting to such crimes which constitute, along with the intolerance and fanaticism that feed them, an ongoing threat to the entire international community.\nThe measures that must be taken at the national level to prevent, fight and punish terrorism cannot be totally effective unless they are backed by a more concrete co-operation among States. The efforts against this outrage should be accompanied by unequivocal condemnation, no encouragement or complicity, even passive, should be tolerated. France urges all countries of the world to pursue this fight unsparingly, unceasingly, with absolute resolve, until this leprosy of our age is completely tooted out.\nIn conclusion, whether we are talking about East-West relations, the settlement of crises or responses to the major issues of our time, much still remains to be done. Were the international community, out of weariness or discouragement in the face of constantly new obstacles, to give up in one or another area, all our efforts would be reduced to nothing.\nThese are the responsibilities of the United Nations. It is easy to highlight the shortcomings, the defects, the red tape of the United Nations. There is nothing surprising about this since these deficiencies are our own and pertain to each and every one of us.\nFirst we must adapt our Organization to the changes taking place in the world and undertake the necessary reforms while preserving the indispensable balances. We should be distrustful of reforms that would undermine the foundations of the system put in place in San Francisco it has proved itself irreplaceable. Real reforms should have as their objective a better Implementation of the Chatter and a better functioning of the machinery. This is why we believe the prompt implementation of the conclusions of the Group of 18 is desirable, and we are hoping for a settlement of the financial problem weighing over the life of our Organization and its specialized agencies. This is also why we, together with all the French-speaking nations recently represented at the Quebec Summit, are asking for the strict application of the regulations regarding the use of languages, especially French.\nWith regard to what has been done, as well as what remains to be done, we know that the Organization has been and will be able to rely on the man who is at one and the same time its soul and its principal officer, the Secretary-General. I should like to express again to Mr. Perez de Cuellar the French Government's high regard and appreciation for the remarkable services he renders the international community with a skill, talent and courage that has earned him the esteem and the constant support of all of us.\nThis mission, more than any other, is performed in the service of peace. Over-used and often misused, the word \\\"peace\\\" must remain the expression of our greatest ambition and, at the same time, the expression of the greatest reason. Our highest priority, of course, is to put an end to conflicts: solutions imposed by force will never be as enduring as a settlement freely negotiated and consented to. Efforts to bring about peace must also include organizing an effective and controlled disarmament that ensures our security. Working for peace, lastly, means addressing the causes of conflicts and bringing about the conditions that lessen tension. Security, disarmament and development, as was shown by the recent United Nations Conference devoted to this relationship, remain Interdependent,\nHence the reasonable ambition which is ours: namely, a genuine peace that la not dissociated from the reduction of inequalities in the world, nor from aid to development and co-operation.\nHere again, we find the central role o\u00a3 the United Nations, together with all the specialized agencies of the United Nations family, in ensuring that the Immense wealth engendered by modern technology should benefit not a few peoples but the greatest possible number. There, transcending quarrels often Inherited from centuries past, lies the true challenge of our age. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI take pleasure, Sir, in congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. I wish you every success in discharging this important task. Our goal should be a constructive session where moderation will prevail. I am confident that you will guide the work of the General Assembly with diligence and skill towards that goal. I should also like to take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to the President of the forty-first session, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh. During the last session important decisions were reached, in particular on the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations. Mr. Choudhury personally contributed to the achievement of agreement on this vital issue, and the General Assembly was able under his guidance, to function effectively despite the constraints arising from the financial situation of the Organization.\nI would equally like to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-General. The United Nations and the Members of the Organization have continued to benefit from his dedicated efforts on a wide range of international issues. I reiterate our confidence in him to promote greater international understanding and harmony.\nThe tasks of preserving peace, resolving international problems, strengthening international security for all and creating a more equitable economic environment continue to challenge our nations and Governments. Increased confidence-building and international co-operation ate the key to dealing effectively with many of those challenges.\nProm our vantage point between the continents of Europe and Asia we have always appreciated the value of and given firm support to the efforts towards stabilizing and improving East-West relations. Mindful of our geographic location, we have supported in the field of arms control and disarmament those initiative that have a chance of being translated into concrete, balanced and verifiable measures without diminishing the individual or collective security of any count or group of countries. These considerations will continue to shape our approach to disarmament questions. \nWe are pleased to note that there are at present new opportunities for genuine progress in East-West relations. Important steps have already been taken on the difficult road towards arms control and disarmament.\nWe welcome the agreement in principle reached between the United States and the Soviet Union for the elimination of all their medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles. We have always supported the idea of the complete elimination of medium-range nuclear forces through the global application of the so-called double zero option. The agreement will go down in history as a major step forward, since it will entail meaningful and reciprocal reductions in the nuclear forces of the two major Powers for the first time in the nuclear age. Chancellor Kohl's declaration on the Pershing la missiles is an important and constructive step that facilitates that agreement. It is our hope that this agreement will pave the way for a treaty at the level of strategic weapons. The momentum that currently exists in the arms-control field must not be allowed to ebb away.\nWe believe that arms-control efforts should be considered as an integrated whole in all its dimensions, be they nuclear, chemical or conventional. An agreement on medium-range nuclear forces in Europe will accentuate the urgent need to address the question of conventional forces in a meaningful way. It is not possible to deal with nuclear weapons In isolation if we are seeking enhanced security. If there is no progress in the near future in the area of conventional arms control, further reductions in nuclear forces may Indeed prove to be very difficult to achieve.\nThere is a pressing need to establish a conventional balance in Europe at the lowest level possible, from the Atlantic to the Urals. Turkey participates actively in the negotiations to this effect currently under way in Vienna. I wish also to stress, as we have done in previous years, the growing urgency of concluding an international convention on the general and complete prohibition world-wide of chemical weapons and on the destruction of existing stockpiles.\nThe success of arms-control initiatives depends in the first instance on the establishment of an environment of confidence among the parties concerned. In this connection I would underline the importance of the Helsinki process, which has contributed to bringing about an environment in Europe through which unprecedented progress in nuclear-arms reductions has come within the reach of mankind. All three dimensions of the Helsinki process, which deal, respectively, with security, economic relations and humanitarian issues, are of equal importance for the establishment of mutual confidence and fruitful co-operation in Europe.\nDuring the past year, as the attention of the international community has focused ever more on the continuing war between Iran and Iraq and the situation in the Gulf, that tragic conflict has caused further devastation and suffering, and I poses a growing threat to regional and international peace and security.\nWe are deeply concerned by this situation. We maintain the hope that resolution 598 (1987) will provide a suitable basis for both countries to bring the war to an end. We hope that the Secretary-General's contacts in the region will contribute in concrete terms of the peace process, since the outbreak of hostilities between our two neighbours we have maintained friendly relations based on mutual confidence with both parties, while remaining strictly neutral. We believe that we can contribute to the peace process. The escalation in the Gulf and the tensions that have arisen in the region have further complicated the situation. In this respect, we have been trying to eliminate the misunderstanding caused by a lack of communication and to maintain a dialogue among the countries concerned. We remain ready to do everything in our power to be of assistance in this respect, while pursuing our friendly relations with all sides. \nIn the Middle East, the Arab-Israeli conflict still awaits a just and lasting solution. There Is a definite need to reactivate the search for peace. During the past year the idea of an international conference has gained ground. Turkey supports all initiatives which might lead to a just and lasting peace. Representation of the Palestinians in such a conference is an important issue. The views of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people should also be given due consideration in this regard.\nWe continue to support full recognition of the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people and the withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories under Its occupation since 1967, including Jerusalem. The ultimate aim should be a just and lasting settlement which would create the conditions whereby all the nations of the region can live in peace and prosperity within secure and recognized borders. Economic co-operation among the countries of the region and projects serving common interests could increase confidence among the peoples of the region. That is our vision and that is why we have been working and consulting on an economic venture that will take the abundant waters of two rivers in Turkey as far south as to Saudi Arabia.\nThe situation in Lebanon continues to be a source of serious concern and sorrow. The tragic developments of recent years lead us to reaffirm once again our conviction that only national reconciliation will enable the people of Lebanon to address all its problems successfully.\nThe apartheid policies of the Pretoria Government have continued to be the principal cause of tension and violence in southern Africa. Since last year, unfortunately, the political situation in South Africa has not improved. The policy of the Turkish Government on this problem remains unchanged: so long as the South African Government does not totally abolish its policy of apartheid and embark upon a real process of dialogue and change, the international community should persevere in its efforts. The worsening of the situation in South Africa and the continued human suffering created by apartheid require more than ever a firm reaction on the part of the United Nations.\nThe Council for Namibia,, of which Turkey was a founding member, has this year marked the twentieth year of its establishment in 1967 as the legal Administering Authority for the Territory until it attains independence. It is a matter of the deepest regret that after so many years the Namibians have not been able to exercise their right to self-determination and that the United Nations plan for the Independence of Namibia, embodied in Security Council resolution 435 (1978), has remained un implemented. We reaffirm our full solidarity with the people of Namibia and our determination to continue to support their legitimate struggle for \n\nindependence under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), The immediate and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which was adopted unanimously, constitutes therefore the only universally acceptable basis for a peaceful solution to the Namibian question.\nThe threat posed by terrorism to every society and to all facets of international relations has not abated. On the contrary, acts, methods and practices of terrorism which were unequivocally condemned by the General Assembly two years ago have continued to claim innocent lives on an increasing scale. Turkey has for many years stressed the necessity of effective international co-operation against terrorism in all its forms, we shall work with other Members for a forceful new resolution on terrorism which reaffirms resolution 40/61 of 9 December 1985, Those who instigate or support terrorist activities with the intention of jeopardizing the territorial integrity and security of other States assume a grave responsibility and should be unequivocally condemned by the international community. There can be no double standards about terrorism. Attempts to differentiate between various forms of terrorism can only encourage new acts of outrage. Those who support or tolerate terrorism for political advantage will only live to regret their short-sightedness.\nIn the current year, there is no doubt that the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Traffic convened at Vienna in June was a timely initiative. We welcome all United Nations efforts directed towards assuring greater control over the drug problem, reducing the illicit drug trade, and at the same time alleviating the damage it causes to individuals and societies. As we stated at the International Conference, the close links between the illicit traffic in drugs and both organized crime and international terrorism constitute a serious and increasing threat to social stability and therefore necessitate concerted efforts by the international community to combat those scourges. \nThe Turkish approach to the Cyprus problem is realistic and constructive. In fact that the Turkish Cypriot side has accepted the Secretary-General's draft framework agreement of 29 Match 1986, presented after comprehensive and arduous consultations with the parties concerned, is another indication of this constructive attitude. It is regrettable that the Greek side seeks to prolong the dispute and pursue confrontation rather than accept the Secretary-General's draft framework agreement as the basis of a negotiated settlement. The Greek Cypriot efforts to blame the party that has accepted the Secretary-General's draft for the present stalemate constitute a manifest contradiction. By the same token, the Greek Cypriot efforts in international forums where the Turkish Cypriot people are not represented will certainly not be conducive to a settlement of the dispute. The Greek Cypriot initiative to open a debate on the Cyprus problem during the present session is yet another example of its efforts to divert attention from its intransigence. Past experience has shown that such initiatives render the problem all the more complicated and difficult to solve.\nThe Members of the United Nations are aware of our deep humanitarian concern over the plight of the Turkish minority in Bulgaria, a minority of one and a half million people whose status and rights are unequivocally recognized by bilateral and international agreements. We regret that the Bulgarian Government continues with its coercive policy of assimilating that community, denying its identity and its most elementary human rights. Bulgaria also denies its members the right of emigration. We are ready to accept all who wish to immigrate to Turkey. Many countries and organizations have appealed to the Bulgarian Government to abandon this policy of oppression and to restore the minority rights of the Turkish Muslin community. In fact, if the Bulgarian Government adopted a positive attitude in this regard, that would bring about progress in our bilateral relations, improve the prospects of Balkan co-operation, and reinforce the Helsinki process with regard to the application of its humanitarian principles.\nWith regard to Afghanistan, we continue to support the efforts made by the Secretary-General and his representative to help work out a political solution, regret that the latest round of proximity talks held at Geneva has been inconclusive and that it has not yet been possible to surmount the remaining difficulties on the way to a comprehensive settlement. \nWe strongly believe that the diplomatic process must be pursued and that Afghanistan must be allowed and assisted to become once again a truly independent country. In this connection we should like to reiterate our deep appreciation of the humanitarian assistance provided by the Government and people of Pakistan in hosting millions of Afghan refugees.\nThe prevailing tensions in South-East Asia and the plight of the Kampuchean people continue to be a cause of concern. The key to a just and lasting political settlement in Kampuchea continues to be the exercise by the Kampuchean people of their inalienable right to self-determination. We consider the eight-point proposal made by the Coalition Government on 17 March 1986 and supported by the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to be a valid framework for a comprehensive political settlement. We also believe that the recent efforts of the countries of ASEAN and the Secretary-General represent a constructive contributor to the search for a peaceful settlement in Kampuchea through negotiations.\nI should like to emphasize once again the importance that we continue to attach to the efforts deployed to bring about a constructive and fruitful dialogue in the Korean peninsula. We welcome the initiative taken by the Republic of Korea to reopen the suspended dialogue between the two countries. We hope that the parties concerned will keep working on such a process and engender the conditions necessary to lead to their representation in the United Nations.\nWith regard to Central America, we hope that the new regional effort undertaken this summer on the initiative of Costa Rica within the framework of the Contadora process will promote peaceful solutions to the problems that confront the countries of the region. In this regard, we welcomed the peace plan adopted at that meeting of the Heads of State of the five Central American countries, held in Guatemala City in August. We hope that it will generate a new momentum towards resolving the problems of the Central American region through negotiations within a democratic process.\nOn the international economic scene, the major challenge before us continues to be the reactivation of the development process and the restoration of sustained growth in the world. We all know that events of recent years have not been favourable in this respect. Many countries in the developing world have registered negative growth rates, and the economic growth in the industrialized countries has remained slow as compared to the 1960s and 1970s.\nI should like to submit that the international community cannot and should not be complacent about this situation. In fact, the possibilities and potential available in today's world can indeed turn the tide provided that the community of nations implements the necessary measures in a timely manner.\nThe seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) constituted a landmark in this respect. At that Conference a common approach was adopted by the international community in order to deal with the problems besetting both the developed and the developing world. Countries individually and as groups respectively made common commitments and accepted obligations which are clearly and exhaustively stated in the Geneva Final Act. The Conference was realistic and pragmatic, both in the assessment of the world economic situation and the in remedies to be applied. The concept of interdependence has acquired a tangible and meaningful substance. A strong consensus has emerged as to the need for higher global growth with a view to improving the international economic environment and rendering it more conducive to the solution of the problems of indebtedness and protectionism and acceleration of the process of structural adjustment. \nI wish to focus on an issue of high importance to the developing world from the viewpoint of both integration and development. Protectionism has made deep inroads into the industrialized economies. UNCTAD VII rightly diagnosed the need to revitalize international trade as a means of creating the additional resources needed to overcome development problems. It is important that growth-oriented policies be accompanied by the removal of protectionist barriers. We hope that the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations will usher in a more open system of international trade. We support the idea of an immediate standstill and wider roll back in the early stages of multilateral negotiations.\nNeedless to say, the curtailment of access to the markets of the industrialized world will only compound the debt problem. Careful though Turkey is about its debt payments, we would none the less hasten to state that the time has come for more sustained and balanced trade to overcome the development problems of, especially, the middle income countries. We should like to underline the fundamental contradiction in introducing restrictions on imports from the developing world while expecting debt payments to proceed smoothly.\nWe believe that in addition to universal action there is much to be done at the national level. The Turkish experience is worth recalling in this respect.\nOnly eight years ago our economy was on the verge of collapse. Vital imports had ceased because of severe foreign currency shortages and production had come to a virtual standstill. As a result of the market-oriented and liberal trade policies that we have pursued, Turkey today maintains the highest rate of economic growth among the countries members of the Organisation for Economic Co\u2014operation and Development (OECD), with exports having quadrupled since the early 1980s and industrial goods comprising 78 per cent of total exports. We are currently experiencing a boom in tourism and other services. In April 1987 Turkey applied to the European Community for full membership, confident that its economy had for the most part reached the level of competitiveness for such an undertaking. There are still big challenges ahead, but we are confident of our future.\nLet me now stress the importance of initiatives which the developing world can take collectively. A concrete example is the Committee for Economic and Commercial Co-operation of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which held its third meeting in Istanbul earlier this month. Within a short period this institution has registered palpable achievements. One such has been the creation of a long-term trade financing scheme. Such possibilities and potentialities abound in South-south co-operation.\nHowever, a sustained and organized impetus is needed in the form of investments and capital inflow, better access to the markets of the industrialized world and facilities for debt repayment in support of growth-oriented structural adjustment policies in developing countries. Increasing responsibility falls on the industrialized world to help overcome development problems by improving the international environment and sensibly raising their growth rate.\nIn concluding, I wish to express my hope that the forty-second session of the General Assembly will be able to contribute to the search for peace and co-operation in the world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff It is with a renewed feeling of confidence in the United Nations and a keen perception of its vital role in the strengthening of peace and co-operation amongst peoples that for the third time I come to this podium.\nNearly all the nations of the world are represented here, protagonists in the universal and egalitarian communion that this General Assembly propitiates every year. Here the nations, large and small, raise free and sovereign voices in a discussion of important items on the international agenda.\nBrazil has the privilege of opening this debate, which allows me to be the first to compliment you. Sir, upon your election to the presidency of this General Assembly and to convey to you our best wishes for your complete success in that capacity. I would like also to express my appreciation to Mr. Choudhury, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, for the able way in which he presided over the work of the General Assembly at its forty-first session. I bear responsibility for carrying out the foreign policy of a Brazil reborn into the practice of democracy, strengthened in its commitment to the interests and aspirations of its people and open to candid dialogue at the international level.\nI speak on behalf of a country which is absolutely loyal to its diplomatic traditions, one that is building its future with determination, without being intimidated by the obstacles raised by the reality of the modern world. This reality, unfortunately, is independent of the will and aspirations of most of the peoples of the world and is not always in tune with the lofty purposes of this Organization.\nThe so-called crisis of multilateralism undermines the attempt at juridical regulation of international life and saps the foundations of co-operation among States.\nThe world will no longer tolerate structures based on the supremacy of the few and the submission of the many. Attempts to impose oligarchic schemes on the organization of international society meet with increasing discredit. There is no place any more for rigid and exclusive formulas, Manichean dualisms, or theories that arbitrarily divide up world power - theories often inspired by geometrical figures. The world will come upon better days only when the international order is made effectively democratic and, to achieve that goal, the United Nations has an essential role to play.\nNo nation or group of nations has the right to impose its own conceptions and solutions on the increasingly complex picture of international relations. No one nation should seek to isolate itself or fail to take into consideration the universal aspirations of the community of nations.\nI view with satisfaction the fact that the two super-Powers - by means of direct dialogue between their leaders. President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev - are seeking more fertile understanding and mutual confidence which, we trust, will result to the benefit of all countries. Along the same optimistic lines, it should also be recorded here that there was a recent important meeting between the leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic - Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Erich Honaker - an historic event that may well lead to positive developments for a mature and constructive relationship.\nIn multilateral diplomacy there ate perceptible signs of encouraging vitality. One of those signs was the decision to create a zone of peace and co-operation in the South Atlantic - a decision of undeniable significance for the fulfilment of the principles and purposes of this Organization. There is still hope for a peaceful settlement of the conflict that for over a decade now has been raging in Central America.\nThe United Nations represents the awareness of mankind that only by dialogue and persuasion can differences between States be resolved amicably. In unanimously adopting its resolution 598 (1987) on the conflict between Iran and Iraq, the Security Council showed its capacity to act in a constructive way to arrive at the peaceful and negotiated settlement of disputes. This action to restore peace, in accordance with the terms of the Charter, leads us to believe that in other cases it will be possible to have recourse to the authority of the Security Council, in the same conciliatory spirit. I am persuaded that the Council's diplomatic potential should be used to the fullest extent.\nIt was in the light of this conviction that Brazil decided to present its candidature for one of the seats allocated to Latin America on the Security  Council. Brazil believes that it is in a position to make a constructive contribution during the coming biennium in reactivating the Council's role and in settling problems that affect or can affect international peace and security.\nHaving been honoured with the unanimous endorsement of the Latin American Group, we hope to be equally worthy of a vote of confidence from this General Assembly.\nThe latest signs of a break in the clouds that darken the international political situation are in direct contrast to the indefinitely prolonged economic crisis. The magnitude of the challenges facing the developing nations and the total lack of progress in restructuring the international economic order are the two sides of the coin of the same deeply disturbing panorama.\nThere is no raising of consciousness about the drama and concerns of the nations of the third world and their right to a destiny of achievement and progress which is under constant threat. I am from a developing country that will never surrender this right and is not only convinced of the justice and legitimacy of its claims but also of the viability of its objectives in the economic and social fields.\nAn additional cause for concern in the international community is the persistence of political crises that have been aggravated by the resort to force in violation of the United Nations Charter. Only last year I remarked to this Assembly that, where force is present nowadays, stalemates are more frequent than either victories or defeats. The use of force or the threat of the use of force is not only illegal but is proving itself to be ineffective as well. This holds true in the Gulf region, where the machinery of violence is out of control. It is also true in southern Africa, with the persistence of the tense climate provoked by the apartheid regime, the unjustifiable delay in bringing about the independence of Namibia and the acts of hostility and aggression perpetrated by South Africa against its neighbours. Only the intolerance, short-sightedness and unreasonableness of the racist policies of South Africa can explain the continuing existence of this situation, which is an offence against human dignity and violates the principles governing relations between States.\nOn the other hand, it is becoming more and more urgent to give new impetus to attempts to achieve a lasting, comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East. Brazil believes that the need to convene an international peace conference, under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all interested parties, is becoming increasingly pressing. In this context, I reiterate our concern over the suffering inflicted upon the people of Lebanon, a country whose integrity should be respected.\nWe are hopeful that understandings arrived at between the parties involved, with the participation of the United Nations, will quickly lead to the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and the cessation of all forms of outside interference, so that the Afghan people may exercise their sovereign right to self-determination.\nWe also view with concern the continuing impasse in the case of the Malvinas. Brazil, which recognizes the sovereign rights of Argentina, hopes that the parties involved will heed the appeal repeatedly addressed to them by the General Assembly to attempt to reach through dialogue a negotiated settlement of all aspects of the dispute. \nI am pleased to note that the proposals on the subject of the South Atlantic made from this rostrum in 1985 by Mr. Jose Sarney, the President of my country, were successfully made a reality in the initiative culminating in the General Assembly's approval of resolution 41/11, of 27 October 1986. The establishment of a zone of peace and co-operation of the South Atlantic signified the international community's recognition of the determination of the South American and African countries of the region to maintain their independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and to promote co-operation for economic and social development in conditions of peace and freedom.\nFor that decision to be implemented properly, other States must co-operate in good faith. This is indispensable. The militarily more significant States are called upon in particular scrupulously to respect the peaceful statute governing the region, and to avoid extending into the region rivalries and conflicts that are foreign to it. I cannot fail to point out that serious focuses of tension continue to exist there and that they are detrimental to the full realization of the objectives and principles of the decision adopted by the General Assembly.\nFrom the rostrum of this peace forum I wish also to register the satisfaction with which Brazil views the possibility of the conclusion in the near future of the first agreement in history on nuclear disarmament. If, as we all wish, the United States and the Soviet Union come to a successful understanding on medium-range atomic weapons, we shall have the first real disarmament measure, in contrast with previous agreements, which amounted to nothing more than a palliative management of the arms race.\nIt is obvious that the more heavily armed countries bear the primary responsibility for the disarmament process. But it is equally indisputable that other States have the right to participate in the decision-making process on problems that, although caused by some, affect all, without exception. We therefore consider it indispensable for the negotiations between the super-Powers to be linked with the efforts made in multilateral disarmament forums, especially the Conference on Disarmament, which Is entrusted with a specific mandate.\nI stressed in my statement at the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the developing world has been plunged into a deep crisis, and the efforts we are making to resume economic growth are confronted with an adverse International reality, with structures that accentuate the differences instead of reducing them. I also affirmed then that the attempt to shape the new by using the models of the past impeded the resumption of growth and development on a world-wide basis and the formation of a more just and more equitable international system.\nThe understanding arrived at on the problem of the foreign debt, as set forth in General Assembly resolution 41/202, is an indication of the promising headway which has been made, progress which should now be consolidated. I repeat here the firm and clear position of my country; we acknowledge our International financial. We will settle our foreign debt under fair and reasonable terms and conditions. No one can claim that Brazil has not Itself made every effort to overcome its difficulties. Brazil cannot, however, jeopardize its development.\nIn their efforts to seize Increased economic opportunities, the developing countries encounter the severest restrictions imposed by their industrialized \tfields of finance, trade in goods and services, and, especially, the absorption of state-of-the-art technologies. \nThis is a tendency that undermines the heroic struggles of developing countries to assure their peoples a dignified and prosperous future. It is a tendency that dashes those nations' expectations of more just and equitable participation in the international economy - and more than their expectations: their irrefutable right.\nBrazil has no alternative but to grow. We must meet the crucial needs of a vast population which, in many strata, has known nothing but poverty and suffering. Development is not an option for us; it is an imperative. \nThe efforts undertaken by the developing countries to create a new international economic order will produce results only if they are accompanied by effective action to offset the distortions that exist in the policy of transfer of scientific and technological knowledge. In this regard a vigorous endeavour can be noted on the part of some developed countries to seek to create a new international division of labour, but a division that would be more inequitable and prejudicial to our interests since it would thwart our legitimate right to have access to the latest scientific advances and mastery of state-of-the-art technologies. As President Sarney stated on 4 September, when he announced Brazil's mastery of the technology for enriching uranium, Brazil cannot forgo broad and unrestricted access to the entire range of available scientific knowledge and its practical applications.\nIn this connection I wish to reiterate my country's commitment to use nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes. This commitment not only is beyond dispute but also is supported by the positive effects which Brazil's technological advances in this field, together with those of its sister nations, are producing, to the enhancement of increased co-operation and mutual trust in Latin America. The initiatives of collaboration which are being implemented between Brazil and Argentina In particular, will assure the  mastering of the nuclear cycle without the development of atomic weapons in our continent. This common purpose was highlighted in the exchange of correspondence between Presidents Jose Sarney and Raul Alfonsin when the announcement of Brazil's mastery of the technology for enriching uranium was made public.\nThe fact that Latin America is showing its ability to find practical and creative answers to its own problems is most encouraging. In this regard I should like to cite the example of the dynamic action which the Contadora Group has been 'taking, with the political backing of the Support Group of which Brazil is a member, in its quest for a genuinely Latin American solution to the conflict in Central America.\nOn behalf of my Government I wish to praise the important understandings arrived at on 7 August last in Guatemala. On that occasion the Heads of State of the five Central American nations gave a clear and historic demonstration of political will to resolve the conflict. Brazil deems the accord signed then to be one which offers a unique opportunity to guarantee peace in the region. To that end it has lent its active and interested contribution to the understandings which resulted in the decision, adopted on 22 August in Caracas, to set up an international commission for the purposes of verification and surveillance.\nIn Brazil's judgement the results of the recent steps taken in the quest for a peaceful solution to the Central American crisis indicate that the countries of the region are themselves in a position to find ways to put an end to the conflict which concerns and affects all of Latin America. To accomplish this it is essential that all other countries with ties or interests in the region avoid displaying any attitude that might render such solutions non-viable. The same ability of Latin America to find its own solutions to the problems of the continent is corroborated by the creation of the Permanent Mechanism for Consultation and Political Co-ordination, instituted as a result of the fruitful experience acquired over more than two years of successive contacts among the eight countries which make up the Contadora and Support Groups.\nThe decision of those countries, arrived at last month in the city of Sao Paulo, to begin to hold periodic meetings at the presidential level is an indication that the process of regional co-ordination begun in Rio de Janeiro has rapidly matured. In fact the Group of Bight is an integral part of a process of broader regional understanding, another of whose multiple facets is to be found in the renewed efforts towards the integration of Latin America, which Brazil, as well as other countries of the region, has been fostering in various forums such as the Latin American Association for Integration, the Latin American Economic System, the Latin American Energy Organization and the Cartagena Consensus.\nI wish to reaffirm before this world forum the importance my country attributes to the agreements for integration and economic co-operation concluded with Argentina and Uruguay at the beginning of last year. These are instruments of truly historical significance which attest to our fraternal determination to grow together, to strengthen our democratic institutions and to contribute to the success of the greater undertaking, which is today closer to realization than it was yesterday: the Integration of Latin America as a whole.\nMy words here today have expressed greater optimism and hope than I voiced in this forum last year. This attitude can be explained in the light of some positive aspects of the current International panorama. Along with this optimism and hope, however, I cannot disguise my disappointment and even indignation at the imbalances and inequities which persist on the international economic scene\u00b7 Recent progress in the political field is not being accompanied by advances in the struggle against misery and poverty. On the contrary, the insensitivity and unyielding attitude of the developed countries are increasingly evident on issues of trade, finance and the transfer of technology \nMy country is currently experiencing a time of crucial importance for the definition of its political and institutional directions. We are about to approve a new constitution within the framework of perfecting our democratic way of life. Brazil is ready to continue along the road to peace and construction. This is the road that will lead to progress and prosperity for our people, in growing harmony and closer co-operation with all friendly nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\nI should first like to extend to you. Sir, our sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. I am absolutely sure that your long experience and your well-known skills ensure positive results by this important session. We are particularly pleased to see in the Chair a representative of your country, which is a friend of the Jamahiriya and linked to it by strong relations of friendship and understanding. I assure you of our readiness to co-operate fully with you as you discharge your high task.\nI express my country's appreciation also to Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, who presided over the forty-first session of the Assembly with outstanding skill. We believe that his guidance as President played a large part in the success achieved by that session.\nI pay a tribute also to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar for the efforts he has made and continues to make to promote the role of the Organization and to achieve its purposes and principles, particularly in the maintenance of international peace and security.\nI also congratulate Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed on his appointment to the post of Under-Secretary\u2014General for Political and General Assembly Affairs. This is the forty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, an organization which, despite its shortcomings and the loopholes in its Charter, remains the only hope that the international community has for the achievement of peace and security based on justice, and of the well-being and equality of peoples. The peoples of the world - and it is they who are mentioned at the very beginning of the Charter - have always looked to this Organization to fulfil their hopes and aspirations, in freedom, justice and equality.\nWhen the Organization was established, everyone believed that that would be the beginning of the end of existing international struggles and struggles based n hegemony and racial and ethnic discrimination. The whole world opposed Nazism and fascism as aberrant phenomena. The family of nations joined hands to eradicate those dangers and to stem their tide. Libya, which was one of the victims of fascist aggression lost more than half its population opposing and resisting that aggression during a long and bitter period of struggle, fully appreciates the importance of the world's and mankind's victory over fascism and Nazism.\nIn the field of decolonisation the United Nations has achieved many successes and victories. The struggle of peoples in all the continents of the world, and in our African continent in particular, has been crowned by many victories, which led to the demise of colonization and the smashing of its chains. However, those victories in fighting fascism and Nazism achieved by the community of nations have encountered many setbacks because of the emergence of imperialism, racist Zionism and neo-colonialism. Today we see entire peoples facing extermination or dispersion.\nThe tragedy of the people of Palestine, a tragedy caused by the alliance between imperialism, world Zionism and colonialism, is seen in the attempts to eradicate the Palestinian people. That tragedy can indeed be considered the worst tragedy in our contemporary history. The United Nations, which was used as an instrument to legitimise the aggressor and deprive the victims of their rights through the creation of the Zionist entity, has a moral responsibility to correct that historical mistake.\nThe establishment of the racist regime in South Africa - the counterpart of the racist regime in Palestine - through the same instrument is but another example of the historical tragedies being forced upon peoples. The violation of the rights of millions of African blacks in South Africa and Namibia and the inhuman treatment meted out to them make this a shameful chapter in the history of our time. The racist regime in South Africa can be ended only if imperialist States cease their direct support for that regime. Furthermore, the independent of Namibia, to which imperialist Powers are attempting to create obstacles and which they are trying to prevent by creating new conditions, can be achieved rapidly only on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nWe believe that the time has come to impose economic sanctions on the racist regime to force it into line with the will of the international community. We further believe that the racist regime must allow the people of Azania to determine its own future in freedom and without any pressure whatsoever, so that we may at last hear the voice of the black majority, which has not been allowed to be raised at any time in the past. Nor has that majority been allowed to participate in ruling its country. Stability and peace cannot be restored to Azania unless the national rights of the black majority are fully recognized.\nDespite the attempts by mankind and the family of nations to achieve peace, the savage campaign by the United States Administration against small countries and peace-loving peoples cannot but make the picture a very depressing picture and underline the nature of the State terrorism practised by that Administration. Mi \u0443 peoples have been in the past and continue to be subjected to that imperialist campaign, whether directly or indirectly, in every one of the world's five continents. The Vietnamese people was subjected to mass extermination\u00b7, Grenada is subjected to direct invasion and occupation; Nicaragua has been the subject of siege and aggression; Cuba is the subject of aggression; Libya was the victim of direct aggression from the north, while today it is subjected to the same aggression on its southern borders; Palestinian refugee camps have been and continue to be destroyed; there have been and continue to be attempts at the mass extermination of the Palestinian people, inside and outside occupied Palestine, with the use of American weapons of destruction and with the support of the American Administration. That Administration has provided the Zionist entity with all types of weapons to commit aggression against the Palestinian people and expand, at the expense of neighbouring Arab countries, in the Golan and in Lebanon.\nFurthermore, American imperialism does not hide its enmity towards the Arab world and has widely proclaimed its strategic alliance with the Zionist enemy.\nOld, traditional colonialism, which was kicked out of the front door, is today trying by all possible means to return through the back door. French colonialism, which suffered many setbacks in the African continent, faced defeat in Algeria and was forced to leave its colonies in the African continent, is today attempting to return through the back door. French bases on the African continent, and in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are all a direct threat to and aggression against small countries and peace-loving peoples. The continuing occupation by France of a part of the African continent, is in the case of the island of Reunion, and other parts of the world, such as New Caledonia, where the will of the people is being misrepresented, are outstanding examples of the remnants of this abhorrent colonialism.\nLibya, which was one of the victims of aggression and direct French intervention, cannot but draw the attention of the international community and the world to the danger of French occupation, intervention and presence in the African continent, particularly in Chad. We have heard the Foreign Minister of France speaking of the \\\"responsibility\\\" of France. What responsibility is he talking about? Is it the responsibility of the wolf to its victim? Is it the responsibility of the master to those he wishes to continue to enslave? What role has France to intervene in Africa? Perhaps it is the right of the wolf as comparable to the lamb. We say to the French Government from this international rostrum the time when colonialism could use its heavy stick has gone forever. \nAlgeria is no longer French. Viet Nam, following Dien Bien Phu, is no longer French. Libya is no longer part of the fascist empire of Mussolini. The age of colonialist and fascist treaties and conventions to divide the world and its people has also gone forever. May I also recall that Libya, which fought fascism, Libya, which lost half its population defending its land and waters, will not give up any part of its territory under any condition. Aouzou is Libyan and will remain so. We do not need any French scrolls or documents to prove it is so.\nWe believe in the inevitability of the victory of peoples, despite all the tragedies and plights to which humanity has been subjected. The presence of such a large number of Member States which struggled in the past against colonialism and which struggle today against imperialism is resplendent proof that history cannot be rolled back; it is proof of the inevitability of the victory of peoples. Despite the attempts of imperialist Powers to divide peoples and to sow seeds of dissent among them, we can still say, and say emphatically, that the world today realizes more than at any time in the past the true nature of colonialist-imperialist plots.\nWhat happened in 1948 when plots were made to partition Palestine, disperse its people and legitimise the aggressor will not be repeated in the name of the United Nations. The United Nations today is very different from the United Nations of yesteryear.\nFor the United Nations to undertake its role fully, it must be changed in a way that will never allow the Organization and the members of the international community to ignore new political and economic realities that have emerged on the international scene. The paralysis of United Nations resolutions, the rejection of its will, indeed the flouting of the United Nations and the non-observance by some major Powers of their commitment to the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights must not be repeated.\nCertain rights and privileges of some States - the right of veto, for example - runs counter to the simplest rules of equality among Member States provided in the United Nations Charter - are an obstacle in the way of a truly effective role for the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace ; d security. The right of veto has been continually used against the international will to defend the aggressor and justify aggression and occupation. The time has come for the international community to get rid of that privilege, which is clear y counter to the principle of equality among Member States provided for in the Charter of the United Nations.\nWe welcome all agreements between the two super-Powers to achieve disarmament and peace. However, as small peoples we have learned from our experience not to e over-optimistic. Imperialist Powers will not give up their ambitions or their objectives of hegemony and domination. Imperialist Powers exploit all attempts I peace-loving States to achieve peace and use every opportunity to attack small peoples, usurp their riches, monopolize their wealth and destroy their economies.\nI have said that, despite the achievements of the United Nations, hotbeds o: tension, dispute and war exist in many parts of the world. Those Powers which reject peace and justice feed those disputes and, indeed, they lead to the fanning of more such disputes in order to try out their weapons and achieve their imperialist aggressive aims. The time has come for the United Nations to achieve peace and security, based on the interests of peoples, not on those of the monopolies.\nThe war in the Gulf must be brought to an end; it is a war between two neighbouring Muslim States whose resources must be devoted to the interests of their peoples} their joint efforts must be devoted to standing together with other Islamic and Arab countries in the region against the joint imperialist-Zionist threat. Only the imperialist Powers have an interest in the continuation of this war - a war through which those imperialist Powers attempt to gain a stronger foothold. By amassing forces in the region they wish to inflame that war. We express support for the Secretary-General's efforts to end that war as soon as possible, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.\nThe situation in Latin America and Central America cannot be improved and peace cannot be restored to those two regions unless the imperialist intervention is brought to an end. Imperialism is supporting mercenaries in the area. We salute the efforts of the Contadora Group and the Support Group in Central America as represented in the Guatemala agreement, which we believe is the only way to solve the problem. We should also like to emphasize our support of, and solidarity with, the peoples of Nicaragua and Cuba against imperialist intervention and aggression.\nI have mentioned attempts by imperialism and colonialism to sow seeds of dissent among African brothers. Allow me to say that the solution to the Chad problem can be found essentially - as has been emphasized by various parties and even by Mr. Habr\u00e9 himself - in an end to French intervention, the withdrawal of French and imperialist Powers from Chad, and achievement of national interests among all Chadian factions.\nThe Jamahiriya has always expressed its willingness to help in solving the Chad problem. Libya recently declared, through the leader of its Revolution, that it would leave the Chadians to solve their own problems and that it no longer considered that there was any problem whatever between it and Chad. Furthermore, the Jamahiriya has expressed its complete readiness to co-operate with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the good offices committee assigned by that organization at its most recent meeting held in Lusaka to deal with the Chad problem.\nTo date, the problem of Western Sahara has not been solved in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Secretary-General of the OAU\\\" to solve the problem in accordance with the relevant resolutions and in a way that would ensure justice and equality.\nThe Jamahiriya, which has 1,900 kilometres of coast on the Mediterranean, is very keen to see it become a sea of peace and security for all Mediterranean countries and for the world as a whole. However - and most unfortunately - the Sea continues to be a region of tension owing to the presence there of imperialist fleets in its waters and imperialist-colonialist military bases on its shores, If those fleets and bases remain in the area, that will lead only to more tension and the possibility of new conflagrations in that area. \nLibya has been the victim of treacherous American military aggression during which the waters and airspace of that sea were used. That aggression was directed against Libya in an attempt to abort the Libyan revolution and to kill its leader. In General Assembly resolution 41/38 the international community clearly condemned the aggression after having first agreed at its forty-first session to include an item in its agenda - item 142 - to discuss the issue.\nThe solution to the Cypriot problem can be achieved through co-operation between the two communities in Cyprus, Greek and Turkish, on the basis of a United, non-aligned Cyprus and the elimination of imperialist colonialist British bases there. The Jamahiriya supports the efforts of the Secretary-General towards the achievement of a peaceful and just settlement of the question of Cyprus.\nIn the Asian continent we notice many hot spots of tension. My country, which enjoys excellent relations with the Asian States believes that efforts to solve the problems and eliminate these hot spots of tension must be continued. The agreement signed by the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Viet Nam is likely to resolve problems in the area in a way that will guarantee the rights of their peoples and their socio-economic choices.\nWe in the Arab world have been subjected to efforts to divide us. We fully appreciate, therefore, the importance of the reunification of Korea in a peaceful framework. We support dialogue and mutual understanding towards that goal and we call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korean land. I cannot fail to mention here, however briefly, the international economic situation and the economic crisis faced by the peoples of the world, particularly the third world. The international economic crisis is becoming more grave every year, and it is the developing countries, my country included, that are most seriously affected. Indeed, the peoples of those countries are already bearing the brunt of those consequences. In fact, the developing countries have begun experiencing the effects of economic stagnation, as reflected in their inability t achieve the economic growth needed to guarantee a minimum level of development and progress. The least developed countries face the spectre of hunger and poverty as well as deterioration in all sectors of their economies, particularly in the African and South-East Asian regions affected by drought. The international economic crisis can be appropriately addressed only if the world moves towards dialogue and attempts to eradicate the factors that have provoked it, in the forefront of which is the flagrant injustice being imposed on the developing and the least developed countries because of instability in international economic affairs. The developed countries must restore balance if they are to avoid the effects of the current imbalance from spilling over into their own economies. Tariff barriers on imports must be removed. Furthermore, the developed countries must devote more attention to achieving real stability in the international monetary system.\nThe North-South dialogue will succeed only if the developed countries make concessions with regard to their selfish goals and exercise the moral responsibility they bear towards developing countries. That dialogue can be enhanced by a genuine South-South dialogue and solidarity among third world countries.\nThe world is going through a critical stage of large military blocs and many imperialist and colonialist interventions\u00b7, hence it is in dire need of the Non-Aligned Movement, The Jamahiriya strongly supports that Movement, for we are fully convinced that it has a constructive role to play to decrease tension and achieve international peace and security. We in the Non-Aligned Movement are this year celebrating its twenty-sixth anniversary. On this occasion we hail Its many successes, some of which, unfortunately, have made many of its members the object of imperialist campaigns merely because they have held strongly to the principles and objectives of the Movement as the sole hope for humanity.\nMay I, in conclusion, say that promoting the role of the United Nations - an Organization the imperialist Powers wish to weaken - will be a true guarantee for the achievement of its objectives\u00b7, international peace and security. Attempts to solve disputes outside the United Nations and dividing the world into blocs can only lead to undermining the Organization. Small countries, which make up the overwhelming majority of the membership of this Organization, bear the fundamental responsibility to support the Organization because small countries, including Libya, can but consider their membership of the Organization as one of the best guarantees of their independence and freedom. Pot that reason we must foster mutual effective co-operation in order to enable our Organization to fulfil its role free from any hegemony or intervention.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nMr, President, it gives me great pleasure to extend to you, on behalf of the Ethiopian delegation and on my own behalf, congratulations on your well-deserved election to preside over the forty-second session of the General Assembly. While expressing our confidence that your diplomatic skill and leadership qualities will enable this session to come to a successful conclusion, I should like to assure you of the full co-operation of the Ethiopian delegation as you discharge your heavy responsibilities,\nI take this opportunity also to convey our appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Choudhury, for his skilful leadership of the last session of the General Assembly,\nMay I also convey heartfelt gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his indefatigable efforts in managing the affairs of the United Nations during one of the most difficult periods of its history.\nIn the context of today's tense world situation, an immediate halt to the arms race is imperative if humanity is to be assured of peace and progress in the coming century. Though the call for disarmament antedated the creation of the United Nations and reverberated throughout the earlier decades of this century, it was the onset of the nuclear era that made that call a most pressing and urgent issue on the international agenda. \nThe belief that nuclear weapons provide security, though still embraced by a few, is rapidly becoming out of harmony with the thinking of the international community and is becoming egregiously anachronistic. Indeed, there is now a consensus that the arms race is not only threatening international security, but undermining global development. My delegation therefore believes that measures must be taken to respond quickly to the deeply felt quest of humanity for peace and disarmament. It is heartening to note in this connection that the Soviet Union and the United States recently agreed in principle to effect real disarmament by eliminating intermediate and short-range nuclear weapons.\nFurther measures, such as the renunciation of the first use of nuclear weapons and the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty, could surely go a long way in creating mutual confidence among the nuclear Powers and facilitating progress in nuclear disarmament.\nAt this point I must reiterate Ethiopia's conviction that the Soviet Union deserves the tribute of all peace-loving peoples for the numerous courageous initiatives it has taken to rid the world of nuclear arms. The present opportunity for progress towards genuine disarmament should be taken by all concerned, particularly by those attempting to extend the arms race into outer space.\nThe risks involved in the militarization of outer space are so grave that the call for the abandonment of such a policy should be given the highest priority. The militarization of outer space should be viewed not only in terms of the security danger that the resulting acceleration of the arms race represents, but also in terms of the further diversion of resources that could otherwise be employed to improve the desperate social and economic conditions of the dispossessed in both the developed and the developing worlds. \nIn this connection, I welcome the results of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which highlighted the direct link between disarmament and development and which, we should like to hope, has set in motion the process of development through disarmament. We have no doubt that the $1 trillion estimated to be the current global military expenditure per year could be better utilized in realizing one of the major purposes of the United Nations - economic and social development.\nThe deplorable economic and social condition in which much of humanity finds itself should long ago have elicited the genuine concern of those with the means to make a difference. Instead, the grim economic situation characteristic of the developing world as a whole is left to deteriorate even further, to the point that today, in most of those countries, it has reached alarming dimensions.\nAlthough in the final analysis each country has the ultimate responsibility for seeking remedies for its own economic troubles, solutions to externally induced problems require international co-operation and multilateral efforts. This is particularly pertinent to the economic difficulties now confronting developing countries.\nThe most striking feature of the developing world today is the lack of resources for development, which is the result of the persistent problems of the decline in commodity prices, protectionism and the extremely heavy debt burden shouldered by most. Stagnation in official development assistance has also compounded the problem. In fact, as is widely recognized, several developing countries have become net exporters of financial resources to the developed world.\nIn the circumstances, the developed world, I submit, has a political and moral responsibility to help developing countries overcome economic predicaments the major causes of which lie beyond their control. The demand that the developing countries need first to put their house in order is obviously not the correct prescription for a malady whose primary source is the external economic environment. Protectionist measures that deny access to markets for products of the developing countries, the sharply falling prices of commodities and the debt problem require multilateral solutions.\nRegrettably, however, the North-South dialogue within the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and elsewhere that has been going on for many years has proved to be far from satisfactory and, indeed, the dialogue at the recently concluded seventh conference of UNCTAD has once again demonstrated that many countries of the North have yet to show the political will to accept multilateral solutions to the multifaceted problems hindering economic recovery and growth in the South.\nIn this respect, developing countries, while on the one hand making every effort to remind the developed world of its responsibility and self-interest in global development and in the establishment of the new international economic order, need on the other hand to establish and strengthen South-South co-operation on the basis of collective self-reliance\u00b7 We believe this fact was underlined and the process of co-operation was further advanced by the Ministerial Conference of Non-Aligned Countries on South-South Co-operation, held in Pyongyang last June-\nThe adverse effects of the global economic environment have been especially severe on the economies of the least developed countries. For Africa, where 27 of the 37 least developed countries are found, the international trading and financial environment has become a major impediment to recovery and to the rehabilitation of the agricultural and other economic sectors, hard hit by the recent catastrophic drought. It is to be recalled that at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to the critical economic crisis in Africa, the international community expressed sympathy for Africa's economic plight and pledged assistance to complement the continent's developmental efforts by adopting the \nUnited Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 (resolution S-13/2). Although African countries have since done their level best to implement economic policies falling broadly within the framework of the priority programme adopted by their leaders in July 1985 and the United Nations Programme of Action, the response of the international community towards helping these efforts has proved disappointing.\nThe sharp decline in export earnings suffered by African countries in 1986, which is continuing in 1987, is hardly conducive to recovery. Far from enjoying effective support for their efforts to revive their economies, African countries have in fact been drained of resources. The external indebtedness of Africa is now estimated to be $200 billion and, when compared with the continent's total gross domestic product and its total export earnings, represents an unbearable burden. Indeed, the debt-servicing commitments of Africa have eaten up resources that could otherwise have been used for agricultural rehabilitation and for effective implementation of the Priority Programme. Furthermore, the situation has been aggravated by the fall in real terms in official development assistance. It is no wonder the present predicament of African countries has been aptly described as one characterized by financial drought and famine.\nAfrican countries are under no illusion that the search for remedies for their economic woes should be left to others. They are indeed determined to bear the burden required to pull themselves out of the excruciating economic crisis that has stifled recovery for so long. However, since some of the major obstacles to recovery are the results of external factors, international co-operation and assistance are indispensable. The international community is therefore called upon to respond favourably to Africa's need for increased financial assistance and to its desire to convene an international conference on Africa's external indebtedness.\nIn any discussion of African problems, one cannot fail to refer to the explosive situation in southern Africa, for the diffusion of which the international community in general and the United Nations in particular bear a special responsibility. Today there are few more serious threats to international peace and security, and few greater challenges to the principles upon which this Organization is based and, indeed, no more blatant violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms than that represented by the racist Pretoria regime and the apartheid system it so single-mindedly promotes.\nThe unlawful occupation and continued suppression of the aspirations of the Namibian people by Pretoria in total defiance of the international community continues with impunity. The United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia, contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978), has been rendered a dead letter, not because it is an unrealistic plan, but because of the intransigence of Pretoria, which is reinforced by support from a few Governments in the West. Any and all attempts to link the independence of Namibia to other unrelated issues is only a subterfuge for postponing the liberation of the Namibian people, and my delegation feels that the United Nations should not allow itself to be defined by Pretoria indefinitely. Resort should therefore be had without delay to enforcement measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, in order to bring the racist regime onto the path of international legality and morality. The imposition of comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions is the only peaceful course of action that could expedite the independence of Namibia. Failing this, the suffering people of Namibia would have no alternative but to intensify the legitimate armed struggle under their sole and authentic representative, the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). \nWithin South Africa itself, the racist regime has continued to deny the black majority of its fundamental human rights and to practice its abhorrent system of apartheid. The world-wide call for comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against Pretoria is awaiting the response of some Western Governments which still embrace racist Pretoria as an ally and even consider it the last bastion on the African continent of the so-called Western civilization. We should be honest enough to say before this august Assembly, and without fear of contradiction, that the litmus test for one's commitment to human rights is one's attitude towards apartheid. Verbal condemnation of apartheid, which in practice impedes the application of measures to combat this crime against humanity, cannot hoodwink world public opinion and must be abandoned.\nEthiopia, true to its commitment to the total liberation of Africa, joins the call for comprehensive mandatory sanctions against Pretoria and expresses its solidarity with the African National Congress and with all patriotic forces engaged in a heroic struggle against the racist regime to regain their freedom and human dignity.\nIt is a widely acknowledged fact that the regime in South Africa has also continued with impunity its destabilization of, and aggression against, the front-line States. The wanton destruction of property and other economic and social infrastructure, as well as the indiscriminate massacre of civilians, including the young and the aged, are daily occurrences throughout southern Africa. Through direct military incursions into neighbouring countries and through the arming and financing of bandits, Pretoria is still attempting to stifle the struggle for liberation and to suppress even political and moral support for those who are fighting for their fundamental freedoms and national independence. \nIn the circumstances, the international community is duty-bound to assist the front-line States to resist Pretoria's aggression and to enable them to overcome their vulnerability to South Africa's economic pressure. In this respect, the establishment by the Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries of the Africa Fund is an example that needs to be emulated. Even with its limited capacity, Ethiopia will not fail to extend support to and stand in solidarity with the front-line States.\nIn addition to the situation in southern Africa, there are numerous other hotbeds of tension that threaten international peace and security. The war between Iran and Iraq, for instance, and the accompanying foreign Intervention in the region could easily escalate into a situation with unforeseen consequences to world peace. As has often been stated, this is a war that should never have been started and should never be allowed to continue. The search to find a just and durable solution must, therefore, continue and must be based on the well-known principles and norms of inter-State relations, taking into account the legitimate interests of both parties to the conflict.\nAs a country not far away from the region, Ethiopia is seriously concerned at the increased presence of foreign forces in the Persian Gulf, The Gulf is, in our opinion, a natural extension of the Indian Ocean, which the international community has declared a zone of peace. The early convening of the repeatedly postponed international conference on the Indian Ocean could, therefore, go a long way in contributing to the climate of peace and security, not only In the region of the Indian Ocean, but more particularly around the Persian Gulf. As a hinterland state of the Indian Ocean, Ethiopia attaches great importance to the speedy realization of the objectives of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace and will continue to strive for the early convening of the conference at Colombo. In the mean time, we call on all those concerned not to aggravate the situation in the region through military and naval build-up and so-called military exercises.\nAs regards the situation in the Middle East, Ethiopia once again insists that the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination is an issue that should be addressed in any peace formula designed to bring about genuine peace to the region, A lasting peace can only be established when the national tights to the Palestinian people are restored and when the rights of all States of the region to live in peace within recognized boundaries are respected. My delegation also believes that progress towards peace in the region requires the holding of an international peace conference with the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nThe United Nations has been seized of the questions of Cyprus, Korea, Lebanon, Western Sahara and the situations in south-west and South-East Asia for quite some time. While my Government's views on all these issues are well known, I wish to state that recent developments for peace and national reconciliation in Afghanistan and Kampuchea must be supported and encouraged by the international community. Efforts to restore the unity and territorial integrity of both Cyprus and Lebanon and to advance the process of the peaceful reunification of the Korean people must be intensified. The Ethiopian delegation believes that the recent proposals presented by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea could serve as a constructive basis for accelerating the process of peaceful reunification of the Korean people. As regards the question of Western Sahara, we maintain that implementation of the latest decisions of the Organization of African Unity (OA\u00dc) and of the General Assembly of the United Nations is more urgent now than ever.\nWhen we turn our attention to the situation in Central America, we note with indignation that, in clear contravention of the fundamental principles of respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States, the United States has, during the last nine years, subjected Nicaragua to all sorts of pressure, intimidation and even overt acts of aggression. The intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua directly and through the use of counter-revolutionary bandits masquerading as \\\"freedom fighters\\\", is of course a folly beyond our comprehension. If big States, relying on their military might, are allowed to arrogate to themselves the right to decide on the future of other nations, the world would surely be plunged into anarchy. In this day and age we cannot and must not allow the resurgence of imperialism as the dominant factor in world politics. On the contrary, we must uphold international legality and, in this case, we must all echo the call for full and immediate compliance with the Judgment of the International Court of Justice of 27 June 1986. \nWhile expressing solidarity with the Nicaraguan people and Government, Ethiopia wishes to commend the efforts of the Contadora and Support Groups, as well as the recent efforts of the countries of Central America collectively to shoulder the responsibility for bringing about peace in their region.\nIt will be recalled that at its forty-first session the General Assembly, responding to a widely felt need for introducing reforms to improve the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations, adopted resolution 41/213. Although no one with genuine concern for the health of the Organization could belittle the importance of the reforms adopted, we cannot hide our disappointment at the fact that some were tempted to use the reform exercise to attack multilateralism in general and to undermine the authority of the General Assembly in particular.\nFurthermore, we should like to state quite openly and with candour that the avowal by the United States of its commitment to reform of the administrative and financial functioning of the Organization while it refuses to pay its assessed contributions to the regular budget of the United Nations cannot but sound hollow. We are, at any rate, gratified to note that, despite the immense political pressure and financial difficulties it has faced in the past few years, the world body is still striving to overcome its difficulties and fulfil the purposes entrusted to it.\nBefore I conclude my statement, I beg the indulgence of the Assembly to say a few words about the proclamation of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in September this year - a historic development which we believe will further enhance Ethiopia's international standing and promote regional peace.\nThe Provisional Military Administrative Council, despite all the efforts to besmirch its image, belittle its achievements and even question its revolutionary and patriotic essence, has today vindicated itself by fulfilling its original promise to hand over power to a genuinely representative Government that responds to the aspirations of the Ethiopian people to equality, social justice and progress.\nThe past 13 years in Ethiopia's history have been years of fundamental changes which not only freed the Ethiopian people from centuries of bondage and servitude but also registered encouraging achievements in the various fields of national endeavour, thus setting the stage for the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.\nThe Constitution of the new Republic, which is the supreme law of the land, has been drafted by experts from all relevant disciplines and is firmly based on the historical, cultural, political and economic conditions of the country. The draft of the Constitution was discussed, enriched and amended by the people nation-wide and came into force only after it was endorsed by the overwhelming majority of the Ethiopian people in a national referendum. The National Assembly - or National Shengo - composed of well over 800 deputies, was also formed through a process of democratic elections and in today's Ethiopia constitutes the highest organ of State power.\nThe first session of the National Shengo, concluded only recently, has issued important proclamations among which figure the historic changes made in the regional administrative structure of the country and in the devolution of power to the regions so as to guarantee the equality of nationalities and facilitate their speedy development. The country is now reorganized into five autonomous and 24 administrative regions. This structure, we believe, will ensure the free exercise by our people of their political, economic and cultural rights, while at the same time safeguarding and consolidating the historical unity of the motherland.\nThough the establishment of the Republic represents a milestone in our history and has laid a solid foundation for overall development, we are well aware of the fact that long years of hard work and sacrifice are yet required for accelerated social and economic progress. Like other developing countries, Ethiopia suffers from the prevailing unjust international economic system and is still a victim of natural calamities. More particularly, it is now once again exposed to the challenges of the drought which has resulted from the small amount and uneven distribution of precipitation during the main rainy season this year.\nAs a result we are expecting next year a drastic shortfall in food production in the affected regions. Regrettably, some Governments are already attempting to use our predicaments to promote their own ideology and policy prescriptions by attributing this shortfall to the agricultural policies we have chosen for ourselves. The zealous effort of some, particularly officials of the United States Administration, to promote this point of view is such that this appears to be tantamount, to linking natural calamities, from which they themselves are not immune, to the policies we have chosen to pursue. Undeterred by the self-serving pronouncements and actions of others, we will, however, continue to give special emphasis and priority attention to agricultural development and food production.\nWhile the current drought will undoubtedly impede our determined efforts to rehabilitate and develop the agricultural sector of our economy, we have no doubt that with the effective mobilization of our own limited resources and the assistance of the international community we shall be able to overcome this temporary setback so that the aspirations of our people to a better and brighter tomorrow may be realized.\nAs regards the foreign policy of the People's Democratic Republic, chapter 5 of the new Constitution sets out the basic guidelines. According to article 29: \\\"The People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia shall strive for co-operation among peoples, mutual development and the strengthening of good-neighbourly relations with adjoining States on the basis of respect for the inviolability of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, non-interference in their internal affairs, the peaceful resolution of conflicts and, in general, the principles of non-alignment.\\\"\nOn the basis of mutual acceptance of these principles, we are ready to forge and strengthen relations with all countries, particularly those which are in our region and with which we have had difficult relations.\nWe do not interfere in the internal affairs of others and we expect others to act similarly. We respect the national unity and territorial integrity of other States, and we expect others to respect ours. The establishment of the Republic, with its new regional structures, and the peace process that we have initiated have created, we believe, the necessary favourable atmosphere and conditions for the countries of the region to address the substantive issues that divide them and to establish a long-lasting peace on the basis of mutual respect for the principles and norms of international law and good-neighbourly relations.\nFinally, I should like to reiterate our conviction that in the present interdependent world there is no substitute for multilateralism as the best mechanism for solving the various complex international problems confronting humanity. Indeed, we should all be seriously concerned at the various manifestations of hostility to these principles evident in recent years, and as a result must exert every effort to combat such manifestations. We must above all support and strengthen the United Nations as the universal embodiment of multilateralism.\nThe People's Democratic Republic, whose Constitution explicitly prescribes for Ethiopia active participation in international and regional organizations, affirms its full support for the United Nations and a strong commitment to its Charter principles. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great honour for me to participate in the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nFirst, Sir, I wish, on behalf of the Government and people of the Dominican Republic and on my own behalf, to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. That decision was made on the basis of your well-known personal and professional skills and experience in international affairs. These qualities will undoubtedly enable you to make a significant contribution to the success of our meetings.\nI take this opportunity to extend a cordial greeting to your predecessor, Mr. Choudhury of Bangladesh, and thank him for the competent and authoritative way in which he carried out the duties of President at the last session.\nOn behalf of the Dominican Government, I also have pleasure in extending warm greetings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, and assuring him of our appreciation and gratitude for his praiseworthy and valiant efforts in pursuing the purposes of our Organization.\nThe maintenance of peace and respect for the principle of non-intervention are unalterable elements of the foreign policy of my country, as set forth in our fundamental law and supported by our practice in international relations.\nNegotiation and dialogue are for my country the ideal instruments for the achievement and maintenance of peace, both nationally and internationally. Without peace there can be no economic progress or social development.\nPeace is not merely the absence of war or peace imposed by a superior force. Peace imposed by fear, conditional upon a balance of destructive power, is despicable and transitory. The fear of a nuclear cloud enveloping out planet prevents the full development of the human intelligence that would make possible the creation of conditions in which mankind could enjoy the material and spiritual benefits of this world. For this reason the Dominican Republic welcomes with hope the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union that will make it possible to establish conditions for the elimination of medium-range nuclear missiles. We join the other speakers who have already applauded this step in the Assembly.\nOne basis for peace is humane treatment of and solidarity with immigrants, be they undocumented aliens, political refugees or fugitives from war zones. That is why the Dominican Republic is taking the opportunity offered by this Assembly to consider one of the most harmful practices in this respect discrimination with regard to the mobility of factors of production. It is a little-known fact, but a fact none the less, that most of the countries represented here practise some kind of discrimination in their immigration policies.\nEmigration from our countries is a consequence of the worst economic crisis that virtually the whole of America has suffered since the 1930s. Despair and hunger force many people to leave their countries, homes, families and friends in search of something better. Is it just and charitable to treat our brothers who set out on that painful Odyssey so harshly and contemptuously? To do so is to undermine the foundations upon which the longed-for peace must be based.\nThe Dominican Republic is convinced that the basis of a fruitful peace is, among other things, the gradual elimination of the protectionist barriers that prevent the free flow of international trade. Those barriers favour certain monopolistic interests, both political and economic\u00b7, they increase unemployment and inflation in the countries that take shelter behind this policy.\nProtectionism, whether by raising tariff barriers or by imposing quotas, is a two-edged sword that harms producers and consumers equally, to the benefit of a minority. It is extremely difficult, not to say impossible, to quantify the effects of increased protectionism upon our economies. The predictable result, however, is that the path of protectionism leads to the world-wide contraction of international trade.\nProtectionism may benefit some, but only in the short term for in the end it harms everyone, including the protectionists themselves. Free, vigorous world trade, unhampered by quotas, is indispensable to the well-being of the world economy. Every protectionist measure removes us further from that objective. We must, therefore, all move together towards a process of liberalization of world trade\u00b7, but for that purpose, it is necessary that more countries accede to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),\nOur position on the problem of foreign debt is well-defined. Our country is not in a position to honour the debt-servicing scheduled, particularly considering the precarious levels of our foreign exchange resources. What is needed, therefore, is a programme that will reconcile what the country should pay and what it can pay, always bearing in mind that economic growth and the subsistence of our: people must not be sacrificed. With regard to our debt to commercial banks, we press for the concession of longer grace and repayment periods by the World Bank and the substantial reduction of the interest rates on that debt. \nAs regards our bilateral debt, we firmly believe that for the achievement of bilateral negotiations it is not necessary for us to reach a prior agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMP) , In this regard we have publicly stated our intention to restructure our commitments with the Paris Club whether or not there exists a financing programme with the Fund. We share the view that the countries members of the Paris Club should urgently revise their restructuring policies in order to permit multilateral agreements with debtor countries.\nOn the multilateral debt, our country considers it absolutely necessary, precisely at this time of financial crisis, for international development banks and multilateral agencies to maintain a net positive flow of resources to our countries. Otherwise debt servicing to these institutions will become virtually impossible. What is required is the greatest possible flexibility on the part of International bodies as regards the repayment of the loans, their methods of procedure, credit policies and a greater supply of concessional resources.\nConcerning South-South debt, my country hopes that the financial relations of payment and repayment of external debt with developing countries may be framed in terms of new patterns of compensation, bearing in mind the relative levels of development and the availability of reserves in each of our countries.\nWe must all make a determined effort to eradicate the inequalities brought about by social maladjustment which provoke international social agitators, who take a heroic stance in their actions but are no more than criminals.\nOn terrorism my country believes that at this forty-second session the General Assembly should unanimously adopt a resolution appealing to all Governments to set in motion the provisions of General Assembly resolution 40/61 of 1985. Any other course would be a waste of time. We cannot establish distinctions between social agitation and the legitimate struggle of oppressed peoples. Another threat to peace is the growing traffic in drugs, a far worse evil than nuclear clouds. We must therefore launch a publicity campaign under the auspices of this world Organization to ensure that, utilizing the most modern and sophisticated means of mass communication, we can inform mankind about the dangers represented by the consumption of and traffic in drugs. As repression has so far proved ineffectual, it would be better to work for a drop in consumption, which would hurt the drug traffic.\nMy country wishes to emphasize the grave danger to mankind of the spread of AIDS (acquired immune-deficiency syndrome) with its serious consequences. As was recently pointed out by the Holy Father Pope John Paul II, this is a \\\"grave crisis\\\". It has been shown that this illness is not only spreading throughout economically and culturally disadvantaged areas but is also increasing in civilized regions, where its advance has taken on alarming proportions.\nMy delegation proposes that the United Nations should foster research to find a remedy for this illness} that fellowships be created to help laboratories look into the origin and cause of the disease; and that a data bank be established for the exchange of information about it. This is a matter that is as important as, if not more important than, the other threats mentioned previously, such as nuclear weapons, external debt, protectionism, discrimination against immigrants and the drug traffic.\nMy delegation also believes that great importance attaches to the problem of the elderly. Many years have elapsed since the General Assembly at its thirty-seventh session adopted its resolution 40/30 endorsing the International Plan of Action on Aging. \nIn view of the enormous magnitude and growing complexity of the question of aging, the Government of the Dominican Republic considers that the time has come for the United Nations to adopt a declaration on the rights of the aged and that the Governments of all countries, developed and developing, should lend their sponsorship to this matter so that this sector of the population, to which we shall all ultimately belong, may occupy its rightful place in the community and in society in general.\nIn our judgement it would also be beneficial to convene in 1992, the tenth anniversary of the Vienna Conference, a second world assembly on aging at which we would use the same Kind of complementary measures employed so successfully at the International Conference on Population held in Mexico City in 1984 and at the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women held in Nairobi in 1985. With respect to the measures adopted by the Dominican Government to avert the economic crisis, I must say that these have been very appropriate.\nIn the fiscal area, the aim we have set for ourselves is that of significantly reducing our fiscal deficit until we make it less than 1 per cent of our gross domestic product. Bearing in mind that during the past year this deficit was in the order of 5 per cent of the gross national product, such a reduction of our deficit would imply a drastic reduction in the inefficiency of our economic system. To bring about this significant reduction in the deficit, we are applying important administrative and structural reforms in our economic policy.\nBefore reducing its expenses, the Dominican Government is introducing the reform of a fiscal system, designed to simplify our tax structure, to increase its elasticity and to rationalize our tariff system. What has been achieved so far this year indicates that the savings for the central Government were five times greater than for the same period last year. This has helped to bring about the duplication of capital expenditure and the reduction of deficits as programmed. The structural reforms include privatisation of State sugar-cane lands by sale to the private sector so that the lands may be used for the development of agricultural and tourist projects.\nAnother structural reform is integration of the production and sale of electric power into the private sector. In the Dominican Republic, this public service has so far been supplied by a State monopoly in a very inefficient manner.\nThere would be little use in my country's applying an economic policy directed outside, increasing national savings and reorienting the role of Government with regard to the economy if there were not a supportive policy on the part of the industrialized countries with whom we conduct trade. From these industrial nations we require a renovation of the process of liberalization of international trade. We would request them to reduce their subsidies to exports since these are prejudicial to our people. The first world must avoid restrictions on its imports so that the exports of the third world will not suffer.\nSome industrialized countries should promote a reduction in their real interest rates even if to do this they have to reduce their excessive budget deficits. Moreover, the International Bank could contribute by reducing the margins charged for its loans, especially for those countries that are going through an adjustment process. We could create amongst all of us defensive techniques that would enable us to face future increases in interest rates \u2014 for example through the use of compensatory financing facilities by the International Monetary Fund (IHF) , There is little sense in our having net flows towards the IMF or the World Bank when we could be obtaining from them greater resources than those which we are paying, and precisely when we most need such flows.\nThe industrialized countries could contribute new funds to the international organizations so that these, in turn, could be channelled to our countries. Latin America will need some $20 billion annually in coming years. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development - the World Bank - and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) are being called upon to do their share, especially in the short term. These institutions are capable of expanding their co-financing operations and partial guarantees of private loans.\nThe first objective of ray Government's global economic policy is to establish self-sustaining economic growth so as to continue expanding employment and per capita income for the population. In view of the growing external indebtedness, my authorities are responding and mobilizing as many material and human resources as possible for the promotion of economic growth and achieving a rate of real growth of approximately 11 per cent per annum during a large part of this year.\nMy Government's second objective is to face responsibly the problems of external debt. In so far as we are complying with the deadline agreed to we are requiring out creditors to accept that these be paid in the roost feasible manner and without extraordinary sacrifices by the people.\nAlong with those objectives we are working to distribute income more equitably, but not simply by taking away from some to give to others rather, by educating all to produce and create wealth. We recognize that the solution to our poverty is not to divide our wealth amongst more people but to increase that wealth so that it can be better distributed among all. Economic growth is the best means we have to do so, and in that way respond to the essential needs of our population.\nTo attain those objectives we are orienting our external economic policy  promoting exports, foreign investment and tourism, and requiring more efficient import substitution. To expand our external trade we are seeking a competitive and realistic exchange rate, and trying to avoid protectionist excesses to which we are so inclined.\nWith regard to the balance-of-payments problems, we are trying to remove the temptation to increase State intervention. Experience has taught us that the final result of such interventions tends to be a wasting of resources and a private sector which is more independent of the Government. In addition, we cannot demand that others be less protectionist if we are not prepared to move towards increasingly free world trade.\nWe are seeking to stimulate the repatriation of the flight of capital and provide a more secure profitability. We hope truly to reward persons who save so that they can effectively contribute their savings to national endeavours. We are encouraging savings and discouraging consumption, paying attractive interest to those who save and eliminating the subsidies that still exist in our banking system.\nFurther, we are stimulating the entry of foreign capital, especially if it does not imply debts. Accordingly, within a few weeks the Dominican authorities will begin to permit the conversion of a considerable part of our external debt into investments. This conversion will significantly reduce our debt and its servicing; it will contribute positively to our economic growth and generate more employment and income for our population. \nThe Dominican Republic has applied for admission into the Lome Group. Why Lom\u00e9? Because we have a reality before us: the need to rely on the support and solidarity of those industrialized nations which are members of the European Economic Community. The States members of that Community in the Lome framework are encouraging autonomous and sustained development of the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific; they accord more favourable treatment than the most-favoured-nation treatment and the Generalized System of Preferences; and they implement technical and financial assistance for development in the form of subsidies and special hard and soft loans among other things.\nThe Dominican Republic is seriously concerned at the situation prevailing in various parts of the world where existing tensions and conflicts are endangering peace and stability. Our country reaffirms the need to foster national reconciliation in countries with divided communities. Similarly, we urge respect for the right of peoples to self-determination and for the principle that no State has the right to intervene by force of arms or in any other manner in the internal affairs of another State.\nOn the other hand, we are concerned at the indifference of some States with regard to the implementation of resolutions adopted by overwhelming majorities in the General Assembly with a view to solving extremely important questions for world security. This apathy calls into question the viability of the United Nations as an organization and thwarts its commitment to maintain international peace and security; moreover, it undermines internationalism and threatens the solvency of the United Nations.\nIt is necessary to strengthen the mandate of the United Nations and, at the same time, avoid any initiative that may weaken its capacity for action and its role as the universal instrument of peace. \nThis Assembly has before it once again the same crises and conflicts about which it has debated for several sessions. This reflects the repetitive character of the Assembly's debates and the scanty progress achieved in eliminating tensions and problems affecting the international community. The perpetuation of many conflicts is due essentially to non-observance of the principles set forth in the Charter, lack of respect for the standards of conduct enshrined in international morality and law# and the absence of a determination by the parties concerned to find just and equitable solutions to the problems.\nMy Government reiterates the need for the immediate and complete withdrawal of foreign troops now in Afghanistan and urges all States to respect that country's territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty. I express the firm hope that negotiations during the next round of talks will bring about a satisfactory resolution to end this long conflict# thus providing the Afghan people with an opportunity freely to exercise its right to self-determination in a genuine way - because that invasion of Afghanistan is a potential threat to peace. We applaud the mediation efforts of the Secretary-General and once again express support for United Nations resolutions urging a peaceful solution.\nThere are today countries facing serious crises owing to external causes and pressures# such as Kampuchea and Chad. We support# to the extent of our possibilities# every effort being made to establish freedom and democracy in those regions.\nThe Dominican Republic has maintained a traditional position of support for Argentina's legitimate claims over the Malvinas Islands; consistent with that traditional position we urge Argentina and the United Kingdom to make every effort to initiate the kind of talks called for in General Assembly resolution 40/21. Peace on the Korean peninsula is a matter of the greatest interest to the international community. However, the objective of unification of the communities of South and North Korea must not be brought about by force but by peaceful means  through dialogue and negotiation between the two parties, which should be resumed without pre-conditions or extraneous requirements.\nMy delegation considers that a concrete way to resume the dialogue would be through conversations between the Foreign Ministers of the two Koreas in conformity with the initiative formulated a few months ago by the Republic of South Korea.\nMay I now refer to Haiti, the nation with which we share our Island of Hispaniola, a country with which we are United by so many links that it would take a long time to enumerate them. The Haitian people and Government face an enormous task in achieving the aims they have set for themselves: freedom, democracy, work for all, and the creation of conditions that enable that people to enjoy its inalienable right to education and health. Only through exercise of their human rights will the inhabitants of Haiti be able to enjoy the fruits of this world, which its Creator has put here for us all. In this respect, the Haitian people needs the help of all of us, which does not imply foreign interference in its affairs. We support the statement made here along those lines by President Namphy\u00b7\nThe Dominican Republic, for its part, is increasing its bilateral contacts with that sister republic to create a modern system between the two countries involving free bilateral trade; the mutual combating of deforestation; and the exchange of journalists, teachers and students so that we may each learn about the realities, needs and pains of the other and so that, for a given length of time; professionals from one country may practise In the other without discrimination. \nThe Dominican Republic supports the efforts being exerted to bring an end to the fratricidal conflict in Central America. With hope we join in the agreement for peace recently signed by five Central American Presidents in Guatemala. That agreement should be encouraged in so far as it constitutes the basis upon which a commitment may be forged to establish democracy, ideological pluralism, freedom and respect in that long-suffering region of our hemisphere. We therefore unreservedly support the appeal made here recently by the President of Costa Rica, Mr. Oscar Arias Sanchez, for concord to prevail in Central America.\nThe Dominican Republic supports all efforts to bring an end to the long war between Iraq and Iran. In the light of the latest developments in the Persian Gulf, there arises an ominous question as to the world's future: are we moving towards world conflict and reaching the point of no return? We hope that the desire for peace that has been shown by the Great Powers may prevail in those two nations and in their religious feelings.\nA constant feature of my country's foreign policy is our deep concern about the Middle East. Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our population includes people of both Arabic and Jewish origin, all of whom are contributing, in an extraordinary fashion, to the development of our country, in a true model of human coexistence. Why should that not be the case in the countries from which those Jewish and Arabic immigrants have come?\nMy country feels that the only way to achieve peace in the Middle East is through dialogue between the parties to the conflict based on the provisions of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The Dominican Republic maintains its position of unwavering friendship towards the peoples of that region. We do not believe that friendship with one of the countries of the region should result in discrimination against others. Such friendship should not be criticized; no country should be criticized for being on friendly terms with either of the parties to the conflict, as sometimes happens when a country helps one of them.\nIn conclusion, I have not dealt with all of the important items on our agenda. I come from a small country, but one that has the good fortune to have a great President, Mr. Joaquin Balaguer, whose modern conception of history enables him to be an insightful observer of the world scene. Thus we feel solidarity with all the peoples represented here who bear the burden of many problems like ours. For that reason, my country will be represented wherever there are appeals for solidarity, respect, and efforts for peace. We wish to live in a world in which nations large and small may have equal opportunities for the benefit of their citizens, and the right to enjoy the resources we should all enjoy without discrimination.\nOur country has demonstrated that we have a stable democracy. In my country there are no political prisoners and no discrimination of any kind, religious or cultural. For this reason, our arms are open to all. Because of our history and our language, we are a country of the Caribbean and also a country of Latin America. That is why we wish to serve as a bridge between the two Americas so that peace may prevail in our continent.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nAt the beginning of this statement. Sir, I would have wished to say at length how pleased the Republic of Panama is at the choice of a person as deserving as you to preside over the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. I would have wished as well to express special appreciation to your predecessor for the admirable work which he accomplished, and to refer in addition to the tireless and constant dedication of the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, to the cause of peace and the strengthening of the Organization.\nSimilarly, following a tradition that dates back many years, I would have liked to begin this statement with a detailed list of the main world problems, followed by an explanation of the Panamanian position on them, but I find myself obliged to shorten those elements of my statement as much as possible, because on this occasion I speak on behalf of a people threatened and wounded, a nation humiliated and under attack.\nThe tenth anniversary of the signing of the Panama Canal Treaties by my country and the United States of America occurred on 7 September. That event in 1977 was unanimously welcomed by the international community, in particular the countries of the American continent, which saw in those documents agreement on a date by which colonialism on Panamanian soil would be ended and all vestiges of colonialism would be eradicated from American lands.\nUnfortunately, the tenth anniversary of those Treaties was not a celebration for us Panamanians, who marked that date by expressing our indignation at the profound disillusionment of seeing that the will and resolve of that time had been distorted and the agreement replaced by a plan of aggression already set under way, carefully conceived, meticulously organized and obstinately pursued, to turn our dream of independence and sovereignty into a grotesque and pitiful farce. Last year the President of the Republic of Panama denounced in this Hall the fact that the most reactionary sectors of the United States of America, with the servile support of the extreme right of the Panamanian opposition, had mounted a campaign to discredit leading figures in the Panamanian Government in order to undermine our efforts in the Contadora Group to bring peace to Central America and silence our demand that the violations of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties be corrected.\nDuring the past year, we have seen that campaign strengthened with all sorts of unfounded accusations, especially against those authorities that have been struggling most resolutely for peace in Central America and opposing with determination United States attempts to restore and preserve a colonial pattern in the areas bordering the Canal and reduce the Panamanian Government to the status of a submissive colony.\nWith Panama unable to obtain or exercise the right of reply in the face of the entire network of communications media that had been manipulated, the slander increased in seriousness, quantity, frequency and potential harm, because the moral aggression that forms the first part of the plan of domination was necessary to prepare United States public opinion so that it would condone any act against Panama, any injustice, any attack and any violation of the Charter of the United Nations and that of the Organization of American States (OAU). Since attainment of that goal requires a profound knowledge of the democratic sensibilities of the people of the United States, and a great familiarity with the most effective means of deceit to turn slander into widely accepted truth, there was a systematic replacement of the staff of the United States diplomatic mission in Panama and an increase in administrative and technical staff. An attempt was made to build satellite broadcasting installations, in violation of the Vienna Convention of 1961. \nA team was organized to host and guide official staff; politicians and correspondents so as to manipulate whatever opinions they might form on Panama. A whole parade of alleged violations of human rights and alleged weaknesses in democratic institutions was staged. Indeed, the entire United States diplomatic mission seemed to have been turned into a factory for slander and lies, with its own distribution and dissemination machinery. The complaints that we have lodged about this at the highest levels of the United States Administration have remained unanswered.\nThe other Governments of the world, which have access to sources of information that no one manipulates or falsifies, are governed by their own principles and act in accordance with their own interests, know that these are not the facts, and they must have already begun to wonder why the United States of America is acting in this way with regard to Panama. Later, they will begin to see the answers to this question, because I must now go on to the second part of the plans economic aggression.\nIn the past 10 years we have had increasing success in the plan of the revolutionary Government of Panama to create a great financial centre, taking advantage of the very special advantages that my country can offer, and this has become a new source of wealth and work for the people of Panama. As the number of foreign banks with branches in Panama increased, and as funds deposited in those branches grew to billions of dollars, the pressure put on Panama by the United States Government to reform its bank legislation also increased. They demanded changes that might make the banks consider it more appropriate and lucrative to transfer their operations to another country, which would thus put an end to the flourishing of these activities, which represent 9,000 permanent jobs. \nWhen it was seen that the campaign of slander against Panama was not affecting the financial centre and that Panama was only agreeing to those specific changes that could facilitate joint efforts against the illicit drug traffic, the financial centre became one of the targets of the plan of aggression. All the seditious actions of the past three and a half months have had as their principal arena the heart of the banking area of Panama City, and news articles with photographs of people setting fire to automobiles or bags of garbage, with the name of a foreign bank in the background, had the effect that the slander of the mass media had not achieved.\nJust three months ago, Panama denounced before the Organization of American States and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries a resolution adopted by the United States Senate which violates internationally recognized principles accepted as fundamental to the peaceful coexistence of nations. In its brazen arrogance, the resolution even cited legal norms and formulas that should be applied to remove from their posts those Panamanian officials whom the plan of aggression had singled out as pawns to be cleared off the infamous chess-board that had been set up. \nLast week, while Heads of State or Government and representatives of various nations were expressing their support for the cause of peace in Central America in this Organization and reiterating their support for the principles of the United Nations Charter, the United States Senate, with total disdain for international legal norms, adopted a resolution imposing conditions on economic assistance, military aid and arms exports to Panama, as well as on imports of Panamanian sugar to the United States of America, unless, within 45 days, a transition Government were established in Panama in compliance with the will of United States senators.\nBy one of those ironies in which history abounds, the oppressor often commits a blunder that favours the oppressed, and the last days of that time period coincide with the national holiday of Panama. The deadline is on the eve of the date when Panamanians commemorate Panama's Proclamation of Independence from the Spanish Empire. On that day we shall be reaffirming that Proclamation of Independence with the firmest possible resolve.\nAs if the violation of the principles of self-determination of peoples and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States were not enough, the recent Senate resolution violates specific norms adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. I should like briefly to cite a few of them.\nArticle 32 of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States establishes \\\"No State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights.\\\" (resolution 3281 (XXIX) General Assembly resolution 36/103 on the inadmissibility of intervention in the Internal affairs of States clearly affirms. \\\"The duty of a State, in the conduct of its international relations in the economic, social, technical and trade fields, to refrain from measures which would constitute interference or intervention in the internal or external affairs of another State, thus preventing it from determining freely its political, economic and social development; this includes, inter alia, the duty of a State not to use its external economic assistance programme or adopt any multilateral or unilateral economic reprisal or blockade ... as instruments of political pressure or coercion against another State, in violation of the Charter of the United Nations.\\\" (resolution 36/103, Sec. II para. 00)\nIn resolution 41/165, adopted just last year, the General Assembly \\\"Reaffirms that developed countries should refrain from threatening or applying trade restrictions, blockades, embargoes and other economic sanctions, incompatible with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and in violation of undertakings contracted, multilaterally and bilaterally, against developing countries as a form of political and economic coercion that affects their economic, political and social development.\\\" (resolution 41/165, para  3)\nI should like to affirm before this Assembly that however overwhelming and formidable the might of a nation may be, it shall never have the power to alter the significance of these norms, nor to evade the moral condemnation of other nations for having violated them.\nThat brings me to the third phase of the aggression that has already begun to emerge and that I now denounce, on behalf of the Government of Panama, before all the other Governments of the States Members of this Organization. \nAt about noon on Wednesday, 23 September, this very month, while the Ambassador of the United States of America was hosting a luncheon at his official residence with his councillor and with many figures of the opposition recognized as the main local leaders of that attempt to overthrow the Panamanian Government which I have been denouncing, over 100 soldiers of the United States armed forces stationed in the defence zones in the area bordering the Canal, whose sole purpose is the defence of the inter-oceanic waterway, arrived in two buses at the United States Embassy building and parked there, in violation of the procedures established in the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and its related agreements on the displacement and transport of those foreign troops.\nAt the same time, a Black Hawk UH 60 helicopter, bearing registration plates M-23985, from the Howard military air base near the Canal landed some 10 kilometres from the northern air strip of the Rio Hato airport, where there are military installations belonging to the Panamanian defence forces, without using established air corridors and in violation of Panamanian air space. Its pilot refused to respond to demands from the control tower that he identify himself and indicate the purpose of the flight, and the aircraft took off when a Panamanian land patrol approached it.\nI must explain that if I am mentioning these details even though it is unusual to do so in United Nations statements on such occasions, it is because one of the main strengths of the Republic of Panama is the support for the cause of national liberation of my people that the repudiation of similar acts of aggression arouses in other nations.\nThe Panama Canal Treaties, which tomorrow will formally have been in force for eight years, very intentionally took into consideration the fact that the patriotic sensibilities of the Panamanian people had been deeply wounded for many years by the United States military presence in the colonial enclave they maintained there for 75 years - years of humiliation and outrage by foreign soldiers who often behaved like victorious occupation troops.\nFor that reason, the Treaties included provisions that even prohibit the wearing of foreign military uniforms outside specifically established areas of defence, except in the case of official occasions. I must, with great indignation and sadness, emphasize here that a luncheon given by the head of a diplomatic mission and his deputy for the leaders of a movement aimed at overthrowing the Government of the country where they are accredited is not an official occasion. What occurred constitutes, it must be said, a premeditated and calculated provocation with the intention of creating a situation conducive to some act of violence that would justify to United States public opinion the aggression that forms the third stage of the plan.\nAs was to be expected, there has already been a nationwide reaction which can be seen in many declarations by trade union and student organizations, reviving language that had not been heard in my country since the days that followed the act of aggression committed by United States troops against the Panamanian civilian population that caused 21 deaths and left over 500 people wounded.\nWhy such outrage? Why is a country as large and powerful as the United States pitting itself against a nation which has tendered it great services and against a people which has always shown it friendship?\nOne day soon, Government leaders will understand that it is not possible for this atrocious game of inventing slander and fabricating lies to continue without endangering their own democratic institutions. That is why we must now explain why a sinister coalition of forces is acting against the independence and sovereignty of Panama, as well as against the Government which, in an unequal contest, is now defending the country's status as an independent and sovereign State. For almost five years now the Governments of Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and Panama have been acting together to promote agreement on a peaceful negotiated solution in Central America. Time and again, with similar recourse or by other means, as the case may be, foreign interference has succeeded in thwarting the initiative that emerged in 1983 and that first gathered together the countries of the Contadora Group and then the countries of the Support Group, with the approval of all nations in general and, in particular, with the sincere and resolute support of the nations comprising the European Economic Community and the Non-Aligned Movement. We have had to pay a high price for our perseverance and insistence on achieving a Latin American solution to this Latin American problem. As we overcame the obstacles one by one, obstacles created or fostered to a large extent by sectors of the United States Government, and as prospects of peace began to emerge more clearly, pressures mounted on the Panamanian Government to leave the Contadora Group and to withdraw its support for the cause of peace in the region.\nWhen the position of the four countries of the Contadora Group was aligned with the position of Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay, a military member of the United States National Security Council personally demanded of General Manuel Antonio Noriega that Panama withdraw from the Contadora Group. When he was told that the demand was an affront to the dignity of our people and nation a plan was hatched to subjugate Panama. Three months later there began a wide-ranging replacement of United States diplomatic staff, followed by an increase in the number of administrative and technical staff and increases in the number of troops stationed along the Canal, in disregard of the ban on such increases contained in the treaties in force between the two countries.\nThe reactionary forces in the United States Government that conspired to destroy Panama's independence found it crucial to replace the Panamanian Government with a compliant Government that would blindly follow its orders.\nAt the forty-first session, in Panama's statement, the President of Panama Eric Arturo Delvalle, denounced a plot to evade implementation of the Canal Treaties, under which the Canal is to be turned over to full Panamanian control within 12 years and the United States military presence in our territory is to end at the same time.\nThat statement and the further denunciations of many violations committed by the United States lent a new dimension to the plan of aggression already set in motion with the manipulation of some United States communications media and some local and foreign news agencies to bring about acceptance of the slanders invented for use as the main weapon in the dirty war declared against those who defend my country's independence and sovereignty.\nThe United Nations was a beautiful and promising result of the sacrifices made by mankind in the struggle against fascist barbarism. Its most powerful members paid with countless human lives and incalculable destruction to learn the tragic lesson I am now recalling. Half a century is not long enough for people to forget.\nIn its structure, in its methods, in the way its combined forces operate, in its organization, and in its tactics, the movement threatening my country bears a terrifying resemblance to the fascist movements that laid waste and subjugated Europe.\nDespite those resemblances, the United States Senate has chosen in support of that movement to play the sinister card of interventionist action and economic aggression, thus presenting a grave danger to all the nations of the Americas and a tangible threat to world peace. If the United States Government used all its might to impose on Panama a minority Government which submitted to its desire for domination, no nation in the world would be able to feel that its independence and sovereignty were secure or that a similar attempt could not materialize at its own borders.\nIf the Panamanian people had not rejected the seditious outbreak that, with the support, aid and instigation of certain sectors of the United States Government, tried to overthrow the Panamanian Government and replace it with a provisional Government obedient to the orders of the United States Embassy in Panama, I should not be here now making this denunciation. \n\nSince the beginning of the decade, a few years after the new Canal Treaties came into effect, Panama has been sounded out unofficially, and has received various other representations, about the possibility of an agreement extending authorization of military installations on Panamanian territory beyond the year 2000.\nProminent members and representatives of the United States military establishment have said, with an insistence that is significant, that the problem of the military presence, which will end in 12 years with the coming into effect of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, requires that the United States Government make decisions and take actions that must be begun at the latest in 1989 - that is, within 15 months.\nUnder the agreement reached in 1977, the United States armed forces are to be gradually reduced in number, and at the same time the role of protecting the Canal is to be transferred in an orderly, gradual way to the defence forces of Panama. Despite that, in the past five years United States forces have grown significantly, instead of decreasing, and increased participation by the Panamanians in those functions has been systematically forgotten and delayed.\nFor some years now, with growing frequency and at the highest level, as time goes by, civilian and military officials of the United States have been saying that the approach of the date set for the final implementation of the Canal Treaties and the end of the United States military presence in Panama is a problem demanding immediate attention.\nThe Panamanian Government has had only one answer to the soundings and veiled proposals that have reached it} that answer has always been that Panama demands that the Treaties be complied with to the letter. This sheds a revealing light on the fact that the minority political forces comprising the movement opposing the Panamanian Government have always been in favour of the United States keeping military bases in Panama beyond the year 2000.\nShortly before the organized attack against the constitutional Government of Panama there were discussions in the United States Congress and reports on the financial cost of leaving the existing installations in Panama and the repercussions of doing so on United States strategic interests. Recent State Department documents have gone to unbelievable extremes of brazenness in recommending measures for the structuring of a new Government in Panama to defend those strategic interests. Outstanding among the excesses in this plot against my country, and a grim threat, is the fact that the United States Senate is trying to impose in Panama a provisional Government that, according to repeated public statements by the main leaders of this treason, would have as its President the very man who was overthrown in 1941 for his attempts to make Panama an ally of Hitler's Germany. That makes clear another motive of the plan against Panama, and once again demonstrates how dangerous it is for the other nations of the American continent and the ideals of this Organization.\nAware of the terrible price now being paid for the independence of its foreign policy, Panama reiterates its unswerving commitment to the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement, and it hopes to see in the near future the establishment of a new international economic order. At one with those who promote the new trend of the unity of the Latin American countries, Panama believes that the strengthening of that unity requires, as an immediate task, the achievement of peace in Central America and the fraternal comprehension and generosity that will give Bolivia access to the sea. Such demonstrations of maturity and solidarity will make the Latin American peoples better able to fight for the cause of Argentine sovereignty over the Malvinas, South Sandwich and South Georgia's Islands, for the full attainment of self-determination by Puerto Rico, for a political solution to the foreign-debt problem and for the eradication of the drug traffic as a service rendered to other nations where this scourge increases the moral breakdown of major sectors of the population. It will therefore also be better able to form an invincible front against slander organized as a tool of war against the independence of our nations.\nAs a country where all forms of racial discrimination disappeared over half a century before slavery was abolished in the United States, Panama condemns the odious divisions of society in South Africa and once again expresses its firm solidarity with the people of Namibia. We reiterate our support for the aspirations of Spain in connection with Gibraltar and urge that peace be achieved between Iran and Iraq and that peace be brought to Lebanon. We reaffirm also out support for any action that can lead to peace between Arabs and Israelis, on the basis of the right of the State of Israel to exist within secure boundaries, as is established in a United Nations resolution. Panama once again affirms its people's solidarity with the Sahraoui people. It shares the aspirations of Cyprus, Afghanistan and Kampuchea to be free of any foreign military presence, and expresses its hope of soon seeing the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea represented in the General Assembly as Members of the Organization. The proposals for a ministerial meeting to deal with the unification of the Korean peninsula should be agreed to without delay.\nDespite the moral aggression that it is suffering and the danger of military aggression that it is confronting, Panama will continue to fight for a Latin American solution to the crisis of Central America and will continue to demand the implementation of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty, with the Canal under full Panamian control as of 31 December 1999, under the agreed terms and with the United States military presence ended on that date.\nThe Republic of Panama has full grounds for invoking the principles of this Organization and for making use of all the legitimate means that the norms of international law place at its disposal) and it is beginning to do so by openly stating that those principles and those norms have been violated by the United States, first through prolonged, severe moral aggression against the Panamanian Government and then through calculated, base economic aggression.\nI affirm also that those principles and those norms are in danger of being converted into a dead letter by the use of force against the independence of my country. Because of the magnitude of that danger, we Panamanians must continue to fight for national liberation, regardless of the harsh times that lie ahead and the extraordinary sacrifices required to defend the Panamanian nation against the aggressors. We shall never be subjugated.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffYear after year we come to the Assembly concerned about the direction of international events, which, with disheartening persistence, weaken our hopes of laying the foundations of lasting peace in this century.\nIt is not only a matter of our going through a period of crisis. In fact, the world, particularly in modern times, has been in permanent crisis. What makes today special in historical terms is the speed with which changes occur, their scope and mankind's manifest inability to manage them. It would seem that during these last few years, more than at any other time in history, ideas have been lagging behind events. That should not surprise us. The world has evolved so rapidly that we have had to give up our notion of life as order to think of it in terms of movement. May it not be that during recent years man's creative energy has developed mainly in the scientific and technological fields, leaving behind roan as a forger of ideas and institutions needed to bring order and leadership to the technological world that he has created? Today, more than ever, ideas are needed; ideas for regaining our mastery over a dynamic world that is going out of control and threatening to make us its prisoners.\nFaced with the gulf between facts and ideas, with the persistence of factors that work against peace and security, and with the international community's inability to put an end to them, or at least to mitigate their effects, we believe the time has come to pause, so that we may all proceed on the one hand to examine the extent to which the international system set up after the Second World War adequately responds to the problems of the world of today, and, on the other, seriously to analyse our own individual attitudes, which, based solely on the satisfaction of special interests, threaten the most elementary forms of the international co-operation which we have so laboriously and hopefully built up over four post-war decades.\nUruguay has already stated in other forums that the poor performance of the international system, both in political and economic terms, is due largely to a turning away from the fundamental principles on which the post-war international order was built - international solidarity and multilateralism. By pointing here to the crisis involving these principles, we are not simply referring nostalgically to ethical and political values of the past. We are pointing out the validity of two pillars of international relations, which we cannot put aside in the interest of pragmatism or so-called realism. If we wish to build a more equitable world, we must keep in step with the realities, but not at the price of undermining the climate of understanding and dialogue which we have created during these last 40 years.\nThat is why it is necessary to view international problems in a global context- A world of peace and justice can be based only on the conviction that there are no national interests that are not of concern to the international community that what a country does or fails to do will have, in varying degree, repercussions on the international environment; that, if I may paraphrase, nothing that involves any State can be unimportant to the international community.\nPrecisely because interdependence is today a fact which no country can avoid, we ask of the multilateral system an open and co-operative attitude so that the approach to and discussion of problems shall not be limited to partial, short-sighted views.\nLast year, on an occasion similar to this, when Uruguay reiterated its support for the United Nations, we stated our belief in the need for an in-depth, unprejudiced and comprehensive analysis of the instruments available to the international community to achieve its common objectives in order to determine their adequacy in present circumstances and the measures needed to correct their failings and limitations. We still believe that such an analysis is necessary and that we must not delay it, going beyond the recent studies and proposals on restructuring.\nThis exercise must be carried out within the ethical and legal framework of the principles of the San Francisco Charter, and the United Nations must continue to be the main channel for international co-operation and solving political disputes. Our confidence in the Organization as an instrument of peace was recently strengthened when it was resorted to in an attempt to put an end to the tragic conflict between Iran and Iraq, which has gone on for years.\nUruguay is grateful for the spirit of compromise and the will to co-operate shown by the permanent members of the Security Council on this occasion, as well as for the Secretary-General's bold efforts. We trust that the Organization's intervention and the aggressive diplomatic action by the Secretary-General will be instrumental in restoring peace to that troubled region.\nDespite what I have said so far, there are encouraging signs that we must not ignore, signs that make us think that the world is today better prepared than ever to adopt this comprehensive and long-term view, which the solution of our common problems demands. That is what happens when we observe the democratisation process of the last 15 years, which, despite accidental set-backs and collapses, has continued to move forward and has become consolidated in all the regions of the world.\nMoves towards democratisation, begun in the 1970s when there were important political changes in countries of southern Europe, later spread to all regions of the world and were substantially furthered by the recent democratic recovery of almost all the countries of Latin America. This process is, in the judgement of the Government of Uruguay, a decisive factor in the pursuit of peace and security. Democracy, understood as the political system which is based on free and periodic election of its authorities, is the system which by its very essence ensures respect for human rights, the political independence of States and the ethical and legal principles which must govern international relations. There is a close undeniable relationship between peace and the effective exercise of democracy. History teaches us that the most serious disputes and wars of the past were almost always caused by authoritarian, expansionist and colonialist regimes. This is illustrated at the present time by the persistence of the Government of South Africa in continuing its intolerable policy of apartheid and the illegal occupation of the Territory of Namibia, which is a clear threat to peace and an infringement of human rights, against which the formal repudiation of the international community seems not to be a sufficient reply.\nOn the other hand, the democracies are experiencing a natural rapprochement leading to solidarity and co-operation. What is happening at present in the Latin American regional environment is an example of how democratic Governments can coexist in peace and work for peace. For some time now, these Governments have decided to co-ordinate their efforts to find a solution to the great problems that afflict the hemisphere, initiating a process of active, direct and responsible diplomacy hitherto unprecedented in Latin America. In this search they have established informal procedures for consultation, co-ordination and negotiation in diverse areas including, inter alia, the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts, economic integration and policy co-ordination in areas such as external debt and financial and trade questions.\nThe forthcoming meeting of eight presidents of the region will be a significant step towards Latin American solidarity and towards the political presence of the region in the world. The Contadora Group and the Support Group, of which Uruguay is a member, continue to be, despite the enormous difficulties they have had to face, a vigorous expression of solidarity in the hemisphere. The Contadora Group has had a decisive Influence on the search for a formula for a satisfactory political solution to the already long and painful drama of Central America. The end of this drama is up to the protagonists themselves, but it is undeniable that Contadora and Its Support Group have played an essential role in bringing the parties together and in dissuading them from finding any but a political or diplomatic solution to the problem.\nWe hope that we are witnessing the last act of this drama and that its outcome will be a solution based on the principles of non-intervention, the free choice of peoples and genuine democratisation and pluralism. On this occasion I wish to pay a tribute to President Arias of Costa Rica, whose efforts towards the restoration of peace in Central America deserve the gratitude of all of Latin America. The recent Esquipulas II agreements, which have been mentioned today, are a bold, responsible and dispassionate step taken by the Central American countries themselves. They deserve our full support and call for solidarity and non-Interference on the part of all countries, especially those which have direct or indirect interests in the region. Let us, then, with our political solidarity and our co-operation, help the Central American peoples themselves to achieve a just and lasting peace in the region. \nThe Latin American democracies are thus United in their search for peace in the region and the welfare of their peoples, but enormous efforts are necessary if democracy is to be maintained in the developing countries. By its very nature it is a vulnerable system and its vulnerability increases in an economic and political environment which is not propitious for it, especially the international environment which conditions and influences our destinies to such a degree. On the one hand, the democracies are threatened by a set of economic factors which seriously endanger their survival. This fact was stated by the President of our country. President Sanguinetti, in this Assembly in 1985 in these words:\n\\\"A genuine democracy ... can be preserved only within an economic context that allows its citizens to provide for their basic material and spiritual needs. ... when this condition is not fulfilled and poverty and unemployment prevail, violence emerges and is unleashed, the powers of disorder take advantage of the fertile soil, the fabric of society disintegrates and, in the international sphere, political loyalties become erratic.\\\" (A/40/PV.6, p. 12) Just as development without democracy inevitably leads to authoritarianism and totalitarianism, sacrificing freedom and human rights, democracy without economic development ends up being an empty form, which inexorably leads to political and social instability.\nMuch time has passed since the idea that political and social peace were not possible in an economically divided world became part of the basic tenets of international reality; none the less economic contrasts and contradictions have only increased and deepened. It is not germane at present to attribute responsibilities or identify those at fault; fortunately, awareness of our interdependence has developed sufficiently to make us understand that, just as we have all been Involved in the genesis of the present situation, we must all suffer  its consequences if no satisfactory solution is found. It is paradoxical that despite the fact that we are fully aware of our responsibilities we have not taken the necessary action to reverse the trends that are leading us to a dead end. Current economic indicators regarding trade, production, consumption, investment and financing do not allow for optimistic forecasts) the pace of world economic activity has lessened and in most of the developing countries the recessive trends that have characterized the development of their economies in the last few years still prevail.\nWhen trying to face these problems the developing countries are at a great disadvantage and we stressed this in the recent meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Several factors have contributed to the worsening of their situation: in the first place, the renewal of protectionist pressures by industrialized countries. Those countries have kept up costly programmes of domestic support to certain productive sectors, thus limiting international competition. Perhaps more serious yet has been the use of export incentives and subsidies, which are incompatible with the standards governing international trade and which affect how world markets work by artificially distorting supply, which, in turn, has served to depress even more the price levels of products of special concern to the developing countries.\nOn the other hand, prices of the main export commodities of developing countries have steadily declined, with some recent exceptions, but these exceptions seem to be linked rather to crises in exchange parities than to a true recovery in price levels.\nTo this we must add the external debt problem. Although there has been progress in acknowledging joint responsibility in the origins and solution of the debt problem, as well as in acknowledging that the subject must be faced within a positive context of growth and adjustment policies, the international economic situation has made the tremendous adjustments carried out by the debtor countries insufficient. For the vast majority of our countries it is impossible simultaneously to grow, Invest and service their external debt. The massive transfer of financial resources abroad has continued, reaching unbearable dimensions for our economies.\nAs was stated by our Presidents in the letter addressed recently by the Cartagena Consensus to the Venice Summit, \\\"We consider it essential to insist that the external debt problem binds us all  due not only to its causes but also to its consequences.\\\" In the face of this dramatic situation, all that has been said and done so far is obviously not enough. It is not enough to acknowledge responsibilities and show understanding; nor are the partial measures which the most developed countries have adopted either individually or collectively enough. Efforts to understand the economic problems which afflict the developing countries today and the search for solutions must be but the starting-point from which the members of the international community should initiate effective co-operative action and support the transformation of developing countries.\nIt is from this starting-point that, within the framework of serious and responsible international co-operation, we must undertake the necessary structural adjustments in both the developed and the developing countries, whatever may be their political and economic organization and whatever the relationships that link the members of each group together and to other groups.\nIndeed, the world cannot be based on principles of justice and equal opportunities in the economic field without adjustments in all economies, not just those of the developing countries.\nWhat is particularly needed is a decisive change of attitude on the part of the most developed countries, especially regarding trade. They must allow the developing countries to cease to be the depositories where the developed countries dump their subsidized excess production and the suppliers of raw materials paid for at unfairly low prices to finance the welfare of other peoples. The developing countries wish to have access to the markets of the developed countries and to obtain fair prices for their products so that they may be able to repay their debts and devote new credits to investment rather than to financing high interest rates.\nIn making these statements our attitude is responsible and constructive: first, because the great adjustment required during the past few years, the worst since the great depression, was at the expense of the standards of living of the developing countries alone; and, secondly, because we have long abandoned the simplistic attitudes that cast the blame for all that happened in the developing countries on external forces or relationships.\nWe, too, the third-world countries, must make a great adjustment effort which will allow us to play the role we should play in the world economy. In this context, we continue to believe that, in addition to the adoption of serious and responsible policies outside our own economies, all possibilities of South-South co-operation should be explored and used. We are convinced that there is still much to be done along these lines and that we, the developing countries, must establish the direction of this co-operation and the ways in which it must take place. In this context, we welcome and have great hopes of the recently established South-South Commission under the chairmanship of the illustrious African Statesman, President Nyerere.\nNot everything is dark in this field either. It would be unfair not to mention some of the facts which allow us to nurture modest hopes regarding future developments in economic matters.\nFirst, I must mention the new round of negotiations started in Uruguay last year within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Fulfilling the resolutions of the Punta del Este meeting, several working groups have been established and plans for negotiations have been approved. The parties are acting with a fitting sense of urgency and responsibility, and this justifies out optimism regarding the results to be obtained. The Uruguay round continues to deserve the full support of all its participants. Furthermore, it was comforting to note that at the recent Venice summit conference the Heads of State of the seven Western industrialized countries supported the objectives of trade liberalization and the strengthening of the multilateral trade system through the Uruguay round, and undertook to submit concrete negotiation proposals in the near future. \n\nTo this we must add the results of the last United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which the Government of Uruguay considers to be very satisfactory. It is fitting to stress the fact that for the first time a text incorporating within a multilateral framework a series of important conceptual advances regarding external debt, basic commodities and international trade was accepted by consensus. UNCTAD was undoubtedly strengthened by this session, in which its role as a significant forum for the international debate on the development question was reaffirmed.\nThe need to adopt more imaginative viewpoints and concepts of renewal is urgent and essential when dealing seriously with the economic problems which afflict us, and the same need exists in the political sphere.\nHere, too, the scene is one of light and shade. This year we began our tasks in this area encouraged by several events which we interpret as clear signs that we are on the path towards the solution of some serious problems. We have already mentioned the efforts made by our Central American brothers to put an end to the tragedy that afflicts them, as well as the Organization's efforts in the Iran-Iraq dispute.\nThe recent constructive dialogue between the leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic was a contribution to peace and the relaxation of tension in the world. Some disputes continue against all logic, however. One such is that which has afflicted the Middle East for years and already taken an enormous toll in lives and resources, without changing the obstinate stance of the Governments involved, which are determined not to acknowledge the rights of other States and peoples. We restate our conviction that a lasting peace in the region must be based on acknowledgement of the right of Israel to continue to exist as a State, with stable and secure borders, and the right of the Palestinian people freely to decide their destiny according to the resolutions of the world Organization.\nMany situations which affect peace and security have been created through the influence of external factors which distort the will of peoples. Anything that tends to twist, misrepresent or suppress that will is a violation of the political independence of States, the free choice of peoples and democracy, and should therefore be condemned. That is why our country reiterates its deep concern at the continuance of situations such as those in Afghanistan, Kampuchea and Cyprus and of the intolerable forms of oppression practised in South Africa and Namibia. Similarly, the continuance of artificial political divisions, as in the case of the Korean people, does not contribute to peace.\nThese and other international situations feed the feeling of insecurity and serve as an excuse for large and small countries alike to persist in the absurd arms race, weakening the economies of many of them, to the benefit of the producer and middleman elite.\nIn no other sector is the chasm between technological creativity and political and institutional creativity so deep as in that of war industries. The degree of diversity, sophistication and power achieved by the weapons defies the imagination, while the production of and trade in these weapons continues to increase. Meanwhile, during the past few years disarmament and arms-control initiatives have made no significant progress. Having saturated the planet with enough arms to devastate it several times over, the aim is now to place those weapons in outer space, adding terror to terror and making more acute the collective feeling of impotence.\nRecently, the great Powers have multiplied their efforts to achieve at least partial results in the negotiations on disarmament and arms control. Last weekend we read with relief and joy that the Governments of the United States and the Soviet Union were on the verge of reaching an agreement on the control of shorthand medium-range missiles. What was said this morning by the President of the United States is certainly encouraging and casts a ray of light in this long tunnel of frustration and failure. The super-Powers, on whose will the continuance of the world as a habitable place depends, must know that the attention and hopes of the entire international community are set on these initiatives and negotiations, and that they are morally and legally bound to intensify the efforts already begun before it is too late. They bear the major responsibility for rescuing the world from the obsession with arms, which has, unfortunately, contaminated the developing countries as well. It is especially in this area that the creativity and good faith of States can play their part.\nWe are not completely satisfied with the results of the Conference on disarmament and development. None the less, it cannot be denied that recognition by almost all the international community of the link between the two is, with the other conclusions, a promising starting-point for future action. \nA third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament could be an opportunity to revitalize old ideas, propose new ones and adopt procedures to implement them. But such a special session must be called only when we are sure that positive and substantial results will be achieved. We must not let such an opportunity become a mere rhetorical exercise.\nSo long as initiatives regarding general and complete disarmament are not crystallizing, proposals to relieve specific geographic areas from the dangers arising from the use of force have a fundamental role to play in the maintenance of peace and security. Last year, Uruguay supported Brazil's initiative, which resulted in a General Assembly resolution declaring the South Atlantic a zone of peace and co-operation. There is no need to stress how important the South Atlantic region is to Uruguay, not only from a political and strategic point of view but also from an economic and environmental point of view. In Uruguay's judgement, that resolution is only a first step on the basis of which we must draw up a legal statute for the South Atlantic which, taking account in particular of the concerns of the coastal countries, would not only ensure the avoidance of non-peaceful activities in the region or of having it used as a pretext for confrontation and rivalry, but also become an encouraging basis for the development of new manifestations of solidarity and co-operation.\nBut the effective establishment of a zone of peace in the South Atlantic will not be possible while the problem of the Malvinas Islands remains unresolved. Once more, as on previous occasions, Uruguay urges the parties to this dispute to intensify their efforts to resume negotiations to put an end to a situation whose persistence affects the whole of Latin America, and whose final solution must restore the islands to Argentina, which holds legitimate sovereignty over them. \nLast year, in the same Latin American spirit, we received in our country the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Chile and Bolivia, determined to seek a fair and final solution to the question of Bolivia's outlet to the sea. We sincerely deplore the suspension of those discussions and, in a fraternal spirit, we urge our Chilean and Bolivian brothers to persist in their dialogue, for which purpose we shall always welcome them in our country. We are convinced that dialogue is the only way to put an end to a dispute which, in the interest of all, ought to be resolved.\nIt is our lot to live in a complex and challenging, but none the less fascinating, world.  While dangers and threats thus far unknown to mankind appear ahead of us as a result of intolerance of all kinds and the arms race, the future also offers mankind the hitherto unimagined benefits of modern technological civilization.\nThe task with which this Organization was charged by its Charter, 42 years ago, was to manage this world according to principles of equity and justice. To realize that lofty purpose we must all decide with sincere political will to face up to the great points of ambivalence of our world, which are the most disappointing features of our time: At a time when our civilization makes it possible for a minority to attain an unprecedented standard of living, hunger and poverty persist and are increasing for the vast majority.\nAt a time when we are approaching a half century of efforts to achieve international dialogue, we are incapable of overcoming in a spirit of mutual tolerance the violence of fundamentalism in all its forms - racial, religious and national - and of insane and bloody terrorism. At a time when we are adopting charters, treaties and declarations on respect for human rights, flagrant violations of those very rights persist in every corner of the planet, reflecting shamefully on the most precious ethical and political principles of our civilization.\nAt a time when we recognize economic interdependence to be as inescapable as\nIt is mutually beneficial, we are Incapable of facing together the great imbalance and injustices of international economic relations, and undertaking the adjustment which have so far been focused mainly on the developing countries.\nAt a time when we are advancing along the path of technological progress as brilliant as it is unbridled, we are attacking the environment, thus compromising future life on the planet, as reported so accurately by the World Commission on Environment and Development in its study entitled \\\"Our Common Future\\\", which is to be considered at this very Assembly session.\nAt a time when enormous resources are required for the great structural transformation of the developing countries, we continue to spend on weapons in a single year the total value of all third-world external debt.\nThose are only some of the great points of ambivalence which trouble and challenge mankind. To face them, a commitment to the values of a democratic, pluralist, tolerant society is necessary on the domestic scene, and a commitment to a society based on the principles of dialogue, fairness and co-operation is required on the international scene.\nThose are the principles by which my Government stands, along with all of Uruguayan society. In 1985 Uruguay recovered its traditional democratic life and made fully effective the operation of its republican institutions, along with all human, civil and political rights, thus achieving national reconciliation and initiating the dynamic activity necessary to bring about the economic and social progress of our .people. As a part of Latin America, Uruguay feels deep solidarity with all countries of the region. We reiterate our integrationist vocation, particularly via-a-vis our neighbours, with which we shall continue to build bridges of political and economic co-operation which, along with strengthening our national identity  further the purposes of democratic consolidation and progress in the entire sub-region.\nOn the international scene, Uruguay, which has always been true to its traditions of respect for and commitment to international law, will continue to do everything in its power to strengthen international dialogue and foster the fulfilment of the principles of the Charter of which it is a signatory. That is the message of my Government and of all of Uruguayan society.\nThat is our position as we come to this Assembly session. We are certain, Mr. President, that as they were under your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, the results of this session, under your wise and inspired guidance, will make a significant contribution to international harmony.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI come before this General Assembly for the third time to complete a story which I began to tell just one year ago.\nI come before you today because in my country, as in many countries around the world, the promise of freedom is held sacred.\nI come before you today because just two days ago the people of Suriname made their voices heard/ they express \u0430 desire for \u0430 new life and a new beginning. I come before you today to tell you that the people of Suriname have just written their own Constitution, I come before you today because the seeds of revolutionary change planted in 1980 are bearing fruit and nourishing the lives of the people of Suriname\u00b7 The people of Suriname are on the eve of choosing their representatives through free and fair elections, on the basis of their Constitution.\nOur history since 1980 has been one of turbulence  of endeavouring to chart a course consistent with the wants and needs of our people\u00b7 We are a country with a past similar to that of many of you. Suriname was a colony/ ruled by a distant Government which viewed our people and our natural wealth as their rightful property. The very diverse cultures which comprise our society were exploited, and the tensions between them deliberately and maliciously cultivated to prevent the development of a unified nation. This delayed our independence and, when self-determination was realized, remnants of our past continued to hinder our growth.\nIn 1980 steps were taken finally to erase the stains of our colonial subservience. We could no longer sit idle while the fabric of Surinamese society was disintegrating and decaying. So some of us acted, not without provocation, and certainly not for purposes of personal grandeur. Our cause was the sanctity of Suriname, our goal was the betterment and prosperity of its people. At that time, in 1980, the military pledged to return control to a civilian government. We stated then that such a transition would take place when the social, economic, political and educational sectors of society had been reformed to accommodate a new Suriname, one which was capable of addressing the needs of all its citizens, rich and poor, Creole, Amerindian, European, Asian and African.\nAs I have stated before in this Assembly, the process of nation-building in a country with a colonial past and a multi-ethnic population is a sensitive and difficult task. However, today I will offer no excuses, nor will I speak of obstacles still impeding our progress. For today it is my honour to reaffirm our pledge of seven years ago and introduce to the world a free and democratic Republic of Suriname.\nTwo days ago, in the presence of international observers, our Constitution was approved. It is a document which was carved from the accumulated history, experiences and knowledge of our people. Several years ago a civil dialogue was begun which tapped the enormous resources of our community. It called upon representatives from a wide variety of political, social and economic interests. The energy we tapped from that body, and our thirst for a true democratic society, were transformed into a National Assembly, adding to the discussion formality and legitimacy. This was not merely a gesture of goodwill on the part of the Government; the creation of that body was an act necessitated by the maturation of Suriname\u2019s body-politic; it was an act of love for the land which is Suriname and an act of faith in the hopes and abilities of its people.\nThe National Assembly set out to draft a document which would form the foundation for a free and open Suriname. The document, which has been ratified by the people, finds its strength and validity in the widest range of political participation in the country's history. It is a law from the people, for the people. And on 25 November, just weeks from today, general elections will be held and an era of civilian control will commence.\nThe army is ready and willing to accept the results of this process and is committed to defending and securing the national integrity and sovereignty of Suriname against intervention and interference.\nThese are historic times for the people of Suriname. But they have not been attained without sweat, sacrifice and, unfortunately, the loss of lives. The path to democracy has been laden with numerous and unforeseen obstacles. Through the course of our journey, we have encountered the vagaries of the international economy} we have dealt with the uncertainty of chatting a course which diverts from our colonial past; and most regrettably, we have faced the bullets of those who sought to undermine our efforts. It is this last hurdle which proves most distressing for the Surinamese people. For in combating these parasites, innocent men, women, and children have been struck down, caught in the crossfire of a conflict they detested but found themselves powerless to escape. \nThis fighting has exacerbated the economic woes which were unforeseen and unjustly imposed upon our country. When the last vestiges of colonialism saw fit to hold economic stability hostage to the direction of internal policy, they condemned the people of Suriname to a future of uncertainty and hardship. In the wake of this callous action, violence erupted. The perpetrators did not act out of some lofty quest for prosperity, but out of an obsession for personal vengeance and as stooges of colonialism. The people of East Suriname saw no alternative but to flee the country for neighbouring French Guiana, seeking refuge from a war which was fracturing their existence. We should like these people to return to their homes. They are citizens of Suriname and should feel secure in their own country. We have called upon the International Committee of the Red Cross, in consultation with the Government of France, to assist in this process on a permanent basis. But, most importantly, we must demand that those Governments and parties supporting or encouraging the violence in our country immediately stop their actions. The lives being lost are not being lost for any cause at all - our people are dying in vain.\nIn the name of democracy, external Powers supported and encouraged a continuation of this senseless violence. Behind the barrel of a gun they pretended to bring democracy to Suriname. They have committed themselves to the disruption of the process which is currently under way, a process that is proving so successful and is cherished so much by the people of Suriname. How, then, can democracy be a goal of those who support terrorism in the Republic of Suriname? How, for that matter, can terrorism serve the people anywhere in the world?\nAt this point I take the opportunity of expressing the gratitude of the Surinamese people to those countries that have variously supported us in our plight; at the same time, we look forward to increasing understanding and support from other nations. I wish to pause here to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside over the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am sure that under your guidance and leadership many of the crises facing the world will be dealt with in a rational prudent and effective manner.\nI take this opportunity also to congratulate Mr. Choudhury of Bangladesh on the outstanding way in which he presided over the last session of the General Assembly. To our congratulations we want to add our best wishes for his future endeavours.\nMy friends, there is trouble all around us. Brother is fighting brother in the Middle East, Asia and Central America. Repression continues in its most barbaric forms in southern Africa. And it was inevitable that so far most representatives in the General Assembly should have dealt with these major international crises. And while the scope and nature of these crises would justify lengthy discussion, on this occasion it will suffice for us to refer to our contributions at previous sessions of the Assembly. \nThe Government of Suriname commends the efforts of the Central American Presidents to bring about a regional peace treaty. We whole-heartedly endorse the efforts of the Security Council and of Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in the Gulf\u00b7\nLike the people of the rest of the world, the Surinamese people have welcomed the concrete steps taken by the super-Power s towards the lessening of the nuclear threat. But any form of international peace that is achieved can be sustained only if the resources thus released ate used to recreate the international economic order. The suffering part of mankind cannot find relief in the absence of a nuclear threat alone. Now, however, I must return to the question I posed just moments ago; what is democracy, and how can such a noble objective lead to the violence and death which pervade too many of our lands? Democracy can mean many different things to many different people. By strict definition, democracy represents the principles of social equality and respect for the individual. Those are simple-enough concepts. Yet they are so difficult to realize. Democracy is an abstract idea which is not easily grasped. It is a fragile state of being which must be nurtured, cultivated, taught. If stretched to its limits unnaturally, it deteriorates into chaos and lawlessness. But if it is not permitted to blossom and take on characteristics unique to its adherents, it lacks the strength and vitality to be fruitful. There is no monopoly of wisdom in this world; nor is there a monopoly of virtue- Each one of our nations strives to realize a degree of national freedom and dignity consistent with its concept of democracy. It is a system whereby opposing and divergent views may flourish or perish on the merit of their wisdom. To the great Powers of the world I repeat that. There is no monopoly on wisdom; nor is there a monopoly on virtue.\nFurther, I say the following to them. You possess tremendous attributes and have harnessed the most awesome and fearsome powers of earth. Yet too often you lack the simple capacity for understanding and empathy. You insist that your way is the right way and spurn those who seek to discover truth for themselves. I beseech you not to prejudge, but to permit the developing nations of the world the same opportunities as you had. So many of us in the Non-Aligned Movement want only to venture down a path of our own choosing. Yet too often first steps ate marred by the norms established by both sides of the rhetorical battle. If your concern for our future were based on a genuine concern for the welfare of our people, the intrusion might be more palatable.\nThere is so much we can teach you and, of course, we can learn from you. But for this transfer to take place, for this union to occur, there must be mutual trust and respect. This cannot be fostered in an atmosphere of fear and ideological self-righteousness.\nYou, the leading members of the international community, can guide the world to a more stable and lasting peace. Your wealth should not be used as a political tool to force compliance with your policies or adherence to your beliefs. If your positions are sound and well-founded, time will bear this out. Aid for development is the key with which to unlock the cultural/ historical and, of course, economic riches which so many of our countries possess, but which lie unexplored and unutilised. The misunderstanding which plagues so much of the international arena, the political aggression which manifests itself in violence, and the economic plight which threatens not only the smaller debtor nations but the entire world community are merely symptoms of unwillingness to compromise with peoples of different minds.\nIn this regard, I make the following appeal to representatives of the international media covering today's proceedings. Their words and perspectives reach millions and shape the opinions of the world's inhabitants. The burdens weighing upon a country and its people can be lessened if the lines of communication are kept open and are kept free of sensational journalism aimed at increasing circulation rather than airing both sides of a controversy. I urge them to realize and accept the awesome responsibility of their position and act in an honourable and just manner.\nIn Suriname we are embarking on a new phase of our life an important aspect of which is our endeavour really to become an organic part of the Latin American and Caribbean region, I extend my Government's heartfelt appreciation to those who have aided us throughout our struggle. Naturally, we will learn from our trials and tribulations, and in the phase that we have now entered we will, in dealing with both domestic and foreign issues, take chances which can lead to broader understanding and co-operation. Without respect, understanding and co-operation, the future of mankind is destined to be far more difficult than we imagine and we will achieve much less than each of our nations now envisages.\nI came before the Assembly, Mr. President, mainly to set the record of my country straight - the record of our past, our present and cur future. We know that the expectations of happiness and prosperity of the people of Suriname are the same as those of all the peoples of our world, and that is no wonder, for they reflect the noble goals enshrined in the Charter of our Organization, the United Nations. We, like the rest of the world, are therefore justified in expecting all possible support from this Organization in achieving our goals. \nWhile it will take some time to solve all our major problems, we hope that our noble Organization, the United Nations, will before long be in a position to present to the world encouraging beginnings of solutions that are long overdue.\n \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, it is my pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the high post of the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly, it is our conviction that, under your able guidance, our gathering will bear fruitful results in the preservation and consolidation of peace.\nI should like to express my Government's full appreciation of the efforts of Mr. Javier P\u00e9rez de Cuellar, the United Nations Secretary-General, and his wise conduct of the Organization's work.\nThe people and Government of Afghanistan attach enormous importance to the role played by the United Nations in regulating international relations and peacefully resolving conflicts through political means, based on acceptable and just solutions.\nThe international problems under discussion in the Assembly are serious and difficult. There is no doubt, however, that the threat of a nuclear conflagration and the use of force are the central concerns of all nations, all realistic and far-sighted statesmen and peace-loving circles of the globe. Solution of these problems requires \u0430 new way of political thinking.\nMy Government believes that no exceptional security can ever exist for any individual Power unless durable and genuine peace, founded on general and complete disarmament, is established for all. Not a single country can ever breathe freely under the shadows of nuclear missiles and the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI) project of the United States of America. The possibilities existing in contemporary international relations and all the potentialities of the United Nations should be deployed for the solving of world problems and towards the establishment of a universally acceptable political and legal mechanism to regulate international relations.\nWe warmly welcome the possibility of the signing of an agreement on the elimination of medium- and short-range nuclear missiles in Europe created during recent talks in Washington between the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union and the United States of America. It is our hope that the experience gained during those talks will be utilized towards banning nuclear tests and reducing and finally eliminating strategic nuclear weapons.\nThe Government of Afghanistan follows with increasing concern dangerous regional developments in various parts of the world. In the strategic Gulf region, expansionist and neo-globalistic imperialist policies have created an explosive situation. The concentration of huge naval forces of the United States of America and its allies has posed the serious threat of a new flare-up of uncontrollable dimensions. We favour implementation of the proposal for the withdrawal of foreign naval forces from that region.\nThe senseless war between Iran and Iraq has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands and has inflicted heavy material losses on both sides. We support resolution 598 (1987) of the Security Council, which calls for an immediate cease-fire.\nThe powder-keg tension in the Middle East, which is on the verge of explosion, remains unchanged because of the continued Israeli occupation of Arab lands and denial of the Palestinian people's legitimate right to self-determination and statehood. The convening of an international conference with the participation of all parties concerned is the only reasonable way for the solution of this issue. It is imperative to search for a viable and comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem and thus to eliminate a dangerous centre of tension in the Eastern Mediterranean region through the convocation of an international conference within the framework of the United Nations. In this region, again, provocations from across the ocean has further escalated discord and conflict In Lebanon.\nThe Pretoria regime continues its policy of apartheid in South Africa through the violent oppression of the people, in spite of the unanimous demand for its termination by the entire world.\nThe noble efforts of the United Nations for securing the independence of the people of Namibia is being obstructed and aggression is still being carried by the apartheid regime against Angola and other front-line States, Here, too, the interventionist hand of the United States is clearly involved.\nThe United States armed threats against Latin America have clearly surfaced, with the scandalous military and financial aid to the Nicaraguan contras. The recent accord reached in Guatemala among the leaders of the five Central American nations once again revealed the practical nature of the Contadora peace process as well as the need for putting an end to foreign interventions in the affairs of the region.\nWe express our solidarity with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the unification of North and South Korea and for the denuclearisation of the Korea peninsula. The reconciliation process Initiated in the People's Republic of Kampuchea deserves appreciation and support. It is our hope that all sides concerned will welcome this meaningful and positive process. \nI should like to express high appreciation and support for the role of the constructive peace proposals and initiatives offered by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and other socialist countries, peace efforts initiated by the United Nations, member countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, reflected in the Harare Declaration and the Delhi six proposals, as well as for endeavours of the national liberation and progressive movements.\nThe world economic situation la still appalling. No doubt this will have grave consequences. The increase in the number of the least developed countries from 31 in 1981 to 40 in 1986 indicates the sad reality of the prevailing international economic life. The present world economic situation Is not unrelated to the arms race. Only checking the arms race can release the necessary resources to improve the world economic situation.\nUnless international economic security becomes an Integral part of the overall global security and is strictly observed, a rapid and stable harmonious growth rate and the establishment of a new International economic order will not be achieved.\nThe debt crisis, debt servicing and high interest rates along with protectionist policies have led to the retardation or total suspension of development programmes in the developing and least developing countries. Concerning the objective realities in my country, I should like to state that with the victory of the April Revolution, our people rose only to fight against backwardness, illiteracy, ignorance, disease, poverty and unemployment in our society.\nFor nine years, however, an undeclared war has been continuing against our country by the enemies of Afghanistan. Prom its very inception this war, waged through some neighbouring countries, has been increasingly intensified and has assumed new dimensions every year. Billions of dollars have been poured in by the Washington Administration and other imperialist and reactionary circles for fuelling this war. As a result, thousands of Afghans have either been martyred or crippled, and hundreds of thousands of others have been displaced and now live pathetic lives in exile.\nThe war has also ruined our national economy. For instance, 2,000 schools, 350 bridges, 50 cultural centres, 131 hospitals, 224 mosques and holy places of worship, 258 production institutions, thousands of kilometres of highways and communication lines, and thousands of trucks have been destroyed or burned. Total damage to our national economy has reached billions of Afghanis, amounting to three fourths of all the total development investment in the past 50 years in Afghanistan. Huge defence expenditures, which otherwise could have brought about an improvement in the living conditions of the people, have burdened our fragile economy.\nThis situation has made it imperative for every Afghan to think about how to overcome this state of affairs. This necessary determination, new political thinking and the common endeavour of every patriot is directed towards putting an end to fratricide and establishing peace and tranquillity in the country. This determination and new political thinking found reflection in the policy of national reconciliation which came into effect on 25 January 1987. This policy is in total conformity with the principles of humanism, Islam, Afghan traditions, the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nThe proclamation of a unilateral cease-fire and its further extension; the proclamation of a general amnesty, including the release of prisoners; the endorsement of new legislation regarding better regulation of agrarian issues; the exemption of interest on debts and tariffs of the peasants; the returning of confiscated properties to the returnees; the encouragement and development of private investment; the adoption of new and suitable terms for conscription to the national service; and other such steps have recently been taken for the public welfare.\nMore than 3,200 commissions for national reconciliation have been established throughout the country. About 83,000 of our refugee compatriots have returned, despite obstacles created by neighbouring countries. More than 30,000 members of the armed opposition groups have laid down their weapons inside the country and are co-operating with the Government in preserving peace and security in their localities. Nearly 600 armed opposition groups encompassing 53,000 people are in contact and negotiating with the Government.\nThe new Law of Political Parties which guarantees the activity of various parties has been endorsed. This is the first of its kind in the entire history of the country. The draft of the new constitution has been prepared and published for public debate by the people of Afghanistan both in and outside the country. In line with its history and traditions, Afghanistan has been proclaimed, in the constitution, as an independent, sovereign and non-aligned country, which shall enter into no military pacts and shall allow no foreign military bases on its territory. It is enshrined in the new constitution that Islam is the religion of the people of Afghanistan. Comrade Najib, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, has rightly stated that \\\"the new constitution is the constitution of conciliation.\nThe achievement of national reconciliation would have been much greater if some of the countries had not adopted a hostile stand towards it. Yes, it is not proceeding without difficulty. However, no alternative exists for putting an end to war and bloodshed. To realize the policy of national reconciliation, the practical participation of all the political parties and groups, together with the clergymen, patriotic personalities and social organizations is required\u00b7 Consistent efforts have been made to establish a national unity coalition government with the participation < f the representatives of all sects and strata of society\u00b7 These include the seven Islamic parties, supporters of the former King, and other groups and individual who are ready to join the process of national reconciliation. In this regard, various specific high posts of State in the legislative, judicial and executive organs have also been proposed to them. \nThe policy of national reconciliation has not only been welcomed in the country but also enjoys international support. The socialist countries, the majority of the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement and some of the countries members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (QIC), as well as international organizations, political parties and peace-loving and progressive forces, have welcomed this bold and courageous peace initiative of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and given it various kinds of support. The resolute support of the Soviet Union for national reconciliation, and its economic assistance, once again refute the charges from some quarters against Afghan-Soviet friendship.\nGoodwill delegations from the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan recently paid visits to various countries of the world. The purpose behind these visits was to inform those countries about the realities of Afghan society and invite their delegations to visit Afghanistan to acquaint themselves with developments in our country. I should like to express my gratitude for the goodwill of those countries and their support for the noble and humane cause of my country.\nI also express my appreciation to those international organizations - including the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees - which have begun visiting and communicating and co-operating with Afghanistan. It is precisely since the announcement of the programme for national reconciliation that the flow of modern weapons supplied to the opposition by their supporters abroad has sharply increased. The United States of America has increased its financial aid for the continuation of the undeclared war from $530 million last year to $630 million in the current year, and it will reach $1,000 million next year. The United States has also increased the dispatch of modern Stinger missiles to the extremists from 6o units last year to 600 units this year and has started to supply them with 12\u03cb mm long-range mortars. The United Kingdom, too, has further increased the dispatch of Blowpipe missiles to the extremists. These weapons have been used to shell cities and villages, carry out terrorist acts and shoot down civilian aircraft, murdering innocent passengers, including children, women and old people. It is clear that our enemies have not abandoned the policy of \\\"war to the last Afghan\\\".\nOur people firmly believe that with the full realization of the policy of national reconciliation, nationwide peace will inevitably be ensured in the country. Unfortunately, however, in the course of the general debate at this session of the General Assembly, there have been some speeches in which attempts have been made to distort the substance of the processes going on in and around Afghanistan and to cast doubts on the policy of national reconciliation.\nI should like to emphasize another very significant development which is at variance with the allegations of those who want to transform the constructive discussion going on in the General Assembly into a battleground of confrontation. I have in mind the fact that it is precisely since the last session of the General Assembly that there has been radical progress at the Geneva talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the participation of the representative of the Secretary-General.\nThe negotiating sides have been able to prepare the main documents comprising a political settlement, and these are virtually complete. The gap between the positions of the two sides on the time-frame for the return of troops has been narrowed down to only eight months. We appeal to the Pakistani side to adopt a constructive stand and demonstrate political realism. This will enable us to solve remaining differences, including those concerning the time-frame, and the next round of talks will prove conclusive.\nThe policy of national reconciliation and the Geneva talks are contributing as two separate processes to the achievement of a single objective. That objective is to ensure peace inside the country and achieve a political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan.\nIn this connection, I wish to point to the ineffective nature of the resolutions on Afghanistan adopted by this Assembly over some years now. They have failed to bring about a guaranteed cessation of Interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan as the root cause of the tense situation there. The removal of that root cause could rapidly make possible a comprehensive settlement, I therefore appeal to all in this Assembly to embark upon a move which instead of Impeding will facilitate a settlement.\nI assure representatives that the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is fully prepared to take a constructive position and participate actively in the preparation of a truly balanced draft resolution that would contribute to the speediest possible political solution of the situation around Afghanistan.\nit is our conviction that the General Assembly can help bring about a favourable international atmosphere conducive to the political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan and to the process of national reconciliation in the country. Both processes have recently gained considerable momentum. Afghanistan is on the threshold of a crucial historical change. We believe that a political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan is in full accord with the interests of both our people and all the nations of the region. It will ensure peace and security in the region and in the world and in no way prove contrary to the national interest of any other country.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like first to convey to Mr. Peter Florin, on behalf of my delegation, sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. His qualities as an experienced diplomat, coupled with his great experience of our Organization, and the high offices that he has occupied in his country are a sure guarantee of the successful conduct of our work at a time when the Assembly must once again discuss serious problems which threaten the balance of our planet. We wish him every success in carrying out his difficult duties.\nI should like also to congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, a sister Muslim country whose dedication, authority and ability made calm, positive work possible at the last session.\nI take this opportunity also to pay a special tribute once again to the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his persistent efforts in the service of world peace. I associate in these congratulations Mr. Joseph Reed, who was recently nominated to the post of Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs. My delegation is convinced that the great qualities that distinguish that eminent diplomat will make him an effective member of the Secretary-General's new team.\nTwo years after the historic celebration of the fortieth anniversary of our Organization we must say that, despite the cries of alarm heard on that occasion, and despite our aspirations to a better world, the threat to international peace and security is greater than ever before. Indeed, in the light of the persistent conflicts and the sporadic wars which could at any time degenerate into a general conflagration, the peoples of the earth have never felt with such anguish the daily threat that endangers their very existence.\nWe are concerned at the increasing difficulties facing our Organization, given the many challenges that beset mankind. Urgent measures are necessary to ensure that the sacred principles of the Charter of our Organization are respected and applied. The United Nations is the universal symbol of justice, equality and peace. It is a moral bulwark which has frequently enabled our world to escape the worst that could happen. That is why we must understand the primary, decisive role that it must continue to play. It is time to re-establish its credibility, because millions of people pin their hopes on it. However, to ensure that the community of nations can continue to shoulder its great responsibilities effectively, a new mentality, based on mutual understanding and respect, must predominate in international relations.\nLike the gloomy political situation that characterizes international relations at present, the rather poor economic situation is of great concern. This session is taking place two months after the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held in Geneva in July. The reasonably positive results that emerged from that Conference reflect a certain change in the positions until then adopted by the developed countries of the North, although by no means all obstacles have been overcome - far from it.\nIt goes without saying that the recovery that has started in the North has become a great problem for the developing countries of the South and proves that partial, unilateral solutions adopted by the wealthy countries to resolve structural problems are inadequate. The crisis continues, and my country, which is one of the least developed, increasingly feels the damaging effects of this. These effects include: disorganization of the international economic system; a great increase in the debt burden as compared with the developing countries' repayment capacity; a sharp fall in the prices of raw materials; the continued worsening of the already catastrophic situation of the least developed countries and so on.\nBecause mine is an island country, because of our restricted national territory, part of which is still under foreign occupation, and because we lack mining resources, the development process embarked upon after our independence by the Comorian Government, under the enlightened guidance of Mr, Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane, President of the Republic, continues to face major obstacles. We would note in particular the following the fact that the prices of our commodities, which account for more than 90 per cent of the value of our exports, have gone down; the fact that the volume of our debt servicing has increased by two and a half times in less than three years; the intransigence of our creditors with regard to the unfavourable conditions of their loans; the reduction in absolute terms of export earnings; the failure by some of our partners to respect commitments to assist our country that were undertaken at the first round table of donors, organized in Moroni, our capital, in July 19B4.\nDespite these many constraints, my Government continues to make great efforts to support growth and improve the living standards of our people. Thus, beginning in 1979, a restructuring programme relating particularly to production sectors has been undertaken. these efforts have been accompanied by a series of measures to improve financing in the public and para-public sectors, enabling us better to rationalize State operations and support growth by promoting private initiatives and very productive endeavours. This economic recovery policy had led to much improved performance in some areas by 1983. In fact, thanks to the multiplying effects of this programme, throughout this period we have seen an overall growth in the economy of 6 per cent per annum and an annual increase of 1.7 per cent of real income per inhabitant. Nevertheless, the worsening of the international environment, marked by a sharp drop in commodity prices, and the great increase in debt servicing brought about by the excessive increase in interest rates in the main currencies used in the credit market have wiped out these endogenous efforts.\nOur Government, for its part, is firmly committed to the spirit of enterprise and is determined to continue the battle against underdevelopment. However, without sustained increased aid from the international community, our country will not be able to reach its goals. That is why I now appeal to all people of goodwill to demonstrate, in keeping with the relevant resolutions of our Organization, their active solidarity by giving us their valuable assistance.\nIn the light of the complexity of the problems that confront our States, regional and sub regional grouping is one of the ways to reduce these difficulties. That is certainly true for my country, and it is one of the priorities of its foreign policy. That is why my Government is committed to promoting regional and sub regional co-operation. Comoros was one of the founding members of the Preferential Trade Zone, incorporating countries of eastern Africa, southern Africa and the Indian Ocean. But it is thanks to the establishment in 1984 of the Indian Ocean Commission, which includes Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles, Reunion Island and Comoros, that our various peoples can now pin real hopes on the advent of a common sub regional market. \nThe Indian Ocean Commission, over which my country has the honour of presiding, gives the inhabitants of the area a chance to create a new economic area capable of providing for the harmonious, integrated, long-term development of our subregion. But despite our determination, because of its paltry means the Indian Ocean Commission will not be able, without significant aid, to become the indispensable tool for the growth of our economies.\nApart from the generous and greatly appreciated aid given by the Commission of European Communities, no other assistance has been forthcoming to support our sub regional co-operation. Therefore, as current Chairman of the Indian Ocean Commission, I would appeal for the assistance of the international community and ask it to take an active part in financing the projects included in our programme.\nAllow me now briefly to assess the international political situation.\nIn the Middle East, Israel continues its aggression against the Arab peoples The Zionist entity refuses to accept the reality of the Palestinian people as a nation and seeks to flout its inalienable rights, with the assistance of its allies, Israel is pursuing an aggressive expansionist policy and has rejected the peaceful solutions proposed thus far.\nWe have always supported and affirmed the view that there can be no lasting, true peace in the Middle East as long as the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are not recognized, guaranteed and effectively exercised. That is why the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros supports the idea of an international peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned, including, of course, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole, authentic, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\nA corollary of the Israeli-Arab conflict, the situation in Lebanon is still marked by daily violence and suffering, to which now has been added the spectre of famine and the situation is aggravated by the permanent presence of the Zionist army of occupation.\nAfter seven years of deadly hostilities that have brought about a situation in which there can be no victors and no vanquished, the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq continues its rampage in those countries. The increased risk of this conflict becoming international requires increasing vigilance by the international community. That is why we welcome the efforts of our Organization, more specifically the Secretary-General. The Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros supports Security Council resolution 598 (1987) calling for an immediate cease-fire by the two warring parties. We once again appeal to them, and particularly to Iran, strictly to abide by the Security Council resolution and all the efforts made thus far to achieve the cessation of hostilities and to put an end to this war, which is both absurd and futile.\nDespite the resistance and bravery of the Afghan people, Afghanistan continues to suffer massacres and destruction in an undeclared war imposed upon it by a foreign Power. We have been following with keen interest the mediation efforts conducted under the auspices of the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General, but we remain deeply concerned about the continuance of this war that has already inflicted great losses on the people of that country. My country unreservedly supports the heroic struggle of that fraternal people, and we call for the immediate withdrawal of foreign forces in accordance with the relevant resolutions of our Organization.\nTurning to Kampuchea, that country continues to be beset by foreign military occupation, notwithstanding the resolutions of the General Assembly calling for the immediate, unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops. The suffering people of Kampuchea is entitled to choose for itself, in full freedom and without any external constraints, the kind of government it wants.\nThe situation in the Korean peninsula remains at a standstill. Despite the statement by the two States in the North and the South on reaching an agreement, no decisive step has yet been taken towards peaceful reunification of the country. We exhort the two parties to continue to try to find a just and lasting solution to the problem, because a United Korea would be a guarantee for peace and stability In that region. We reaffirm that the admission to membership of the two Koreas in our Organization would help to promote a speedy settlement of the problem.\nIn southern Africa, despite the repeated condemnations voiced by the international community, the Pretoria regime is still maintaining its inhuman policy of apartheid. This region is still the theatre of grave events that have brought about an explosive situation, thus imperilling the political stability of the countries of the region. We strongly condemn the continuing inhuman system of apartheid and sincerely call for abolition of that policy, which alone can help restore civil peace in the country and stability in that part of our continent.\nWe note with regret that Namibia still has not regained its independence, despite the relevant resolutions of our Organization. Faithful to the principles of peace and freedom, the Comorian Government is convinced that implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) alone will make possible a peaceful, negotiated settlement of this problem.\nThe situation on the Chadian-Libyan border calls for special attention. While welcoming the cease-fire, although it is fragile, between Chad and Libya, my country is very concerned about this dispute between two African countries, both members of the Organization of African unity (OAU) and the Islamic Conference.\nIn our view, the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the charter of the OAU require that any dispute should be resolved through dialogue and negotiation. We therefore make a solemn appeal to the two parties concerned to embark upon the course of dialogue, mutual understanding and good-neighbourliness to resolve their conflict. The interests of their respective peoples are at stake, as well as the dignity of Africa and the unity of our pan-African organization.\nTurning to Western Sahara, my country reiterates that it fully supports the resolutions adopted at the 18th and 19th summit meetings of the OAU. We are convinced that to secure a satisfactory and lasting solution to this problem a referendum must be organized to enable the people concerned to exercise their right to self-determination. We call upon the parties concerned to make use, under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the current Chairman of the OAU, of all the peaceful means at their disposal and to demonstrate wisdom and the will to attain that goal.\nMy country, like all the other littoral States of the Indian Ocean, is concerned by the increasing reinforcement of the military presence in that region, which has been made more serious by the explosive situation in the Arab-Persian Gulf. In its desire to preserve peace and security in that area, my country has always fought for the establishment of a zone of peace, a demilitarised, denuclearised zone in the Indian Ocean, in keeping with the Declaration contained in General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI).\nBefore concluding this brief review of the international situation, I wish to refer once again to a question familiar to our Organization that is a source of serious concern for my country. I mean, of course, the question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte.\nAs the Assembly knows, this problem arose from an injustice and a flagrant violation of public international law, and has a permanent place on the agendas of all international and regional organizations. Unfortunately, no just, lasting solution has been found, and this year again there will be a special discussion 01 this matter which will give us opportunity to go into more detail on it. For the time being, I would merely state that there have been no developments since the forty-first session of the General Assembly because nothing has happened to give the matter a fresh impetus.\nYet, after the meeting between the delegation of the OAU and the French Prime Minister, Mr. Jacques Chirac, in June 1986, and the encouraging statements h the latter, everyone felt that something positive would finally emerge. I would recall, however, that, following that meeting and the subsequent meetings between President Abderemane and the highest French authorities, the French Government decided to withdraw from the French Parliament the Bill on the organization of a referendum in Mayotte. Finally, the French Prime Minister paid a brief visit to the Comoros in October 1986. But the situation that prevails there has not lived up to the hopes raised by all these initiatives.\nNevertheless, my Government, convinced of the justice of its cause, has not ceased its efforts to continue to assert its most legitimate rights both in international forums and at the bilateral level.\nEvery time this question is discussed by the international community there is unanimous condemnation of this injustice and people always say that Mayotte is an integral part of the Islamic Federal Republic of Comoros.\nI reaffirm once again from this rostrum that the people and Government, of Comoros, because of their right and the unanimous support of the international community, are determined to fight until their just cause triumphs.\nWe therefore make an urgent, solemn appeal to the French Government to take a decisive step, within the framework of the friendly relations that exist between our two countries, to make possible a final solution to this distressing problem. \nIn conclusion, I reaffirm my Government's unswerving commitment to the United Nations system and its ideals and noble objectives.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff On behalf of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and on behalf of Zambia, I join all other speakers in congratulating you.\nAmbassador Florin, on your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. In doing so, I want to assure you of the co-operation of the African member States, and at the same time register our strong appreciation for the work done by your predecessor, Mr. Choudhury, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh.\nFurther, I congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier P\u00e9rez de Cuellar, on his outstanding and excellent leadership of this Organization. I also feel very honoured to express our special and deep gratitude to him for his presence at and valuable contribution to the twenty-third OAU summit meeting, held at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 27 to 29 July 1987.\nI would have preferred to carry a lighter and happier message on behalf of Africa, but that is not so because this session is taking place against the background of a worsening international situation. While the arms race rages on we are today witnessing with increasing frequency and intensity the creation of more hotbeds of tension in the world.\nAfrica is gravely concerned about this. We therefore hope that this session will help find solutions to some of the numerous problems confronting the world. We firmly believe that this can be done only through collective, concerted effort. That is the basis of our commitment to the United Nations. That is why we are here, sharing our concerns with the rest of the Member States.\nA little over a year ago, at its thirteenth special session, the General Assembly unanimously adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. That Programme is a unique framework for co-operation between Africa and the rest of the international community to bring about Africa's economic recovery. Convinced that such a task should begin in earnest and without fail, African Heads of State and Government collectively adopted in 1985 Africa's Priority Programme for Economic Recovery 1986-1990, and pledged to assume primary responsibility in its implementation.\nBy adopting the United Nations Programme of Action, the international community endorsed Africa's Priority Programme, acknowledged the need to create a more supportive international economic environment, and pledged to make every effort to provide sufficient resources to support African development initiatives. On our side, we committed ourselves to respect, at the national level, the priorities of Africa's Priority Programme, to continue vigorously to pursue appropriate policy reforms and fully to mobilize domestic resources for the successful implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action.\nWe have made strides during the past months of Africa's Priority Programme in reordering our economic priorities. We have introduced painful economic reforms and adjustments, and stabilization measures, often at tremendous economic and social cost and in the face of serious political risks, which in many a country have threatened the very foundations of social confession and political stability.\nAll this has been taking place at a time when a number of countries are experiencing continued or re-emerging drought problems and emergency situations, threatening once again to drain and divest scarce national resources that are badly needed for recovery and development.\nThe recovery and development efforts in the southern African region have been and continue to be frustrated by the racist regime of-South Africa and its- continued policies of aggression and political and economic destabilization. These policies have exacted tremendous financial and human costs and totally undermined peace, stability and security which are the very prerequisites for economic recovery and development.\t.\nBut, in spite of all the formidable difficulties and costs, Africa has demonstrated and continues to demonstrate its unswerving commitment to the United Nations economic recovery Programme. To us Africans the implementation of that Programme has been simply a matter of survival and a challenge to recover and develop; and we are determined to survive and grow.\nRegrettably, one cannot but conclude that almost one and a half years after the adoption of the Programme, and despite some limited initiatives here and there, the international community's overall response has fallen far short of the requirements of the Programme. The international community has not lived up to its side of the recovery pact.\nOur assessment of the situation is amply supported by the findings in the comprehensive and excellent progress report of the Secretary-General which is before us. This is also the assessment of a large body of distinguished African and non-African policy-makers, experts and representatives of international. United Nations and non-governmental organizations, who met recently in Nigeria at an international conference sponsored by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), in co-operation with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the African Development Bank. That group of policy-makers, experts and others set out to assess African's chances of recovery and development as embodied in the Abu\u013ca Statement, which is also before this session. Indeed, it is also the assessment of other major international organizations and a number of Western governments.\nIn addition to the failure of the international community, particularly the States members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) r to respond adequately, the external economic environment has become further aggravated. In one year alone, 1985 to 19B6, Africa lost as much as $US 19 billion in export earnings as a result of the collapse of commodity prices. In 1986 terms of trade deteriorated by 28 per cent and the purchasing power of its exports fell by 3 0 per cent.\nThe debt and debt-servicing problems have also assumed alarming dimensions. By the end of 1986 Africa's debt had reached $US 200 billion, amounting to 54 per cent of the gross domestic product and almost 440 per cent of export earnings. Debt-service ratios to exports now exceed 50 per cent and are much higher for many countries. The scheduled debt-service payments exceed $US 15 billion. The situation is so critical that many countries have had to stop payment altogether  and a special summit meeting of the Heads of State of OAU, to be held on 30 November and I December 1987, will specifically discuss this problem.\nThe dramatic fall in export earnings and the huge debt-service payments represent transfers from Africa of precious financial resources which could have been used to engineer economic recovery. The African countries pledged finance of about 63 per cent of the African Priority Programme for Economic Recovery 1986-1990 from domestic sources on the assumption of stable commodity prices, so that the revenue and household income derived there from could in turn be stable and assured. That assumption went with the wind during the very first year after the adoption of the United Nations Programme of Action. Very little, if any, action has been taken by the international community to ameliorate the debilitating effects of the adverse external environment.\nNo measures are in sight to stabilize export earnings from commodities, which are of major interest to Africa nor have effective mechanisms been put in place to deal with the unmanageable debt and debt-servicing burdens in any meaningful way. Worse still, the anticipated increase in the resource flows to Africa has not materialized. Not only have they not matched the resource outflows from Africa; they have actually stagnated. Standing at $US 10 billion in 1986, total resource flows to Africa in real terms were below the 1985 level. Thus, while Africa lost about $US 34 billion in outward transfers in 1986 alone as a result of the fall in export earnings and of debt-service payments, the net Income resource flows could compensate for only a little more than half of that loss.\nIt is thus clear that Africa has been losing on all counts, to the extent that one wonders whatever happened to the commitment the international community entered into in the United Nations economic recovery Programme for Africa and to the spirit of co-responsibility and mutuality of interest and why it has not translated itself into concrete actions.\nThis session should, inter alia, take stock to the extent to which our mutual undertakings have been honoured and spell out what needs to be done during the remaining life span of that Programme, if it is to be successfully implemented.\nAlthough the word \\\"compact\\\" has not been used in the Programme of Action, the new partnership based, as it were, on a mutual commitment and shared responsibility between Africa and the international community is nothing short of a compact for development and progress in Africa, It also symbolizes the restoration of faith in the efficacy of international economic co-operation in support of Africa,\nOf course we Africans know only too well that we have to be the masters of our own destiny and that we have to sustain domestic policy reforms, continue the efforts to improve economic management as long as it takes, and also concentrate all the adopted priorities to bring about the necessary change in the structure of our economies, to pursue self-reliant and self-sustaining development and to strengthen economic co-operation and integration in Africa.\nHaving said that, it is also true - and this needs to be stressed in very clear terms - that these efforts, no matter how relentlessly they are pursued, would be futile without genuine improvement in the external economic environment and without the adequate support of the international community. Unless effective solutions are found for the debt and commodity problems and unless resource flows at levels adequate to compensate for the outward transfer of resources away from Africa and also to allow for a meaningful positive per capita growth rate are ensured, prospects for bringing about recovery and development in Africa will become forever elusive and the continent will forever be a victim of the vagaries and misery of perpetual crisis.\nThe case for external support to Africa does not primarily rest on moral grounds, as some of us would like to portray it. It does not. The hard evidence clearly shows that a perverse massive transfer of resources out of Africa is currently taking place. These outflows must be stopped and reversed through resource inflows that would also take into account the requirements of growth.\nHowever, one is aware of and grateful for some initiatives by some donor and creditor Governments to provide a variety of debt-relief measures and special assistance programmes. These measures include the rescheduling of official debt through the Paris Club on more generous terms and of private commercial debt through the London Club. Some donor countries have also cancelled other debts in favour of some least developed African countries.\nWe also welcome the recent decision at the Venice Summit that consideration should be given to the possibility of applying lower interest rates to the existing debts of those African countries that are undertaking adjustment efforts and that agreement should be reached, especially in the Paris Club, on longer repayment and grace periods.\nSome initiatives have also been taken by Multilateral institutions to increase the volume of their assistance to Africa. Worthy of mention here are the replenishment of resources from the International Development Agency (IDA) amounting to US$ 12.4 billion and the decision to allocate 45 per cent thereof to sub-Sahara Africa.\nAlso notable is the recent proposal by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the resources available for the restructural adjustment facility be tripled to $9 billion in special drawing rights from 1 January in order to provide special support to poor countries facing extraordinary balance-of-payments problems. However, appreciable as these efforts are, they only represent partial approaches to the problem in hand and do by far fall short of the requirements of Africa.\nWhat is required is a package that includes solutions to the debt and commodity problems and a substantial increase in official development assistance (ODA). Such a package should include the conversion of all debts into grants, a substantial reduction and cutting of interest rates on commercial debts and the consolidation of these debts and the debt-service payments due thereon into long-term loans repayable over 30 to 40 years on concessional terms, allowing for a 10-year period of grace. The resultant debt-servicing requirements must be fully compatible with the capacity to pay of African countries, after fully taking into account the requirements of sustained growth and development.\nA solution should be found to the mounting debt of African countries to the IMF and the World Bank. There is now a substantial net outflow of resources from Africa to the IMF. It is estimated that in 1986 the net outflow of resources from Africa to the IMF amounted to over $US 960 million. Such a situation is unsustainable, unjustifiable and illogical. We should ensure that the IMF and the World Bank can reschedule, on a long-term basis, the repayment of the debt owed to it by Africa and the debt-servicing obligations.\nThe urgent need to deal with the problems of African commodities can hardly be overstressed. The dramatic fall in export earnings and the continuous deterioration of Africa's terms of trade have not only made a mockery of any attempts to increase the volume of exports but also they starved the African economies of a major source of investment funds.\nWe should translate into specific action the call on the international community in the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1906-1990\n\\\"To deal urgently with commodity issues, taking into account the special interests of the African countries ... and also to increase the capacity of African countries to process, market, distribute and transport their exports\\\", (resolution S-13/2, annex, para. 17(b)(ii))\nSupport for and the stabilization at reasonably remunerative prices of the earnings from commodities of primary interest to Africa are an important area for specific action. In this regard, the recent proposal by the Economic Commission for Africa (EGA) , which was also taken up by the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to expand donor participation in these matters and systems to include the other Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) donor countries deserves special attention. In addition to providing solutions to these problems, the package must ensure the flow of concessional resources to Africa at levels adequate to compensate for any outward transfer of resources as well as to meet the requirements of sustained growth at meaningful levels.\nOver and above this, $US 9.1 billion per annum are still needed from external sources to finance Africa's Priority Programme for Economic Recovery 1986-1990. The requirements of the African development programmes, which go beyond the requirements of the Priority Programme, are much larger.\nThe international community should shoulder its responsibility to face the problems of Africa squarely and provide the kind of lasting solutions that I have just mentioned. The efforts to initiate concrete action have failed to take off, because of the opposition of a few major countries. I appeal to them, in the name of humanity and in the name of international solidarity, to join hands with other countries in the full implementation by the international community of our joint economic recovery Programme for Africa. The problem of the environment is a matter of grave concern to mankind as a whole. We in Africa attach great importance to the urgency of this global issue. It is in that context that we welcome the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, which was presented to the twenty-third ordinary summit meeting of the OAU. It is worth noting in particular that, while the Commission recognized that pollution largely constitutes a northern or urban problem.\n\\\"poverty is the main cause of environmental degradation in many developing countries\\\".\nI commend that report to the Assembly, and at the same time I wish to the Chairman of the Commission, the Prime Minister of Norway for it, and also for coming to address our summit meeting in Addis Ababa, the twenty-third session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of Africa.\nThe political situation on the African continent is no better than the economic scene. Western Sahara continues to be an area of conflict. The Organization of African Unity supports the efforts now being made by the United Nations Secretary-General to bring about a cease-fire and a referendum. We call earnestly on both the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco to support the Secretary-General in his efforts. As in the past, the OAU will do all in its power to assist.\nThe dispute between Libya and Chad has not yet been settled, but we are consulting among ourselves within the framework of the Organization of African Unity in an effort to find a lasting solution to the problem. The ad Hoc Committee, which held its first meeting in Lusaka last month, is continuing its efforts to find a solution to the problem. In this regard, we strongly appeal to the wider international community to refrain from such action as will further complicate the situation.\nThe volatile and worsening situation in southern Africa, at the root of which is the evil system of apartheid in South Africa, continues to be a matter of grave concern to us. This world body has condemned apartheid and has rightly declared it a crime against humanity. Numerous appeals have been made to the regime in Pretoria to abolish this most cruel system of racial discrimination - but to no avail. Instead, the racist regime has responded by strengthening its repressive machinery and enforcing apartheid with even greater brutality. The racist Pretoria regime has, among other things, refused to lift the state of emergency and has continued to muzzle the press through censorship.\nSouth Africa's aggression against neighbouring independent countries has increased. Furthermore, its destabilization of the front-line States through its sponsorship and control of anti-Government bandits, mercenary-led groups such as the MNR (Mozambique National Resistance) in Mozambique and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) in Angola, has been considerably stepped up. These bandit groups cannot lay any claim to credibility as the representative of the people in these countries - much less to any worthwhile cause. Their hallmarks are murder, plunder and wanton destruction and violence.\nOnly recently, the South African-sponsored armed bandits added to their macabre record the cold-blooded massacre of hundreds of innocent women, children and old people at Homoine and elsewhere in Mozambique. The banditry of these, groups has caused much loss of life and property and unimaginable suffering and has Left permanent physical and psychological scars on the people of these countries. In Mozambique alone, an alarming number of children die as a result of this banditry. Hundreds of thousands of persons have had to flee from Mozambique and Angola, thus presenting a refugee problem of a magnitude that the region is finding difficult to cope with.\nYet, even as I address the General Assembly, the racist regime's armed forces, supported by the bandits of UNITA, have invaded Angola. Only a few minutes before I came here, I received reliable information that the racist troops in Angola have now actually taken over from their bandits of \u00dcNITA, because the so-called headquarters of those bandits was about to fall to the Angolan patriotic forces. The South African racist regime's evil forces have now taken over complete control of the war situation in southern Angola. In short, they have actually now invaded Angola themselves. There is no longer any pretence about this. All this is a deliberate campaign to establish Bantustan-type governments in front-line States.\nOf course, in the end the racists cannot succeed. But how much bitterness are they building up against themselves in the hearts of all those young people, part of the future of mankind, who are now growing up witnessing this barbaric campaign by a primitive regime in the twentieth century.\nSouth Africa's destabilization of neighbouring countries is meant not only to turn them into Bantustans but also to force them to abandon their support for the struggle against apartheid. What the racist regime in Pretoria simply does not understand is that that struggle is not being waged from outside but is being fought and will be won by the oppressed peoples themselves right inside South Africa.\nThere appears to be no indication at all of a willingness on the part of the racist regime to dismantle apartheid peacefully. But, as surely as night follows day, apartheid will be destroyed. It is not a question of if but of when and how apartheid will be ended. I want to emphasize that point: it is not a question of if but of when and how apartheid will be ended.\nWe wish, therefore, to reiterate what has been stated before; In the context of the southern African situation, comprehensive and mandatory sanctions remain the only peaceful way - I might add, comparatively speaking - to end apartheid. Lest it be forgotten, I point out that the world has been warned by the Organization of African Unity and other bodies that failure by the international community to resolve this issue peacefully will result in unimaginable bloodshed and destruction.\nSouth Africa's bogus attempt at reform cannot be tolerated, because, as the farce of a tricameral parliament has shown, apartheid cannot be reformed. Furthermore as the impudence of the May 1986 whites-only elections loudly proclaimed, the racist regime is neither serious nor willing to negotiate the dismantling of apartheid. It is against that background that we should like to repeat our endless appeals to the major Western countries which have sufficient leverage over the racist regime to join the campaign for comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the apartheid regime.\nIn the absence of such sanctions, only revolutionary violence by the oppressed majority of South Africa will dismantle apartheid. The racist regime must be pressured to renounce the abominable system of apartheid and the ban on the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and other political parties and organizations, lift the state of emergency, release Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners and proceed to negotiate with the genuine representatives of the oppressed people for a non-racial and democratic government.\nNamibia constitutes another tragedy for this Organization and for the international community as a whole. A global consensus exists that South Africa is illegally occupying the Territory of Namibia. The International Court of Justice, the Security Council and, indeed, this Assembly have reaffirmed that global view. A great deal of energy, diplomatic effort and even money have been spent to remove the innumerable obstacles impeding the implementation of the United Nations plan approved In Security Council resolution 43b (1978). The world has anxiously been awaiting the implementation of that resolution. The momentum that existed in 1978 has completely waned in the wave of the impasse created by the linkage of the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola with Namibian independence.\nThe OAU, the Non-Aligned Movement, the United Nations General Assembly itself and the Security Council have always maintained that the issue of linkage is extraneous to the Namibian question. We therefore request the Security Council immediately to face its responsibilities and enable the Secretary-General of the United Nations to proceed with the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nThe international community has a duty to assist the front-line States and other independent States of the region in order to enable them to withstand South Africa's acts of aggression and destabilization. I also appeal for increased humanitarian assistance to the victims of apartheid, especially those who have been displaced from their homes.\nI note with profound dismay that although the principle of peaceful co-existence has been accepted as the foundation of the United Nations, the intense rivalry between the two super-Powers and their respective blocs, which is the major driving force behind the arms race, is a real threat to international peace and security. In a world where millions of people die of hunger and malnutrition every year, how can our conscience allow us to spend over US$ 1000 billion per annum on armaments? What sense is there in our continuing to acquire and perfect more and more nuclear weapons when existing arsenals can destroy the world many times over? How can we live in peace with nuclear weapons, which we cannot manage to keep safe even when we are not using them?\nSurely we owe it to ourselves and to posterity - and, indeed, to the millions who have died and continue to die of starvation, malnutrition and disease - to stop the arms race, especially the nuclear arms race, so that we can channel the resources released in that process to more worthwhile and life-supporting purposes. In this regard, we should like to appeal to the two super-Powers, which have a special responsibility seriously and urgently to negotiate with each other an arrangement that will lead to general and complete disarmament.\nIn that vein, Zambia, and indeed the whole of Africa, welcomes with great relief and joy the recent announcement that the two super-Powers have reached\nagreement in principle to abolish all medium- and short-range missiles with a view to concluding an intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty. There is no doubt that the whole of mankind feels justly proud of that achievement at this historic moment. That agreement in principle reflects the patience, responsibility and great foresight that the two super-Powers have shown after long and difficult negotiations. Accordingly, we present our hearty congratulations to President Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.\nWe know, however, that much more needs to be done. Much larger nuclear, chemical and conventional stockpiles remain. We therefore call on the United States and the Soviet Union to persist in their efforts to rid this earth of all nuclear and chemical weapons and significantly to reduce conventional armaments, in order to guarantee security for both sides and for the world at large.\nThe Middle East continues to be an area of conflict. The Palestinian problem remains unresolved and now seriously affects Lebanon and its people. There is, however, a ray of hope - an international conference for peace in the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations. The OAU supports such a conference and calls on Israel to take full advantage of this historic opportunity to re-establish peace and secure borders for all in the Middle East. But for such a conference adequately to address all the issues of the area, it is imperative that the Palestine Liberation Organization attends as a full participating member. In this way, all the countries and peoples of the Middle East will commit themselves to the outcome of the conference.\nThe war between Iran and Iraq has entered its eighth year. The cost in human lives and property has been very heavy for both countries. The concentration in the Gulf of forces alien to the region increases the probability that the war may expand beyond the present conflict. That conflict could expand and engulf the neighbouring States, and threaten the flow of oil from that region. The OAU is concerned about the war and about its menacing consequences, we believe that the road forward lies in ending the war. For that reason we welcome the adoption by the United Nations Security Council of its resolution 5\u0423\u042c (1987). That resolution may not have fully satisfied the demands of all concerned, but it provides a basis for a meaningful settlement of the problem. It is our understanding that Iraq has already accepted the resolution. We therefore join the international community in calling on Iran to do the same.\nThe situation in Central America is also a source of worry to us. The peace and stability of that region can be assured only if the countries there are allowed to settle their own problems without external interference. We therefore support - and support fully - the Guatemala agreement recently signed by the five Presidents of the area. It is our hope that this will provide a basis for the settlement of all the outstanding issues.\nThere are other areas of tension. I am referring here to Afghanistan, Cyprus, Kampuchea and the Korean peninsula. In all these areas the introduction of foreign troops has made it difficult for the people of those countries to establish peace for themselves without outside interference. We join with the rest of humanity in demanding that those countries be given the opportunity to determine their own future.\nThe United Nations remains the most important multilateral institution for resolving international conflicts. It affords debate across ideologies and other human prejudices. It is a uniting factor. It must be preserved.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all. Sir, I should like to take this opportunity to offer you my congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your long experience in diplomacy and international relations and your personal talent are great assets that assure us of your enlightened and vigorous conduct of this session's proceedings.\nI should also like to express my gratitude and admiration to the Secretary-General. With dedication, wisdom and tenacity, and assisted by outstanding associates, he has performed year after year the delicate and complex tasks entrusted to him. At a time when certain world and regional conflicts have entered a critical phase, his initiatives and his efforts at mediation and conciliation have taken on a special importance. I need refer only to the Iran-Iraq war and the occupation of Afghanistan. I want to say how very pleased my Government is that his mandate has been renewed and assure him once again of all our confidence.\nLast Tuesday, Mr. Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs, addressed the Assembly as the current President of the European Community and its 12 member States. I entirely endorse the positions he expounded here on the various international questions in today's world, and shall therefore confine my remarks to the following observations.\nThe review of the international situation in which we traditionally engage at this time of year leads us on this occasion to make an assessment that is more subtle and, indeed, more positive. We are, of course, still disturbed to see that confrontation and military occupation persist in various parts of the world. There are new outbursts of violence, and breaches of human rights are still as widespread as ever. At the same time, a majority of member countries continue to endure the hardships inflicted by the state of the world economy. \nHowever, a number of recent developments appear to indicate a more positive turn and, indeed, to justify new hopes. I have in mind, in particular, the situation in Central America, to which I shall revert later, and the situation in Sri Lanka, where a balanced agreement has been signed between the President of Sri Lanka and the Prime Minister of India providing for a conclusion to the bloody war that has been waged between that country's two communities. I should also mention the very encouraging results of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which has just completed its work at Geneva. \nI would be remiss if I did not reiterate our common commitment to the fight against terrorism. Glimmers of hope have appeared with regard to the possibility of convening a Middle East peace conference. The emerging consensus in the aftermath of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development also demonstrates a new state of mind and greater convergence of interests and views. \nAbove all, however, the evolution in East-West relations, in which my country has the greatest interest, situated as it is in the heart of Europe, is a matter that gives ground for new optimism. The question of utmost interest to us is whether international relations have indeed reached a turning point. For the first time it is my impression that we are witnessing the slow demise of the cold war and the old dogmas that have characterised post war political dogmas based on the dialectic of the world class struggle, unrelenting confrontation between ideologies, hostility and fundamental distrust between blocks. The desire to avoid nuclear disaster, to guarantee the survival of mankind and to offer prosperity to the greatest possible number is, I believe compelling peoples, and consequently their political leaders, to do some clear thinking. \nNo one can deny that in our day the development of modern technology and the continual internationalisation of production and trade have led to interdependence among economies and States\u00b7 It is only natural and realistic for political leaders of whatever persuasion to recognize the situation and resolutely and without ulterior motives adopt a policy that will bring about the conditions necessary for broader, more creative and mutually advantageous co-operation. For the present, our attention is focused on the prospects for the first real disarmament agreement, concerning intermediate nuclear forces, which should be concluded before the end of the year. This has in particular resulted from a fortunate initiative of NATO, dating from 1981, It is therefore with keen hope that we look forward to the formalization of the next summit, which should result in the signing of this historic agreement. \nSuch an agreement would bring about a decisive strengthening of the climate of trust and the spirit of co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union, between East and West. It would help reduce tensions to the lowest level known by Europe since the end of the Second World War. It is our hope that in the wake of that initial agreement, which is of vital importance politically and psychologically negotiations on a drastic reduction of strategic nuclear forces will also be completed. In the same spirit, we very much hope that the work of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva - where many hurdles have been overcome - on the prohibition and elimination of all chemical weapons will be completed promptly. \nFrom the same standpoint of the need for stability and increased security in Europe, my country also advocates parallel negotiations on conventional forces, which we hope will lead to a balanced reduction, also properly verifiable, of such armaments. The need further to enhance the spirit of trust and co-operation requires that in the mean time existing treaties and agreements be complied with and that the establishment and development of new categories of intra- or extra-atmospheric weapons not be encouraged, for they would only create additional confusion in the already highly complex technical rivalry and would put the arms race on a new and entirely different path.\nIt is with pleasure that we note the new directions of Soviet domestic and foreign policy. During my recent trip to Moscow I had the privilege of speaking to important Soviet leaders, and I came away believing that a change in policy really is under way. This should help bring about profound and lasting progress in all spheres, in particular respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, which many justifiably expect. In this context I would recall and emphasize our political will to act with our partners in the European Community so that the work of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will lead to the total implementation by all participant countries of the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act. Just as we feel entitled to consider the implications of recent developments in international relations, so we must make it clear that only actions - not resolutions - will remove the doubts and reservations that history and experience have rooted within us. \nIn this regard, the increasingly murderous war in Afghanistan causes serious doubts to persist as to the Soviet desire for peace in its foreign policy. How can it be otherwise, while foreign troops remain stationed there and prevent the Afghan people from fully exercising their right to self-determination and to build a new society that is truly non-aligned and independent? Only the rapid withdrawal of those troops according to a precise timetable will make possible progress in the talks being held by the Secretary-General.\t\nThe agreement on a plan for the restoration of peace in Central America, reached on 7 August by the five Presidents of Central America, is another source \u03b9 : satisfaction to us. Luxembourg, acting together with the other member countries ( E the European Community, has constantly advocated a negotiated settlement, particularly at Ministerial Conferences at which its representatives have met with those of the Central American countries and the Contadora Group - first in San Jo\u015b in 1984, then in Luxembourg in 1985, and, recently, in Guatemala in February of this year. \nResisting outside pressures and demonstrating a common political will, the Heads of those five nations have given the world a lesson in courage and political wisdom by saying no to any armed solution and choosing peace through a negotiated regional agreement based on dialogue, reconciliation and democracy. The first steps towards implementation of the peace process, which is certainly as difficult and delicate as any process ever has been, are encouraging and consolidate the restored climate of trust. It is therefore desirable that all countries involved in the region accept that agreement and contribute to its conversion into a genuine peace with due respect for international law. \nIn two countries of East Asia which have for too long been subject to oppression and dictatorship, democracy has also been given a chance. In the Philippines, President Aquino has worked with determination to establish institutions truly representative of the people of the Philippines. She deserves our support as she moves along this road, which is strewn with formidable dangers. Her efforts to bring about economic recovery, to curb corruption, and to carry out the necessary social and economic reforms, particularly agrarian reform, deserve our esteem. In the Philippines, Latin America and elsewhere, success in the attainment of democracy is closely linked to the bold measures required for progress and social justice, of which those countries have so long been deprived. \nIn South Korea, an intelligent people has succeeded in securing recognition of the legitimacy of its political and social demands, thus opening the way to political amnesty, freedom of expression and free elections. We are pleased that, as the Seoul Olympic Games draw near, this process is helping bring about a truly democratic regime through the responsible contribution of all parties concerned, including the present Government and the leaders of the opposition. The absence of any representative of the Korean people in this Hall thus deserves to be re-examined at this session. \nOn the Question of the war between Iran and Iraq, we wish to welcome the unanimous agreement reached in the Security Council, based on an identical assessment by the five permanent members of the Security Council. This is an encouraging sign which is promising for the future of the United Nations. It signals a new trend which deserves to be highlighted and sustained. That decision proves that all the members of the Security Council, diverse as they are, are capable of finding a common political will and of shouldering the special responsibilities that the Charter and the Members of this Organization have entrusted to them for the maintenance of international peace and security. \nEven though this diplomatic breakthrough cannot erase from our minds the suffering of the war, we should like, from this rostrum, to applaud this magnificent precedent, achieved with a unanimity unparalleled in recent history, which should enable East and West, North and South, to work more resolutely an on a larger scale towards the restoration of international peace and co-operator It is my firm belief that the great majority of the Members of the United Nations expect to see the Council, in keeping with the spirit of the Charter, examine with equal determination other important questions and other acute conflicts that have been too long neglected. \nIt is true that Security Council resolution 598 (1987), of 20 July, hasn\u2019t yet brought peace. But that only shows that that while the agreement of the Council is certainly indispensable in order to stop the conflict, it is not yet necessarily sufficient. In fact, the war is continuing, more destructive than ever. More than seven years of armed aggression have resulted in the death a 3 injury of more than a million civilians or military personnel, most of them innocent young people, whole cities have been laid waste by attacks from the air and incessant bombardments. There has been repeated use of chemical weapons, inflicting atrocious suffering, in flagrant violation of the Geneva Protocol of 1925. We should unreservedly condemn their use. \nThe war is tearing apart two peoples who are the heirs of ancient and outstanding civilizations. It has sown disquiet and caused social divisions in a number of Arab countries, and even beyond the Arab world. Because of the risks that it might spread - the tragic incidents in Mecca are proof of that - the conflict now threatens international freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf, requiring the intervention of friendly and allied countries to safeguard free passage in those International sea lanes. I join all those who have expressed encouragement of the Secretary-General's action, which is continuing, in close consultation with the Security Council, with the aim of securing acceptance by the two parties of the Security Council resolution, which alone is capable of leading to a comprehensive, just and honourable settlement. \nThe call for the holding of an international conference on the Middle East has created a momentum which returns to the United Nations the initiative in the search for a comprehensive solution. It has become evident that this is the only forum capable of setting in motion and successfully completing a genuine peace process in the region. My country, with the other member States of the Community, supports such a conference. The consultations conducted by the Secretary-General with all the parties concerned and with the members of the Security Council strengthen our belief that holding an international peace conference under United Nations auspices has now gained an increasingly broad measure of support, as there is no alternative to a negotiated solution. We hope that the consultations will be continued and intensified. \nThe twelve States members of the Community have several times set out the principles on which a just and comprehensive solution should be based. I refer in particular to the Declaration they made in Venice in 1988. It was based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which set forth in particular the principle of withdrawal from all the territories occupied during the 1967 conflict. The Declaration also emphasizes the principle of the right to existence and security of all States in the region, particularly the State o Israel, as well as equality of treatment for all peoples, which implies recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. \nI am convinced that the remaining resistance, in Israel and elsewhere, \u0437 the idea of this international conference will eventually be overcome, and that consequently the chance of a negotiated settlement will at long last be take. However, we view with the gravest concern the present situation in Lebanon, a country that has been bled dry and torn apart by 10 years of civil war and f reign occupation. The regular eruption of violence continues relentlessly, with I s macabre procession of bombardments, hostage-taking, massacre of innocents, a d inter-communal strife. Only by ensuring reconciliation between its different communities will Lebanon be able to recover its sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity. Like the Secretary-General, I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to the United Nations peace-keeping forces, which, in Lebanon as elsewhere, continuing to supervise - despite a heavy toll of dead and Injured - the separation of the parties concerned and the maintenance of a truce which, in the absence of a definitive settlement, continues to be precarious. \nIn South Africa the situation continues to be extremely serious and explosive. The white minority Government is committed to maintaining the system of apartheid, which is in many ways a cause of shame to mankind. Since the elections of 6 May all the promises of reform seem to have been forgotten. There is no sign of any fundamental change, and no willingness to engage in dialogue has emerged. The state of emergency continues\u00b7 Thousands of people remain in detention without trial censorship is constantly being intensified. Externally, South Africa rides roughshod over the sovereignty of neighbouring countries. It is continuing the illegal occupation of Namibia. My Government unreservedly condemns this policy and these actions of South Africa.\nIn 1985, under the presidency of Luxembourg, and again in 1986 the countries of the European Community enacted a number of measures designed to punish the Pretoria Government for its repressive policy towards the black majority. Those measures are reviewed and where appropriate strengthened in the light of developments in the situation. The Assembly and the Security Council should act likewise. Above all, the international community should respond to the desire to retain apartheid not with ineffective steps and disunity, but with a determination to demand its total and irreversible elimination. The pressure of the international community must also be brought to bear unrelentingly to end the flagrant and systematic violations of human rights in many other countries. Here I refer in particular to the situation in Chile, whose people have now been unjustly deprived of democracy, freedom and fundamental human rights for 14 years. \nThe world economic situation continues to give rise to grave concern. Wherever one looks, economic growth is still slow and inadequate. The world's gross domestic product grew by only 3 per cent in 1986, and prospects for 1987 and later are not much better, especially in view of the 1.6 per cent per annum growth of world population. In the northern hemisphere - that is, in the industrialized countries - the situation is in most cases reflected by the persistence of high rates of unemployment, marked external imbalances and, here and there, profound and painful restructuring. \nIn the Southern hemisphere, we note that development has been severely hindered by a number of factors; exceptionally low and unstable commodity prices, a deterioration in exchange terms, a drop in export earnings, increasingly crushing debt servicing, and obstacles to trade. In addition, adjustment policies often cause a worsening of already precarious living conditions, particularly for the most deprived sectors of the people of those countries. \nGenerally speaking, the gap between the developed and the developing countries is becoming wider rather than narrower. In particular, the per capita income in the industrialized countries - both East and West - grew by about 3.5 per cent in 1986, whereas it declined by about 4 per cent in the developing countries. Of course, all those percentages are average figures; that tends to blur not only the disparities between countries but also the inequalities within many countries themselves. \nGiven that gloomy picture, the countries that took part in the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII), held two months ago in Geneva, reached a consensus which I welcome. They proved able to show moderation and realism - I would go so far as to say a new sense of individual and collective responsibility. In that regard, I draw attention to the conduct of the countries with Communist regimes, which, for the first time in history, associated themselves with the analysis of the other participants. In particular, I must emphasize the positive action of the People's Republic of China. That country distinguished itself at UNCTAD VII - as, indeed, it has done in other spheres - by its moderating and constructive efforts, which redounded to the greatest benefit of all the participants. \nThe conclusions reached by that Conference do not of course, provide any miraculous solutions with direct, short-term effects. They do, however, involve the acceptance of fundamental principles which are dictated by the mounting interdependence of economies and respect for which is a pre-condition for the general resumption of growth, development and international trade. \nIt is also to be hoped that the new financial and structural solidarity that is envisaged will be quickly given concrete form and that the commitments entered into by all concerned will be sufficiently precise to make possible the creation of the environment necessary to bring about recovery. The multilateral trade negotiations now going on, which are designed to ensure a greater opening up of markets, will provide an initial response in that regard. \nGrowth is without doubt a necessary condition for the improvement of living standards in all countries, particularly the developing countries. Each of them, of course, must bear the primary responsibility for its own development. None the less, I venture to state that a development policy of some depth must devote equal attention to the effective participation of all the people, the distribution of national income, and the social effects thereof. There are clear reasons of justice for that - and also the fundamental idea that development cannot be imposed. \nIn conclusion, let me state again - if there is really a need to do so - our commitment to the Organization. How can we still doubt that the United Nations system is irreplaceable, when we consider the crucial role played, for example, by the Security Council in such questions as the Iran-Iraq war, the Middle East, Afghanistan and the search for solutions in Cambodia and Cyprus? Can we still afford the luxury of a multilateral crisis when we realize the outstanding service rendered to peace day and night by United Nations forces in various flashpoints around the world? Can we afford the luxury of a crisis at a time when we want to see international action strengthened in order to secure universal respect for human rights? Can we afford the luxury of a crisis when countless economic and ecological challenges make sustained international co-operation more essential with the passing of each day? \nIn that spirit, I would refer to the remarkable report just published by the international Commission presided over by the Norwegian Prime Minister, Mrs, Gro Harlem Brundtland, which shows how very alarming is the state of the world environment as well as its grave consequences for future development. These problems, transcending national boundaries, require deep thought and vigorous action, which can be harmonized only at the international level. \nIt therefore seems to me most desirable to find a solution as soon as possible to the financial crisis of the United Nations, which not only paralyses our work but also undermines confidence. The legal commitments solemnly subscribed to in regard to this Organization, just like the primacy of international law, require this of all of us. The necessary restructuring undertaken by the Secretary-General in implementation of the relevant resolution, which was adopted unanimously, must be encouraged and quickly completed. \nForty-two years ago the United Nations was established in America, this welcoming land of democracy where we meet each year with so much pleasure. This time, I have deliberately focused my remarks on the more realistic and more pragmatic new trends in international relations. It is for us, together and in solidarity, to make the United Nations a more coherent, more integrated and better-structured centre where the efforts of all nations to ensure prosperity can be more effectively harmonized. Without this, there cannot be a more secure, and therefore all-encompassing, peace. Finally, I would refer to the annual report on the work of the Organization that the Secretary-General has just submitted to us. I share very broadly the assessment made in it of the serious international problems. I therefore readily endorse the following relevant and deeply poetic words used by the Secretary-General in describing the present international context; \n\u201cIt is as if the sails of the small boat in which all the people of the earth are gathered had caught again, in the midst of a perilous sea, a light but favourable wind. ... [But] our global vessel will need skilful piloting and the assistance of dedicated oarsmen to navigate the many shoals and reach safe landfall in the next century\\\". (A/42/1, p. 2) \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst, Sir, I should like to extend my congratulations to you on your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Your election is a deserved tribute to your admirable diplomatic qualities and also a vote of confidence in your country. My delegation intends to co-operate fully with you as you guide the work of this Assembly.  To your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, we extend our most sincere appreciation for the able manner in which he presided over the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr, Javier Perez de Cuellar, has steered the ship of this Organization during very stormy weather and has done so splendidly. We is deserving of our unreserved praise and support. We welcome his report on the work of the Organization. The Secretary-General has ably outlined the problems, opportunities and challenges that lie ahead as we begin the forty-second session of the General Assembly. We sincerely hope that his important ideas will receive the serious consideration they deserve in the days to follow, as the Assembly tackles the items on its agenda.\nAs we meet today, impulses for peace have quickened when compared to the position prevailing at the inauguration of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. Encouraging, if tentative and rather tantalizing, signs of a relaxation, of tension between super-Powers and on the international stage in general are discernible. Yet much too much is still unresolved for us to say peace is here at last. The international situation remains volatile and explosive and much can still go amiss. For that reason we should take very seriously the Secretary-General's words when he states that;\n\\\"Even if the favourable wind felt this year prevails, our global vessel will need skilful piloting and the assistance of dedicated oarsmen to navigate the many shoals and reach safe landfall in the next century.\\\" (A/42/1, p.2)\nFor us to profit from the present thaw, it is necessary that we take every advantage of the possibilities before us to create an environment conducive to the search for peace world-wide. This forty-second session of the General Assembly provides us with one such opportunity. Let us seize and exploit it to the fullest possible extent.\nOur deliberations this session could not have started on a more auspicious note than that provided by the announcement two weeks ago by the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of an agreement in principle for the global elimination of land-based intermediate nuclear forces (INF). We welcome this positive development. It is the first time an agreement actually to reduce existing arsenals of nuclear forces has been made. It is therefore an important psychological breakthrough, not only because it will demonstrate, as we have always argued, that a reduction of armaments can actually create a sense of greater security among nations, but also because it will, we are convinced, expose the fallacy of trying to seek security in the arms race. We hope that, when signed and ratified, the INF agreement will give fresh impetus to continuing negotiations on other broader areas of disarmament aimed at the halting of the arms race, nuclear disarmament and ultimately general and complete disarmament. We urge the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union and, indeed, of all other nuclear-weapon States to seize these possibilities of our times, to proceed to agree on a moratorium on nuclear testing as a first step towards the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty and the reduction and eventual elimination of strategic nuclear missiles.\n\nWe urge the Conference on Disarmament to redouble its efforts to ensure the early conclusion of the convention banning the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. The use of chemical weapons is already proscribed by the 1925 Geneva Protocol. However, it is our conviction that the mere possession of such weapons inevitably leads to their use. It is for that reason that we seek their total elimination.\nOuter space is the common heritage of mankind and must be used for practical purposes and for the benefit of all peoples. It should not become yet another frontier to be conquered in the armaments race, neither should it become another repository for implements of death and destruction. A weapon-free outer space is possible if all States forgo the so-called defensive option and commit themselves to the dialogue for general and complete disarmament. We call on the Conference on Disarmament to hasten negotiations aimed at the conclusion of agreements on the prevention of the extension of the arms race into outer space. Meanwhile, strict adherence by all parties to the already existing international legal instruments on space weapons, including the 1986 outer space Treaty and the 1972 anti-ballistic missile Treaty, would prevent the extension of the arms race Into outer space.\nIn spite of the gains that have been made in a number of areas of disarmament, our world is far from being safe; the future of mankind is far from ensured. The prevention of nuclear war remains the most urgent task of our times and a pre-condition for all our endeavours. It Is Imperative that disarmament negotiations in the various multilateral forums be facilitated for the sake of the survival of mankind. It is for that reason that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries believes that the convening of a third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament could give the necessary political impetus to negotiations in various forums aimed at the elimination of the threat of nuclear weapons. We therefore urge the forty-second session of the General Assembly to decide on the specific dates for the convening of the special session. \nThe convening of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development in August-September this year was an event of major significance. Viewed against the background of the seemingly unbridgeable differences and the dire prediction that the Conference was doomed to failure, the adoption of a consensus document after three weeks of serious negotiations was a victory for multilateralism. It was a testimony to the willingness of States to work peacefully together without intimidation or threats. This consensus may have fallen short of the expectations of many of us but we take comfort from the fact that a foundation-stone upon which we shall build has been laid. In a world in which global military expenditures now run at approximately $2 million a minute and threaten to burst the 31-tr ill ion-\u0430-year barrier, the staggering opportunity-cost in terms of human needs not met, retarded and distorted economic growth or lost opportunities for constructive co-operation can no longer be ignored. The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries looks forward to the consideration of this important item during this session of the General Assembly and the third special session devoted to disarmament.\nThe gradual revival of multilateralism was evident not only during the recent Conference on disarmament and development but also at Geneva during the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The convening of UNCTAD VII against a background of uncertainty in the international economic environment and the adoption by consensus of the Final Act represents yet another victory for multilateralism.\nIt has opened up new possibilities for progress in economic negotiations, particularly on the interrelated issues of money# finance, external debt and trade and development. The signature or ratification of the Commodity Fund Agreement by many more States during the UNCTAD meeting has brought the Common Fund for Commodities closer to fruition. The consensus reached in the areas of external debt and financial resource flows, though limited in scope, nevertheless opened new avenues that need further exploration during this session of the General Assembly. We in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, having participated actively in the evolution of the consensus at Geneva, stand ready to co-operate fully in exploring these new opportunities.\nSimilarly, we hope to build on the consensus resolution, 41/202, adopted at the forty-first session, which recognized that the external debt crisis had already reached dangerous proportions and that an integrated approach involving creditor and debtor nations, multilateral financial institutions and international private banks was necessary if durable solutions were to be found to the debt problem. We welcome the growing realization in some quarters in the industrialized creditor countries that the case-by-case approach cannot provide a viable solution to the debt crisis. We are concerned at suggestions that seem to indicate that the free play of blind market forces alone can correct the imbalances in the international system by a process of automatic adjustment.\nThe long-term solution to the debt problem lies in the adoption of a comprehensive set of measures recognizing, inter alia, the need for growth in the debtor countries, for stability of commodity prices, for the halting of reverse transfer of resources from developing to developed countries and for the reinitiating of financial resource flows to developing countries with a view to achieving the official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product, as agreed in the International Development Strategy, and the official development assistance target of 1.5 per cent of gross national product for the least developed countries as agreed in the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s\u00b7 We in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries believe that they are convening of an international conference on money and finance, with universal participation and aimed at meeting the development and financing requirements of the international economy, particularly those of the developing countries, is already long overdue. We therefore urge the forty-second session of the General Assembly to examine further the possibilities of setting in motion the preparatory process for the convening of such a conference without further delay.\nA little over a year ago the United Nations General Assembly, in recognition of the critical economic situation on the African continent, convened a special session for the purpose of mobilizing international support for Africa's efforts towards recovery and development. The partnership for development that emerged then between the international community and Africa under the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 held out hope of a promising future for Africa. Regrettably, that hope has been largely unfulfilled. The debt crisis, the collapse of commodity prices and stagnating resource flows to Africa continue to place obstacles on Africa's path to recovery. As if that were not enough, many of the commitments made by the international community have not been translated into concrete action in terms of increasing resource flows to Africa. It is therefore imperative that this session of the General Assembly explore new avenues for making available additional financial resources for Africa's development, in accordance with the commitments made during the special session, so as to avoid further deterioration of the situation in that part of the world. \nThe non-aligned countries are determined to play their part through the enhancement of programmes for economic co-operation among developing countries. In June this year the members of the Movement had the opportunity to meet in Pyongyang, in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in an Extraordinary Ministerial Meeting devoted solely to South-South co-operation. Action-oriented measures aimed at giving a new push to economic co-operation among developing countries were taken. We therefore call upon the United Nations to give all the necessary support, through its appropriate machinery, to these South-South programmes for co-operation.\nThe interrelated nature of the issues of the environment and development is no longer a question for debate. We therefore welcome the findings in the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, released earlier this year. We hope that the report will awaken the consciousness of the international community to the need for the mobilization of resources to enable developing countries to pursue long-term strategies harmonizing environmental considerations with developmental objectives.\nIn addition to the challenges of disarmament and economic development, the international scene is still characterized by a number of focal points of tension. These crises distract the parties concerned from their priorities of socio-economic development and aggravate international tension. It is therefore essential that they be resolved, if international peace and security is to be assured. In this regard the signing of the Guatemala agreement by the five Central American Presidents in August this year is a most welcome development, promising a future of . hope and peace not only in Central America but also in the whole Latin American and \u013c Caribbean region, and indeed for all mankind. \nIn August this year I had the privilege of leading a nine-member delegation of the Standing Committee on Central America of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries; on a mission to Managua and Caracas. On that occasion we had the opportunity of meeting the Foreign Ministers of the countries of the Contadora and Support Groups, to deliver a message of support for the peace process in Central America from the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Wherever we went, whether Managua, Caracas or Panama, we were greeted by ordinary men and women whose only desire for their countries and their region was peace - peace to enable them to live with each other in harmony and friendship, peace to enable them to channel their energies into the socio-economic development of their countries, peace to give them a chance of hope for a brighter future for their little ones. Among those men and women in Nicaragua, Panama and Venezuela one could not fail to feel and sense an air of great expectation and hope and, above all, an overwhelming desire for peace. The people of Central America have dared to dream dreams which some of us are too cynical and too afraid even to think of.\nCentral America would like to give peace a chance. Let us give the countries of that region an opportunity to give peace a chance. We have already heard some of the leaders of the subregion presenting their case before this international body from this rostrum. We shall be hearing others in the days to come. But what can this body do by way of response? How shall we respond to those eloquent appeals for peace? I believe that the international community should, first, unreservedly, openly and forcefully declare its support for the Guatemala agreement; secondly, solemnly call on all nations not to do anything that might undermine this very important agreement; thirdly, urge member countries to give increased financial support to Central America so that the subregion may address the economic and social problems resulting from years of economic disruption and neglect; and finally, give full support to the efforts of the Secretary-General in this regard and urge him to continue to fulfil his mandate to assist in every possible way in the implementation of the Guatemala agreement. Surely the minimum that we can do to demonstrate our support for this unique and daring regional Initiative is adopt a resolution embodying these elements.\nThe deteriorating situation in the Middle East is a cause of great concern on the part of the international community. Earlier this year it seemed as though a consensus on the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East was at long last within our reach. Indeed, the Secretary-General's interim report (A/42/277, para. 6) noted encouraging signs of \\\"increased interest on the part of the international community in the idea of a [Middle East] conference\\\" and \\\"indications of greater flexibility on this issue amongst the parties\\\" directly concerned.\nIt was in an effort further to promote the early convening of the international conference on peace in the Middle East that the Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries called for a special ministerial meeting of the Non-Aligned Committee on Palestine, in Harare in April this year, to review international developments in the light Of General Assembly resolution 41/43 D of December 1986. A week later there was the historic Algiers meeting of the Palestinian National Council, which enhanced the unity of the Palestinian people, thus preparing them to be effective participants in the Middle East conference. Since that time the non-aligned countries have been engaged in consultations with the President of the Security Council, the Secretary-General and all the members of the Security Council in an effort to bring about the convening of the conference. We are still awaiting the Secretary-General's final report on the prospects for such a conference. In the meantime we appeal to the friends of the Tel Aviv regime to come out in the open in support of the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East. We urge them to make it clear to Israel that the international community cannot accept its continued veto of the convening of the Conference. We all know of course, that Israel does listen to its friends: for - as the French saying goes - c'est la vie and alas, the \\\"Lavi\\\" is no more. We urge the Security Council to meet as soon as the Secretary-General presents his final report so that it may take the necessary measures to bring about the convening of this important Conference.\nThe return of peace and stability to the troubled Gulf region must receive our undivided attention. In this connection, we welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to restore peace in that part of the world. We urge Iran and Iraq to heed the call of the international community to put an immediate end to this fratricidal war, which should not have been. But, equally, we are opposed to the introduction of forces alien to the region, as these can only aggravate the tension there. We therefore call for the removal of such alien forces from the Gulf.\nThe situation in southern Africa continues to threaten international peace and security. The past year has proved, for all to see, that the Pretoria regime has no intention of dismantling the immoral system of apartheid. Quite to the contrary: the racist regime has intensified its campaign of terror against the oppressed masses of South Africa in defence of its heinous system. The situation has deteriorated badly, as can be seen from the re-imposition of a state of emergency; the muzzling of the press; the radical lurch to the right in white politics; and the systematic and unrelenting campaign of torture, assassination and detention and arrests of children, women, workers and opponents of apartheid. An age of darkness has descended upon that benighted country. It is clear that Pretoria has lost respect for or feat of a divided international community, it has taken comfort in the complicity of those countries which have used their vetoes in the Security Council to shield it from the wrath of the international community. It is necessary that Pretoria be left in no doubt that it is a pariah because of its obnoxious policies. But what can be done now to get our message across? it is my humble suggestion that we need to follow a two-track strategy. The first should be to examine the possibility of the setting up of an international mechanism to monitor and report on the implementation of the various packages of sanctions already agreed to by the international community. That will introduce an element of heightened accountability. Secondly, we should demand that the United States, the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany desist forthwith from shielding South Africa in the Security Council, and we should call upon the Security Council to impose immediate comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa.\nThe international community has a special responsibility to bring Namibia to independence. The time has long passed for it to discharge that duty. In August this year the apartheid regime unleashed a vicious campaign of terror in the Territory. It has flooded the Territory with over 100,000 armed troops to terrorize the tiny population of Namibia. Arrests, disappearances, detention without trial, murder and assassination have become the regime's methods to coerce the population into submission. Churches and schools have been demolished, often fire-bombed, at the slightest suspicion that their followers are sympathetic to the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). Trade unions and other popular movements are under siege. Namibia today is the definition of hell on earth for its inhabitants.\t \nThe international community has an obligation to respond, and to do so urgently and decisively. Namibia is not free because Pretoria continues to occupy it illegally in order to protect apartheid in South Africa. Namibia's independence is delayed because the United States has linked the achievement of independence by Namibia to the removal of Cuban troops from Angola. Namibia's independence is therefore now a hostage to the interests of the United States. The responsibility of all of us is to try to convince the United States that blackmail and hostage-taking are wrong, no matter the victim or the perpetrator. We should consider taking a series of direct steps to fulfil our obligations to the people of Namibia. First, we should expose and condemn the reign of terror in Namibia both through the media and by appropriate action in the General Assembly and the Security Council, as need be. Secondly, we should now trigger the process of implementing resolution 435 (1978) through the Security Council. And finally, should that fail, we should consider other, alternative approaches within the provisions of the Charter - and there are many - to bring Namibia to independence.\nThe front-line States and States neighbouring Pretoria have suffered much of late as a result of Pretoria's increased destabilization activities. We therefore call on the international community to render increased material assistance to those States, in order to help them to resist Pretoria's aggression. In this connection, we appeal for increased support for the AFRICA Fund (Action for Resisting Innovation, Colonialism and Apartheid Fund) , established by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at Harare last year for the purpose of assisting those States\u2019 Focal points of tension are, unfortunately, found in many other parts of the world. The independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and non-aligned status of Cyprus need our full support. That beautiful island and its warm and wonderful people can never know peace while foreign troops are on the island and continue to increase in number. The present stalemate is fraught with danger. It is important for the international community to examine, if need be in a more formal setting, what further actions it could take to bring peace to Cyprus.\nWe are likewise concerned that the aspirations of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their country remain unfulfilled. It is our belief that this objective can best be realized through dialogue and consultations between North and South, without any foreign interference, and in conformity with the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity set forth in the North-South Joint Statement of 4 July 1972. For this purpose, it is essential that all foreign troops be withdrawn from the area.\nThe situations prevailing in Afghanistan and Kampuchea are sources of serious concern to the international community. With regard to these conflicts, we stress the importance of the principles of non-interference and non-intervention in the affairs of sovereign States and the inadmissibility of the use of force against sovereign States. The people of Afghanistan and Kampuchea have the right to determine their own destiny, free from foreign interference or coercion. There can be no justification, in any circumstances whatsoever, for foreign interference or intervention in the internal affairs of these or any other States. These are sacred principles on which the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries can never compromise. We commend the Secretary-General's efforts to find a peaceful settlement of these conflicts, and call upon all concerned to co-operate with biro in this regard.\nThe right of all peoples to self-determination and independence is a sacred tenet of our Organization, enshrined in resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960. When we look at the 159 members of our body and recall that the overwhelming majority of them were formerly colonies, we can be justifiably proud of our record. This success should not, however, distract us from the imperative need to complete the task we set for ourselves through the resolution. The broad surge towards freedom and independence, which began before 1960 and carried on through the 1970s, seems to have ebbed, and we appear to be at a stage at which the forces of resurgent colonialism and imperialism are gathering strength and retrenching themselves to oppose humanity's impulse towards freedom. The cases of Namibia, Sahraoui, New Caledonia, Puerto Rico, Micronesia and other dependent Territories are a constant reminder that our battle for the self-determination and national independence of peoples is still unfinished. We demand the immediate implementation of resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant United Nations resolutions in all these cases.\nThe importance of the United Nations can hardly be overemphasized. It is the one truly universal body representing the free association of States on the basis of sovereign equality and reflecting the hopes and aspirations of all peoples all over the world. We cannot therefore accept the undermining of its role. By circumventing it, by blocking its capacity to function and, recently, by trying to manipulate it through the withholding of funds, certain States have sought to erode the authority of the United Nations. If there is waste in the running of the Organization, we would be glad to see it corrected and the resultant savings put to better use. If the United Nations can be run more efficiently, all the better. But what we will not countenance are attempts to hijack the Organization and subvert its democratic character through the withholding of assessed contributions - itself a delinquent act and a violation of obligations under the Charter.\nThis is our Organization. As a universal Organization, it must hearken to a kaleidoscopic constituency. Misguided attempts to make it monochromatic and serve special Interests can only detract from its noble goals and eventually lead to its demise. For the United Nations addresses a complex reality, and that reality win not become simpler merely through pretence that it is so.\nA very real tragedy that has befallen our Organization is the view of certain States that they can reduce it to a mere rubber-stamp for their individual policies through the buying of votes. Some have even pursued the strategy of keeping registers of those who vote \\\"with them\\\" or \\\"against them\\\" in this forum, with the object of using that information as a yardstick by which to judge to whom they shall give or refuse aid. We deprecate this debasement of the United Nations through attempts to turn it into an auction floor where votes go to the highest bidder. We are here, not to vote for or against any country, but to take decisions on issues - based on principles, for that matter. Therefore, if judge we must,: then let us judge each other by the degree of faithfulness to the principles of the Charter. If a register be kept, then by all means let it be kept right here at the United Nations, controlled by non-governmental people, comprising the best legal  political and social scientists of the day. Let them judge each one of us; according to how often the votes we cast are in accordance with, and seek to uphold, the principles of the Charter. Yes, let us get stars and incentives for our loyalty to the Charter, the instrument by which we have bound ourselves. This Organization can never be \\\"our\\\" United Nations as opposed to \\\"theirs\\\"; nor can it be \\\"theirs\\\" as opposed to \\\"ours\\\". Once we see it as \\\"ours\\\" f it will not serve \\\"them\\\", nor will it really serve \\\"us\\\". As \\\"theirs\\\", it will not serve \\\"us\\\" or \\\"them\\\". Only as the United Nations, meeting everybody's views in part and forcing compromise from all, will it serve anyone at all.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nPermit me first to congratulate you,, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly, I am confident that your skills and ability, as exemplified by your illustrious career, will lead this session to significant results.\nI wish to take this opportunity to express my delegations appreciation of your predecessor/ Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, for the effective manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the forty-first session of the General Assembly..\nWe wish also to express our support for the untiring efforts of our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, sometimes despite serious setbacks, to find solutions to the many conflicts in the world today. No lasting solutions can be achieved without a genuine effort of peaceful co-operation by all United Nations Member States.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is a small eastern Caribbean State. Like many other States represented in this Assembly, my country is a product of the post-war decolonization process. We gained our independence in 1979 and were admitted to the United Nations in 1980. Our view of the world and the relations we have with other States have been fashioned by our history, our present circumstances and our perceptions of the world around us.\nIf representatives can picture in their minds a small, tropical island 133 square miles in area and approximately 40 other smaller islands stretching for 100 miles along the outer rim of the Caribbean Basin, they may be able to get an idea of the country I represent. The narrow coastal plain and interior mountain valleys on Saint Vincent, together with six of the Grenadine Islands, support a population of 110,000 vincentians. They should consider also a country in which half the population is under the age of 21, where unemployment is currently at about 30 per cent of the labour force and which three times during the past two years has seen its major export crops destroyed by tropical storms; a country without an international airport to service its most important sector, tourism. Those are some basic facts about my country.\nYet, the records of this Organization will be found to contain hardly any pleas from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for special attention. Forming part of the English-speaking Caribbean, a region characterized by long democratic traditions and the rule of law, we are a people which emerged just over two years ago from the institution of slavery and the plantation system, an even worse form of apartheid than that practised in South Africa today. Cut adrift from the metropolitan Power by the stormy winds of decolonization and without adequate preparation or economic safeguards, we have been forced to draw upon our own spiritual reserves and resourcefulness to survive.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is governed at the present time by the New Democratic Party, under the leadership of our Prime Minister, the Right Honourable James Pitz-Allen Mitchell. In presenting the annual budget in Parliament two months ago, the Prime Minister analysed the problems facing the country in the year ahead and concluded his address as follows;\n\\\"my Government is anticipating that the new year will be a better one for the people of this country. With it will come new challenges and major decisions, but we are a country of bright, energetic and ambitious people and I am confident that the right decisions will be taken at the right time.\\\" Notwithstanding the difficulties we face as a country, there are occasional rays of hope, such as, for example, the International Monetary Fund's June 1987 consultation report on Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, which states; \\\"In the last few years Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has achieved a major improvement in public finances, which has facilitated a marked recovery in the financial position of the State-owned National Commercial Bank and a considerable strengthening in the country's external position.\\\"\n\\\"Peace and Justice\\\" is the motto which Saint Vincent and the Grenadines adopted over a century ago. It is not surprising therefore that the United Nations, with the Charter as its centre-piece, holds special significance for my Government and people, for the ideals which the Charter seeks to promote are, indeed, peace and justice. \nThis Organization, is one born of bitter wartime experiences and human suffering. Coming into existence 43 years ago, it then represented, and still embodies today, man's highest aspirations and goals. In the Charter are crystallized mankind's highest ideals, such as the sanctity of life, the dignity and worth of the individual, peace, freedom and social and economic justice. The Charter of the United Nations is the outstanding achievement of our century, and my delegation believes that, now as we approach the twenty-first century, man's best hope of survival lies in his ability to transform the Charter from a mere legal instrument into a living and dynamic principle enshrined in our legal systems and in our hearts.\nPeace is a basic condition necessary for achieving the fruits of civilization. To the degree that the arras race and geopolitical and regional conflicts and tensions exist, to that same degree we fail to achieve the goals of progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. There is a direct relationship between peace and development and, as a corollary, between disarmament and development. Not many deny this.\nMy delegation, like all other delegations represented in this Assembly, therefore welcomes the recent announcement by the United States of America and the Soviet Union of an agreement in principle for the global elimination of land-based Intermediate nuclear weapons. We hope that this historic agreement between the super-Powers represents the first sign on the horizon of a new day in which there will be complete elimination of all nuclear missiles, both intermediate and strategic, and that it will usher in an era of peace on this planet so satiated with war.\nNotwithstanding this un-seasonal thaw in relations between the super-Powers, the international situation remains very volatile and explosive. It is imperative that the present momentum be maintained in order to bring about a more lasting easing of global tension.\nIn my own region  the signing of the Guatemala Agreement in August of this year by the five Presidents of Central America is a most welcome and encouraging development. The Costa Rican initiative based on the invaluable work of the Contadora and its Support Groups deserves our fullest support.\nMy country also welcomes the Cartagena Protocol signed last year in the Republic of Colombia, which opens the way for the Caribbean countries of Guyana and Belize to become members of the Organization of American States.\nThe war in the Gulf region between Iran and Iraq cries out for a peaceful solution. We support the Secretary-General in his efforts to find such a solution and we call on Iran and Iraq to heed the call of the international community and abide by the terms of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) for a cease-fire and to put an end eventually to the senseless slaughter.\nMy delegation notes the increased interest on the part of the international community in the idea of a conference on the Middle East. The basis of a Middle East settlement already exists in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) . This must include the right of all States in the region, including Israel, to exist within secure boundaries; the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including the right to establish a State of their own; and the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied since 1967.\nAfghanistan and Kampuchea still remain under foreign occupation. My delegation supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to find a solution to the problem of Afghanistan. We are also encouraged by the increasing contacts and ongoing dialogue between the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and Viet Nam and the various groups in Kampuchea. Afghanistan and Kampuchea, both of them small countries, still remain the victims of aggression and illegal occupation by larger, more powerful neighbours. This is unacceptable to the international community, and my delegation joins in the international consensus calling for withdrawal of all foreign troops from those countries. The Afghans and Kampucheans have the right to determine their destinies free from foreign interference or coercion.\nMy delegation sees the need for increasing dialogue between North and South Korea. Only dialogue and negotiation will lead to a reconciliation of the views of the two parties. It is imperative that the deeply rooted mistrust between the two Koreas be replaced with understanding and good will, which are surely not beyond the capacity of a people with different ideologies but whose culture is more than 5000 years old.\nWe support the efforts of the Secretary-General in helping the two Cypriot communities to find a just solution to the problem of Cyprus without foreign intervention.\nWe believe also that a negotiated settlement is the only acceptable solution to the question of the Malvinas Islands.\nThere can be no lasting peace in a world without development or a world in which economic inequalities exist. The current global recession has created a number of problems which are very destabilizing to developing countries, especially to small open economies like those of the island States of the eastern Caribbean. The international economy is going through a period of deep structural change, and solutions will have to be found for thorny problems such as the debt crisis, unbalanced terms of trade, international monetary instability, and unacceptably high levels of unemployment in developing countries. \nThere is need for an integrated approach to those problems. The solutions adopted must be such that all countries, large and small, might benefit from the new technologies and possibilities of our times. Encouraging signs in this direction are the recently concluded seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Uruguay Round launched in Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986.\nA strange anomaly of our time is the global waste of precious resources on armaments while millions everywhere suffer from illiteracy and poverty and die from malnutrition and starvation. The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development held in New York in August and September of this year reminded us of these hard realities. This is a moral problem that strikes at the very roots of human survival. Instead of expenditures on arms, there is an urgent need to allocate these resources to the eradication of hunger and disease, including the deadly threat of AIDS (acquired immune-deficiency syndrome), and to finding solutions to pressing problems relating to the environment. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines will support all initiatives at the current session of the General Assembly aimed at putting these issues into perspective.\nThere is a new initiative among the eastern Caribbean States for political and economic integration, in an attempt to harness our very limited resources to provide a better standard of living for our peoples. Serious consideration is being given at the moment to unification as a strategy for development in the subregion. The advantages to be derived from such a union in terms of increasing returns within a widening scope of activities are obvious. The true goal of human endeavour is development and happiness. All our efforts at the national and international levels should have as their aim, as stated in the Charter of the United Nations, the reaffirmation of our faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small.\nNo greater denial or abuse of these rights exists today than that inherent in the monstrous practice of apartheid by the racist regime in South Africa. This is an issue which continues to threaten international peace and security. South Africa has no intention of dismantling the immoral system of apartheid. It has intensified its campaign of terror and brutality against the oppressed masses within its own borders and in surrounding States. The situation is becoming more and more explosive. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines joins with the international community in calling for comprehensive, mandatory sanctions against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter.\nThe Saint Vincent and the Grenadines delegation equally condemns the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa and calls for the immediate independence of Namibia through implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).\nMy delegation condemns all assaults on the rights of man, whether social or political in nature, and condemns all forms of intolerance whether they are based on religion, colour or class.\nFinally, my delegation congratulates you, Mr. President, on the success of this debate and pledges its fullest support to you for the remainder of the present session of the General Assembly. We should free ourselves from the notion that the United Nations has failed; it has registered considerable success in a variety of areas of international co-operation. While it cannot perhaps negotiate for the world, it can help the world to negotiate. History has saddled us with a heavy burden and responsibility, and as we look towards the twenty-first century, we should redouble our efforts to achieve the goals and ideals enshrined in the United Nations Charter of peace, development, happiness and love for all mankind. The task before us is far too great to waste any more time. We must act now.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr, President, at this forty-second session, reflecting as it does the maturity of our Organization, it is fitting that the General Assembly should have honoured one of its most deserving servants who has devoted much of his diplomatic career to the United Nations. Hence, I am particularly pleased to congratulate you warmly on this honour, which is indeed the highlight of all the work you have done for the international community. This election means that our Assembly will enjoy the invaluable assistance of one of its most faithful supporters, a prestigious witness to both its difficulties and its greatness. As representative of a divided country, you can better than anyone else comprehend the horrors and consequences of conflicts and wars that have torn mankind apart and remain the basic raison d'etre of the United Nations. I assure you. Sir, of the full co-operation of my delegation both within the General Committee of the forty-second session - of which Zaire is a member - and throughout your term of office as President of the General Assembly.\nMy delegation wishes to express its gratitude to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury whose well-known experience and diplomatic talents contributed so much to the successful conclusion of the General Assembly's work at a particularly difficult time. The delegation of Zaire is very pleased to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whose ability, resolve and courage have earned him his reputation as a man who is committed to defending the cause of our Organization. From the excellent report he has presented to us and the various dangerous missions he has carried out on behalf of this Organization, it is evident that as he begins his second term of office he is endeavouring to give this Organization the renewed impetus and vigour necessary for a rational operation.\nHe is supported by another great diplomat, Mr. Joseph Verner Reed, virtuous great human and social qualities we all recognize and whom we all know as a most affable person, and whom I should like to congratulate on his appointment as Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs. My delegation is convinced that the new team will prove to be extremely effective. In the great undertaking of the reforms now under way, the Secretary-General can be assured of the support and contribution of Zaire.\nAs the forty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations opens, many conflicts and hotbeds of tension and imbalances of all kinds characterize the world scene. Some States Members of this Organization, far from being inspired by the ideals, objectives and lofty goals enshrined in its Charter ~ particularly those that concern the maintenance of international peace and security, the development of friendly relations between nations based on respect for the principle of the equal rights of peoples, the territorial integrity of States and the attainment of international co-operation - have persevered in making demands that create threats to international peace and security.\nAt the same time, the most acute crises afflict much of mankind in the form of drought, famine, wretchedness and poverty. According to statistics made public on 11 July 1987 by the United Nations, some 5 billion human beings face challenges that are world-wide rather than national in scope and that amply justify the concerns being expressed by all Member States in this forum, the General Assembly of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations, as catalyst for the contemporary values, is thus called upon to seek by all means possible the emergence of an atmosphere of trust, peace and co-operation among all the nations of the world.\nFollowing the marking of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, that highest of objectives, the formation of a better world, must win the support of all Member states through a common resolve to apply Article 33 of the Charter, which calls on parties to any dispute likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security first of all to seek a solution through negotiation, mediation or other peaceful means of their own choice.\nIn this context commendable efforts have indeed been made by the General Assembly since the first special session on disarmament, held in 1978, whose ' conclusions, enshrined in its Final Document, should inspire all Member States of our Organization and be applied by them if we wish to save mankind from any danger of a nuclear holocaust.\nSecurity, an essential element of peace, has always been one of the most deeply felt aspirations of mankind. States have sought to preserve their security through the possession of weapons, and some have survived because they have had them. But in our time the build-up of weapons, particularly nuclear weapons, presents an even greater threat to international peace and security.\nThe second special session of the General Assembly on disarmament, held in 1982, had the merit of proposing a whole series of measures designed to speed up the process of general and complete disarmament through specific proposals in the form of a comprehensive programme of disarmament. The Conference on Disarmament, which meets in Geneva - my country is a member - has distinguished itself by preparing that programme under the leadership of an outstanding diplomat, a Nobel laureate. Ambassador Garcia Robles of Mexico,\nConsideration of that comprehensive programme of disarmament under agenda item 66 - and this was the programme submitted by the Conference on Disarmament - will enable the General Assembly to gauge the importance of the initiatives taken by the 40 members of the Conference on Disarmament. Moreover, at its thirty-ninth session, in resolution 39/160 of 17 December 1984, adopted without a vote, the General Assembly noted that world-wide military spending had acquired a staggering magnitude and that the global trend continued to be towards a faster rate of annual increase in those expenditures.\nAccordingly it decided to convene an International Conference with a view to establishing a close relationship between disarmament and development. That Conference, held recently in New York, from 24 August to 11 September, emphasized the international community's resolve to achieve disarmament and development as factors that strengthen international peace and security and promote prosperity.\nHowever they are two distinct processes, and the Assembly recognized that one should not slow down the development or evolution of the other, for development activities cannot wait for resources to be made available through disarmament. Moreover, disarmament has imperatives that are at variance with the objective of releasing resources for development. But, above all there is a close correlation between disarmament and development, which are linked by a multidimensional relationship.\nShould this close correlation between disarmament and development not encourage the nuclear Powers to ensure both the disarmament and development of underdeveloped countries and thus promote peace in the world? The special responsibilities incumbent on the nuclear Powers have been cited very often, particularly those of the two super-Powers to speed up the process of nuclear disarmament so that negotiations can be held with a view to the swift conclusion of the agreement limiting strategic weapons and the adoption of measures to prevent the unleashing of nuclear war and the use of force in international relations.\nAgainst this background, my delegation would join others in saying how pleased we were at the agreement concluded on 18 September 1987 in Washington between the two super-Powers with regard to the elimination of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. This indeed indicates noteworthy progress in a historic process of general and complete disarmament under effective international control.\nThe summit meeting of the super-Powers is therefore awaited with great interest with a view to the conclusion of the agreement that has now been achieved by the foreign ministers.\nIn addition to that agreement, my delegation would like to see other effective measures taken to prohibit or prevent the development, manufacture or use of other weapons of mass destruction, with high priority given to the conclusion of an agreement on the elimination of all chemical weapons. My delegation is convinced that at their summit meeting, the two super-Powers will be able to achieve further and more tangible results in working towards true nuclear disarmament.\nThus we will enter a new era of detente and optimism in the relations of trust between those two super-Powers which will lead all States towards a lessening of tension at the international level and will provide guarantees to States that do not have nuclear weapons that such weapons will not be used.\nWhile an atmosphere conducive to dialogue does prevail between the two super-Powers, this is unfortunately not the case in respect of the racial communities of South Africa, where that shameless system regarded by the United Nations as a crime against mankind - the policy of apartheid - still exists. That policy of racial discrimination denies the fundamental rights of the black majority population and thus runs counter to the most elementary principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. The heroic, harsh and difficult struggle to combat that hateful system means that the black people of South Africa are increasingly winning the sympathy of some white liberals who had an exchange of views with leaders of the African National Congress (ANC) on this problem at a meeting held recently at Dakar.\nThe mobilization of the working masses in the general strike that paralysed the economic structures of white power heightened the awareness of the black combatants that they were waging a legitimate and just cause.\nWhether it be the twenty-third summit of Heads of State or Government of the OAU or the Quebec Francophone Summit or the international forums that have considered this situation, all unanimously condemned the minority racist regime of South Africa and called upon it to enter immediately into a dialogue with the authentic representatives of the black people once apartheid had been dismantled and an end had been put to the state of emergency; once all the political prisoners had been released, beginning with Nelson Mandela; once the ban had been lifted on the ANC and other political organizations in that country.\nThe same applies to Namibia, which should long since have acceded to independence but which continues to be illegally occupied by the minority racist regime of South Africa, which established its system of apartheid there.\nThe violence and endless suffering endured by the people of Namibia have in no way diminished the spirit of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in its struggle to gain the freedom and independence to which Namibians are entitled.\nMy delegation would like to state again that implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the only valid basis for a settlement of the question of Namibia. It goes without saying that dismantling apartheid will not only enable Namibia to regain its independence, will not only enable the black majority of South Africa to belong to a democratic society not based on race, but it will also ensure that the independent front-line African States will not have to suffer from repeated acts of aggression, sabotage and destabilization carried out by the minority racist regime of South Africa.\nIn Central Africa, the people of Chad are still suffering aggression from a neighbouring African State which, since 1973, has been interfering in its internal affairs, occupying a large tract of its territory, and imposing on it an unjust war involving death and large-scale material destruction. Moreover, that African State is ignoring the principle of the inviolability of borders inherited from the time of independence and is using force contrary to the principles set forth in Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations. It is also refusing to participate in any negotiations that are being carried on by the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU on this conflict. Accordingly, my delegation unreservedly supports the inclusion in the agenda of the Assembly of item 140 entitled \\\"Aggression against and occupation of Chad by Libya\\\".\nWhatever the conclusions on the matter that will be arrived at by the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU, the General Assembly, as the forum in which all conflicts are considered pursuant to Articles 33 and 35 of the Charter, will have to take up this question with a view to finding a peaceful settlement.\nFrom discussion of item 140 there should emerge a resolution condemning the illegal occupation of Chadian territory by the aggressor and belligerent State and calling for withdrawal from that territory, together with compensation to the Chadian people for the losses incurred.\nIn the north-west of Africa, there is still a conflict with regard to Western Sahara. In his meetings with the leaders of the countries concerned, the Secretary-General of the United Nations spared no effort to try to ensure a peaceful settlement of that problem. \nAs regards the Middle East, 20 years ago the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 242 (1967) which, at the time, was regarded as an important step towards the settlement of all aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Although other resolutions have been adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly on the question of the Middle East, no progress has yet been made. The convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East is still the subject of consultations held by the Secretary-General with all the interested parties. My delegation wishes him every success and hopes that the parties in conflict will no longer be opposed to negotiations in accordance with Security Council resolution 338 (1973).\nSuch is the cost of peace in the Middle East, for it implies justice and equality among all peoples of the region. The Arab people of Palestine, like the people of Israel, are entitled to a homeland - to a State.\nConsideration of the situation in Asia leads me to look at the situation in Afghanistan and Democratic Kampuchea. Those two countries have been victims of a violation of the principles of political independence and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and the territorial integrity of States. Resolution 41/33, of 5 November 1986, Is still valid, in our view, since paragraph 3 called for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan and called on all parties concerned to work for the urgent achievement at a political solution in accordance with the provisions of that resolution and with the need to create the conditions necessary to enable Afghan refugees to return voluntarily to their homes, in safety and honour. Since those provisions have not yet been implemented, my delegation will once again become a co-sponsor of a draft resolution repeating those demands at this session.\nThe same applies to Democratic Kampuchea, which continues to be occupied by foreign troops. In resolution 41/6, of 21 October 1986, the General Assembly once again expressed its conviction that the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea, the restoration and preservation of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, and the right of the Kampuchean people to determine their own destiny were the main factors in any just and lasting resolution of the Kampuchean problem.\nThere having been no satisfactory developments in this matter since then, the same provisions must be embodied in a resolution again at this session. My delegation will fully support such a draft resolution.\nStill in Asia, the tension created by the division of Korea into two States persists and is symbolized by the demarcation line in Panmunjon. Appreciation of the contribution made by the peoples of North and South Korea to the work of the United Nations has often been expressed by all Member States, as it has of the contribution made by countries divided after the Second World War.\nThe profound aspirations and enterprising spirit of these peoples should lead the General Assembly and the Security Council to reconsider the question of their admission to membership of the Organization on the same footing as other divided States, without prejudice to the consultations that are taking place between the two parties with a view to unification.\nThe delegation of Zaire cannot pass over in silence the disturbing problem of the Persian Gulf, where a fratricidal war continues between two non-aligned countries, Iran and Iraq, and is extending ever further beyond the regional dimension. The conflict between the two countries is becoming an oil war and is increasingly involving States flying the flags of other States in international waters.\nThe recent mission of the Secretary-General in the Persian Gulf pursuant to Security Council resolution 598 (1987), although it brought some hope of a peaceful settlement of the conflict, leaves the Assembly perplexed and must encourage all delegations to make use of their good offices with the countries concerned to bring to an end this war which has already lasted seven years.\nIn Central America, the efforts of the Contadora Group and the Support Group to bring peace and co-operation to the region deserve to be encouraged by all States. Having reviewed the political situation and the problems of the day, we turn to economic problems. In recent years the world economic situation has been marked by a slowdown in the world economy. World production increased by only 3 per cent in 1986, as compared with 3.4 per cent in 1985 and 4.5 per cent in 1984. World production per capita increased by about 1 per cent, which is half the average increase in the 197oa.\nThe world economic situation was characterized in 1986 by sharp fluctuations in terms of trade caused by unprecedented fluctuations in the prices of the principal commodities produced by Zaire and in the exchange rates of currencies.\nThe total foreign debt of developing countries is now almost 41,000 billion, and the ratio of debt-servicing payments and export earnings of the group of developing countries as a whole reached a record level in 1986. Interest payments by developing countries to service their foreign debt# which amounted to more than \u00cc65 billion in 1986, have continued to restrict their ability to import and to develop, while the net transfer of resources from developing to developed countries has risen to some $24 billion for the second year running. This sombre picture reveals to the international community the outrageous disparities between developing and industrialized countries. The latter have continued to enjoy a generally satisfactory rate of economic growth.\nMy delegation feels that implementation of the programmes of the United Nations Development Decades, the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development and the resolutions adopted at the seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) call for a substantial transfer of resources from both the private and the public sector to the developing countries to finance their development and a satisfactory settlement of the problem of the foreign debt of those countries.\nMy delegation thanks all the creditor countries, and especially Canada, which has agreed either to cancel our public debts or to reschedule some of them. Zaire will work with all those of good will for the establishment of a genuine policy of good-neighbourliness and co-operation, not only with the States of central Africa to create viable economic opportunities for the peoples of the region, but also with all States that cherish peace and justice, to ensure the victory of international co-operation.\nZaire shares the preoccupation of the United Nations with the maintenance of peace and is firmly devoted to the ideals and work of the Organization, from which it has greatly benefited in the matter of its unity and the strengthening of its independence. The best demonstration of this devotion is provided by our conduct, which conforms to the principles of mutual respect between States, the sovereign equality of States, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and respect for territorial Integrity.\t1\nThe unanimity of those who have spoken in this Hall in support of peace is proof of the incontestable determination of all Member States to live together in harmony, tranquillity and security. My delegation appeals to States Members of the United Nations to commit themselves to ensuring world peace.\nI wish the forty-second session of the General Assembly every success in its\nwork. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, on behalf of the people and Government of Venezuela, I am pleased to convey to you my sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. Your well-known personal Qualities and your wide experience as a diplomat are guarantees that in this new stage of General Assembly activities we shall achieve fruitful results.\nMay I also express Venezuela's appreciation of the outstanding work accomplished by Mr. Choudhury of Bangladesh, the outgoing President of the Assembly. His valuable contribution was felt in many fields and his actions bear witness to his support of the principles which guide the United Nations.\nIt is with particular pleasure that I also greet most respectfully the Secretary-General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, an eminent Latin American. His persistent efforts on behalf of international peace and harmony and the intellect and tenacity of which he has given proof in the discharge of his lofty functions have won him broad and open recognition.\nOnce again I come to this forum of universal dialogue to reaffirm the commitment of Venezuela to the fundamental causes of peace and understanding among peoples, which are the raison d'etre of this Organization. I come to this Assembly in the conviction that in times of great economic crisis, extreme political dilemmas and threats to peace the United Nations is strengthened as the undeniable contemporary chosen place for negotiating solutions to the major problems which affect the international community. Our message is therefore one of unequivocal support for its endeavours and labours.\nThis assures me that I am interpreting the unanimous conviction of Venezuelans in reaffirming unambiguously that Venezuela has faith In the United Nations, in the motives that brought it into being and in the effectiveness of its ideals. We are firmly on the side of those who strive to strengthen It. The satisfaction of many basic expectations depends on Its vigour. We cannot allow the prospects for collective well-being to suffer for the sake of subordinate Interests. The time has come for concrete Initiatives and results, with a clear sense of the responsibilities at stake. The United Nations can do It. We are certain of that.\nI should like to put before this General Assembly some views which seem to me to be basic to the present International situation, together with a broad outline of the foreign policy of my Government, which is the Government of the Venezuelan people. \nAt the outset I must refer to the challenge of peace at the global and the regional level. The dangers which beset the human race in this nuclear era are well known. We are also familiar with the serious obstacles that lie in the path of a just and lasting peace. Confronted with these barriers, it is natural that pessimism often prevails in prognostications on the subject of peace and its future.\nWe cannot, of course, deceive ourselves. While it is true that since what is called the Second World War no new general conflagration has broken out, it is also true that the current \\\"nuclear peace\\\" is less a voluntary arrangement - which, of course, is not reassuring either - than the result of implacable rivalry for power and dominance, spurred by fear, mistrust and the quest for hegemony.\nThese facts cannot be concealed, but it would also be wrong not to point out some positive signs which show that our wills are not yet governed by irrationality. We realize that arms control and disarmament are not in themselves guarantees of peace, but there is no doubt that they make it clear that there is a desire for peace. In this respect, we welcome the important steps which the two great nuclear Powers have been taking to eliminate medium- and short-range missiles in Europe.\nVenezuela wishes its voice to be heard in categorical support for this and other initiatives designed to lessen in some measure the crushing burden of the nuclear-arms race, I think it is necessary, and also fair, to recognize the positive intentions which serve to motivate the leaders of the great Powers in the negotiations under way. Let us hope that this spirit of compromise will be the prelude to speedier and more far-reaching advances on the road to arms control and nuclear disarmament. In these times, when the danger of self-destruction is looming with threatening clarity, we cannot rely on the balance of nuclear terror as an element for peace. We must go beyond that and support peace on the basis of the values of international tolerance and understanding.\nA few days ago the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development took place. It confirmed once again the obvious fact that in the midst of the economic-financial crisis which the developing countries face it has now become Imperative that measures be taken which will make possible a re-channelling of substantial financial resources, which would undoubtedly facilitate the solution of some of the grave problems confronting our countries.\nAny progress in the field of disarmament will be a welcome step towards a goal which we defend and will continue to defend resolutely. We therefore once again urge the super-Powers to accelerate and broaden negotiations in the field of nuclear disarmament. Similarly, as we reiterated at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, another objective which we shall not renounce is the conclusion of a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. We are pleased to see the progress that is being made on this subject in the ongoing negotiations.\nIn accordance with the principles of this Organization, we have exercised our responsibility as a member of the Security Council during three terms in the course of our 30 years of democratic life. Our current mandate as a non-permanent member of the Council, the primary organ of the United Nations, where we have at all times endeavoured to play a conciliatory and constructive role in the promotion of world peace, ends in December.\nMy country will continue to pursue its recognized peaceful calling and course in all relevant parts of the world. We firmly and loyally support the settlement of disputes between States by peaceful means, including direct negotiations, without pressure or unacceptable deadlines. We advocate the use of reasonable. It Is In this spirit that we have taken part as a member of the Contadora Group in the resolute quest for peace in the Central American region. After four years of arduous work aimed at achieving a peaceful, negotiated solution to the Central American crisis, we are beginning to see some results which allow us to be reasonably optimistic.\nThe agreements reached in Guatemala by the Presidents of the five Central American Republics were a substantial advance and justify our referring to the obstacles that have been overcome. This is an effort made by the Central American countries themselves, which should make the agreed procedure genuine and trustworthy.\nI wish to emphasize that the International Verification and Follow-up Commission provided for in the Guatemala agreement was established in Caracas a few weeks ago. The members of the Commission are the Foreign Ministers of the Contadora Group, of the Support Group and of Central America, and the Secretaries-General of the Organization of American States and of the United Nations.\nWe are, of course, aware that in this whole process we need the co-operation of countries with links with and interests in the region. All our efforts could be impaired and peace in Central America made impossible without a positive contribution from these elements. We also recognize that this conflict, like many others we have witnessed and are witnessing, is to a large extent the result of underlying socio-economic injustices, which have to be addressed. These are fundamental aspects and the Contadora and Support Groups take them into account in their true dimensions. Thus it was decided at the Caracas meeting to take the necessary steps immediately to prepare a structure and an instrument for an emergency programme of international technical and economic co-operation for the benefit of the countries of the region. It was also agreed that work would be begun as soon as possible by the international community on measures to implement the programme. This is an important requirement.\nThe continuing negotiations and the political will constantly evinced in the joint action of the countries of the Contadora Group, enhanced by the addition of the countries of the Support Group, have led to the accumulation of a wealth of useful experience, prompting the eight countries to establish a permanent mechanism for consultations and concerted political actions. This was set up in Rio de Janeiro in December 1986.\nThis action is in line with our purpose of strengthening, organizing systematically and harmonizing political action by participating Governments, by means of regular consultations on matters which affect or interest our countries, in the context of increasing Latin American unity. We are also prompted by the determination to secure and strengthen democratic and pluralist processes on our continent. We have not entered into competition with organizations and forums in our regional area, nor do we intend to do so.\nAs a step forward in this process, the eight Presidents of the consultation mechanism have decided to meet in Mexico at the end of next November to decide on specific objectives which will contribute to a broader understanding among the Governments and peoples of the Latin American region.\nThe trend towards democracy in Latin America has fortunately received a great impetus in recent years. Nevertheless, we must reaffirm our conviction that there is a close connection between international security, democratic stability and the socio-economic development of our countries. The survival of democracy has much to do with the capacity of a system based on freedom to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of its people to well-being. We know full well that the primary obligation in meeting the challenges of development rests on our own shoulders. But this in no way diminishes the responsibility which the industrialized world shares and the contribution which it should make in the struggle against protectionism and in the sensible management of the debt problem in such a way as not to curtail our prospects of socio-economic progress and political stability.\nIf we are sincere - and history will not forgive us if we are not - we must recognize that the protectionist race in which some developed countries are engaged and the problem of the external debt and the rise in interest rates, which have recently been dangerously accentuated, are two scourges that also have sinister implications for world peace.\nNo viable solution has yet been found to the external debt problem, the solution of which has so far been approached without regard to any historical perspective. Instead it has been dealt with simply as a financial question, and the arrangements necessary to settle once and for all a crisis which affects both international banking and the development of peoples have simply been postponed. Even more alarming is the fact that increasing limitations are being placed on the debtor countries' capacity to meet the basic needs of their peoples. This one-sided and selfish approach undoubtedly creates deep divisions in international economic relations and jeopardizes social peace in the world. \nWe have been asked to be patient and make sacrifices, and we have demonstrated patience and made sacrifices so as to avert an international financial collapse and win time in seeking a concerted and shared solution to the Indebtedness problem. But our attitude has been ignored and misinterpreted. A political dialogue has become more difficult  the conditions set by the international financial community have become more severe, and our ability to honour our international commitments by sharing in international trade has been restricted, it is therefore imperative - this bears repetition - to hold a broad and sincere dialogue between creditors and debtors, on the basis of co-responsibility and the right to develop.\nI am saying this with the authority which Venezuela has by having honoured its obligations and negotiated the restructuring of its debt in a framework of moderation and understanding, and as a warning in the face of a crisis which, because it was postponed without any effort to deal with the root of the problem, might assume an even more acute form.\nThe protectionism of the industrialized countries - due in large measure to a lack of discipline in the management of their domestic economies - represents a new, fundamental and unfair - indeed abusive - restriction on opportunities for the developing countries to maintain normal relations with the .international economic community. Through all kinds of mechanisms, crude and subtle, our products' access to international markets is being hampered, which in turn prevents us from adopting development strategies based on a large share in the world economy. While the rules of international trade are being side-stepped, new ones are being devised which ignore the needs of the developing countries, with no regard for the consequences to the stability and evolution of international relations.\nAs a result of this lack of perspective, the poor countries are now in the absurd situation of sending net transfers of resources to the rich countries, which, in practical terms, means, greater poverty, deeper inequalities and fewer possibilities of maintaining a dialogue and institutional stability.\nFrom every point of view, it is necessary to support negotiating endeavours so as to find better solutions for the problems mentioned. But it is also necessary to avert the risk that the developing countries remain on the sidelines of the far-reaching changes that are now taking place - among other reasons because of innovations in technology, production and international trade.\nUnless international co-operation fills this gap we all run the risk of projecting into the future an international economy compartmentalized into unrelated blocs or, what would be even worse, integrated on the basis of dependent relationships, the characteristics and effects of which would doubtless be contrary to the purpose and to the essence of this Organization. We must therefore remember that we have pending on the agenda the mandate for the start of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development, which should be revised and ratified in the light of present circumstances, including the results of the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII), which met in Geneva last July.\nThat Conference was able to hold a constructive dialogue among all regional groups on the subject of the reactivation of development, growth and international trade through multilateral co-operation. This is very important) it is one of the surest steps taken steps taken so far to solve the problems raised.\nIn its conclusions, we note that it went beyond a diagnosis of the international economic situation and, in the measures and policies recommended by consensus, the Conference made it possible for UNCTAD, as the principal institution in the United Nations system in matters of economic development, to resume, at least in part, its proper role in multilateral economic politics. We therefore trust that UNCTAD VII will mark the end of the process of debilitation and of the disagreements to which UNCTAD has been subjected. If UNCTAD has proved anything, it has been its relevance as a forum for the formulation and negotiation of policies and measures regarding the problems of international economic relations and economic development. Today we have a better perception of the problems, their scope and implications, of the positions and prospects for which they are managed, as well as of the directions that need to be taken for their solution.\nIn connection with the growing interdependence of all our countries, my Government wishes to make a very special mention of the report entitled \\\"Our Common Future\\\", prepared by the World Commission on the Environment and Development, an organization presided over by the Prime Minister of Norway, Mrs. Gro Harlem Bruntland, and whose final report has been submitted to this Assembly for consideration.\nThe diagnosis, conclusions and guidelines of that valuable work have been closely scrutinized in ray country. Venezuela's traditional position, both at the national level and in the international forums dealing with the study of environmental problems, has been to defend development in harmony with a balanced ecology, of which man is an integral part and without which his very existence could be threatened. We welcome the publication of this brilliant and useful work and urge that it be debated with a creative intent for the best interests of man and his future.\nI should also like to refer to the phenomenon of international trade in toxic and dangerous wastes. It is scandalous that this should exist and that the disparities in technology, progress, in the legal infrastructure and control are so abused as to make many developing countries the dumping ground of the scum of industrial activity. This situation requires thorough study and regulation at the multilateral level. Venezuela will support every effort aimed at guaranteeing that by the beginning of 1989 the international community will be in a position to approve a world-wide convention on the control of cross-border movements of dangerous wastes. .\nIn the meantime, the Government of Venezuela has decided to adopt regulatory provisions to prevent its territory from becoming the recipient of toxic wastes.\nI must also reaffirm, with utmost force and urgency, that at times when we are busy solving pressing problems, we neglect what is perhaps one of the greatest dangers for mankind: the gradual breakdown of the environmental eco-system which is nevertheless our main source of sustenance and life. We therefore maintain that at all levels of activity of the United Nations system, as well as of all other sub-regional, regional and international organs, a greater awareness should be fostered of the close link between economic development and environmental problems, as well as of their long-term effects. It is urgent to ensure the quality of life for generations to come. Accordingly, we support with keen interest the holding, this session, of a plenary meeting devoted exclusively to items pertaining to the environment and development.\nVenezuela is attentively following the process of reviewing the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations, as called for in resolution 41/213, as well as an in-depth study of the intergovernmental structure of the United Nations and of its functions in the economic and social field, now underway in an ad hoc committee of the Economic and Social Council. This process, which is intended to improve the United Nations system, should not, however, affect the essential functions, mandates and programmes of the Organization. \nAs we see it, there is nothing whatever that can justify depriving the Organization of the budgetary resources which are mandatory under the Charter, nor for compelling it to dismantle its infrastructure and programmes because of delays and failures to comply with financial obligations. Such an attitude is inadmissible, the more so if it proceeds from contributors with a high level of responsibility towards the Organization.\nThe Government of Venezuela, even in the face of a difficult situation as regards its exports earnings and of countless economic and social needs, has made it a point of honour to comply fully with its obligations towards this Organization, Almost all Member countries have had the same attitude. We can only trust that the so-called United Nations financial crisis, the origin of which is well known, will be overcome by full compliance with the obligations we all undertook on becoming Members of this Organization.\nOne of the basic items that has figured prominently in our debates is the battle we are waging to eradicate the grave scourge of the production, consumption, abuse and illicit traffic of drugs.\nAt the International Conference held in Vienna in June last, important steps were taken to draft measures for International co-operation' in this field, where the need for concerted action by all countries Is becoming Increasingly evident. The phenomenon of cross-border drug trafficking cannot be defeated by one country alone. It must be addressed on all fronts: domestic, bilateral and multilateral. The Vienna Conference succeeded in producing two important documents in this direction, that is, the Declaration and the broad and multidisciplinary Plan of Action, which are before us as instruments of undeniable value to guide and harmonize actions by States and by international organizations in the crusade against drugs. \nOn the other hand, as a measure to supplement the efforts of the international community in this direction, Venezuela, a resolute pioneer in this struggle, will steadfastly pursue its action within the United Nations, so that we may as soon as possible conclude the convention against the Illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances, the initial draft of which the Venezuelan delegation submitted to this Assembly in 1984. The work done so far leads us to be optimistic, but it is obvious that in this field - the battle against what I have not hesitated to call the \\\"Trojan Horse\\\" of our civilization - much remains to be done, particularly in those countries that provide the biggest markets for this fiendish consumption. Not to face this aspect of the problem decisively would be suicidal. The war against drugs must be global, at every stage, lest we be defeated.\nOnce again we must refer to the grave conflicts prevailing in southern Africa. It is intolerable that, after long decades of debates and decisions taken both by the Security Council and by this Assembly, the colonialism and racism imposed by the ruling minority in South Africa should persist at all costs.\nOnce again we urge South Africa to comply fully with Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) , thus leading to the prompt independence of Namibia, as decided by the international community.\nVenezuela attaches particular importance to its relations with African countries. With them we wish to pursue our efforts in the common struggle for the final eradication of apartheid and the defeat of colonialism reigning in Namibia, One of the issues the Organization has been dealing with for decades is the Middle East conflict, a constant concern of the entire international community. We express the hope that it may be possible to arrive at a meeting of minds which will enable progress to be made towards a negotiated, just and lasting solution in that important region of the world. In this respect we support the Secretary-General's efforts aimed at convening a peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned.\nIn the same context, we are gravely concerned about the persistent tension and armed confrontations between Iran and Iraq - countries with which Venezuela maintains cordial and important relations. We hope that this long war, which has engendered such widespread destruction, will soon be ended thus averting the implicit danger of a widening of the conflict.\nThe existence of this Organization, the continuing validity of its noble principles and ideals and its broad and diverse action in many different aspects of international life - all bear eloquent witness to Its role and what it can accomplish.\nThere is no doubt that after this already lengthy road of 42 years of United Nations existence many expectations remain unrealised, but action on many others is on course and moving confidently into the future. In these times of supreme challenge our Organization urges us to strengthen it and give it our most resolute support.\nWe earnestly hope that the deliberations of this session of the General Assembly will be reflected in effective and fruitful results that will promote harmony and progress for all peoples, within a balanced world order where genuine and total peace prevails, free from any restrictions. That is what the yearning for justice of universal man still demands.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, Sir, to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am especially pleased by your election since the relations between our countries are close and friendly and our co-operation is fruitful. I can assure you that in your high and responsible post you can count upon the full co-operation and support of the delegation of the Hungarian People's Republic,\nOur delegation, guided by the policy of the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic, which is in full conformity with the aims and principles of the United Nations Charter, wishes to contribute actively to the success of the work of the present session of the General Assembly as well.\nThe conditions for widening the dialogue and developing practical co-operation among States seem more favourable now than they were during the forty-first session of the General Assembly. The positive trends in the international situation have somewhat strengthened, though grave tensions also persist.\nThe dialogue that has been resumed and become constant between the Soviet Union and the United States of America points in the direction of reduced international tension and strengthened confidence between States, The progress made in their bilateral disarmament talks gives rise to hopes and may induce far-reaching favourable changes that would usher in a new period in the history of international relations, leading us on to the twenty-first century. This imposes increased responsibility on the two leading great Powers. The entire community of nations rightly expects that by accepting mutual compromises they will steer the course of international developments in the desired direction. However, the most important lesson of our foreign policy activity in recent years shows that every country, irrespective of its size should assume a share of that responsibility and do its utmost to contribute towards easing international tension and strengthening co-operation between nations.\nWe maintain that an excellent possibility of doing so is afforded by the United Nations, which is, within the system of international relations, an irreplaceable forum for co-operation among countries of different size, with different social systems and at different levels of economic development. We are deeply convinced that the world Organization still has considerable possibilities yet to be explored and a great potential yet to be mobilized for implementing the noble objectives and principles of the Charter. To avert and remove once and for all the danger of a nuclear catastrophe, to halt the arms race and adopt effective disarmament measures, to build just economic relations free from discrimination and to create living conditions worthy of man in the twentieth century - these are tasks for the nations and for the international community in which, we believe, the United Nations and its agencies should show more initiative and play a more active and pioneering role. It is this awareness that prompts my Government, together with other socialist countries, when we emphasize the need for the General Assembly to take steps towards bringing about a comprehensive system of international peace and security. The aim of this initiative is to lay the basis for broad international co-operation in inter-State relations to replace the present confrontation and mistrust.\nIn our nuclear age, the military and non-military challenges to the security of the world, the complexity and intricacy of international problems and the interdependence of States call for entirely new approaches to questions of security. The relevant discussions at the forty-first session of the General Assembly allowed some conclusions to be drawn which should form an integral part of security policy concepts in our time. \nThe events of the intervening period have reinforced the conclusion that national and international security can no longer be separated and that neither can be preserved in a lasting way to the detriment of or in subordination to the other. Given the realities of our age, no single country can rely exclusively on military-technical means for guaranteeing its security. This can be achieved only by political means and by joint action. No single country has an exclusive right to security. The creation of a new structure of security policies presupposes the active participation of all States, whatever their size or political and social system. It is impossible in our day to remove the threats to common security except by comprehensive management of the different problems, namely, those which emerge separately or in conjunction in the political, economic, humanitarian, human rights and ecological fields. In our world, interwoven as it is with mutual dependence, this conclusion is on the way to becoming a clich\u00e9, but the manner of implementation, the course of action to follow, appears to have won less general acceptance.\nThe responses so far to our initiative reaffirm our opinion that the objective pursued is right. Taking due account of the interrelationships between different areas and with the involvement of the States Members of the United Nations, joint efforts should be made towards elaborating a viable system which, resting on the Charter of the United Nations, may provide a firm long-term basis for balanced development of international relations. Such a system should be based on the democratisation of international relations and world politics} reduction of the role of military strength and its possible relegation as a security policy concept; the creation of conditions and the elaboration and application of an institutional system and rules of conduct necessary for a political settlement of international conflicts; joint solutions to global world economic and ecological problems, and the achieving of a fuller measure of human rights.\nHow are these goals to be attained?\nOn the one hand, the framework and mechanism of this new system of security should be devised and, on the other, action based on a broad consensus should be taken concurrently on whatever concrete issue is ripe for solution. We consider that such action is possible even on several global problems. I refer to international action against terrorism, drug abuse and diseases such as AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), among other things.\nConsideration of the relevant agenda item in the light of such an approach might give an opportunity for a substantive dialogue on both the conceptual aspects and the concrete problems of international security and make it possible for concrete courses of action to be charted on the basis of mutual interest and consensus.\nThe core and substance of activity in this direction is that no State or group of States may claim a monopoly on action, for the related problems are shared and their solution, too, can be promoted only by joint efforts. The encouraging progress made in certain areas of disarmament talks over the past years is a clear and most important indication of positive processes unfolding in international life. The Hungarian People's Republic considers it desirable to ensure, and is doing all it can to see, that the favourable opportunities emerging in the field of disarmament are not missed and that their impact is extended globally through the transmissions of international relations. \nThe fundamental truth of the nuclear age, affirmed by the leadership of both the Soviet Union and the United States, is that a nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought. The Soviet-United States agreement in principle on the elimination of medium-range and tactical-operational missiles reached recently represents a real breakthrough in the practical implementation of the recognition of that truth. The destruction, under strict international verification measures, of those two categories of nuclear-weapon systems could prove a milestone in nuclear disarmament as a whole. The agreement would create a qualitatively new favourable situation in Europe, and would open the way to new measures aimed at further reducing military confrontation. The favourable political effect of such a highly important step would be felt not only by Europe but also by the world at large.\nAn agreement between the two great Powers on 50 per cent outs in strategic offensive weapons and on concurrent strengthening of the anti-ballistic missile Treaty limiting the building of anti-missile systems would be another major step towards strengthening strategic stability. The Reykjavik summit last year paved the way in this field too for bringing closer positions that still differ on several important issues. The range of problems that continue to impede the successful conclusion of the multilateral negotiations of over 10 years on the complete prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons is also narrowing.\nIn our view there is nothing to support or justify the downgrading of multilateral disarmament talks. Rather, the contrary is true: all of us must jointly seek ways and means to achieve a solution, for which an excellent opportunity will be provided by the forthcoming third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. Europe, where the greatest stockpiles of weapons and armaments, as well as armed forces opposing each other, are concentrated, is a continent of particular relevance to disarmament. Any armed conflict between States of the continent would be likely to plunge the peace and security of the whole world into danger instantly.\nThe Stockholm agreement last year opened a new chapter in the efforts to promote European disarmament and to strengthen confidence and security. Initial experience shows that the measures agreed upon have produced favourable effects in themselves. But, what is perhaps even more important, they serve a useful purpose in paving the way for a significant lowering of the level of military confrontation in Europe. On the basis of the Budapest appeal issued by the States Members of the Warsaw Treaty in June 1986 and the responses thereto of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 23 States participating in the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe have, since last February, conducted consultations about the mandate of future negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Europe. Those negotiations must lead to reductions in conventional armed forces down to minimum levels of sufficiency for defence, and thereby to an increase in European stability.\nThe proposed measures constitute a short-term programme of action for disarmament. They should be supplemented by steps creating the foundation for an infrastructure for security in the next century. Without the comprehensive prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests, without the adoption of effective multilateral nuclear-disarmament measures, and without the prevention of the deployment of weapons in outer space, it is hardly possible to think in terms of twenty-first-century security. We are convinced that continuing multilateral negotiating efforts are needed to attain those goals. In the light of the quickening tempo of bilateral and multilateral regional talks, the slow progress or dilatoriness in multilateral disarmament, talks within the United Nations system, particularly in certain areas of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, are becoming a source of growing concern.\nBy signing the Final Act of Helsinki more than a decade ago, the States of Europe expressed their conviction that security cannot be built solely by military means, and that appropriate political, economic and humanitarian conditions are equally indispensable for security. There is no room for doubt that the process of European security and co-operation is an indispensable framework for the maintenance of East-West dialogue and the development of co-operation.\nHungary has a vested interest in the continuation and intensification of this process. The large number of proposals submitted at the Vienna follow-up meeting is another indication of the vivid interest shown by the participating States in the steady development of co-operation in Europe. This is evidenced by the fact that States belonging to different groups of countries and having different social systems have identical goals on several issues.\nHungary, which is situated in the zone of direct contact between countries with different social systems, is bound by myriad traditional ties to the European States, Despite the differences in ideology and socio-economic system, the countries of Europe have established useful, fruitful and ever broadening co-operation in numerous areas, Hungary's relations with the countries of Western Europe likewise testify to the recognition that novel approaches to international relations, dialogue among States, practical co-operation and action based on mutual respect for divergent interests can be the only path to the future for Europe. \nThat is naturally true for all continents. It would be a significant contribution to just and lasting solutions to regional conflicts and to the elimination of hotbeds of crisis if the General Assembly adopted at the present session a declaration on the enhancement of the effectiveness of the principle of non-use of force in international relations, the draft text of which was elaborated at this year's meetings of the Special Committee established for that purpose, with the active participation of representatives of socialist, non-aligned and Western countries, indeed, the most urgent task of our age is that of banishing the use of force from international relations. The adoption by the General Assembly of the declaration, relevant also to the progressive development of international law, would be more than a symbolic gesture of commitment to strengthening this basic principle embodied in the United Nations Charter.\nNumerous developments over the past year have strengthened our conviction that the United Nations should play an active and growing role in the relaxation of tension and in the elimination of regional hotbeds of crisis. Effective involvement by the world Organization would considerably increase its chances of taking action in other future issues, while adding to its weight in world politics and enhancing its prestige. The activities of the United Nations, including those of the Security Council and of the Secretary-General and his representatives in the quest for negotiated settlements, the relevant resolutions and mediation efforts, are assuming growing importance in setting good examples. They express the political will of the overwhelming majority of Member States and bring about a mechanism for settlement applicable to any conflict, giving widespread recognition to the principle that a negotiated settlement is the only way out of an armed conflict. That is substantiated also by developments concerning the Iraq-Iran war. Consequently, we welcome and support the active and constructive role of the Secretary-General in the search for a solution to the Gulf crisis that is acceptable to all.\nCrises can be solved only through a process of comprehensive settlement with the participation of all the parties concerned, and on the basis of the principles of equality and equal security, the principles of the United Nations Charter and the norms of international law. Such efforts can be served most effectively by international conferences to be held under the auspices of the United Nations, whether for a just settlement of the Middle East crisis or a peaceful solution of the conflict in Cyprus. Attempts to use tension as a pretext for increasing foreign military presence and intervention counteract those principles and United Nations efforts to teach settlements. \nElimination of the crisis in South Africa could be promoted by the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions and by resolute and concerted international action. The racist regime of South Africa persists in its efforts to prevent the black majority from exercising its fundamental human rights by the adoption of internal repressive measures and by resort to force, and it attempts to stabilize its position in the region by economic blackmail and by military action against the front-line States. We support resolute international action to prevent the Republic of South Africa from evading in every way the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and from continuing its illegal occupation of Namibia, as well as from launching repeated armed attacks from that Territory against Angola.\nWe consider it an urgent task to strengthen security in Asia and the Pacific and to establish constructive co-operation between the countries of the region. It is gratifying to note the increased activity and growing role of small and medium-sized countries in Asia, as well. We support, any efforts by the countries of the region aimed at creating peace and security on the Asian continent. In this spirit, we welcome the policy of national reconciliation of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and support the endeavours of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful and democratic unification of Korea. In our opinion, the policy of national reconciliation proclaimed by the Afghan Government and the mediation activities of the Secretary-General's Personal Representative have increased the chances of eliminating the crisis situation around Afghanistan.\nThe events in the Central American and Caribbean regions continue to give us cause for concern. My Government favours a just, negotiated settlement of the Central American crisis on the basis of full respect for the sovereignty of the countries concerned and for the legitimate interests and national dignity of the peoples of the region. It lends support to the joint efforts of the Contadora Group as well as to all initiatives of the countries of the region aimed at finding a genuine solution.\nAt the current session of the General Assembly, our delegation will devote great attention to the condition of the world economy and to the problems of international economic relations. The openness of the Hungarian economy and the intensity of our external economic relations compel us to follow with close attention any shifts in the external environment of our economy.\nI must point out that imbalances in the world economy have continued to grow, notable strains have emerged in the international financial and monetary systems and the indebtedness of numerous countries has reached critical levels. The cost of the arms race diverts enormous resources from the productive sphere. The erosion of the international trading system has continued. The growth of protectionist tendencies, discriminatory measures impeding the expansion of international economic relations and restrictions based on non-economic considerations, whose effects are felt especially in trade in modern technologies, are a source of concern.\nSolutions to the problems of the world economy demand a new type of global approach, particularly from Governments that have a decisive influence on the conditions for economic co-operation. In our view, some progress in developing such an approach has recently been made. Let me refer in this respect only to the round of talks started by the contracting parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at the ministerial conference in Punta del Este, Uruguay \u03b9 and to the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) held last summer.\nI think that this new world economic outlook, which is more responsive to realities and to world-wide interdependence, is also reflected in the very important document, entitled Our Common Future, of the International Commission for Environment and Development chaired by Prime Minister Brundtland of Norway. My Government agrees with the statements and conclusions of that document.\nEfforts to create international economic security/ also supported by Hungary, are directed towards ensuring that the principles of partnership relations based on mutual respect for one another's interests, stability, reliability, predictability and fulfilment in good faith of contractual obligations are observed in international economic relations. Implementation of these basic principles can promote mutually advantageous solutions to the present-day problems of the world economy, as well as its balanced growth. World economic problems cannot be solved except with the active co-operation of all participants in international economic relations.\nPromotion of respect for human rights and their universal implementation - and, to that end, promotion of co-operation among States - is one of the fundamental objectives of the world Organization. Present-day events bear out the recognition expressed in the letter and spirit of the Charter that there is a close relationship between respect for human tights and the maintenance of international peace and security. The United Nations elaboration, through strenuous efforts, of an internationally recognized system of principles and norms relating to human rights is among the Organization's achievements deserving of our recognition.\nWe consider it a central task of the United Nations to take effective action against mass and flagrant violations of human rights, which also pose a threat to peace and security. Disregard for the right of peoples to self-determination, the humiliating policies and practices of racial hatred, racism and mass discrimination against nationalities and in any other form demand of our Organization, and of each of its Member States, the adoption of a resolute stand, as well as action. A no less important task for the United Nations is the promotion of respect for individual and collective human rights and their effective exercise.\nWe are convinced that the postulate to respect and implement human rights is a major and indispensable achievement of our civilization - a common value of mankind to whose creation we have all contributed. It is necessary to seek points of common interest as well as ways and means of co-operation in order to enrich it.\nCountries and peoples have followed different historical paths and have started from different foundations in moving closer to the shared values and ideals evolved within the framework of the United Nations system. Such differences are a natural phenomenon - just as the diversity of cultures is - and awareness of this fact may contribute to strengthening confidence in the human tights and humanitarian fields as well.\nThe need for universal implementation of human rights implies exercise of the rights of peoples and individuals, just as it implies recognition and protection of rights for different segments and groups in society, including nationalities. Constructive co-operation in matters affecting the situation of national minorities has an important role to play in inter-State relations and in the development of good-neighbourly relations, and may even influence the political atmosphere of entire regions, in Hungary, the equal participation of nationalities in the political, economic and cultural life of society is an important component of national unity. Recognition of the individual and collective rights of nationalities, including the right to education in their mother tongue, and the creation of institutional and democratic frameworks for their existence, serve to help them preserve, develop and strengthen their identities.\nThe favourable tendencies recently observed in international relations have allowed multilateral forums - including, first of all, the United Nations - to resume an active and effective role in the development of international co-operation. To enable the world Organization to live up to that role, it is indispensable to enhance its effectiveness and streamline its activity. At the same time, this requires that every Member State contribute constructively as much as it can to overcome the difficulties in the operation of the United Nations. We are now at a propitious moment for the world Organization and for the entire community of nations. The States Members of the United Nations must seize the opportunity to steer the course of the world irreversibly towards disarmament and international co-operation. I hope that the work of the present session of the United Nations General Assembly will also help to ensure that more and more States become aware of this opportunity and take an active part in joint efforts to ensure the accomplishment of this mission.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI congratulate you. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly and assure you of the support of the delegation of Iceland in carrying out the duties of that noble office.\nTwo years ago, at the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, I had the honour of addressing this great Assembly. On that occasion I also had the pleasure of listening to many world leaders express their hopes for a world without wars and misery, for a world of peace and good living for all. I do not doubt the sincerity of those who express such hopes, but I ask myself why, then, have we failed.\nIn those fine anniversary speeches several explanations are found. Certainly, much has been achieved through the United Nations, and not least through the efforts of the various specialized agencies dealing with specific world problems. On the other hand, it seems to be a rather widespread opinion that the General Assembly and the Security Council have too often failed, and certainly there is considerable evidence to support such an opinion.\nThe General Assembly has grown, it seems, into a forum of heated debates, with accusations and counter-accusations, between nations which too often seem to belong to power blocs with predetermined views on most issues of importance. To many the General Assembly does not look like a world forum of statesmen seeking in earnest answers to the many problems from which humanity is suffering. But why bring this up at this moment, somebody may wonder. Two years ago we went through the exercise of reviewing the work of the United Nations throughout 40 years and suggesting ways of improvement. We have new gathered here for yet another session of the General Assembly. This is therefore the proper time to do as we promised the world two years ago and show at this session that we meant what we said. \nThe Icelandic delegation to the General Assembly will act accordingly. We shall not take part in accusations and arguments between nations. We shall honour the sovereign right of every nation to govern its own affairs as long as that is within Internationally agreed rules and regulations and does not give others cause for grievance. We shall oppose those that do not honour the sovereignty of their neighbours and that start military conflicts and wars. We shall support reasonable measures to settle such differences.\nWe congratulate the Central American countries on the peace agreement which they have reached and urge all nations to support and assist in the implementation of that treaty. We assume, of course, that the parties involved will restore human rights in the area without delay and thus show their sincere intentions to live up to the agreement.\nWe also strongly support the Security Council's attempt to end the military conflict in the Middle East. I wish to suggest that, if this is not accepted by the countries in question it should be followed up by further international action, such as the imposition of a complete arms embargo. We shall support all realistic resolutions calling for the limitation and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons, a nuclear-test ban and the elimination of chemical weapons, with satisfactory means of verification.\nWe strongly oppose apartheid and any and all suppression of human rights. We shall take part in an honest effort to improve the general quality of life. We shall therefore support all reasonable measures to prevent pollution and destruction of the environment, especially when such practices affect more than one nation or the whole world. In this respect I refer, as examples, to such practices as making the oceans of the world dumps for the most hazardous waste and destroying the ozone layer. No nation or industrial complex should be allowed to continue such practices, often purely for financial gain.\nThe danger involved In the application of nuclear energy for power production can no longer be overlooked. With that fact in mind I suggest that the nuclear power industry should be required to accept mandatory safety standards and inspection as determined by an international body such as the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nIceland strongly supports the conclusions of and proposals made by the Nordic Commission on Environment and Development and we trust that these will become the basis for world action.\nWe shall honour the right of every nation to make proper use of resources within its boundaries without interference from others, but where much exploitation affects others we shall stress international consultation and scientific control. Furthermore, we believe that all living resources have the right to be conserved, although they can be utilized properly. We reject interference by a self-appointed police force, however powerful such a nation may be. People in glasshouses should not throw stones.\nI trust that I have made the position of the Icelandic delegation clear. Furthermore, I want to stress that we look to the United Nations with high expectations and respect. In spite of its shortcomings, we see this important Organization as humanity's greatest hope for survival. We believe that the United Nations should be strengthened and we are willing to take part in such an effort.\nPersonally, I believe that a major source of our problems is to be found in the lack of confidence and trust. Therefore I suggest that we do everything in our power to ensure that people from all parts of the world are allowed to travel freely and get acquainted. I am certain that this would dispel many of the false ideas about others now so frequently held by so many. A year ago my country, Iceland was host to the leaders of the two most powerful nations in the world, who, we can assume, have the future of mankind in their hands. It was a pleasure to host that meeting and thus contribute a little to the crucial attempt now being made to reach agreement on the long overdue reduction of nuclear weapons.\nI want to pay a special tribute to the super-Powers for the results now made evident by the agreement just announced on the elimination of medium-range missiles. We trust that this will be followed by further and larger steps in the elimination of nuclear weapons.\nIceland, which is one among a very few nations that does not have a military force, will always be available to assist in such an attempt to improve life on earth. I should like to see my country become a sanctuary for those who want to meet in peace and seek solutions to the many problems from which mankind is suffering. For that purpose I would welcome not only the leaders of the super-Powers but all members of the General Assembly to my country, Iceland. \n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI have pleasure. Sir, in congratulating you cordially, as the representative of the friendly German Democratic Republic, on your election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly, \u013e assure you of the readiness of my delegation to co-operate with you fully throughout this session. I should also like to express our sincere appreciation to the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Mr. Choudhury, for the able manner in which he presided over the previous General Assembly session.\nWe all owe special appreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who continues to make his important contribution to the efforts of the United Nations to deal with the most acute world problems.\nYear after year, in this same Hall, we have been making and hearing sombre assessments of the international situation, because it could only be described as it actually was. Until recently it seemed that the period of apprehension and uncertainty would never end and that the vicious circle of rivalry and confrontation would persist in spite of all our efforts.\nIt is encouraging that today we have reason to believe that changes are in the making, because the process of dialogue, negotiation and the search for ways out of the exacerbated international situation in the world has been initiated and is evolving. The positive consequences of this process, which is opening up genuine, prospects for understanding in fields in which this was inconceivable only a short while ago, are already being felt in a certain easing of international tension and constitute a sound basis for hope of a more tranquil world and of new development prospects.\nTrue, confrontation continues, but there is also ever wider dialogue on an increasing number of issues. There is a stronger orientation towards negotiation with a view to resolving the accumulated problems of the world. The conviction that mutual agreement and confidence-building provide the only course that can promise the world a future is gaining ground. Every step forward in any field of International relations provides an Impetus to progress in others.\nInitial results in the field of arms reduction are at hand. After more than four decades of nuclear build-up, the world la on the threshold of an agreement on specific measures for partial nuclear disarmament. This is a chance which must not be missed. History would never forgive anyone for preventing this great step towards a better future for all. The forthcoming agreement is, naturally, just the beginning of the long road to complete nuclear disarmament. Its historic importance, however, lies in the fact that it offers real chances of re-channelling International trends in a direction that is in the interest of all nations.\nThis is a moment which requires, maybe more than ever before, wisdom, foresight and courage on the part of us all. The elimination of all weapons capable of annihilating mankind and all the achievements of civilization must be our objective. That would mean victory for the realization that we can only live together and in co-operation and that aspirations to supremacy guarantee survival to no one. \nOn this occasion, my country would like to pay a tribute to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America for their constructive efforts, which will, we trust, shortly yield valuable results. Many years of aspirations, demands, appeals, efforts and contributed by individuals and organizations have been directed towards this goal, which is within reach and which I believe, indeed, we have reached. It is with satisfaction that we note that such developments are an important step towards adopting the stances which the Non-aligned Movement has been advocating incessantly and perseveringly for over a quarter of a century and which were reiterated in the appeal addressed to the leaders of the United States and the USSR by the summit meeting in Harare. \nIn this connection I should like to point out that, like many others, we are of the opinion that even stronger efforts are required on the part of all in order for the process of disarmament to embrace all types of weapons and all regions of the world. It is our judgement that in Geneva we have come closer to adopting a convention on the total ban of chemical weapons. All the conditions exist for taking that important step through the earliest possible adoption of the convention.\nI have already said that an atmosphere of negotiation and agreement facilitates the initiation of a genuine process for the resolution of other crucial problems of international relations. It both sets the conditions and demands our greatest commitment. There are some encouraging signs that some of the crises in various parts of the world which have become a part of our lives and the escalation of which we have feared for years and decades are entering a stage at which solutions are being sought in line with the Interests of the countries and peoples directly involved, as with the interests well as of the International community at large.\nIt is with pleasure that I call attention to the wise and courageous act of five Central American countries which, in the spirit of the efforts of the Contadora Group and with the support of the whole of Latin America, have made a historic contribution to the peace process in their region. The adoption of the peace plan is the result of the constructive efforts of the countries of Latin America to find solutions to their own problems through their own means and actions. Such an approach has always enjoyed the support of the non-aligned countries.\nWe believe it is high time - and also that the situation is now more favourable - to begin solving the Middle East crisis. The proposal for an international conference to be held under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties directly concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and others who have a useful contribution to make, is a sound and realistic move on the road towards peace which is gaining growing recognition in the world. I believe that at this session we should take a resolute step towards the earliest possible convening of such a conference.\nWe are deeply convinced that the only just, permanent and comprehensive solution is one that would ensure the withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories occupied since June 1967, including Jerusalem, the exercise of the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination and to the establishment of a State of their own, and recognition of the right of all the States of the region to security and autonomous social development. That would call for patient efforts on the part of all the countries and all the factors in the region. The non-aligned countries, through the activities of their Committee of Nine for the Middle East and Palestine, are striving to promote conditions for the holding of such a conference and to mobilize all the elements that are ready to contribute to that\nAlthough the causes of the crises in south-east and south-west Asia have not yet been eliminated, there are certain developments which give rise to hopes and expectations. We attach importance to the dialogue on solutions that would ensure the rights of the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea to independence and free development on the basis of the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops, without foreign presence, intervention and interference from any side whatsoever. World public opinion demands that there be no hesitation in this respect and that this process should not be impeded in any way. \nThe resolution on ending the war between Iraq and Iran adopted unanimously by the Security Council is in our opinion a sound basis for a just and lasting solution. It also highlights the importance of the effectiveness of the United Nations. None the less, the war goes on. Its continuation and the entry of foreign Powers into the Gulf have created an explosive situation which could spark off broader conflagrations and even jeopardize peace in this region and in the whole world still further. We are witnessing dangerous incidents every day. We therefore sincerely hope that the sides in this conflict will as soon as possible! seize the opportunity offered by the Security Council resolution for ending the war and creating conditions for the restoration and peaceful development of their countries. We give our full support to the exceptional efforts that the Secretary-General has been making to that end. We also appeal to all other factors to contribute thereto.\nSome world crises have, however, further deteriorated. This applies primarily to southern Africa, where the apartheid regime continues its blood-bath against the majority population and jeopardizes the independence of neighbouring countries. Developments show once again that no changes can be expected without resolute action on the part of the entire international community. The only remaining peaceful means that remain for liquidating the shameful system of apartheid and for the immediate termination of the occupation of Namibia are comprehensive sanctions against the racist regime in Pretoria.\nSimilarly, we cannot but voice our concern over the lack of progress in resolving the problem of Cyprus. It should also be noted with regret that the situation on the Korean peninsula remains unchanged. The non-aligned countries continue to urge a lasting and just settlement of all those crises, in line with the comprehensive programme of action in the struggle for peace and development adopted at their Summit Conference in Harare last year. The initiative of the non-aligned countries of the Mediterranean - an area beset by crises but also an area with a great potential for the development of co-operation - should be viewed in that context.\nAt their Ministerial Meeting held at Brioni, Yugoslavia, in June this year, 11 Mediterranean members of the Non-aligned Movement unequivocally opted for the development of co-operation among the non-aligned and European Mediterranean and other countries, with a view to easing tensions and creating more favourable conditions for resolving crises in that sensitive geopolitical region. Agreements and concrete measures for confidence building and arms reduction in Europe should involve the Mediterranean as well, since peace and security in those two regions are inseparably linked. At Brioni the non-aligned countries launched an initiative for establishing an organized dialogue with the Mediterranean countries of Europe. The interest of those countries in dialogue, which opens up new prospects of co-operation among countries on all the Mediterranean shores, has been confirmed in the initial contacts and exchanges of opinion carried out with those countries by Yugoslavia under the mandate of the Brioni meeting. \nYugoslavia attaches exceptional importance to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe as a process based on democratic principles and the full equality of all participating countries. The Vienna meeting, which is now entering its decisive stage, stands a realistic chance of producing significant results provided that all participants demonstrate political responsibility and realism and take account of the interests of all European countries.\nProceeding from the importance of regional co-operation for a positive process on a broader international scale as well, Yugoslavia has taken the initiative in the convening of a meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Balkan countries. It is our desire through constructive dialogue and concerted effort to encourage multilateral co-operation among the countries of this European and Mediterranean region in various fields of obvious common interests, and in that way to build an atmosphere of mutual understanding and contribute to overcoming the burdensome legacies of the past, and encourage bilateral and multilateral relations of good-neighbourliness and co-operation, as this is of vital interest to all Balkan peoples and countries.\nThe encouraging signs seen in certain areas of international relations are regrettably not yet visible in the sphere of international economic relations, where all the contradictions of the modern world are manifesting themselves in an increasingly acute way. All economic and other divisions persist, while the gulf between the industrialized world and the world of the underdeveloped countries continues to widen dramatically. Unfortunately, in the case of this sphere of international relations we can only repeat the negative assessments and profound concerns that have been expressed time and again.\nWe are firmly convinced that the positive achievements in the field of disarmament and the relaxation of international tension could have a more lasting impact on international relations overall if they were accompanied by steps towards settling international economic problems, improving the position of developing countries and above all, resolving the debt problem.\nThe most serious manifestation of the depth of the contradictions in current world economic relations is the phenomenon of the vast debts of the developing countries. Exceeding $1 trillion, they account for over 40 per cent of the developing countries' gross product. Under the burden of debt servicing, the drop in commodity prices and deteriorating terms of trade, there has been a drastic drain of capital from the developing countries, resulting in their impoverishment.\nAn adjustment policy which does not ensure faster development and which cannot rely on radically more favourable debt-repayment terms cannot redress the situation, which is becoming more and more difficult. Debtor countries are unable in spite of their efforts to repay their debts under existing conditions. Their debt-servicing capacities are declining from year to year. The fulfilment of their obligations is less a question of their willingness than, increasingly, a question of their objective inability to do so. Therefore, a way out of the debt crisis cannot be found without concerted action on the part of both debtors and creditors, that is to say Governments, international financial institutions and commercial banks. A solution can be found only by creating conditions for the accelerated development of the developing countries and by radically improving debt-repayment terms.\nA framework for further action in the United Nations along those lines is provided by the agenda item entitled \\\"External debt crisis and development\\\". Last year the Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution on strengthening international economic co-operation aimed at solving the external debt problems of developing countries. That act confirmed the global nature of the debt problem and emphasized the shared responsibility of both debtors and creditors for its settlement. We expect to be in a position this year to go a step beyond that resolution, as a reflection of the gravity of the problem itself.\nI would recall that the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development established the manifold interdependence between those two key problems of today. It also recommended the further study of avenues for diverting part of the vast resources invested each year in the maintenance of existing weapons and research on and production of new ones to the creation of general developmental opportunities, particularly in developing countries.\nWe are convinced that, by its very nature, the revolutionary progress made by science and technology, with achievements undreamed-of only recently, recognizes no boundaries, no geographic, political or ideological barriers or divisions. The accomplishments of the human mind, regardless of where they were made, have to be made accessible to all countries and peoples under equal conditions. Technological achievements must be put in the service of the development of all, and must not be withheld from developing countries, which need them so badly.\nThe protection of the environment is becoming an ever more topical problem of the present-day world. The report of the commission chaired by the Prime Minister of Norway, Mrs. Brundtland, which particularly emphasizes the link between development and the environment, deserves our special recognition.\nThe crossroads the world has reached and the chances we are offered to enter a new era of international relations make the United Nations the place where all interests, all aspirations and all views are reflected, the only forum where equal and democratic decision-making on our common destiny is possible. Now is the time for us through our endeavours to enable the world Organization to discharge as efficiently as possible the tasks for which we founded it, rather than undermining its authority and role with objections because we have not been able to achieve through it each and every individual interest.\nWe must all, regardless of the groupings we belong to and the political convictions we profess, unequivocally, resolutely and consistently apply ourselves to the development of co-operation on the broadest possible basis and to the promotion of a spirit of solidarity and understanding, rather than vying with each other to prove our own excellence and insisting that our own road is the only possible one and that it should be followed by all. In this world of ours, and even in this Organization, there is no one who can claim that no improvements could be made in his country and its international activities or that matters could not be dealt with in a more democratic and progressive manner. We must not stop at the first positive results in the relaxation of international tensions. We paid a high price before it was realized that we cannot hope for, or move steadily towards, a better future if we are bound by ideas and concepts that pull us back. The beginning of the nuclear disarmament process will be fully validated if it is continued and followed by the resolution of the grave economic problems of the world, the overcoming of crises and the steady democratisation of international relations. This can and should be contributed to by all countries - the big, the middle-sized, the small and the smallest, the most developed, the developed and the underdeveloped, the aligned and the non-aligned - by all countries, all peoples, all organizations of goodwill and noble intentions.\nPeace, security and development are integrally linked. Only together can they provide the opportunity for us to build a world in which tranquillity will prevail over fear, prosperity over want, equality and tolerance over violence - a world in which the dignity of nations and peoples will be universally and fully respected.\nI hope that during this session as well we will take decisions that will, at least in some respects, bring us closer to these lofty goals to fulfilment of which my country is wholeheartedly committed, inspired by the tenets and policy of non-alignment.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, Sir, on behalf of the Government of Greece, to congratulate you on your election as President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. You represent a country with which Greece maintains ties of sincere friendship. Your extensive experience in international affairs and the abilities which have distinguished you as a successful diplomat give us the certainty that the work of this session will be brought to a successful conclusion. I should also like to avail myself of the opportunity to express to your predecessor, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhuty, our appreciation of the able manner and the effectiveness with which he guided the work of the forty-first session of the General Assembly.\nI should like, further, to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for the dedication with which he devotes his services to the safeguarding of peace, in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations.\nThe Foreign Minister of Denmark, Mr. Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, as President of the European Community, has already presented the positions of its 12 member States on the main issues confronting us today. These positions, with which we fully concur, reflect the international activities and responsibilities of the Community , as well as the common policies developed by its member States aimed at the promotion of stability and co-operation in international relations.\nI shall therefore limit myself to certain major issues of particular interest to Greece. The promotion of disarmament and out efforts to consolidate security constitute fundamental objectives of my Government's policy. Within the framework of that policy, which we have pursued with consistency, we have promoted a number of initiatives at the national, regional and international level. The Prime Minister of Greece, together with the leaders of the other countries participating in the well-known initiative of the Six, are continuing their untiring efforts towards nuclear disarmament.\nThe momentous developments of recent days are a source of great satisfaction and of hope for the future. The agreement reached in principle between the United States and the Soviet Union for the elimination of Intermediate-range nuclear weapons constitutes a big step towards the banning of all nuclear weapons. We congratulate the leaders of the two super-Powers, President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. The success of these negotiations gives us grounds for hoping that the relations between East and West will continue to improve. At the same time, we express the hope that an agreement on the reduction of strategic weapons by 50 per cent will become a reality, as will the complete cessation o \u0165 all nuclear tests. However, we are also concerned at the continuing rapid increase m conventional armaments. The existing imbalances constitute a serious threat to international peace. We are convinced that, given the necessary good will, it is possible to reach viable agreements regarding balanced reductions of such armaments and an effective system of verification.\nI would be remiss if I did not repeat at this point, as I did last year, our apprehension regarding the continuing spread and use of chemical weapons, which constitute a flagrant violation of existing international rules and agreements, we are convinced that one of the aims of the international community should be a complete ban on the production and use of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles.\nThe reduction of all types of armaments is an imperative necessity in a world with limited natural and financial resources. While hundreds of millions of people on our planet are suffering from extreme poverty and are not in a position to develop their economies, the spending of vast amounts on armaments constitutes blatant provocation. That is why we attach particular importance to the result of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. The adoption by consensus of its Final Document is an encouraging indication of the international community's political will to face the problems of developing countries through substantial progress in disarmament.\nMy country, consistent with its policy of promoting peace and detente, has always supported the efforts of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe as a means of maintaining a constructive dialogue between East and West. We have every reason to hope that substantial progress will be achieved during the fourth phase of the Vienna meeting which has just begun. It is fortunate that this meeting comes at a time of encouraging activity in the field of conventional disarmament and of the agreement reached in principle between the two super-Powers on the elimination of the intermediate-range missiles from Europe. The circumstances in which the Vienna meeting is taking place are unique, and we should exploit them as a first-rate opportunity for the maintenance of security and the promotion of co-operation in Europe.\nI should like to stress at this point that a condition for the maintenance of security and the promotion of co-operation in Europe and the improvement of the political climate in that region is the creation of a feeling of confidence. Specifically, the promotion of confidence at the regional level is an imperative need. My Government is proud that after continuous efforts it was able to develop the closest possible relations with most of Greece's neighbours. The Balkans, in the past the powder-keg of Europe, are today a model of regional co-operation between countries with different political and economic systems. I wish also to underline the consistency and firmness with which my Government supports the proposal to make the Balkans a zone free from nuclear and chemical weapons.\nAnother area on which the attention of my Government is particularly focused is that of the Mediterranean, as it is related directly to the security of Greece. We have repeatedly stated that the Mediterranean should become a sea of peace, friendship and co-operation among its peoples. We have sincerely supported all efforts to that end.\nWe deal with international problems and examine them simply from the viewpoint of the countries involved while tending to ignore the fact that, in the final analysis, it is the individual who is the victim of international conflicts. When some countries spend enormous amounts on armaments, instead of directing them to development projects necessary to improve the living standards of their people, in the end it is the individual who suffers. If countries that have blatantly violated and disregarded decisions of the United Nations persist in policies which have been condemned, again it is the individual who suffers.\nMy Government is deeply concerned over the question of the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as the promotion of social, economic and cultural rights. The problem transcends regional relationships. It is a problem with international repercussions. We are particularly satisfied to see that the United Nations is continuing its efforts in this field and that it has not been discouraged by the many obstacles it has encountered and by the flagrant violations of human rights.\nIt is our conviction that all States are bound to comply strictly with their international obligations deriving from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the relevant international instruments subsequently adopted. Compliance with these obligations is a duty, not an option. As far as we are concerned, we have always unequivocally condemned every violation of human rights, regardless of where and by whom it is committed. The Greek Government has taken an unreserved position in favour of the equality of the two sexes. It has actively participated in all regional and international efforts to ensure the complete elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. At the national level we have adopted policies in favour of a status of women equal to that of men, in all fields of economic, social and cultural life. Within the United Nations we actively support the strengthening of and an increase in the activities of the committees dealing with women's issues.\nThe problem of international terrorism, although it has been less acute in recent months, is still a destabilizing factor in international relations. My country has severely suffered because of terrorism. My Government has repeatedly condemned and continues to condemn every terrorist act  regardless of its origin. The present session of the General Assembly will deal with this subject. We hope that it will be possible, with the co-operation of all States, to reach positive and substantive results and that the consensus reached during the fortieth session will be maintained.\nYear after year the United Nations deals with a number of major international issues. These issues still appear on the agenda, which shows how little progress we have made towards their solution. However, there have been some encouraging developments.\nWe welcome the recent initiative of the Heads of State of the five Central American countries which led to an agreement for the implementation of a peace plan in the area. We consider this to be a notable achievement by five small countries which have decided to take their fate into their own hands and establish the forms of co-operation for their own region. My Government is convinced that the countries in Central America cam peacefully resolve their problems without foreign intervention. We attach particular importance to the application of democratic procedures and to respect for human and civil rights, and we believe that proposals made for a unilateral cessation of hostilities can be of assistance in this respect. I believe that all countries should respond positively to the appeal made from this rostrum to ensure the success of the peace plan in Central America.\nMy country, as is well known, attaches particular importance to developments in the Middle East, an area where not only peace in the region but also international stability and security are in danger. The Arab-Israeli conflict remains unresolved, as there has been no change in the situation created by the use of force, the occupation of Arab territories since 1967 by Israel and the lack of a substantive and comprehensive peace process. The fact that the idea of an international conference, which my country has supported for a long time, seems to be gaining ground, even among those that until recently categorically rejected it, gives us ground for hope. Greece has from the outset supported the idea of convening an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations for the solution of the Middle East problem in which all the directly interested parties would participate. Recent decisions of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Community present a satisfactory framework for starting an effective peace process.\nWe believe, furthermore, that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) should participate in the conference and that the modalities of its participation concern the Arab countries and, in particular, the Palestinians themselves. This conference should have a substantive role, not be converted into a ceremonial forum. It is obvious that the modalities of the conference should be decided by the interested parties themselves, including the PLO, which is the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We hope that the last obstacles impeding the convening of a conference may soon be overcome.\nWe have repeatedly stressed that the basic pre-condition of a peace settlement in the Middle East is the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied Arab territories. We support the aspirations of the Palestinian people to exercise the fundamental, Inalienable right to self-determination, including the eight to create their own State.\nAt the same time, it is well known that we support the right of Israel to exist as a State within internationally recognized and secure borders. However, Israel should not deny to the Palestinian people what it rightly seeks for itself - namely, the right to exist. Nor can the international community tolerate the illegal policy of the imposition of arbitrary measures, the establishment of settlements and the creation of fait accompli in the occupied territories. Such a policy, as in the case of Cyprus, is aimed at altering the legal status of the territories in question and their geographic, natural and demographic conditions, and distorting their history and the identity of their inhabitants.\nThe tragic situation in Lebanon continues unabated despite some occasional faint hopes of a peace settlement, which unfortunately quickly fade. My country again calls upon the interested parties and those exercising influence to work peacefully to preserve the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon and eliminate violence.\nThe war between Iran and Iraq also continues unabated despite the appeals and efforts of the international community. We have also recently witnessed an increase in tension in the vital area of the Gulf.\nThe tragedy of that war, which entails enormous costs to the two peoples involved, and the magnitude of the dangers created by the ever increasing escalation of tension in the Gulf make it imperative that hostilities cease and peace talks begin, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, including resolution 598 (1987). We appreciate the devotion and courage which the Secretary-General displayed in discharging his duties during his mission, for the purpose of securing respect for and full implementation of those resolutions.\nI also wish to stress the importance that my Government attaches to safeguarding free and secure navigation in the area. I must insist upon this point because, unfortunately, my country has suffered from indiscriminate attacks upon Greek merchant vessels, which have caused enormous material damage and the loss of innocent lives.\nThe situation in southern Africa continues, regrettably, to endanger peace, security and stability. Greece is watching developments in the area with particular interest. The number of victims of apartheid Increases daily. The extension of the state of emergency and the continuous violations of human rights - in particular, detention of religious and trade union leaders, detention of children, torture and forced resettlement of the black population and strict press censorship - are developments that deeply preoccupy my Government.\nThe Greek Government has repeatedly and unequivocally condemned the abhorrent system of apartheid and its inherent violence. We call upon the Government of South Africa to engage in a national dialogue with the genuine representatives of the majority of the population, which should lead to the complete eradication of apartheid and the establishment by peaceful means of a democratic, non-racial and United South Africa.\nWe strongly condemn South Africa's repeated aggressive and destabilizing activities against the sovereignty, Independence and territorial integrity of neighbouring States. Greece affirms its solidarity with the front-line States, which should receive full International support in order to cope successfully with the threat against them. In 1986 a highly significant meeting took place in Lusaka between representatives of the European Community and the front-line States. I attended that meeting and remain convinced of its usefulness. I hope that those efforts will continue.\nWe also strongly condemn the continuation of the illegal occupation by South Africa of Namibia, whose people are being denied the right to exercise the fundamental right to self-determination and independence. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) constitutes the sole internationally accepted basis for the peaceful solution of the problem. The Greek Government categorically rejects any linkage of the Implementation of resolution 435 (1978) with extraneous issues, as well as delaying tactics used for this purpose. We consider the establishment In Namibia of the so-called interim administration to be null and void.\nThe Greek Government expresses its concern with regard to the dangerous situation prevailing in two areas of Asia: Afghanistan and Kampuchea. It is regrettable that diplomatic efforts towards their solution have not yet produced the hoped-for results. We are consistent in condemning all cases of invasion and occupation as well as every effort to create fait accompli. We therefore believe that unless all foreign troops in Afghanistan and Kampuchea are withdrawn as soon as possible in accordance with United Nations resolutions no viable solution can be reached. It is imperative that the bloodshed and suffering of the people of these two countries be brought to an end.\nWith regard to the situation in the Korean peninsula, we hope that a just and peaceful solution will be found, to the benefit of the entire Korean people, in accordance with the generally accepted principles of international law. We believe that the promotion of confidence-building measures in the Korean peninsula will create the appropriate conditions for the Olympic Games of 1988 to take place in an atmosphere of co-operation rather than confrontation.\nThe international economic situation shows signs of stress. Imbalances remain, growth rates are low and the future is uncertain. The resumption of high and stable growth rates must be secured in order to bring about solutions to the debt problems of the developing countries and an improvement in the market conditions for their primary commodities.\nThe third world's external debt crisis must be resolved through dialogue and greater understanding of the problem by the international community. We should not lose sight of the political dimension of this problem. The people of the over\u2014indebted countries shouldering the unbearable burden of external debt are deprived of a dignified standard of living. As a result, phenomena of social turmoil have surfaced. The low prices of primary commodities have severely curtailed the exchange earnings of a large number of developing countries. Those countries face serious difficulties in servicing their external debt while implementing strict stabilization programmes, unfortunately, development assistance to those countries and flows of new capital from the international financial system have not yet reached the levels necessary to permit successful implementation of their stabilization policies. For that reason development efforts have fallen behind.\nThe final text adopted by the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) provides a framework for remedial solutions. At the same time imaginative and courageous solutions should be pursued In international forums, particularly at the International Monetary Fund, whose annual meetings begin today.\nI should like to elaborate on an issue of particular concern to the Greek nation that in recent years has been repeatedly dealt with by the United Nations. I am referring to the problem of Cyprus, prolongation of which entails a serious threat to peace and security, not only in the immediate vicinity but also in the broader area of the eastern Mediterranean.\nMore than 13 years have passed since the Turkish array, in flagrant violation of the basic principles of international law, invaded Cyprus and occupied a large part of the territory of the Republic. After the invasion Ankara attempted as a first step to stabilize its military occupation and to drive out those remaining Greek Cypriots who had not yet fled, to become refugees in their own country, the Invading Turkish army. Subsequently, Ankara attempted to alter the demographic composition of the population through a massive influx of settlers, which it organized politically in order to support an illegal government whose existence depends on the equally illegal presence of the army of occupation. Furthermore, by destroying the cultural heritage of northern Cyprus, by plundering churches and by changing place-names, it is attempting to impose partition and create two separate states in an effort to avert the unity of Cyprus.\nFor 13 years Turkey has systematically avoided any discussion of those subjects which, by definition, are pre-eminent; namely, withdrawal of the occupation array; agreement on a system of guarantees that would preclude the presentation of pretexts such as those Ankara has raised to justify its invasion; and withdrawal of the settlers and application of elementary human rights concerning freedom of movement, freedom of settlement and the right to property.\nAnkara has refused to discuss those questions, which obviously should occupy a central position in the consultations. On the contrary, through repeated statements made by Turkey or the Turkish Cypriot leadership, Ankara has made it clear that it has no intention of withdrawing its military forces from the territory of Cyprus, which it is systematically reinforcing with new modern tanks as well as through increasing military personnel. The recent report of the United Nations Secretary-General to the Security Council gives an extremely clear picture of the situation in the area and points out a number of other Turkish and Turkish Cypriot activities that aim solely at the consolidation of the illegal occupation.\nThe Government of the Republic of Cyprus, in an attempt to help the Secretary-General in his mission of good offices, has proposed alternative procedures aiming at the examination of the aforementioned major issues, that is, either at a high-level meeting or at an international conference. The Greek Government fully supports the position of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus that, before any further discussion on other issues that have already been dealt with, the major issues should be examined - namely, withdrawal of the occupation forces and of the settlers, a new system of enlarged international guarantees precluding the possibility of unilateral intervention and the three freedoms.\nIt should in particular be stressed that up to now Turkey has refused any discussion of those issues. That attitude is a clear indication of its ultimate aims. It wants to entrap the Government of the Republic of Cyprus into accepting a constitutional system that would serve Turkish interests solely and make no provision for the withdrawal of the occupation army or the settlers or for the restoration of the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. However, the position of Ankara is highly provocative when it argues that a discussion of the critical problem of Cyprus at this session constitutes a manifestation of intransigence. Indeed, I am astonished at that argument, which expresses a deeper contempt for the United Nations and for the inalienable right of every sovereign Member State to have recourse to the Organization in every case of violation of the principles of the Charter and of the resolutions of United Nations organs.\nConfronted with this situation we have to decide where our duty lies. It would be distressing and dangerous were we to limit ourselves to the expression of hopes and to regrets over lack of progress. I believe it is time for all of us to face up to our responsibilities and to make it crystal clear that force cannot be accepted as a way of resolving international problems,\nGreece is convinced that a just and viable solution to the Cyprus question should be sought within the framework of the United Nations and, more specifically/ through the implementation of the numerous General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, which clearly and unequivocally provide for ways to resolve all these major Issues, it is only natural that we look to the United Nations for a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem. An injustice committed in any part of the world is an injustice against mankind. It is therefore the duty of mankind to restore justice.\n"
