His election is a universal recognition of his high qualities as a statesman and a diplomat and a tribute to the noble nation which he so worthily represents, as well as an honour for the whole of Latin America.\n389.\tI wish also to congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, on the way in which he conducted the work of the previous regular session and the three special sessions held this year. I should like also to convey my respects to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose intense and untiring work deserves the gratitude of all of us who share his concern for the attainment of the purposes of our Organization.\n390.\tI want, too, to take this opportunity to welcome the delegation of Solomon Islands, which is taking part in this Assembly for the first time. The admission of that recently independent nation to our Organization gives practical application to the principle of universality.\n391.\tA few days ago we received with great satisfaction news of progress towards peace in the Middle East which had been achieved in the Camp David talks. We sincerely believe that the efforts of President Carter, President El-Sadat and Prime Minister Begin deserve every praise. It is quite certain that, although there are still many agreements to be reached, through these talks a way has been opened towards a total and final solution. We hope that all the parties interested and concerned in the Middle East situation will continue to seek a just and lasting peace which would eliminate the danger of recourse to violence and its possible extension to other areas.\n392.\tWe have followed with due attention the situation in Lebanon and have viewed with great concern the difficulties which the United Nations forces have met with in striving to fulfil their noble mission, but we hope that the events I referred to earlier will have a decisive impact on a forthcoming settlement soon to be achieved.\n393.\tIn Cyprus, stagnation has been reached and all the efforts of the United Nations to find a solution have remained fruitless. It is our greatest wish that negotiations should be resumed and, with the goodwill of the parties to the conflict, that a just solution to the problem should be found.\n394.\tOn the other hand, we are very pleased to note the progress made in the question of Namibia, which, of course, is a very difficult one. Encouraged by the results thus far attained, we should spare no effort now until the situation has been finally resolved.\n395.\tWe regard disarmament as closely linked to the maintenance of world peace and security; and the same applies to economic development.\n396.\tA few months ago the General Assembly held a tenth special session, devoted to disarmament, the results of which can be judged as contradictory in the light of the preconceived idea which people had of them. My country considers that the result is a step forward. The very fact that the Final Document [resolution S-10/2] was adopted by consensus shows the existence of a political will to achieve general and complete disarmament.\n397.\tOf course, there are still many difficulties to be overcome, but the Final Document establishes the negotiating bodies and the back-up activities that we regard as suitable for its achievement. We should all express our desire to co-operate to the best of our ability in order to smooth the way so that such praiseworthy aspirations become reality in a short time.\n398.\tIn economic matters the world outlook is not favourable. Last week the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 reached the end of its session without agreement on the mandate entrusted to it.\n399.\tMeanwhile, the position of the developing countries is daily worsening. Fluctuations in the prices of raw materials produced by them, prices which are always on the downward trend, accompanied by the rise in the prices of manufactures produced by the developed countries, result in an imbalance in the balance of payments of the former, the loss of their reserves and an increase in their foreign indebtedness. In turn, this has the effect of preventing development and infringes the right to health and education of the peoples concerned.\n400.\tAs developing countries, we are aware of the injustice of the situation and believe that we must find a solution. In our view, the solution lies in the so-called North-South dialogue, but for this dialogue to produce practical results it is essential for the developed countries also to recognize the injustice of the situation, to be willing to give up the undeserved advantages that they have enjoyed and to accept the establishment of a new international economic order that would regulate with greater equity economic relations between countries.\n401.\tSimilarly, we believe that technical and economic co-operation among developing countries should be increased, though this should not be a substitute for the co-operation that the developed countries are obliged to give.\n402.\tI turn to the question of the law of the sea. We note that in the second part of the seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea very little progress was made. In particular, there are still serious differences between the developed and the developing countries over the regime for the exploitation of the sea-bed. We are concerned about the statement by one of the developed countries that it will introduce unilateral legislation on this matter. It seems to us that that will make it even more difficult to reach a compromise on the matter of the sea-bed, which, according to a statement of this General Assembly, is the common heritage of mankind.\n403. A new session of the Conference has been convened for next year. We hope that it will be more successful and that negotiations will focus on the differences that divide us, without reopening discussions on points that have already been\tagreed. That is our most fervent desire. We do\nnot want even to think about the alternative: that the developed countries should be able to exploit the sea-bed exclusively for their own benefit, thus widening even more the difference between them and the developing countries.\n404. Nicaragua is continuing its unchanging policy of respect for human rights, and firmly believes in the need to promote them at the international level, a principle enshrined in the Charter of our Organization.\n405.\tIn accordance with that conviction, my country has invited the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the OAS to visit Nicaragua and is most willing to give all the cooperation that the Committee feels useful for its work.\n406.\tIn order to check subversive terrorist activities, of which I stall speak a little later, my Government was forced temporarily to suspend constitutional guarantees and safeguards, but it was done only for that end, and was done with the greatest moderation. In any event the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights has been invited to visit Nicaragua as soon as possible. This visit might take place on 5 October, a date agreed upon with its President, Mr. Andres Aguilar; this Commission will go to Nicaragua any day now to observe how human rights are respected in my country.\n407.\tThe Government of Nicaragua is a democratic Government, and our current President, General Anastasio Somoza Debayle, received his mandate in popular elections as a candidate of the Nationalist Liberal Party. The Conservative Party, traditionally the opponent of the Liberal Party, also took part in those elections. The presidential term ends on 1 May 1981, and before that date new popular elections will be held.\n408.\tDespite what I have just said, there are groups in Nicaragua which seek to change the constitutional order by force-some because they are not sufficient numerous to organize themselves as a political party and take part in the election, others because they do not believe in the democratic principle under which the majority elects the Government. Some of those groups have received assistance from abroad for their subversive purpose.\n409.\tLast month a group of terrorists in a surprise attack seized the National Palace 5 where the national Congress was in session and where the offices of the Ministries of the Interior and the Treasury are situated. The terrorists took hostage members of parliament, the Minister of Government and officials and employees who were doing their work, as well as members of the public who were there-in all, almost 3,000 persons, including many women and children. In return for the release of the hostages the terrorists demanded of the Government that 59 people who were in prison for crimes committed, such as murders, kidnappings and armed assault, and whom they described as political prisoners should be allowed to leave the country and that a ransom should be paid. For humanitarian reasons and to save the lives of so many innocent persons, the Government acceded to those demands.\n410.\tIn the following days, possibly owing to this humanitarian gesture being taken for weakness, terrorist attacks were carried out in many cities throughout the country, causing great loss of life and destruction of property.\n411.\tIn order to carry out its duty to maintain public order, the Government was obliged to use force, relying on the support of the majority of the Nicaraguan people, who are peace-loving and repudiate the use of violence for the purpose of subverting the constitutional order.\n412.\tThe Government of Nicaragua considers that international action is necessary to prevent and put down terrorism, and is taking part in both of the Committees set up by the General Assembly for that purpose. None the less we believe that the action undertaken thus far should be stepped up and made specific: furthermore, we favour\n25Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism; Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Taking of Hostages.\nrenewal of the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Taking of Hostages.\n413.\tI am therefore pleased to inform this Assembly that yesterday the report of the Ad Hoc Commission of Observers of the Permanent Council established to verify border incidents brought to its attention by the Governments of Costa Rica and Venezuela was completed. That report, which was read yesterday afternoon, and in which both parties have set forth their views, was found satisfactory by the Council. In such circumstances, I was surprised by the statement of the President of Costa Rica to the effect that there had been aggression on the part of Nicaragua. The aforementioned report makes reference to that situation, and I repeat that that report was considered yesterday as the result of the impartial efforts of the Ad Hoc Commission. I stress my surprise at the statement made by the President of Costa Rica at this meeting because, as an important statesman of his country, he has been in a position to observe that before this year, in which we have been torn asunder, there had been attacks against the territory of Nicaragua. I had the honour to witness his inauguration. In his message the President declared:\n\\\"Costa Rica will no longer be a haven for outlaws and international brigands. We will not allow our country to be a staging ground for extremist groups of any political tendency.\\\"\n414.\tI listened with rapt attention to that promise uttered by the President of Costa Rica implying acknowledgement of the fact that before that date invasions had been mounted against my country by organized terrorist groups from the territory of that sister Republic. None the less, 18 days after the President had taken office, a pardon was issued to the detained Communist chief -- Communist, extremist or \\\"Sandinista\\\", as he likes to call himself. That pardon was granted by the Government Council, despite the fact that it had previously been refused by the Supreme Court, pursuant to a ruling of which I have a copy in this file but which it is not convenient to read out because of its length.\n415.\tWe are awaiting the fulfilment of all international agreements that we have signed and, indeed, favourable reports have been received to the effect that calm has been restored in Nicaragua. Yesterday it was ordered that all the political detainees who had been arrested because of the recent events which caused bloodshed in our homeland should be released.\n416- We understand that we have, in Costa Rica, a fraternal neighbour which has always managed to find peaceful solutions to our differences. But we cannot but regret that the terrorists operating from Costa Rica, who recently attacked my country, have gone unpunished.\n417. Nevertheless, everything is returning to normal, and I hope that with the visit of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which will be arriving in my country at the beginning of next month, all of our current problems will be settled, since my Government and the President of the Republic are committed to the maintenance of relations of the greatest friendship with all nations of the American\ncontinent, particularly with the friendly countries of Costa Rica and Honduras. \n418.\tI am making no reproach; I am simply stating what has happened, and there is no lack of respect on my part for the sister Republic of Costa Rica, which is making all possible efforts for the restoration of peace between our two countries.\n419.\tI would conclude by thanking this Assembly for its attention, and with the fervent promise that Nicaragua is committed to the maintenance of peace in the Republic and to the restoration of constitutional order after these days of unrest and bloodshed on our national soil.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n189.\tMr. President, I wish to join the previous speakers in congratulating you on your unanimous election to the high office you now occupy. My delegation is confident that under your able leadership and guidance this thirty-third session of the General Assembly will be a successful and fruitful one. I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Mojsov of Yugoslavia, on the efficient manner in which he performed his duties during the last session of the General Assembly .\n190.\tYear after year we gather here in order to express our concerns over the issues facing our world today. These issues are so numerous that one could not possibly discuss all of them in this world forum at one time, let alone find\nsolutions to them. Therefore, I propose to highlight only those issues which my delegation considers are in urgent need of positive action by this world body. These issues are human rights; the situations in southern Africa and in the Middle East; decolonization; disarmament; and the new international economic order.\n191.\tThe question of human rights, being an important issue, has occupied a central position for my Government and indeed for many other Governments represented here today. It is particularly pleasing to my delegation to note that in some countries adequate measures have been taken to restore basic human rights. However, in others there still exist inhuman practices and an appalling denial of the human rights of people living there. It is the hope of my Government that the international community will condemn those who insist on perpetrating these activities.\n192.\tWe note that this year the international community will be celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This will provide us with a unique opportunity for assessing the records of the United Nations and the international community in the human rights field. My Government hopes that each Member of the United Nations will do the same.\n193.\tMy delegation is pleased to note that there has been progress1 on the question of Namibia. We understand the people of Namibia will attain their independence in December this year. Papua New Guinea will not accept anything less than that. The United Nations should be proud of itself for not letting up on the racist regime of Vorster. We hope the free elections will ensure equal participation in the running of that new nation. We shall certainly be looking forward to seeing Namibia among us in a very short time.\n194.\tI turn now to the question of Zimbabwe. In view of the mounting unrest and violence in Zimbabwe, my Government is convinced that there can be no acceptable solution until majority rule is established in accordance with the principle of \\\"one man, one vote\\\". Unilateral action will not bring about a lasting solution; it will only make the situation worse. Initiatives taken by the front-line States together with the United Kingdom and the United States have be helpful.\n195.\tIn relation to apartheid, institutional racial discrimination in South Africa still causes concern to my Government. We have stated in the past and will state once again here and now, in the strongest terms, that the policy of apartheid in southern Africa is abhorrent. There is no indication whatsoever that the racist Government of South Africa is moving away from its policy of separated races. Opponents of apartheid are victimized; African leaders and organizations are banned; basic human rights are denied to fee black African people. We know, too, that leaders such as Steven Siko have been gaoled and murdered by the racist regime. How long will these inhuman acts go on? The time bomb is ticking. Unless we defuse this bomb, it is going to explode.\n196.\tThe situation in the Middle East causes grave concern, not only to those who live in the region but also to all peace-loving peoples of the world. My delegation\nsupports 'the efforts being made by Egypt and Israel towards a workable solution in that region. We understand the issue is a very complicated one, and a solution will not come overnight. However, we do believe that there should be some compromises and concessions. Papua New Guinea has always remained neutral on this question because deep in our hearts we sincerely want to see peace and security in that region. We hope that what has been achieved at Camp David will give impetus to the process of peace in the Middle East.\n197.\tPapua New Guinea is an ardent supporter of decolonization. My Government has, therefore, earlier welcomed with great pleasure our nearest neighbour, Solomon Islands, to this Organization of nations. I am particularly happy to see representatives of that country take their seats here. I am also happy to say that another island territory in the South Pacific, namely, Tuvalu, will become independent on 1 October this year. The Gilbert Islands expects to achieve its independence next year. In the years to come other small island countries in the Pacific will achieve self-determination.\n198.\tMy Government welcomes the progress of decolonization that is taking place in the South Pacific and looks forward to the day when the remaining Territories under colonial administration become independent. Some colonial Powers represented here today have seen fit not to give people under their colonial rule the chance to express their views in line with the various United Nations resolutions on decolonization. As a country in that region, Papua New Guinea hopes that these metropolitan Powers will change their attitudes towards decolonization in the South Pacific and will ensure that the people in those Territories under their administration will be given the opportunity to exercise their rights to self-determination and independence. With that in mind, my delegation endorses the statement made at the previous meeting by Mr. Owen, the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, concerning Tuvalu, the Gilbert Islands and the Anglo-French condominium of the New Hebrides.\n199.\tIt is my Government's sincere desire that these Pacific neighbours of Papua New Guinea should attain the status of full independence, as this will greatly increase the number of sovereign nations in the South Pacific region.\n200.\tOn the question of disarmament, my Government is deeply concerned at the fact that the arms race consumes some of the most precious resources which we believe could be better used in the social and economic development of mankind.\n201.\tMan has always sought a peaceful existence within secure boundaries; in order to achieve this, he has always had arms. However, man has, through the arms build-up, particularly that of nuclear weapons, created a situation where he is no longer secure. Each State now seeks to have more advanced and sophisticated weapons in case of attack by others. As we all know, this process is threatening the existence of mankind.\n202.\tThe time has come for this world body to act positively towards reversing this dangerous trend. We should call a halt to the arms race immediately. We agree\nwith those who say that political will is needed to achieve real disarmament. However, we also say that a certain amount of trust and perhaps faith in each other is needed in our endeavours towards the achievement of this complicated task.\n203 Ending the arms race and achieving real disarmament are very important and urgent tasks facing us today. The desire of a small nation such as mine is for the peoples of this world to have peace and security. This could then leave us free to concentrate our efforts on bettering the lives of our people-that is, eradicating disease, improving standards of living and providing enough food for the starving masses.\n204.\tThose of us in the developing world are faced with problems of not having enough resources for the development of our peoples. Needless to say, there are people starving, people in need of medical care, people in need of education, people in need of good housing. We are not saying that resources saved in the disarmament process would solve all problems; what we are saying is that it would lighten our burdens if some of those resources could be used for those purposes. This would also contribute to the realization of some of the goals of the new international economic order.\n205.\tThere are those who argue that an end to nuclear testing would not bring about disarmament. We disagree. We are opposed to nuclear testing because, first, we strongly believe that such opposition is a step towards disarmament and, secondly, no one has been able to tell us\u2014at least up to the present time-what are the effects of radiation on mail and his environment. The latter point concerns us most because we are situated in that part of the world\u2014the South Pacific\u2014where nuclear testing is taking place. There is one fact that we know for sure, and that is that man and his environment will never be the same. We have been told that radiation effects are insignificant. This we find hard to believe. We in the South Pacific have repeatedly expressed our opposition to testing in our region. However, our protests fall on deaf ears and testing still continues. We therefore call on those who are responsible for this unforgivable state of affairs to cease their irresponsible activities.\n206.\tThe international community today recognizes the need to move quickly towards a new international economic order, even though there exist differing views on some specific aspects of the major proposals being put forward. My delegation is deeply concerned at the slow pace of the long-awaited world economic recovery. Unstable commodity trade, persistent world inflation and a chaotic international monetary system are still the order of the day. If meaningful progress is to be achieved, developed industrial nations must address themselves to the question of improved access to their markets for the goods of developing countries.\n207.\tIt is a recognized fact that developing countries are an important market for the exports of industrialized countries. If these markets are to remain open, greater efforts must be made to enable third-world countries to increase their export earnings.\n208.\tPrimary commodities are the mainstay of our economies. We are therefore very concerned to see the\nnegotiations on a common fund move forward. We are also watching with interest the developments in the commodity agreements, and we are hopeful that these negotiations will contribute to freer trade, particularly in agricultural products.\n209.\tThe development of an international marketing system, which provides reasonable returns to primary producers in developing countries\u2014particularly to smallholders-is of the utmost importance to the economies of the developing countries.\n210.\tWe should also address ourselves to the question of the reform of the world monetary system as soon as possible. We support the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system. We note that during the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly it was decided in resolution 32/174 to convene a special session of the General Assembly in 1980, at a high level, in order to assess the progress made in various forums of the United Nations system in the establishment of the new international economic order. We hope that we can then take some positive action for the promotion of the advancement of developing countries and international economic co-operation. In the meantime, we should not spare any effort to keep the dialogue going. The Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 should be used as the focal-point for keeping the North-South dialogue alive.\n211.\tAs my Prime Minister stated in his statement at the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly last year, the South Pacific region is often thought to consist of many small island-nations without a regional identity. This is no longer true. The region now has an identity with the coming into being of the South Pacific Forum seven years ago. This is an organization which strives to solve problems that confront our peoples in the South Pacific region and to consider various ways in which economic growth can be achieved in the region. The proper utilization of our natural resources, in particular fish, is one such way by which this goal can be reached. The South Pacific contains what may be the world's only under-utilized supply of tuna fish, and for several South Pacific nations this represents the only natural resource available. As such, it is vital to their future economic growth. It is for this reason that the South Pacific Forum is seeking to establish the South Pacific Region Fisheries Organization, which would ensure that maximum benefits from the vast stocks of tuna that live in our waters would go to the peoples of the South Pacific and not the major distant-water fishing nations.\n212.\tI should like to draw the attention of the United Nations to the question of East Timor. My Government recognizes East Timor as an integral part of Indonesia. I visited East Timor earlier this year and I was convinced that, during the long period when that Territory was under the previous administration, there was little or no development in the social, economic or political field. However, while acknowledging the fact that East Timor is now an integral part of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea would like to\nreiterate its previous position, that is, that the people of East Timor were not allowed their right to self-determination. My Government would have also liked the international community to have had more say in the matter. We regret that this did not happen and that the international community was not properly consulted.\n213.\tThe question of refugees has been preoccupying my country during much of the last year and is still doing so. 1 should like here and now to thank the United Nations for agreeing to give us financial support through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to help feed and provide medical care for Indonesian citizens crossing into Papua New Guinea territory. My Government is not in a position to look after everybody, as these people in the last couple of months have been coming in larger groups. This includes the last group, which numbered 700 persons. As a Member of the United Nations and acting within the spirit of the various United Nations conventions on refugees, we are committed to helping these people by utilizing our limited resources, which could more effectively be spent elsewhere.\n214.\t1 have briefly touched on a few of the issues which my delegation considers in need of urgent and positive action by this body. It is my delegation's hope that during this session some positive steps towards solutions will be found.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n22.\tMr. President, previous speakers have spoken in glowing terms of your ability and wealth of experience and of the satisfaction they have derived from your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. My delegation, even at this ate hour, wishes to be associated with those who have spoken previously in congratulating you. We also congratulate your country and Latin America for having given to the service of the United Nations a person of your eminence and distinction\n23.\tAt the same time, we are not unmindful of the contributions made by your distinguished predecessor,- Mr Lazar Mojsov, of Yugoslavia, who presided over the thirty-second session and the subsequent special sessions.\n36 Like Africa and Asia, the Pacific was, and continues to be, a victim of colonialism. It, too, has not been spared the agonies, frustrations and vicissitudes of domination by foreign Powers. It is a matter of great satisfaction, therefore, to my delegation to welcome Solomon Islands into our midst and to extend to it our co-operation and support.\n37.\tAlthough we come from a region far removed from the main centres of trade, the growing interdependence of the developed and the developing countries makes it necessary for us to follow closely the various discussions on economic issues affecting the international community.\n38.\tWe therefore note with regret and some concern the growing trends towards protectionism. We do not merely view this trend as unhealthy; it also makes us wonder as to the sincerity of those in the developed countries who have been loud in their assurances and commitment to a more equitable distribution of the world's wealth. The statement by the President of the World Bank during the annual meeting of the Bank and the IMF in Washington recently, raises a serious doubt in our mind as to the prudence of protectionism as a policy. Mr. McNamara said:\n\\\"The truth is that throughout the industrialized nations this trend towards protectionism is gathering momentum. There is an increasing readiness for OECD Governments to extend assistance to domestic industries at the expense of developing country exports. And producers of a wide variety of products in the industrialized world-ranging from petrochemicals and ships to bicycle tin s-are now demanding relief from import competition.\n\\\"The popular rationale for this protectionist posture in the developed nations is, of course, that the growth in developing country exports eliminates jobs.\n\\\"But while the impact on jobs in specific firms, or in particular product lines, can sometimes be serious, it is important to recognize that the negative effect of developing country exports on overall employment in the developed world has been negligible.\n\\\"The fact is that developing countries today supply only a tiny portion of the manufactured goods consumed in developing countries. Less than 2 per cent.\n\\\"Even in the case of clothing, which contributed the most to developing-country export growth, the ratio of imports to total consumption in 1976 was less than 8 per cent in the United States. In 1974, developing country textiles and clothing together constituted only 8 per cent of the market in Germany, 6 per cent in the United Kingdom, 5 per cent in Canada, 4 per cent in japan and in the United States, and 2 per cent in France.\n\\\"These low levels of market penetration have clearly made only a minuscule impact on the overall industrial structure of the importing countries, and the impact on the occupational pattern is even smaller since a number of industries share a common need for specific occupational skills.\n\\\"Further, the number of workers displaced by imports from developing countries is only a fraction of those displaced by shifts in technology and demand in the industrialized countries themselves.\\\" \n39.\tWe welcome the steps taken by those industrialized countries to give preferential treatment under the generalized system of preferences scheme to products from developing countries. We hope that other developed countries will have the courage and the foresight to join the scheme.\n40.\tWe share the concern expressed by other speakers concerning the suspension of the Committee of the Whole. While there are still areas of difference, we feel that the extensive informal discussions which the Committee has been holding since May have been useful. We urge that the General Assembly maintain the momentum with a view to reaching some agreement.\n41.\tThe population of the island countries of the Pacific is a mere 5 million. We are spread over a huge expanse of ocean. Though isolated and bereft of resources, we are nevertheless buffeted by the changing fortunes of the world's economy. There have been sharp fluctuations in both demand and prices of our commodity exports. Increased prices of manufactured goods and petroleum merely make a bad situation worse. As far as our largest export commodity\u2014sugar\u2014is concerned, we were fortunate to avoid any serious fluctuations, because, as a member of the Lome Convention, we benefited from the assurance of a guaranteed minimum price.\n\n42.\tIt is not usual in a statement of this nature to dwell on matters which appear to be of regional interest. However, we believe that the emerging Pacific Island community merits special mention for several reasons. We are isolated from the main centres of population; we suffer from limited domestic markets, scarce raw materials, heavy dependence on imports and high transportation costs. At the same time, we do not wish to be unduly dependent on the generosity of others. We have made an earnest attempt to develop co-operation on a regional basis and have been moderately successful in this regard. Although our developed neighbours participate fully and actively in regional activities, it is our hope that they will progressively turn and identify themselves more closely with the South Pacific, of which they are a part.\n43.\tIn any comment on the world's economy, it goes without saying that there is some relationship between economic and political situations. It therefore behoves all of us, and more especially the developed countries, to muster the requisite courage and political will for the resolution of outstanding economic and political issues.\n44.\tIn terms of political issues, the Middle East problem continues to appear on our agenda. We believe that, because of the danger it poses to international peace and security, advantage should be taken of any initiative aimed at resolving the Middle East dispute, no matter how tenuous the chances of success may be. My Government applauds the bold and courageous initiative taken by President Anwar El-Sadat of Egypt. It applauds the statesmanship of President Jimmy Carter of the United States in bringing Egypt and Israel together. We have been encouraged by the response of the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Begin, and the readiness of the Israeli Knesset to approve the Camp David proposals. Whatever the short-comings of the Camp David agreements  may be, we cannot but emphasize its importance in the quest for a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem-a settlement that year by year appears more and more elusive.\n45.\tWhile we believe that the United Nations has an important role to play in the settlement of the Middle East dispute, we sense that only at times our own Organization itself appears to discourage a settlement, only too frequently by the use of extreme and bellicose language. We express the hope that the United Nations will play a more positive role in the settlement of this dispute.\n46.\tWe continue to view with concern the situation in Lebanon. Though separated by an immense distance, my country shares certain characteristics with Lebanon. We are a multiracial, multicultural and multireligious country. We understand the many stresses and strains that such a society is subjected to, and we sympathize with it. We have tried, with some measure of success, to build a community in which we identify and build on what we have in common. At the same time we encourage the development of those features that help to enrich and give added colour and diversity to our society.\n47.\tWe ourselves must work, and work hard if such a society, rich in its diversity, is to be developed. External influences or pressure will not help. We hope, therefore, that Lebanon will be left unhindered to rebuild itself, and thereby to re-establish peace and harmony in what was once a vibrant and dynamic community. Our participation in UNIFIL has been a useful experience both to our troops and to our country. We hope that our modest contribution will go some way towards restoring to the Lebanese people the peace that they have been denied for so long.\n48.\tOur involvement in peace-keeping in Lebanon prompts us to make one or two further observations. First, we view with some concern the continued presence of independent groups in southern Lebanon. The external support given to those groups has blunted to a considerable degree the effectiveness of UNIFIL. Moreover, this has also meant that the restoration of control and sovereignty to the Lebanese Government has been rendered more difficult. Secondly, we believe that the United Nations has a vital role to play in peace-keeping. There are those who have declined to support this particular and useful role of the United Nations. We regret the reluctance of those who are unwilling to support the peace-keeping efforts of the United Nations. We express the hope that there will be a change in their attitude.\n49.\tThere has been steady progress in decolonization, as evidenced by the continued growth in the membership of the United Nations from 51 in 1945 to an impressive 150 today. The latest addition to the international community is Solomon Islands, whose accession to membership in the world community is a particular source of satisfaction to us, not least because both our countries belong to the same region.\n50.\tMoreover, my delegation has noted with interest and satisfaction that some other Territories in the South Pacific will also be able to realize their freedom soon. In this regard, we welcome Tuvalu's accession to independence on 1 October and we have noted with interest the arrangements for the independence of the New Hebrides, as indicated by the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom [10th meeting]. We also note the forthcoming independence of the Gilbert Islands. Beyond the South Pacific, we have noted with interest the imminent independence of the Caribbean island of Dominica. These positive trends serve to reinforce our conviction that the United Nations is indeed progressing towards the total elimination of colonialism.\n51.\tWhile we welcome these developments, it is discouraging to note that there remain a number of Territories that are still ruled by foreign Powers. Some of these are progressing towards independence, while others including some in our part of the world, appear to have been forgotten, either by design or otherwise. We believe that the United Nations should ensure that all those that are under any form of foreign domination be given every opportunity to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination. For our part, through our membership of relevant international organs, including the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, we shall continue to see to it that this indeed is the case.\n52.\tHowever, political independence alone is not sufficient. The onus is on the administering Powers concerned to ensure that, concomitant with political development, socio-economic development is also encouraged. Only too often, socio-economic progress lags behind political developments. The unfortunate result of such a situation is that a politically free people is invariably condemned to a situation where it has to depend on massive hand-outs-a situation that, if allowed to continue indefinitely, cannot but destroy initiative, self-reliance and self-respect.\n53.\tIn turning to southern Africa, where it is evident that aspirations to majority rule remain unfulfilled, 1 shall cite the case of the international Territory of Namibia, the- prospects for the independence of which appear to have considerably improved, despite the unhelpful announcement made recently by South Africa that it will pursue its own plans for elections for the Territory in isolation from the United Nations. We hope that South Africa will abandon this unilateral approach and will be guided by the recent Security Council decision-resolution 435 (1978)- concerning the Territory's independence. It is important that the people of the Territory, including SWAPO, should be fully involved in the electoral processes leading to the independence of Namibia. My delegation reiterates its support for the Territory's freely determining its own future through elections to be held under the supervision and control of the United Nations.\n54.\tThe people of Zimbabwe, too, have yet to decide their destiny freely. We have noted with deep interest the diplomatic efforts that are being pursued to bring genuine majority rule to a people that for too long has suffered in the pursuit of its freedom. My delegation is of the view that the search for an internationally acceptable solution could be facilitated through continued dialogue and discussions between the parties concerned Measures such as an all-parties conference embracing the representatives of the people could facilitate the early attainment of majority government through peaceful means.\n55.\tBecause of our commitment to international peace and security, we welcome the successful conclusion of the tenth special session, on disarmament. The adoption of the Final Document [resolution S-10/2] by consensus merits special mention. Though encouraged by this development we are concerned by the continued existence of important differences, particularly on nuclear issues. Thus, for example, there continue to be differences regarding the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various geographical regions.\n56.\tIn that regard we support the call for wide adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the speedy conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The trilateral initiative taken by certain nuclear Powers in this regard is to be commended, and we call upon other nuclear and militarily important States to join this initiative. Until a comprehensive test-ban treaty is concluded, we call for a moratorium on all nuclear testing in all environments.\n57.\tRegrettably, we must as we have done on previous occasions register our opposition to the continuing use of the South Pacific region as a testing-ground for nuclear devices. The repeated protests by the Governments and peoples of the South Pacific to those responsible for these tests have been of no avail.\n58.\tThough we have been given assurances that the tests being conducted in the South Pacific are harmless, we continue to wonder\u2014if that is so\u2014why these tests are not conducted nearer to home. Recent reports that the inhabitants of an island in the northern Pacific which was used as a nuclear testing-ground by yet another metropolitan Power are facing difficulties, years after the tests were conducted, makes us doubt the veracity of the assurances which presumably are meant to assuage our feeling of concern and outrage.\n59.\tOur preoccupation with urgent nuclear issues does not mean that we should relegate non-nuclear issues to secondary importance. On the contrary, we believe that appropriate agreements on such questions as the prohibition of the use of chemical and radiological weapons must be concluded as soon as possible. Similarly, we feel that urgent measures are required to curb the ever-increasing transfer of conventional arms.\n60.\tA Conference of great importance to the international community has still not concluded its work. I refer to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which has dragged on for some years. What is disturbing to us is that the bulk of the work has been completed but as to the remaining- portion there are divergences of views and positions which appear almost insurmountable. We believe we must guard against the possibility that this small but important part of the negotiation might ruin the monumental and far-reaching work on which agreement has already been reached by the Conference. The protracted negotiation associated with this Conference has led some States to lose patience and, to a degree, confidence that there will ever be a successful conclusion. We appeal to those who have decided to enact unilateral legislation which is not consonant with the present negotiation to think again. Such a step could only impede the successful conclusion of the Conference. Moreover, it would merely add to the widening gap in our dialogue towards the establishment of a New International Economic Order.\n61.\tFiji, like many other countries in the South Pacific, is highly dependent on the resources of the sea because of its limited land area and its limited resources. Keeping strictly within the present development in the Conference on the Law of the Sea, our Government took the first step to bring into effect the Marine Spaces Act passed by our Parliament in December 1977, by declaring the establishment of an archipelagic regime for Fiji. The archipelagic regime has restored to us the geographic unity of our country. In declaring such a regime, the Marine Spaces Act guarantees the right of navigation in and flight over the archipelagic waters.\n62.\tThe final step in the completion of the implementation of the Marine Spaces Act will be the declaration by my Government of a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. The present declaration is limited to the establishment of an archipelagic regime. However, it is the intention of my Government to declare a 200-mile exclusive economic zone as soon as it is in a position where full effect can be given to our right to explore, exploit, conserve and manage the natural resources, both living and non-living, of Fiji's exclusive economic zone, including its sea-bed and subsoil. Among preparatory actions my Government is now taking is the initiation of consultations with neighbouring Pacific countries with which Fiji will have overlapping exclusive economic zones.\n63.\tMoreover, the countries members of the South Pacific Forum are at present involved in difficult negotiations to establish a South Pacific fisheries agency to manage and give advice on the living resources within the jurisdiction of the Forum countries. It is our sincere hope that, with the co-operation and understanding of major fishing and other metropolitan interests in the SoJth Pacific, the Governments of Forum members will be able to conclude a-treaty which will serve the best interests of the region.\n64.\tFish are one of the most important resources in the economy of the island countries of the South Pacific. The negotiations for a regional fisheries agency started with high hopes. However, we have now reached a situation where the formation of such an agency is threatened. The main reason for this sorry state of affairs has been the wish of a dominant Power foreign to the region to join the agency on its own terms.\n65.\t\tIn our statement last year we referred to the fact that colonialism is not dead but has merely taken on new forms and new manifestations. We view this attempt of a foreign Power to join the South Pacific fisheries agency as yet another attempt to dominate our region and to dictate to us the terms and conditions in which we should run our affairs.\n66.\tIt remains for me to express my Government's appreciation to Secretary-General Waldheim for his untiring efforts in the cause of peace and to assure him and his colleagues of our support.\n67.\tAs we observe the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, my Government pays a tribute to the United Nations for its efforts in this important field during the past three decades. This expression of felicitations is tinged with some measure of regret and concern and some disappointment at the continued and unabated violations of human rights in so many parts of the world. It expresses the hope that the next 30 years will see a vast improvement in this regard. I believe that it is appropriate that I should conclude this statement by quoting from the late Pope John XXIII, who in his Encyclical Letter Pacem in Terris, had this to say:\n\\\"An act of the highest importance performed by the United Nations Organization was the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, approved in the General Assembly of December 10, 1948 ...\n\\\".. .the Document represents an important step on the path towards the juridical-political organisation of the world Community. For in it, in most solemn form, the dignity of a person is acknowledged to all human beings; and as a consequence there is proclaimed, as a fundamental right, the right of free movement in the search for truth and in the attainment of moral good and of justice, and also the right to a dignified life. \n\n\n\n"

Mr. President,\non behalf of the Tanzanian delegation I offer you my\nsincere congratulations on your unanimous election to and .\nassumption of the high office of President of the General\nAssembly. Your personal qualifications and experience\nguarantee that you will guide the Assembly to a successful\nconclusion. The Tanzanian delegation is glad to welcome\nyou, and pledges its co-operation in the smooth and\nsuccessful discharge of your responsibilities.\n2. Allow me also to take this opportunity to pay a tribute\nto your predecessor, Ambassador Mojsov of Yugoslavia, for\nthe distinguished service he gave this Organization as\nPresident of the last General Assembly session and the three\nspecial sessions over which he presided. We are both proud\nof and indebted to him.\n3. This year yet another nation was born, an important\nevent in the process of decolonization. The Tanzanian\ndelegation joins other members of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly in rejoicing over the attainment of'\nindependence by Solomon Islands and in extending a warm\nwelcome to this one' hundred and fiftieth Member of the\nUnited Nations.\n4. I wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kurt Waldheim, for his succinct and penetrating survey\nand analysis of developments in the period since the last\nsession which was contained in his report on the work of\nthe Organization. His statement provides a useful\nstarting-point for, an assessment of the international situation.\n5. I wish to underscore in particular the timely warning of\nincreasing areas of frustration to which the world community\nis daily subjected. We would like first to agree with\n\n\n\nthe Secretary-General that, in spite of the many frustrations experienced\u2014and indeed because of them\u2014we cannot afford to succumb to cynical pessimism, for our peoples want to live, and they aspire to the better life this Organization has promised them.\n6.\tAction to banish these frustrations can come if and when all concerned have woken up to the reality not only of the perilous precipice on which the very survival of .all mankind is delicately balanced but also of the general unhealthy physical and psychological conditions in which both poor and rich, powerful and weak, are being engulfed. The future is bright and secure either for all or for none.\n7.\tThe international environment is at present most unfavourable for the development needs of the developing countries. The increasingly severe economic crisis\u2014including widespread unemployment, galloping inflation, currency fluctuations, instability in commodity earnings, indebtedness and protectionist tendencies in international trade continues to place serious constraints on the development efforts of the developing countries. All evidence suggests that these problems are manifestations of the malfunctioning of the present international economic system and its inability to cope with the new realities of today's world of interdependence. These are structural problems which require structural solutions through the establishment of a New International Economic Order.\n8.\tUnfortunately, the urgency of the establishment of the New International Economic Order is not often felt by some developed countries because of their satisfaction with the inequitable world based on selfish and short-term interests, as can be clearly seen from the disappointing record of inconclusive negotiations on various aspects of international economic relations. Thus, although the international community has the capability of redressing world imbalances and inequalities and the prescriptions for such problems are known, lack of political will on the part of these few developed countries has prevented progress in various negotiations on the New International Economic Order.\n9.\tIt is this lack of political will, for example, that is holding back progress in. the negotiations on both the individual commodity agreements and the common fund in \\\"spite of general agreement on the integrated programme for commodities. The United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities has yet to be reconvened after having twice been suspended last year without reaching agreement on the basic elements of the fund. In the multilateral trade negotiations and in the negotiations on the reform of the international monetary system progress is also negligible because of increasing resistance to structural change. The \nconference of plenipotentiaries on the conversion of UNIDO into a specialized agency,  failed to adopt a constitution for UNIDO as a specialized agency because of opposition from some developed countries.\n10.\tWhat is more disappointing, however, is that even where general agreement has been reached, procedural arguments are applied as a pretext for inaction. The most recent example of these delaying tactics was manifested during the inconclusive sessions of the Committee of the Whole or the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174. While the contents of that resolution, including the mandate of the Committee, were negotiated by all interested parties and adopted by the General Assembly by consensus, some developed countries have chosen to associate the mandate of the Committee with only one function, to the exclusion of the other three. We are told that the Committee should merely engage in periodic exchanges of views on the problems of the world economy without reaching formal agreements. These negative attitudes have led to the inability of the international community to agree even on the mandate of the body for continuing the North-South dialogue.\n11.\tThe North-South dialogue can produce concrete results only if all parties are prepared to engage in genuine negotiations with the necessary political commitment to establish just and equitable economic relations among nations. The disappointing results of the negotiations taking place in various forum?, dearly demonstrate that certain developed countries are not yet prepared to part with the privilege derived from the present unjust system.\n12.\tThe Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] recognizes the interrelationship between the prosperity of the developed countries and the growth and development of the developing countries and that the two can no longer be isolated. It also follows, therefore, that those who use political and economic barriers to delay or even prevent the establishment of the New International Economic Order are by their actions creating obstacles to growth and prosperity for all mankind. The international community will be justified in holding those people responsible for the lack of progress in the establishment of the New International Economic Order and for whatever consequences their actions may have on relations among nations and on the world community as a whole. In this respect it must be recognized that the tolerance of the masses of people condemned to the vicious circle of poverty and malnutrition has its own limitations.\n13.\tThe struggle for the establishment of the New International Economic Order has been given new momentum by the conclusions and recommendations of the recently concluded United Nations Conference on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries. My Government\n\nbelieves that implementation of the Plan of Action adopted by that Conference,  which we hope will receive the unanimous support of this Assembly, would contribute significantly to our search for peace, justice and equality.\n14.\tWe recognize that the primary objective of technical co-operation among developing countries is to promote the development of the developing countries on the basis of national and collective self-reliance and thereby improve the living standards of the peoples of the third world. But we also view technical co-operation among developing countries as one of the important instruments which should be applied in the process of restructuring the present international economic system, which has been not only the source of the sharp contrasts between the affluent countries of the North and the poor countries of the South but also a major obstacle to the development efforts of the developing countries. It is because of this interrelationship between national development efforts and the external environment which affects such efforts that we consider collective self-reliance and the establishment of the New International Economic Order to be complementary.\n15.\tIf change in the economic relations of nations is a problem because it involves some form of sacrifice, the same cannot be said of the refusal of the developed countries to place the wealth from minerals of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction at the disposal of an international institution to help the developing countries. Yet even over that common heritage of mankind there rages in the current Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea a desperate tug of war between the developed countries and the developing countries, because the developed countries will not give up the prospect of adding more wealth to their existing wealth, with almost total indifference to the plight of the millions of the destitute who make up the vast majority of the third world.\n16.\tThe total liberation of our continent remains the overriding concern of Tanzania's external policy, and for this reason the deteriorating situation in southern Africa .has become an increasing preoccupation.\n17.\tThere continue to exist two. paths to decolonization and the establishment of majority rule in southern Africa. The people there have' to take up arms and violently overthrow their oppressors in Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa, or, in the face of a disposition by the minority regime to agree to a transfer of power to the majority of the population, take the path of negotiated settlement. The two alternatives are not parallel and mutually exclusive; they may\\\" in fact be complementary. We for our part have always pursued both.\n18.\tIn Zimbabwe, the Anglo-American proposals  offered a framework for a negotiated settlement. The possibility of this was endorsed by the front-line States, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations, which later authorized the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Representative. At present these proposals are seriously eroded, for negotiations within their framework have been either haphazard or unprincipled. Our support for them was contingent on two prerequisites. The first is that Smith has to go. He cannot be a part of the solution of the problem. Rather, he has been the problem. The second is that his power structure\u2014and especially his army of oppression\u2014has to be dismantled and a new army of an independent Zimbabwe built with the freedom fighters of the Patriotic Front as its base.\n19.\tSmith's response to the Anglo-American proposals was the internal settlement of 3 March, which denied those two prerequisites. In view of the orchestrated drama of momentum, vacillation and indecision of the past few months, I wish to stress that those two prerequisites are the key to a successful negotiated settlement. We do not that the participation of any black leaders in an in settlement will bring about independence based on majority rule and in conditions of peace and stability.\n20.\tWe support the unity of the Patriotic Front. We shall work for the consolidation of its unity on the diplomatic front and that of the armed struggle against Smith's minority regime.\n21.\tIn Namibia, the illegal occupation regime of South Africa, after months of pretending reasonableness in negotiations for a settlement, has defied the five Western authors of their proposals.  It has also defied the United Nations, which endorsed both the proposals and their implementation programme.  Much is at stake here: the earnestness of the five, the seriousness of the international community, the word of the United Nations Security Council. The people of Namibia and of Africa see this as a test case.\n22.\tThere is no room for equivocation. There is an incontrovertible logic to these negotiations. South Africa must either comply with the will of the international community over an area of international jurisdiction or be made to comply with this will. For our part, we believe that this Organization has more than deferred to South Africa's sensitivities, to the extent that they legitimately exist. This time has come to resort to all the provisions of the Charter, especially under Chapter VII, to demonstrate to South Africa that the will and conscience of the international community must prevail.\n23.\tInside South Africa itself, racial tension continues to mount, and by now not even the white population could claim to enjoy mental or physical security. If at this stage in history anyone can still imagine that the blacks there will give up and resign themselves to the inferior status to which the white man has attempted to condemn them, it must be the result of total ignorance of the trend of historic events.\n24.\tThe only choice before all of us is between supporting the anti-racist struggle, which is sure ultimately to succeed, on the one hand, and equivocating, which only amounts to lending support, albeit by default, to the doomed regimes, on the other. However, the implications of our choice, it must be stressed, are far-reaching, not only with regard to peace and human life in South Africa itself but with regard to international peace and security. Even to appear to side with the regime lends support to the continued existence of the racist regime and with it a protraction and spreading of bloodshed and suffering within the beyond South Africa itself. We cannot cease to call on the Western countries, in particular, to reconsider their relations with that neo-Nazi regime.\n25.\tBeyond southern Africa, where undoubtedly colonialism and racism are in their most entrenched and ugly forms, there still exist a number of other countries and peoples suffering the indignities of colonialism. Tanzania's support for these peoples right to self-determination is equally firm, for the right of decolonized people to self-determination and independence is universal and must be respected as such. In this context, we reaffirm our support for, and solidarity with, the people of Western Sahara, under the leadership of Frente POLISARIO,  in their struggle for self-determination and independence and we pledge our unshakeable support to the Government and people of Belize in their legitimate struggle for self- determination and independence and the preservation of their territorial integrity.\n26.\tThe Middle East situation continues to pose a serious threat to international peace and security. The continued occupation of Arab lands, the denial of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the escalation of violence and civil strife in Lebanon, compounded by Israeli intervention there, have made the situation in the region even more explosive.\n27.\tIn reaffirming our firm support for the just struggle of the Palestinian people, led by the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], for self-determination and the creation of an independent State, as well as our unequivocal support for the termination of the consequences of the 1967 war of aggression, we wish to underscore the fact that these two elements are prerequisites for a just and lasting settlement in fee Middle East. It remains our considered judgement that the key to the attainment of permanent peace and security in the Middle East lies both in the resolution of the real cause 'of the conflict, namely, the attainment by the Palestinian people of their legitimate national rights, and in the refusal to give any recognition to the enjoyment of the fruits of conquest.\n28.\tIn the Mediterranean region, the problem of Cyprus has remained a source of anguish to us all, in spite of the serious efforts by the Secretary-General to help resolve it. Despite the setbacks that have so far always prevented movement towards a solution, we cannot afford to resign ourselves to total despondency, for in that problem principles of far-reaching implications are threatened, quite apart from the immediate threat to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-alignment of that country. Both communities have a stake in the defence of these principles and their nation. We cannot but hope that the two communities will finally come together for the unity, peace and prosperity of their nation.\n\n29.\tIn the Far East, no solution appears yet to be in sight for the Korean problem. The Korean people, of both the North and the South, want the reunification of their motherland and nation, peacefully and without foreign interference. Tanzania will continue to lend its support to these efforts.\n30.\tIn May this year the United Nations General Assembly began a special session devoted entirely to the most critical problem threatening mankind: the existence and further production of stockpiles of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, the tenth special session was a milestone in the dialogue on this problem. That session succeeded in drawing the special attention of the world to the peril of extinction that mankind faces and the critical choices the situation poses. But, beyond that, we are reluctant to attribute any substantive achievement to the special session.\n31.\tIt is true that the special session was able to produce a Programme of Action [resolution S-10/2, chap. III]. But a Programme of Action is no substitute for concrete action. The true success of the special session will only be seen when and if actual disarmament starts. Previous experiences and the continued existence of the crisis demand that we do not yet congratulate ourselves.\n32.\tThis has been a very eventful year in the United Nations' search for the resolution of many problems that bedevil our world. At the end of this year we shall be commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the historic Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet, despite all these efforts aimed at the resolution of conflict and promotion of a better and safer world, the state of international affairs leaves a lot to be desired. Indeed, at no time has there been a greater need to intensify our collective efforts to try to put an end to the injustice and tyranny that continue to afflict millions of people. At no time has it been more compelling to put an end to the escalating arms race. Indeed, at no time has it been more urgent to strive for a new political, social and economic order. More than ever before we must persevere in the search for a world of nations in human equality, prosperity and solidarity: a world at peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff102.\tThe Lesotho delegation wishes to add its voice to the congratulations of previous speakers on the unanimous election of Ambassador Lievano Aguirre of Colombia to preside over the deliberations of this session. This unanimity is an expression of the confidence this Assembly has, not only in him as a person, but also in the Government which he represents. We feel particularly honoured, because Colombia is a country which has established a commendable record in the United Nations struggle to -right the wrongs which plague humanity.\n103.\tI should also like to congratulate the other members of the General Committee and express the hope that, in the fulfilment of the various responsibilities entrusted to them, they will collectively contribute to the success of our deliberations. Their vast experience and desire for the betterment of the human condition will indeed be of valuable assistance to the President of the session.\n104.\tWe are indebted to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose profound wisdom has guided the work of the United Nations, and to the Secretariat, which has, in more ways than time permits me to enumerate, advanced the work of this world body.\n105.\tSince the founding of the United Nations, more than half the membership present today has been elevated to the glory of independence. It is in the light of this awareness that the Lesotho delegation welcomes Solomon Islands as a new Member of the United Nations. This is further proof of the success of the decolonization process, the subject of an item [item 24] of which this Assembly remains seized.\n106.\tThis session of the General Assembly is taking place against the background of an increasing international awareness of basic human rights. In my view this is appropriate, particularly as this year marks 30 years of the endurance of the profound vision that led to the authorship by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The concern for the rights of man at this particular stage of international relations is a development that has further aided the efforts of this Organization to awaken international outrage against the intolerable perversion of social justice, represented by the harsh poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy that afflict a large segment of humanity, and the equally intolerable nonchalance that has been for so long the hallmark of the attitude of a large part of the world community towards rights of the people of Palestine and the victims of white racist minority rule in southern Africa.\n107.\tThis Assembly must spearhead concrete action that will ensure that the vast resources of this world are not utilized to create weapons for the destruction of man but for the betterment of his condition. We must protest in clear terms against the irrational tendency of those States that have become the merchants of death and not the guardians of humanity's survival.\n108.\tWe are deeply concerned about the enormous over-all capacity of the existing nuclear arsenals and the qualitative improvements they are progressively undergoing. We are equally alarmed by the ever increasing stockpiles of conventional weapons and their widening distribution, which has added fuel to localized skirmishes and wars. The big Powers must be told in no uncertain terms that their spiralling arms race is no less than a race for the extinction of humanity and that their exploitation of local conflicts to advance their traffic in lethal weapons lacks the vaguest vestige of any sense of morality and is more than a tacit conspiracy to ensure that those already on the verge of death because of poverty are indeed assured of a speedy end through fratricidal battles and mutual destruction.\n109.\tThe continent of Africa is beset by numerous problems-social, political, economic and racial. While we appreciate, and are thankful for, the assistance we have received from various quarters, we agree with the views recently expressed before this Assembly by Mr. Gaafar Mohamed Nimeiri, the President of the Democratic Republic of Sudan and the Chairman of the OAU, that:\n\\\"... the solution of African problems is the responsibility of the Africans themselves. African determination and wisdom have seen the continent through many a difficult time before.\\\"[ 10th meeting, para. 33.],\n110.\tWe therefore appeal to all our friends, wherever they are, to help us to help ourselves-that is, to assist us along lines that will reduce our dependence on international aid and handouts. Given the means, we are prepared to shoulder the responsibility for our own development. We do not wish to be used as pawns in the ideological struggle between East and West and, by the same token, we do not want to be economically exploited under the guise of assistance.\n111.\tMy Government's development plans are aimed at the elimination of ignorance, poverty and disease, particularly in the rural areas. We have therefore noted with perturbation the annual report of the World Bank regarding agricultural production and food supplies.  Quoting the FAO, the report indicates that the 1977 per capita food production index was 10 per cent below the level of the period 1961-1965. The report further shows that the food deficit in developing countries, including Africa, is likely to rise to 145 million tons by 1980. This is sad news for the peoples of Africa, who saw political independence as the key to social justice and economic progress. It is our duty and responsibility to see that present trends in the agricultural field are reversed, if we want peace and political stability in our respective countries. According to FAO:\n\\\"Africa has the potential to attain and sustain rates of food production increases which will lead to higher but not necessarily full sufficiency over the next 10 to 15 years.\\\"\n112.\tIn the light of the foregoing remarks, we hope something positive will come out of the Tenth FAO Regional Conference for Africa, held last month in Arusha, in the United Republic of Tanzania. As far as food production is concerned, it behoves us all to strive for individual and collective self-sufficiency. Unless we achieve our food production targets soon, our economies will continue to falter as a result of rising food imports which, according to FAO, nearly trebled in value during the period 1963-1973. In this regard, we pledge our full support for the World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development to be held in Rome in July 1979.\n113.\tLike other economically backward regions, Africa stands to benefit greatly from the promising outcome of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, last month. Provided it is faithfully implemented by all participating countries, the Buenos Aires Plan of Action, which was adopted by consensus, could give impetus to the third world's demands for a new international economic order. As in the political field, the pooling of technical knowledge and experience by non- industrialized countries could have a tremendous impact on international economic relations.\n114. It is, however, time that we recognized the affront to the human conscience posed by the increasing disparities in the conditions of life in the developed and in the developing countries. The grim reality of this gap poses frightening risks for the human community as a whole and it is the surest invitation to acts of desperation, instability and the break-down of orderly international relations among the family of nations. The dialogue between North and South represents an appreciation of the risks involved, but not their removal. Dialogue, however welcome, raises expectations among the poor but has thus far provided no escape from the harsh conditions of want in which most of humanity is trapped, conditions that are universally recognized as defying any rational definition of human decency.\nUS. Those in the developed countries must therefore recognize that it is in their basic self-interest to ensure the speedy attainment of the objectives of the new international economic order, adopted by this Organization. That order is predicated as a minimal basic premise for ensuring social and economic justice, for the whole of humanity and peaceful and stable relations between the developed and the developing words.\n116.\tPeace continues to be an elusive goal in the Middle East. Events in that region have always presented a sharp reminder to the world that real peace is not necessarily symbolized by the absence of active hostilities. We therefore recognize the urgency of defusing the time-bomb in that area. In this context, the Government and people of Lesotho have observed with concern the critical situation in the Middle East, a situation marked more frequently than not by increasing divisions,  antagonisms and hostilities, as evidenced by the civil strife in Lebanon and, as always, by the precarious path between peace and war followed by Israel and its Arab neighbours.\n117.\tAnd it is because of these difficulties that we in Lesotho are prepared to lend our tentative support to the recent agreements reached at Camp David by the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Begin, and the President of Egypt, Mr. El-Sadat, as a step towards peace and security in that all-too-troubled region of the world.\n118.\tWe do so, however, in the knowledge that these agreements are merely frameworks, and frameworks by their very nature are fragile and unstable unless they represent genuine political will for peace. It is on the foundations of that political will that we must now build solid foundations. Many issues still have to be resolved: the precise nature and timing of the Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories; the agreements for the eventual autonomy and self-determination of the Gaza and West Bank by the people of Palestine; and the ultimate fate of Jerusalem and the Palestinians, whose suffering must also be assuaged. Courageous and determined leadership will therefore be needed to foster a spirit that will ensure that the compromises reached at Camp David are not dissolved.\n119.\tIn this context, the Government and people of Lesotho appeal to the people of Israel to treat the Camp David accords not as maximum and unwilling concessions but rather as a step forward to the ultimate implementation of the recommendations embodied in United Nations Council resolution 242(1967), a resolution which the Government of Lesotho has always fully endorsed.\n120.\tWe believe that the Camp David agreements have provided for steps towards dismantling the edifice of hatred, bitterness and distrust in which the people of the Middle East have been locked for so many decades, and that they represent rays lighting the way towards relations based on friendship, to the benefit of all the peoples of the Middle East. I can do no less, therefore, than appeal to all parties to show the admirable spirit, understanding and statesmanship that led to the first initiative of President El-Sadat in visiting Jerusalem, and to continue the spirit of Camp David.\n121.\tOn southern Africa, my Government welcomes the initiative of the United States and the United Kingdom on Rhodesia and of the five Western Powers on Namibia. It is a fact of political life in southern Africa that the Western initiatives are the direct outcome of the success of the liberation struggle. For too long the West, which has been the bulwark of support for the white minority regimes, has turned a blind eye to the inhuman treatment suffered by the majority of the peoples of Rhodesia, Namibia and South Africa. The threat to international peace posed by white racist rule has for too long been dismissed as the hyperbole of African diplomatic rhetoric. We warned while there was time; we urged, cajoled and pleaded for the West to use its clearly recognized influence over the white minority regimes to bring about change; but the Western response was always tardy and at best cosmetic.\n122.\tIn particular the United Kingdom-United States proposals on Rhodesia  seem destined to be buried beneath a bitter welter of blood and chaos as the Smith regime adopts one subterfuge after another to cling to power and follows one atrocity by a yet bloodier one in an attempt to halt the liberation process.\n123.\tAt the conference table the Smith regime has epitomised the worst kind of chicanery. It should thus come as no surprise to anyone that the United Kingdom- United States proposals are in abeyance as a. result of the attitude of the Smith clique. Indeed Smith's co-called internal settlement is nothing but another futile subterfuge to side-step the United Kingdom-United States proposals.\nThe Smith regime knows better than anyone else that it is witnessing the shreds of the settlement being blown away before its very eyes by the windy gusts of the liberation struggle. And yet it persists in clinging to illusory power.\n124.\tInside their country the Rhodesians continue their acts of mass murder and indiscriminate killing. Their catalogue of wanton acts of brutality increases with each day. Where they promised freedom of thought and association in terms of the illegal internal settlement, they now resort to mass arrests of leaders of liberation movements. They seek, not accommodation, but the creation of a basis for the destruction of the economic foundations of the country. They offer not a semblance of peace but a recipe for chaos.\n125.\tThe racist Smith regime, in yet another act of treachery, is attempting to widen the conflict with the liberation movements by mounting criminal acts of aggression against independent neighbouring States. Mozambique, Zambia and Botswana have become targets of the desperation of the Smith regime, and their innocent nationals the objects of the terror of mass bombings and brutal murder. The strategy of the illegal Smith criminal clique is to embroil the whole of southern Africa in war and inflame the area into the blistering inferno of a racial holocaust.\n126.\tIt is to the credit of the three neighbouring State's that they have so far resisted the temptation of responding to provocations of the Smith regime and have opted for policies of safeguarding the welfare of their nationals rather than entering into battle with that regime. Their response has been exemplary and they deserve far more support from the international community than the verbal assurances which they have received.\n127.\tThe initiative of the five Western Powers on Namibia has closed a sad chapter of 11 years of inactivity to give concrete meaning to this Assembly's resolution 2145 (XXI),. which terminated South Africa's Mandate ever Namibia. South Africa deserves little credit for the fact that freedom is now on the horizon for the people of Namibia. For 11 years it vigorously tried to dismember the Territory of Namibia on the basis of its odious apartheid policies. For 11 long years the people of Namibia were subjected to South Africa's illegal occupation, and it is only the threat of direct action against South Africa by the international community and intensification of the liberation struggle by SWAPO that has persuaded cool heads in Pretoria to accept South Africa's withdrawal from that Territory.\n128.\tSouth Africa cannot now demand sympathy for its continuing quibbling over the terms of the hand-over of Namibia. Its de jure responsibility for that Territory has long since ceased to exist and its duty is now to end its de facto illegal domination of the Territory. After its denial of the rights of the people of Namibia and its destructive military ventures in that Territory, its claim to an individual responsibility for peace in Namibia is flimsy and irrelevant. The responsibility firmly belongs to the international community, and in this context my Government welcomes the Secretary-General's report to the Security Council. That report is fair and balanced. It provides for adequate time for an electoral process to be set in motion in an atmosphere free of intimidation by the occupation force of 11 years.\n129.\tWe support SWAPO's insistence on the withdrawal of South African troops from Namibia. SWAPO started its liberation struggle in Namibia precisely because the South African Government insisted on its illegal occupation of Namibia and used its troops and their police counterparts to deny any free political activity to SWAPO and others In Namibia. Thus South Africa's insistence that the strength of the United Nations troops should be minimized while South Africa's troops are retained to provide an umbrella for political activity is farcical. Equally, South Africa's insistence that the electoral process should be advanced is no more than a naked ploy to give political advantage to its creations of the Turnhalle Conference, who, after all, have been allowed free political activity denied to SWAPO.\n130.\tSouth Africa must not be allowed to add further acts of illegality by imposing on the people of Namibia its own geo-political interests and denying them a peaceful solution to the problem of Namibia. Equally, it must not be permitted to create its own Turnhalle-type internal settlement in Namibia, as that would be a prescription for continued instability in the Territory.\n131.\tSWAPO has displayed its goodwill by declaring its readiness for a cease-fire in Namibia in response to initiatives towards a peaceful solution of the Namibia problem. Lesotho rejects in categorical terms the South African stand in reply to both the report of the United Nations Secretary-General and SWAPO's offer. South Africa has a clear duty to respond by turning away from the bad faith it is showing by its repeated objections to details of lesser impact in the package proposed by the Secretary-General. Pretoria must recognize that it has been the linchpin for the systematic denial of basic rights in Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa and that withdrawing its support for the Smith clique and relinquishing its illegal hold on Namibia will at the very least bring forward the promise of liberty for the vast majority of the peoples of these Territories and of creating a more suitable climate for the solution of internal problems, the complexity of which cannot be denied and the potential of which in terms of creating a-racial war of frightening proportions must be clear to all. What the people of South Africa demand now is liberation, liberty and majority rule and not cosmetic solutions to the problems of white minority rule.\n132.\tThe withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia is an act of reason and an acceptance of the realities of the liberation struggle in southern Africa. That is the lesson that the white minority in South Africa must accept. That minority should not commit the suicidal blunder of interpreting these events as a tactical withdrawal behind the fortress of apartheid. For it to do so would be to bury its head in the sand. It would be tantamount to an aberration from the human urge to live in peace and in circumstances that provide for the serene development of the; full human person.\n133.\tThe Lesotho Government welcomed Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which reiterates that the Council's objective is the withdrawal of South Africa's illegal occupation and administration of Namibia and the transfer of power to the people of Namibia, My Government calls on the Government of South Africa to cooperate in the implementation of the report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the initiatives of the five Western Powers. Failure to do so by the Pretoria Government will, at this late hour, prove its continued intransigence and exacerbate the growing anger and impatience of the international community. For us, I need say only that our position has always been clear. Our vulnerability is obvious to everyone. Our preparedness to support the United Nations Charter and our readiness to meet our obligations in terms of United Nations Security Council resolutions, however, must be matched by the readiness of the international community to meet its commitments in terms of Article 50 of the United Nations Charter. My Prime Minister said at a recent meeting of the Consultative Assembly of the Group of African, Caribbean and Pacific States and the European Economic Community:\n\\\"We have consistently warned South Africa that her actions and policies would sooner or later invite the international community to invoke economic sanctions against them and that she should abandon those policies before the imposition of such sanctions become inevitable. Over the years, Motlotlehi's Government has sought to bring home to the authorities of South Africa that her military preparedness was no guarantee for peace and economic stability in the region. Our warnings have been ignored by the Government of South Africa. At the same time, our support for the liberation and liberty of the majority of the people of southern Africa has not weakened.\\\"\nI should like to say, in the words of my Prime Minister: \\\"The international community has an obligation to countries such as mine in the event that embargoes are imposed on South Africa\\\". He also said:\n\\\"I should like to remind the international community that it is its duty to safeguard the basic interests of countries such as Lesotho which will inevitably be affected, should action against South Africa become unavoidable as a result of her continuing denial of basic human rights.\\\"\n134. It must be recognized that in the post-world-war era apartheid constitutes the single most monumental lapse of the human conscience. This Assembly has quite rightly labelled it a crime against humanity. My Prime Minister, in his opening statement at the Symposium on the Exploitation of the Blacks in South Africa and Namibia, and on Prison Conditions in South African Jails held in Maseru last July, said:\n\\\"The people of South Africa have been described as an imprisoned society. A black South African is nevermore than \\\"a step from the prison door. One in every four adults is imprisoned every year. Africans in South Africa are faced with a whole battery of laws that govern every facet of their lives. A stroke of the pen can rob them of their citizenship and dispossess them; the whim of a police official can confine them to jail without trial. Such is the array of apartheid legislation that faces Africans that they live in a twilight terror of arrest. Prison life has become part of the black man's experience. There are over 236 prisons in South Africa compared to 70 in the United Kingdom. In 1971 some 40,000 people were imprisoned in the United Kingdom compared to 470,000 in South Africa. South Africa's daily average prison population was 90,000 in 1971. By 1974 it had risen to over 100,000. This is the grim reality of unjust laws applied with unremitting brutality and vengeance.\\\"\n135.\tThe harshness of the apartheid laws and the brutality of their application are most clearly demonstrated in the statements of South African police officials. Colonel J.V. Visser, Chief of the Soweto Criminal Investigation Department, told the South African Sunday Post on 17 September 1978 that he was sorry that he had not shot Tsietsi Mashinini when he had the chance. The temerity of that admission is as astonishing as it is typical of the attitude of the South African police towards Africans. The rule of law is no longer in the custody of the courts. The white policeman is the law-enforcement agent, the court, the judge and the executioner. In 1975, 92 prisoners awaiting trial died in prison cells; in 1977, the record was 120. Those statistics do not take into account the numerous detainees who died in prison without trial or any charges being preferred against them. Nationals of my country have been victims of this criminal police attitude. Any claim by South Africa. to respect for the law is nothing less than an aberration from truth and a travesty of morality. Colonel Visser was asked by South African authorities neither to explain his remarks nor to justify his apparent disregard of the basic rights of Mr. Mashinini. I owe it to my own sense of justice, and this Assembly owes it to the high ideals of the United Nations Charter, to address a special appeal to South Africa to get rid of its Colonel Visser and the murderers of Steven Biko and other detainees.\n136.\tApartheid remains a blot not only on South Africa but also on the conscience of mankind. Each act of apartheid, every incident of brutality, diminishes us all. It is therefore fitting that we should all strive to afford the people of southern Africa better opportunities for self- fulfilment, self-respect, and the dignity and exercise of basic rights due to all men on earth.\n137.\tIn my view, that is the basic challenge to which this Organization must respond. It is the agenda for its action not for verbal palliatives. The report of the Maseru Symposium is before the General Assembly,  as is the Declaration and Plan of Action adopted at the World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination [A/33/262, chap. Ill], held in Geneva under the presidency of a Lesotho Cabinet Minister.\n138.\tOur willingness to act as host to international conferences on South African issues is motivated by the very deep concern that we feel at the continuation of apartheid, coupled with the very direct manner in which it affects Lesotho. We have sought to provide an opportunity to representatives from various regions of the world to make a close scrutiny of the evils of apartheid. In 1976 we were host to a meeting of American political and economic leaders and African Ministers and provided them with an opportunity for gaining a deep insight into apartheid from the vantage point of Maseru, Last year we were host to parliamentarians from the European Communities and the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and we focused on southern Africa. The Symposium to which we were host this year is part of our continuing effort in the direction of a close examination of what apartheid means for us and for our fellow Africans in South Africa. We are caught in the agony of the imprisoned society. We also share its aspirations to liberty. Our people suffer under apartheid laws in South Africa. Around the territorial land of Lesotho Pretoria has thrown the noose of a circle of bantustans. On our historic land those bogus States are being constructed to deny us any opportunity for the return of the land. On our present territory further encroachments are being made and, in blatant disregard of our territorial sovereignty, efforts are being made by Pretoria to cede our lands to its bantustans.\n139.\tMy Government supported General Assembly resolution 31/6 A which enjoined all Governments not to grant any recognition to South Africa's bantustans. Our support of that resolution was based on our firm belief that bantustans represented a terrible fraud that was being perpetrated on the majority of the people of South Africa by Pretoria. They represent nothing less than the loss of their birthright for that people. The blacks of South Africa are being herded on to 13 per cent of the land surface of South Africa  against their will. They are being stripped of their South African citizenship on the grounds that they belong to the so-called homelands and not to South Africa. They have become aliens in their country of birth. That is the callous face of apartheid. Those black leaders who have collaborated with the Pretoria regime in this treacherous and criminal act will not escape the judgement of the oppressed majority of the people of South Africa.\n140.\tThe Pretoria Government is not only continuing its policies of depriving the black people of South Africa of their citizenship but also implementing its inhuman policies of displacing Africans from their places of residence. Last year it was the cruel displacement of thousands of Africans from their homes in Modderdam, sent to Cape Town, in bitter winter conditions, and the white South African press denounced the Pretoria Government for the bestiality of its actions. This year we have had a repetition of a massive dispossession of Africans- who have been driven out of their homes in Crossroads, At the stroke of a pen over 2,000 Africans were removed from their homes in Crossroads. Their protest met with massive police action resulting in the loss of the life of at least one home-owner. That is the brutality of apartheid, the inhuman situation that this Organization and all countries which love peace and freedom have a clear duty to deal with.\n141.\tAs this Assembly knows, the response of South Africa to our firm rejection of its apartheid and bantustan policies was to close the south-eastern borders of Lesotho. My country deeply appreciated the reply of the United\nNations system to that irresponsible action. Security Council resolutions 402(1976) and 407(1977) were sources of great solace to the Basotho people. We were gratified by the deep appreciation that the missions sent to Lesotho by the Secretary-General displayed in their reports. To all the countries and organizations which contributed to the recommendations of the report in document S/12315  I wish, on behalf of the Lesotho Government, to pay a special tribute. Naturally, we still hope that the amount outstanding, which has still not been pledged, will be made available to enable us to resist the unfair pressures that are continuously being applied against Lesotho by Pretoria. For our part and as a matter of principle, we pledge to continue our policy of resistance to being a party to the bantustan fraud.\n142.\tToday we are host to over 700 black children from South Africa; that is part of our tradition and custom. We have always provided succour to those fleeing from injustice and persecution. Accommodating those children in Lesotho has inevitably led to special demands on our resources. We appreciate the help that we continue to receive from friendly Governments in this task of ensuring that those children can continue their education and live in circumstances in which their youth and dignity are respected.\n143.\tThe international community has a right to know that, even though the refugee community is safe in Lesotho, Pretoria has embarked on a policy of harassment against the people of Lesotho and the refugee community. It has stepped up its espionage activities in Lesotho to such a level that my Government is now left with no option but to respond with firm action.\n144.\tI shall not dwell on the various harsh aspects of apartheid. My delegation has instructions to discuss them in depth in the relevant committees.\n145.\tHowever, I should like to end with a vision of a southern Africa that this Organization must help to create and a vision of man that as we approach the end of the twentieth century we should strive to realize on this planet. In southern Africa, a region rich in natural and human resources,-we should strive to banish, for ever the myth of racial antagonism and achieve the promise of racial harmony; the promise that will give expression to the truth that no man, no race, no nation, no Government has a right to tamper with what God has bequeathed to us\u2014our common humanity\u2014for man and his condition. Let us make ignorance, disease, hunger and-poverty features of a bygone age and create, conditions for man to develop his abilities to the fullest.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff65.\tIt gives me great pleasure to express to you, Sir, my heartfelt congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. Your excellent educational qualifications, the high posts you hive held in your Government and the enormous experience you have gained throughout your work in the field of foreign policy will undoubtedly provide this session with wise leadership that will effectively contribute towards the attainment of its objectives.\n66. It also gives me great pleasure to express on behalf of the delegation of Use United Arab Emirates our gratitude and appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who\npresided over the previous regular session and the\nsubsequent special sessions with the efficiency and distinction that earned him admiration and respect.\n67.\tMy delegation is happy also concerning the admission of Solomon Islands to membership in the United Nations, and, as we extend to it our congratulations on its accession to independence and its admission to membership in the United Nations, we look forward to the day when the universality of our Organization will be realized through the liberation of all territories under colonial rule or foreign occupation and their admission to membership in the United Nations.\n68.\tThe United Arab Emirates wishes also to express again its appreciation of and respect for the efforts exerted by the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, to increase the efficiency of our Organization and strengthen its role in solving the problems of our contemporary world, which, failing comprehensive solutions, threaten the peace and security of mankind. We have noted with satisfaction the success of some of the strenuous efforts of the Secretary-General in numerous arenas. Among the most important of those efforts are his confrontation with the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the preliminary action taken by the Security Council towards Namibia's independence and the restoration of real authority to its indigenous population. While the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization (A/33/1] clearly reflects the magnitude of the challenges and problems facing the international community, it also draws up in a practical and positive way broad guidelines on how to confront those challenges and mitigate their effects in order to attain a final radical solution of them.\n69.\tIn his report the Secretary-General refers to an important and urgent question, namely, the need to replace the struggle for spheres of influence with a more civilized and more representative system of world order in which the nations of the world governed their relations and tackled their common problems with the agreement and participation of all, the weak as well as the strong [ibid., sect. II]. We fully agree with the remarks of the Secretary-General on this matter because we are aware of the effects of the destruction and calamities brought upon many of the third world countries by the struggle among the big Powers for areas of influence.\n70.\tThe review of the world situation at both the political and the economic levels since the previous session of the General Assembly is not encouraging at all. At the political level, we' note with regret the emergence of some dangerous trends towards reviving some aspects of the cold war. The deterioration of the situation in some areas is due to the lack of real progress in solving a number of dangerous international problems by eradicating their root-causes and to lack of respect for the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n71.\tThe development of events in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia still causes us the gravest concern. We are fully aware of the danger inherent in the continuation of white-minority rule in those African countries. We have strongly condemned the policy of apartheid practised by the racist South African Government. That policy represents a violation of human ideals and rights and a challenge to the United Nations Charter.\n72.\tWe welcomed the resolution adopted in July by the Security Council that embodied practical measures for the independence of Namibia its resolution 431 (1978). At the same time we called for vigilance and caution and the continuation of international efforts to force the South African regime to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions.\n73.\tRecent events have proved that our fears were justified. As expected, the racist regime in South Africa has announced its decision to hold early elections in Namibia in order to exclude the leading liberation movement\u2014 SWAPO-from the region and to establish a regime compatible with its policies and subservient to its interests in Namibia. Thus we notice that the Government of South Africa continues to hinder all efforts made both within the United Nations and outside it to achieve a peaceful solution of this problem.\n74.\tWe therefore believe that the Security Council is called upon to adopt firm measures, in accordance with the Charter, against the challenges of the racist regime and its disrespect for the Charter and the relevant Council resolutions, including the one adopted last Friday, resolution 435 (1978). We are all also required to lend all possible assistance to African liberation movements struggling to regain dignity for their peoples and their sovereignty over their homelands.\n75.\tThe region of the Middle East, of which we are a part, is still very far from enjoying real peace despite the efforts made both inside and outside the United Nations. My delegation wishes to reaffirm our strong belief in the universally recognized fact that the question of Palestine is the basis and essence of the Middle East question. It is impossible to solve the Arab-Israeli dispute without achieving a comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian question. Consequently we believe that any solution of this problem must be based on two fundamental conditions: first, the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem; secondly, recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, especially their right to return and their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent State in their homeland. We also believe that the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, should participate in any endeavour to solve this problem. Such participation is in conformity with the right of self-determination as well as with the principle of the inadmissibility of annexing lands by force. Adherence to these principles is the prerequisite for the achievement of a just and durable peace in our region.\n76.\tWe believe that the United Nations is now required to review seriously the developments relating to this question. By so doing, it can adopt new and effective measures to ensure the implementation of its numerous resolutions aimed at the establishment of a just peace in the region. Therefore we support the decision adopted in Belgrade by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries to convene a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the question of Palestine [see A/33/206, p. 133].\n77.\tThe continuance of the explosive situation in the Middle East threatens not only that region's security and peace but also the security and peace of all mankind. In this\nrespect, nothing is more indicative than the increase of tension after the brutal Israeli invasion of our sister country Lebanon. We appreciate the efforts made by the Secretary-General and his aides to accelerate the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978), which calls for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory and the deployment of UNIFIL to ensure the achievement of that withdrawal and the restoration of the legitimate Lebanese authority over its national land. But we believe that that Security Council resolution has not yet been fully implemented, for Israel is still creating obstacles and posing problems concerning the deployment of UNIFIL in the border area of south Lebanon through elements that have no connexion whatsoever with the legitimate Lebanese Government.\n78.\tWe believe that because of that dangerous situation the Security Council should adopt all the necessary measures to affirm and strengthen UNIFIL's mandate in securing Israeli withdrawal and turning over all positions to the legitimate Lebanese authority.\n79.\tWe have read with deep regret what appears in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization concerning the question of Cyprus. The report clearly states that last year was extremely disappointing in regard to finding a solution to the problem of Cyprus. Faced with that situation, we cannot but endorse the decision adopted by the Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries at their last meeting in Belgrade, which stressed the need for meaningful and constructive negotiations between the representatives of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to be conducted freely and without outside interference so that they can reach a mutually acceptable agreement which would protect the interests of both sides and guarantee the island's territorial integrity [ibid., annex I, para. 74]\n80.\tThe tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, has shown the increasing interest of peoples and Governments of the world in this vital question, which is inherently related to the basic objective for which the United Nations was established, namely, the preservation of international peace and security. For it is not possible any more to continue living in an atmosphere of escalating fear of the possibility of a nuclear war; nor is it possible to ignore the huge resources being wasted on armaments at a time when mankind urgently needs those resources for economic and social development. Although the tenth special session was characterized by the difficulty and complexity of negotiations, we may say that it produced results that could be considered as first steps on the long road leading to general and complete disarmament. The Final Document [resolution S-10/2], arrived at by consensus at that session, sets forth an integrated strategy for disarmament which can serve as a guide for all the efforts made on this subject in the future. The document also provides for the creation of international machinery to deal with all aspects of disarmament. We sincerely hope that the next special session on this subject will be able to achieve more progress in this field, thus paving the way for the convening of a world disarmament conference in which all the States of the world would participate.\n81.\tAft r it became independent the United Arab Emirates supported the General Assembly resolution on\ndeclaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. We have also supported all the measures and steps designed to give effect to that declaration.\n82.\tWith regard to the international economic situation, there is no diagnosis more comprehensive than that presented by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his opening address to the second regular session in 1978 of the Economic and Social Council.7 In his statement he indicated that the world situation was not encouraging. Although some positive factors occurred last year, the disconcerting results were much more numerous. The concern about the future is characteristic of the current situation.\n83.\tThe failure of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation and, subsequently, the failure of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, known as the Committee of the Whole, to find solutions to political and economic problems are reasons for pessimism. The attitude of certain developed countries indicated the lack of a genuine political will to negotiate. We feel, therefore, that the General Assembly at its current session should emphasize the need to push those negotiations forward in order to achieve the desired results.\n84.\tAt the current session our Assembly must ensure adequate support for the successful conclusion of the special session it is proposed to convene in 1980 because that session will offer an opportunity to undertake a comprehensive policy analysis based on the results of the international conferences held in previous years, as well as the results of those conferences it is proposed to convene in the future.\n85.\tWe believe that co-operation and solidarity among developing countries are among the most important elements leading to the establishment of the new international economic order. The United Arab Emirates has participated actively in development projects of the developing countries, both directly, through its bilateral relations, and through relevant international efforts, especially the Development Fund of the oil-exporting countries and other international and regional funds and institutions. My country also participated actively in the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held last month in Buenos Aires. My country's delegation endorsed all the important recommendations adopted at that Conference. We nurture the hope that the industrial countries will act positively and with goodwill for the implementation of those recommendations.\n86.\tThe United Arab Emirates reiterates its resolve to fulfil its obligations towards the international community. It also shares the just positions of the countries of the third world which believe in joint efforts and international co-operation aimed at the establishment of a new international order based on the principles of equality, justice and peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff1.\t Mr. President, speaking for the first time before this Assembly, I have pleasure in associating myself with the , tribute that preceding speakers have paid to you and to your country, Colombia, on the occasion of your election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly of our Organization. Repeated references to your wide experience as historian, economist and politician are, I am convinced, so many guarantees of success for our work.\nI wish to promise in advance the full co-operation of my delegation.\n2.\tIt is also with pleasure that I express appreciation of the very high qualities of your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia, who conducted the work of this Assembly with competence and devotion during his term of office.\n3.\tMay I also be permitted to recall the great dedication of our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose acute awareness of the problems besetting countries like mine led him in August 1977 to visit Chad to see for himself what was going on in the country, because the situation we have been confronting for some time has a direct bearing on the question of international peace and security. Mr. Kurt Waldheim believes in fact, and rightly, that, as he said in his report on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"The United Nations was intended, among other things, , to be the guarantor of justice and peace for all nations, and most especially for defenceless or small countries which would otherwise have no recourse in a world dominated exclusively by power politics\\\" [See A(33/1, sect. II].\n4.\tThe interest he therefore, attaches to the development of events in my country has won him the appreciation and regard of the people of Chad.\n5.\tMay I also take this opportunity to congratulate Solomon Islands, which has acceded to independence, thus becoming a full Member of our Organization.\n6.\tWe have always declared our faith in the United Nations and affirmed our desire to make a real, albeit modest, contribution to its work. On this score our position remains unchanged. That is why, like other delegations, we wish to express our profound concern at the most topical questions of the moment: southern Africa, the Middle East, disarmament, the new international economic order, to quote but a few.\n7.\tBut first, we crave indulgence and hope not to tax unduly the patience of the Assembly if we mention once again our own special concerns.\n8.\tAs we have already stressed on repeated occasions both here and in other bodies, we have never Concealed the fact that we have an internal problem in Chad and that that problem, alas, is at the roof of the unfortunate events that have shaken our country for 15 years, seriously disrupting our economy and aggravating our country's poverty. Nor have we made a secret of our conviction that a return to peace and a harmonious life in Chad and the safeguarding of lives, property and resources depend first and foremost on the ability of the people of Chad to agree to settle the problem themselves in accordance with the wishes of the people.\n9.\tWell aware as we are of the situation which we are best placed to judge, we have since the coup d'etat of 13 April 1975 made considerable progress towards a rapprochement of all citizens of Chad and, first and foremost, towards national unity.\n10.\tSince the Head of the State of Chad, General Felix Malloum Ngakoutou Bey-Ndi, made known the exact dimensions of the phenomena which were troubling the people of Chad, at the fourteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], meeting in Libreville, Gabon in July 1977, and since the delegation-of Chad echoed those feelings in the General Assembly of the United Nations at its thirty-second regular session,1 many things have happened in Chad. The most outstanding event is that country's entry into a new transitional but decisive phase in its political evolution.\n11.\tIn fact, one of the principle objectives which the Supreme Military Council and the Provisional Government which followed the coup d'etat of 13 April 1975 set for themselves was a return to a normal life through national reconciliation. Unremitting effective and positive efforts have been made to that end. Thus a number of emissaries have been dispatched, both to the Governments of friendly countries and to our fellow nationals in exile. Within the country itself the forces of order and all our leaders, wherever they may be, have been advised to preach national reconciliation and to be the messengers of peace. The Head of State himself, for his first cont. -is with his compatriots, was to choose the most troubled areas in the country in order to prepare the population for peace. He spoke to them in a friendly, frank and direct way, inviting them to reconsider their position and to participate in the search for a definitive solution to the crisis in Chad.\n12.\tConvinced of the firm intention of the Supreme Military Council and the Provisional Government to respect the rights and aspirations of all the people of Chad without exception, the Governments we consulted encouraged us and granted us their assistance. It was thus that, thanks to the positive and frank support of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Sudan, as exemplified by its President, General Gaafar Mohamed Nimeiri, the policy of national reconciliation led to the signing in Khartoum, on 16 September 1977, of the historic agreement between the Supreme Military Council and the Northern Armed Forces Command Council. That agreement triggered the process of a return .to peace in my country with the enacting on 29 August last of the Fundamental Charter of the Republic and the designation of General Felix Malloum Ngakoutou Bey-Ndi as President of the Republic and the appointment of Mr. Hissein Habre to the post of Prime Minister. The documents relating thereto are at the disposal of representatives and bear the following symbols: United Nations document NV/78/74 of 15 September 1978; and document S/12888 of 9 October 1978, of the Security Council.\n13.\tTherefore, there had been installed in Chad the Government of National Union which took office on 31 August 1978. It includes only two senior officers who have been discharged of all military functions or duties. That Government meets the deep aspirations of the people of Chad and has set as its main task, within the country, to fight by every means to defend our territorial integrity; to fight mercilessly against any secessionist trend in order to preserve the independence and unity of the nation of Chad; to have a constituent assembly elected which would establish new institutions; to institute a new democratic political life which guarantees the secular nature of the State, individual freedoms, fundamental human rights and the effective participation of all social strata in the administration of public affairs and in external affairs, to guarantee the unreserved adherence of Chad to the Charter of the United Nations and to the Charter of the OAU; to practice a foreign policy of friendship and co-operation with all peoples that love peace, liberty, justice and\n14.\tIt might be desirable to recall that Chad belongs to Africa. It is an African State which must maintain its place  in Africa and especially be understood by the African States. In this context the Government of National Union will spare no effort in the struggle for the total liberation of the continent, the strengthening of inter-African cooperation and African unity. It will pursue in particular its action for the development and the consolidation of relations of friendship and co-operation between Chad and its immediate neighbours, providing of course that the latter respect its independence, its sovereignty and its territorial integrity.\n15.\tChad also belongs to the third world and to the non-aligned group, and intends to maintain this position consistently and to play its role in the struggle for a higher world civilization. This means that the Government of National Union will practice a policy of non-alignment. This means that its policy will in no way be confused with that of any bloc, be it from the West or the East, and that its positions will not be dictated except by considerations of peaceful coexistence, the independence of States, just and equitable international co-operation, friendship and solidarity among peoples. That policy of non-alignment in no way precludes our taking clear-cut and firm positions on particular international situations, or the maintenance and strengthening of mutually privileged relations such as Chad maintains with certain friendly countries, relations that are justified by history, geographical considerations and mutual interests.\n16.\tThis has been a general account of the important changes that have taken place in my country and which represent, obviously, a decisive step towards the achievement of peace in Chad.\n17.\tHowever, if difficulties still arise, they are entirely the fault of a neighbouring country, which seeks to retain the northern parts of the country, which it occupies and where it maintains, through its enormous military might, a fratricidal war in order to have its expansionist interests triumph. It goes without saying that only the interference, the intrigues and the greed of that neighbouring country delay the achievement of total national reconciliation. In truth, what our neighbour in question is conspiring to do within our country goes far beyond what it cynically calls the \\\"Chad rebellion\\\" or \\\"the impossibility for the Government of Chad of living with its people\\\". Moreover, the best refutation of these allegations comes from those whom it calls the \\\"Chad revolutionaries\\\" and for whom it sometimes claims to speak. Those \\\"Chad revolutionaries\\\", last month, in a letter addressed to the ambassador of Chad in Tripoli, stated the following:\n\\\"To His Excellency the Ambassador of the Republic of Chad to the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in Tripoli.\n\\\"We, the members of the Committee of Foreign Affairs of the FROLINAT (Front for the National Liberation of Chad, Popular Forces of Liberation, Armed Forces), at present in Tripoli, wish to bring to your attention new tendentious Libyan manoeuvres which were decided on after the formation of the Government of National Union in the country and whose objective is to occupy by force the northern part of the national territory.\n\\\"Thus over 6,000 Libyan soldiers and their allies equipped with heavy arms and the most sophisticated weapons have been sent to points in Zouar, Ounianga and Bao to organize large-scale surprise attacks in the regions of BET (Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti), Batha, Kanem and Ouaddai during the Ramadan festivities. We therefore ask that you denounce in radio broadcasts this new flagrant military invasion by Libya and take the necessary measures to stop it.\n\\\"Moreover, we inform you that we are under strict surveillance by the Libyan authorities and do not enjoy our full freedom. All roads leading to the interior of the country are blocked by the forces of aggression. We thought it our duty to bring this information to the notice of our Embassy, because regardless of our divergence of views in the conduct of the affairs of the country we feel that this is a matter that concerns the people of Chad only. For this reason we are more -determined than ever to defend the territorial integrity of our fatherland and will not yield to any enemy a single inch of our territory. We believe the people of Chad are capable of settling their own problems among themselves and without foreign interference. Finally, it is our patriotic sentiments that have prompted us to provide you with this information in order to enable you to take in time the necessary measures to defend and preserve our homeland.\\\"\n18.\tThat denunciation of military aggression and Libyan expansionism clearly shows that the \\\"Chad revolution is now seething\\\" in Libya and not in Chad. In any case, the will to guarantee national unity and the indivisibility and secular nature of our country is something felt today by all true Chad nationals wherever they may be. They realize more and more, the dangers of. the Libyan manoeuvres. They feel that they are more and more involved in the national cause and will eventually triumph over the forces of evil.\n19.\tThe democratization of the country now under way, as shown by the installation of the Government of National Union, and national demands impose on us the sacred duty to defend our independence, sovereignty and territorial Integrity, as recognized by all States, the United Nations and the OAU, while hoping that the support and understanding of peace-loving countries will prevail over the pressures of all kinds that are exerted against some of our brothers.\n20.\tWe do not want an aimed confrontation with our adversaries although we have had imposed on us a war that conceals its true name. We simply wish to see our rights respected, to see respected with regard to. us the same principles that others claim for themselves. In this context we shall be forced to fight vigorously against those who attack us and to respond with .blows for every blow that we receive, in keeping with our aspiration to peace and our desire to live in peace and quiet, without which any idea of economic and social development would be illusory.\n21. The Republic of Chad has clearly shown since 1973, the date of the: occupation-by Libya of Aouzou, an integral part of our national territory, its readiness to settle the border dispute with that country through peaceful means,\nas laid down in the Charter of the United Nations Charter and the Charter of the OAU. Unfortunately, my country's wise attitude is interpreted by the other side as a sign of weakness. Thus, Libya continues, by means of ruses, blandishments and even bad faith, to deny that there is a border problem and always manages to ensure that any negotiations likely to normalize our relations with it fail. And yet it is well known that it has militarily invaded the extreme north of Chad, just as it is clear that it pursues an expansionist policy seeking to annex, in the long or short run, the whole Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti and Kanem region of Chad-approximately half the territory of Chad. That attitude of Libya, which we have denounced on many occasions, runs counter to the principles which govern relations between States. We wish to say clearly to our Libyan neighbours: put an end to your annexationist policy and to your aggression against Chad; put an end to your brutal interference in the internal affairs of Chad. Then and only then will we be friends, and that will be in the interest of the peoples of Chad and Libya and will also be in the interest of concord and entente in Africa.\n22.\tWe say too that it is the duty of all African States to understand, support and defend Chad's just cause, because the aggression of which Chad is at present the victim is not only contrary to the ideals of Africa, but also threatens other African States which are located very close to Chad.\n23.\tThe OAU, which has been seized of this question since the fourteenth session of its Assembly at Libreville in July 1977, continues to search for a settlement. We sincerely hope that a rapid solution will be found by the Ad Hoc Committee, made up of the Democratic Republic of the Sudan, the Republic of the Niger, the United Republic of Cameroon and the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which was set up for the purpose at the fifteenth ordinary session of the: OAU Assembly at Khartoum in July [see A/33/235 and Corr. l, annex II, AKG/Res.94 (XV)].\n24.\tFinally, we address a pressing appeal to the international community to do everything in its power to protect small countries such as mine against the desire for domination and hegemony of rich countries like Libya. Our Organization must assume its obligations and ensure for small countries like mine the peace and security they need to deal with .the vital problems, which beset them, namely, the fight against under-development and. the poverty accentuated by the suffering caused by the recent drought. Chad has enormous potential, but that potential requires vast means for its exploitation, and above all it needs peace, public security and the protection of the life and property of our people.\n25.\tWe wish in particular to remind those of the great nuclear Powers whose interests are more or less at the root of the kind of assistance and the; massive supply of the most murderous weapons with which they provide Libya, that by virtue of the principles they defend here, sometimes with heat, they should not abandon the countries which have no resources and leave them at the mercy of those which have too much, and whose warlike attitude is quite clear, as is the case with Libya. We have learned through the press the horrifying news that Libya in its expansionist and war-like attitude, intends to build a nuclear plant, it is easy to imagine the apprehensions of my Government in the light\nof such a prospect-particularly since that plant could use uranium from the Aousou region in the territory of Chad. We request the Powers which thus promote Libya's dangerous aspirations not to allow Chad and its people to be sacrificed to or enslaved by neighbouring countries.\n26.\tTo those internal and regional problems must be added another great concern: the constant threat to the survival of the whole of mankind. I wish to speak of disarmament.\n27.\tThe unbridled arms race of certain major Powers has led to the existence of incalculable means of destruction on our planet.\n28.\tIt was most appropriate that the General Assembly devoted its tenth special session to that disquieting problem. My country considers that that session was an important milestone in the disarmament process. It believes that the time has come to orient research on the use of nuclear energy towards peaceful ends and, above all, to invite the great Powers to refrain from imposing those weapons on certain States, as some recent agreements indicate is happening.\n29.\tOne of the criticisms we hear levelled most often at the United Nations concerns its inability to adopt timely, significant and effective measures to solve world problems. Threats to international peace and security which could have been prevented under the Charter have frequently degenerated into bloody conflicts difficult to contain. Yet, whenever crises arise, seriously endangering the stability of the world, it is generally the United Nations we turn to in the hope of finding solutions. What deserves criticism, in our view, is the fact that common decisions resulting from the concerns of the whole community yield in the long run to the limited, interests of some, instead of representing a definitive settlement of a particular problem. That is the reason for the persistent contradiction between the desire for peace, security and co-operation and the constant danger of a general conflagration.\n30.\tWhen we consider the reasons that led the nations to create this Organization we find that the United Nations remains a very valuable instrument for satisfying the legitimate aspirations of mankind. Therefore its successes or its failures depend first and foremost on the way we employ that instrument. To use it rationally we must make every effort to ensure that its system and principles, to which we have unanimously subscribed, prevail over rivalries stemming from selfish concerns. There are many cases which can be settled only within the framework of the United Nations if we sincerely want to avoid a war fir more devastating than the Second World War. The time has come to team the obvious lessons from the tribulations besetting the nations, of the world and to take steps to safeguard it before it is too late.\n31.. Southern Africa in particular is experiencing an explosive situation which is becoming rapidly more and more serious. The task of the United Nations should be not simply to prevent war from breaking out by resorting to palliatives but rather systematically to eliminate its causes, so that the oppressed peoples may live in peace, in other words, the international community must make every effort to assist them in their just struggle against the white racist minority regimes.\n32.\tIn Zimbabwe nothing has changed, in spite of the Anglo-American plan, which first and foremost had the objective of bringing to the negotiating table the main parties involved. Rather Ian Smith and his clique have been allowed to gain time and to use every ruse to render inoperative all the positions that do not satisfy them or their accomplices abroad. The delegation of Chad notes with regret the journey made by Ian Smith to the United States, which no doubt will enable him to obtain assistance from his friends in order to implement his \\\"internal settlement\\\" plan and thus stay in power. The lesson to be drawn from this attitude on the part of Ian Smith is that the manoeuvres of the Powers involved in the settlement of the crisis in Zimbabwe have made it impossible for them to face their responsibilities. For its part, Chad has not changed its position, which remains constant, and it expresses its total support for the Patriotic Front, which alone is carrying on a struggle that fully meets the desires of the Zimbabwean people.\n33.\tIn Namibia the peace agreement arrived at with such great difficulty with the assistance of five Western Powers has been torpedoed by the Pretoria regime. The plan adopted by the Security Council and resolutions 431 (1978) and 432 (1978) will thus remain dead letters, as usual. It is equally true that Namibia is regarded by the whole international community as on international Territory. Therefore it is our duty to resort now to every possible means to implement the decisions of the United Nations\u2014in this instance the Programme of Action adopted at the ninth special session [see resolution S-9/2].\n34.\tIn South Africa it has become mote and more obvious that not only have our decisions with a view to restoring the rights of the peoples not been implemented but the catastrophic situation in which the blacks have been placed is being aggravated. There is no doubt that, with a Vorster as President and a Botha as Prime Minister, the arrests, torture, assassination, hangings in prisons and machine-gunning of blacks in the streets, as in Sharpeville in 1960 and Soweto in 1976, will instance. The question is how long the world will put up with the apartheid regime, whose true intentions are only too clear. Those who, while frequently invoking human rights, at the same time refuse to apply the resolutions and sanctions against that regime will in the long run bear all the consequences of their perfidious attitude; because it is their attitude alone that ensures, the survival of the apartheid regime.\n35.\tIn other parts of the world situations as disquieting as those I have mentioned are still unresolved while the populations puffer. On these questions, too, Chad has adopted a position which is totally unambiguous, whether in the OAU, the Conferences of non-aligned countries or the United Nations. Therefore' it would be idle for me to repeat our position here, since it remains unchanged.\n36.\tDuring the post-war period discussions concerning international economic and social activities were held in terms of the problems and needs of the developed countries. Nevertheless, it is already two decades since the United Nations began to devote a great deal of its time to the problems of the developing world. That international solidarity-or, I should say, that solidarity among Western countries-which, incidentally, was characterized by the implementation of the Marshall Plan, does not exist for the international community when it comes to assisting the peoples of the under-developed countries, whose problems are greater, more urgent and more dramatic than were those of Western Europe in the aftermath of the Second World War.\n37.\tHowever, considerable progress has been made as regards ways of making the world aware of the situation of those poor countries. The proclamation of the First United Nations Development Decade and the first session of UNCTAD were part of that programme, which has been followed by three more sessions of UNCTAD, the proclamation of the Second Development Decade, the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly and a number of regular sessions of the Assembly and many other organs of the United Nations family.\n38.\tFor two decades, as I have said, all the problems of development have been referred to in the texts adopted by the bodies to which I have referred, but today those problems still exist with the same acuteness. We shall mention but a few.\n39.\tIn the field of commodities the deterioration in the terms of trade, which President Senghor has rightly called \\\"the new black slavery\\\", still exists. Resolution 93 (VI) of UNCTAD5 concerning the Integrated Programme that was conceived to solve the problem, still comes up against delaying tactics on the part of rich countries, particularly in respect of the creation of the common fund, which is its main element.\n40.\tWe venture to hope that the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities, which will resume its work on this question in November, will at long last find a happy solution to the problem. Similarly, we place our hopes in the fifth session of UNCTAD, which is to meet in Manila next year and which should bring in-new elements.\n41.\tWhile the developing countries themselves bear the major responsibility for development, external financial assistance is none the less indispensable. Regrettably, the 5 per cent rate of growth which the developing countries were to have achieved by the end or\\\" the First Development Decade, thanks to the transfer of external resources, has never been achieved. Under General Assembly resolution 2626 (XXV), a target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product was set for transfer of public assistance for development by the developed countries to the developing countries, but it is already obvious that that target, too, will\nnot be met, although we are now on the eve of the third development decade. At present only three countries have achieved or exceeded that rate. We hope, however, that the States members of the European Economic Community will keep the promise they made to increase the volume and the quality of their assistance within the framework of a general strategy for development under which the poor countries in particular should receive an increased proportion of official assistance.\n42.\tThe debt crisis among the developing countries is a. problem of great concern. The international community must take urgent measures to reduce the debt of the developing countries, in particular the least developed among them, whose development is already greatly jeopardized. On that point the ninth special session of the Trade and Development Board did not achieve the. expected results. Nevertheless, we hail the welcome initiative of certain rich countries to cancel or reduce the debts of some developing countries. For our part, we wish publicly to thank the Federal Republic of Germany for its decision to transform the loans it had made to Chad into gifts.\n43.\tChad's position on international monetary problems is the following. All countries should participate effectively and on an equal footing in the decisions and management of international monetary institutions. That means that decisions and consultations on monetary matters, which inevitably have an impact on the economic and social development of the .third world, should no longer be left solely to a small group of countries, even if they are the richest.\n44.\tIt is now recognized that technological backwardness widens the already yawning gap between the developed and the developing countries. Taking advantage of their progress in this field, the rich countries use the transfer of technology as an actual bargaining point, and' this is contrary to the relevant provisions of the Declaration oh the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)], the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)], and the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action on Industrial Development. In this connection, we place great hopes in the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development, in the preparation of which my country is taking an active part.\n45.\tCo-operation between developing countries has been the main concern of those countries since their accession to independence. Chad, for its part, is resolutely committed to this course, because we believe that strengthening such co-operation will lead the developing countries towards the collective autonomy that is: one of the very basics of the new international economic order.\n46. Technical co-operation between developing countries falls within that context. In this connexion, the recent United Nations. Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries was a step forward. That is why we support what it has now been agreed to call the Buenos Aires Plan of Action.\n47.\tWe hope that these problems that we have just mentioned, and many others affecting economic relations among developed and developing countries, will henceforth be discussed within the United Nations. That is why the Committee established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, known as the Committee of the Whole, was set up. We cannot understand why certain States refuse to admit that that Committee has this right to work jointly to activate the negotiations towards the establishment of the new international economic order.\n48.\tMy delegation is disappointed that a procedural impasse was reached in the Committee's work and that it was unable to agree on the interpretation of its mandate. The present impasse should not be used as a pretext by some delegations to take the North-South dialogue outside the United Nations. We must devote ourselves to reaching a clear definition of a new mandate so that the Committee may carry out the task of verifying the implementation of the agreements relating to the establishment of the new international economic order and the task of facilitating economic negotiations.\n49.\tThe international Organization has made considerable progress. Nevertheless, there are still many difficult problems confronting us and, therefore, urgent efforts are required to ensure that the appeals of the suffering peoples, of the peace-loving countries, no longer come up against a wall of silence. Let us, then, use the institutions we have and the tools available to us to achieve the goal we have been pursuing since the birth of the United Nations: justice, peace, security, co-operation and a better life for everyone, the powerful and the weak, the rich and the poor.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n1.\tOn analysing the agenda of the thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly, we foresee intense and delicate activity, in view of the complexity and vast number of the items included. However, we hope that in the course of the debates on such important questions ways and means may be found best suited to the solution of the international problems that we are all obliged to face seriously.\n2.\tMay I first, Mr. President, on behalf of the People's Republic of Angola, extend to you most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty- third session of the United Nations General Assembly, which is testimony of recognition of your noble qualities. At the same time, may we wish you every success in the discharge of your difficult and strenuous mandate.\n3.\tMay we also reaffirm to the outgoing President our highest appreciation of the brilliance and dynamism he imparted to the manifold tasks of this international body during the period when he was invested with similar high responsibilities.\n4.\tOur feelings of significant appreciation extend to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the dedicated efforts he has consistently made for the solution of the grave problems that affect the international community.\n5.\tIn the course of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, which took place in Belgrade at the end of July this year, we had an opportunity to state that the direct confrontation of many peoples with imperialism, neo-colonialism, colonialism,\nZionism, apartheid expansionism and the exploitation of man by man still constituted an indisputable reality of our era. Under these circumstances, the supreme aspiration of the peoples to peace is far from being guaranteed everywhere in the world, in that we still see continuing colonial wars, acts of aggression of every kind against independent States, inadmissible military interventions, the resurgence of the use of mercenaries, multiple plots against the sovereignty and security of States, foreign domination and occupation and economic plunder. All these factors are fostered entirely by the imperialist or neo-colonialist Powers.\n6. This alarming situation prevails, and will continue to prevail for an indeterminate period, so long as the Governments of a certain number of countries, which have already been amply characterized, do not strictly respect the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, the Charter of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the policy of non-alignment; so long as many of us are unable to achieve complete independence, taking our national resources into our own hands and using them for the benefit of our peoples and not for that of multinational companies; so long as there is not a categorical rejection of all forms of subordination and dependence, of all interference and of all pressure, whether political, economic or military; so long as it is not forbidden to establish military bases in the most diverse parts of the world, generally imposed or maintained against the will of the peoples concerned, and so long as those already existing are not duly dismantled; so long as all United Nations Members are not seriously and sincerely aiming towards achieving detente, general and complete disarmament and the absolute prohibition of the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, including the neutron bomb; so long as all do not recognize the imperative need to make the Indian Ocean effectively a zone of peace as long as all do not equally recognize and respect the rights of the oppressed peoples to struggle, by armed force or any other means, for national liberation and to choose the political regime that best suits them; so long as the astronomical sums spent on the arms race are not judiciously earmarked for the economic development of under-developed countries; so long as a New International Economic Order has not been created, in accordance with\nprinciples long established and enunciated.\n7. In the middle of this year, in this same place, the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, was held. Of the about 150 items on the agenda of this current session of the General Assembly, 14 are related exclusively to general and complete disarmament. This prompts us to make a few brief remarks on this problem of cardinal importance, although the Prime Minister of the \n\nPeople's Republic of Angola has already defined our position from this same rostrum.\n8. The trend towards achieving real detente appears to us to be predominant now, and this implies taking tangible steps in the field of disarmament. Thus, together with the efforts pursued to achieve agreement on the destruction of stocks of nuclear weapons, it becomes imperative for the nuclear Powers, without exception, to undertake to sign and respect the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and for the guarantees for the security of non-nuclear countries to be strengthened by the adoption of an international convention, in the same way, a treaty on a general and complete end to all nuclear tests should be concluded as soon as possible.\nIt is our belief, however, that the achievement of these prime goals should be accompanied by the gradual reduction of the military budgets of countries that produce the most diverse types of weapons.\n10. Nevertheless, we wish to reaffirm clearly that the principle of not resorting to force for the settlement of international conflicts should not in any way constitute an impediment to the armed struggle of peoples for their national independence or to the exercise of the right to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity against foreign aggression.\n11. For these reasons we regard it as absolutely necessary to establish now the requisite conditions or foundations for the holding of the World Conference on Disarmament.\n12.\tWithin this context of general and complete disarmament we cannot fail to mention the untiring and praiseworthy efforts made by the socialist countries, and particularly by the USSR, for the establishment of the most varied treaties and conventions aimed at preserving mankind from the disastrous consequences of the frenzied arms race and greater and lesser wars. If those praiseworthy goals have pot yet been completely achieved, this is solely and exclusively due to the patent lack of seriousness and sincerity on the part of the imperialist Powers, in particular the United States of America, which thus benefit from the fabulous profits made by their armament consortia.\n13.\tAnother question which also merits some reflection is that related to the promotion of and respect for human rights.\n14.\tWe start from the principle that in the constitution of each country Member of the United Nations the rights of its citizens are duly safeguarded. Every Member of this Organization has adhered to or proclaimed its respect for the norms laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Any action honestly intended to make human rights prevail where they are trampled underfoot is, therefore, legitimate.\n15.\tHowever, what we cannot understand is that certain Western Powers set themselves up as the great and sole champions of human rights when they themselves clearly\ndo not respect them. How, for example, can it be conceived that those which most frequently invoke the much acclaimed rights of man should be precisely those which, through their multiform support for the racist and Fascist Pretoria and Salisbury regimes, not only have ensured the survival of the criminal apartheid system, which constitutes the most flagrant violation of human dignity, but have tried to impede the national liberation struggle of the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa? Moreover, how can one understand the fact that they have not recognized the legitimate right to independence of the peoples of the Democratic Saharan Arab Republic and the Democratic Republic of East Timor? How, then, can the economic blockade against Cuba and the maintenance of a military base at Guantanamo against the will of the Cuban people be justified? How can one explain the failure to recognize the right of the Arab people of Palestine to recover their usurped homeland and set up an independent State and, at the same time, the massive support given to Israel, which enables it to occupy Arab lands, impose Israeli laws on Arab citizens and establish settlements on land which also is Arab? Furthermore, how can one justify support for the Fascist regimes of Latin America-in Chile, Nicaragua and Uruguay-in the face of the courageous struggle of the peoples concerned for their right to freedom? Where, then, is the morality of such champions? As we understand it, the campaign launched on this question is supposed to be against an alleged lack of freedoms in socialist countries, and hence is an attempt to discredit socialism.\n16.\tSince the People's Republic of Angola is an independent country on the African continent, it cannot fail to assume its growing responsibilities within the geopolitical context, both as regards the progressive development of political and economic relations and as regards the national liberation struggles.\n17.\tIn this respect, our special attention centres on the situation prevailing in southern Africa. No one is unaware that the five Western members of the Security Council have for some time now been devoting certain efforts to finding a negotiated solution to the Namibian problem through numerous talks held with the\u00ab South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], the front-line countries and the Fascist and racist Pretoria regime.\n18.\tAfter the Luanda Agreement of 12 July 1978,3 the requisite steps were taken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the progressive implementation of the decolonization programme for Namibia, as SWAPO has always shown a certain flexibility and a marked spirit of co-operation in order to achieve the desired solution. Moreover, SWAPO's proposal to sign a cease-fire with the Pretoria regime, which was duly authenticated by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on behalf of the Security Council, is clear evidence of its firm intention to honour the commitments undertaken. However, faced with the imminence of a Security Council resolution, the Pretoria regime embarked on a series of shameless manoeuvres aimed at compromising the implementation of the decisions of that international body.\n19.\tIn these circumstances the Government of the People's Republic of Angola considers that the unilateral decision of the Pretoria regime to hold early elections in Namibia is intended, as a minimum, to achieve the following purposes: to prevent at all costs the participation of SWAPO in a necessarily free and democratic electoral process; to impose a puppet government which would be constituted on a tribal basis and do its bidding, so as to prevent the transfer of power to SWAPO, the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people; to perpetuate the illegal occupation of Namibia and the inhuman exploitation of the people and natural resources of that Territory; to pursue its constant acts of provocation, violation and aggression against the People's Republic of Angola.\n20.\tAt the same time, the Angolan Government also considers that the putting into effect of the Pretoria regime's pernicious designs to reject the decolonization plan for Namibia, as set forth in Security Council resolution 435 (1978), will have grave consequences, both inside and outside Namibia, which will be the entire responsibility of the five Western Powers if they do not decide to act with due and indispensable firmness-of which, moreover, they have never given proof\u2014to ensure the strict application of the sanctions long advocated at various international conferences and in international bodies.\n21.\tIn view of the possibility that the Governments of the five Western countries may show their habitual timid and hypocritical attitude in facing this insolent challenge to the international community, we think that the appropriate response is perfectly summarized in the ever-timely statement made more than a year ago by the far-sighted leader of the Angolan revolution, when he said:\n\\\"Only through armed struggle is it possible to defeat the oppressive forces in the world. It is not through negotiations, through conferences or councils, that the peoples will determine their own future, because there is a struggle of interests, a struggle between classes now developed through imperialism and through the desire of just one social group to dominate all the others. Without armed struggle, the national liberation struggle would have no vigour in it. It must therefore be intensified.\\\"\n22.\tAnd, because the People's Republic of Angola is and will be by its own will a firm bastion of the revolution in Africa, no one should underrate its unshakeable determination to support SWAPO by all necessary means, and also the other national liberation movements, until such time\nfully attained.\n23.\tThe present evolution of the situation in Zimbabwe is no less disturbing. While it is true that the people of Zimbabwe, under the leadership of their legitimate representative the Patriotic Front, have achieved significant victories in their armed struggle for national liberation, it is no less true that there are ever more imperialist manoeuvres aimed at seeking to push aside the Patriotic Front or destroy it, to create differences among the front-line countries and to establish a neo-colonialist regime in Zimbabwe.\n24.\tIt was on the basis of the connivance of certain imperialist Powers and their agents that the Fascist and racist Salisbury regime saw fit to resort to the farce of the so-called \\\"internal settlement\\\", and also saw fit to perpetrate systematic and criminal acts of aggression against the People's Republic of Mozambique and, albeit on a lesser scale, against the Republics of Zambia and Botswana.\n25.\tIn these circumstances, winning national independence for Zimbabwe inevitably will be achieved through the continuous development of the armed struggle and, consequently, through the growing politico-military implantation of the Patriotic Front on its national territory. We reaffirm our unconditional, militant solidarity with it.\n26.\tIn its turn, although under extremely difficult conditions the African National Congress of South Africa is pursuing its politico-military action against the Pretoria regime, which before long will have to face internally a truly explosive situation. To the Congress, the revolutionary vanguard of the South African people, we express our full support in its struggle against the, odious system of apartheid and in favour of national liberation.\n27.\tWithin the context of decolonization, the total liberation of our continents and solidarity with the national liberation movements, there is a need for all Members of the United Nations to give serious thought to the courageous armed struggles of the peoples of Western Sahara, East Timor and Palestine, under the respective leadership of the Frente POLISARIO, FRETILIN and the PLO.\n28.\tAllow us to refer once again to the fundamental facts of the question of Western Sahara. The heroic armed struggle of the Saharan people constitutes the basis of permanent or growing tension among three non-aligned countries, and that has seriously affected the harmonious development of bilateral relations among some of our States.\n29.\tIn the light of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), the right of the Saharan people to self-determination and independence is indisputable, and this, moreover, was officially recognized by the parties directly concerned until 1975.\n30.\tAt the advisory hearing of the International Court of Justice held on 16 October 1975, it was clearly denied that there existed any ties of territorial sovereignty or any form of uninterrupted exercise of political authority, by any country whatsoever, over Western Sahara prior to Spanish colonization.\n31.\tThe mission sent to the Western Sahara by the United Nations in 1975 clearly stated in its report  that the people of the Territory whom they met were virtually unanimously In favour of independence and also recognized that the Frente POLISARIO was the predominant political force, thus acknowledging its representative character,\n32.\tFinally, the Madrid Agreement of 15 November 1975 was reached without Spain, the then administering Power having previously consulted the Saharan people. For these reasons, it is clear to us that any territorial claim over the Western Sahara is therefore illegitimate.\n33.\tAlthough we still hope that a just solution will be found within the framework of the OAU, through the work of the ad hoc Committee composed of five Heads of State of the OAU and the holding of a special summit on the question of the Western Sahara'0 we are convinced that it is now necessary, by means of negotiations and with the full participation of the Frente POLISARIO, to face up to the inevitable political solution, so as to safeguard the Saharan people's right to national existence and to preserve the region from foreign intervention.\n34.\tIn East Timor the situation is very similar to that in the Western Sahara. When the administering colonial Power withdrew, the Maubere people, already for some years under the leadership of their legitimate representative, FRETILIN, were preparing to assume full power, when suddenly foreign armed forces belonging to a member country of, the non-aligned movement invaded East Timor and occupied the capital despite the proclamation of the Democratic Republic of East Timor.\n35.\tSince 1975 the armed struggle has been considerably intensified. Despite the progressive increase of invading military contingents, which now number some tens of thousands of troops, and also despite the lack of external logistic base and the inconceivable passivity of the progressive community as regards military and financial help for the FRETILIN fighters, the Maubere people, relying on their own forces, undoubtedly control the greater part of the national territory.\n36.\tIt is important to note that after three years of war the. invading armed forces have not succeeded in eliminating or crushing FRETILIN, nor have they been able to beat them back further than about 30 kilometres from the capital. It is therefore imperative that the United Nations Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the non-aligned movement itself address themselves seriously to the grave situation existing in East Timor and that the democratic and progressive forces of the world express militant solidarity with the Maubere people.\n37.\tAt the same time, the gravity of the present crisis in the Middle East also merits particular attention in view of the high degree of tension and the military confrontations in that area. We are wholly convinced that this deplorable situation will continue so long as the legitimate rights of the\nArab people of Palestine to recover their homeland usurped by Israel and to establish an independent State are not recognized. At the same time, we believe that without the participation of the PLO in any negotiations on a solution to the problem it will not be possible to solve that grave conflict.\n38.\tFor these reasons it does not seem to us that the bilateral Camp David agreements  arrived at under the tendentious auspices of the Carter Administration can contribute to a just and lasting solution to this crisis that would accord with the interests of the Arab peoples as a whole and of the Palestinian people in particular.\n39.\tThe permanent hostility of the Israeli regime and the impunity it enjoys owing to the massive support it receives from North American imperialism, which permits it to commit multiple acts of aggression against certain Arab countries, prevents us from being able to conclude that these two could one day favour the just cause of the Arab peoples to the detriment of the sordid objectives of the imperialist Powers in that area, where Israel is the operative tool.\n40.\tThe heroic people of Viet Nam, an exemplary source of inspiration for all peoples fighting for national liberation, are today suffering fresh and treacherous aggression and provocations which barely conceal patently expansionist designs. We thus reaffirm our unshakable militant solidarity with the just and well considered positions taken with the aim of solving present conflicts through the correct method of negotiation.\n41.\tTo the fighting people of Korea we express our total support for their persistent intention to reunify their country by peaceful means and without any foreign interference in their internal affairs.\n42.\tTo the people of Puerto Rico we convey our full solidarity and our warmest congratulations on the victories recently achieved, as reflected in the recent resolution of the Special Committee reaffirming their inalienable right to self-determination and independence, including the complete transfer of all powers to the people of that territory.\n43.\tTo the Chilean people we reaffirm our unconditional support for their just struggle to recover their human dignity, freedom and independence.\n44.\tWe express our most heartfelt solidarity with the people of Nicaragua and their fighting vanguard in the courageous struggle they have been waging to achieve their legitimate aspirations.\n45.\tAnd, since the policy of non-alignment identifies with the liberation struggle of the oppressed peoples, it is fitting here to hail the holding in Cuba of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries and to express our conviction that that Conference\\\" will\n\n46.\tThe People's Republic of Angola will shortly be commemorating the third anniversary of the proclamation of its independence, and in assessing the efforts already made in this short period we can note with legitimate pride, as an example, that, in the field of education, one out of every three Angolans is studying. The number of pupils receiving primary education has tripled in comparison with that in the colonial era, and in secondary education the number has doubled. One hundred and sixty thousand young people and adults have already become literate, and 600,000 are taking literacy courses. In the People's Republic of Angola education is free of charge.\n47.\tIn the field of health., all medical and health care is also free of charge. Substantial efforts are being made to ensure that such care gives the best possible coverage to the rural areas of our country.\n48.\tWith regard to agriculture, the basic factor, and that of industry, the decisive factor, the state production\\\" units have been progressively increasing their output, thanks to the selfless efforts of our peasants and workers.\n49.\tIn the fields of construction, transport and fisheries, the results already achieved are quite significant.\n50.\tYet, the levels attained do not as yet correspond to the targets set because, among other things, it has not been possible to compensate for the material damage sustained because of the invasion of South African armed forces, which is estimated at $6.7 billion and for which compensation has not yet been forthcoming.\n51.\tThe people of Angola, their Party and their Government are enthusiastically pursuing the tasks of national reconstruction in order to consolidate the revolutionary process, strengthen national unity and defence, establish the Party structures throughout the country and build the foundations for a socialist society.\n52.\tThe struggle continues; victory is certain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The very name of your country is a symbol of this historic friendship I wish to assure you that my delegation will give you its fullest co-operation in the fulfilment of the delicate task which has been passed on to you by your most able and worthy predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov. And we are fully confident that under your experienced guidance the General Assembly will be able to achieve significant progress on the many important items on its agenda.\n216.\tThe Italian Government welcomes the admission of Solomon Islands to this Organization as its one hundred and fiftieth Member, and looks forward to close and fruitful co-operation with this new country. The number 150, and indeed the emergency arrangements made by the Secretariat to provide seats for all Member States in this hall, are evidence of the constant progress we are making towards the goal of universality of the United Nations. My Government considers this progress especially significant, since it is the reflection of the successes marked every year along the road towards the full implementation of the right of peoples to self-determination.\n217.\tI should like to pay a special tribute of gratitude and esteem to the Secretary-General, who again in the course of the last year provided an outstanding example of total dedication to the principles and goals of the United Nations. The best evidence of this lies in his masterful introduction to his annual report to the General Assembly. I am in full agreement with this historical analysis and his judgement and remarks on political, economic and social issues as well as on the as yet unfulfilled potential of the United Nations. In particular, I should like to express my strong support for his appeal to foster sentiments of human solidarity so as to overcome national self-interest in the achievement of global objectives\n218. The international framework in which our peoples have to live continues to be characterized by political, economic and military tensions.\n210 One feature casts a sinister light upon the whole panorama of contemporary events: the continuation of the arms race, which so far appears to be uncontrollable. The expenditure of $400 billion every year on the purchase of armaments is a shocking reminder of the frightening lack of resources available to fight poverty and disease. And it is not only the great Powers which are engaged in this senseless contest to produce instruments of death and destruction- this massive diversion of resources which could otherwise be used to promote development, in which it is not only the great Powers which play a part.\n220.\tItaly is convinced that mankind will not advance very far unless it becomes more generally and increasingly aware of the futility of any collective struggle for progress which is not accompanied by an effort to reduce drastically the sacrifice of resources consumed on the altar of a dubious security The results achieved last June at the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament give us ground for some hope, but much remains to be done if effective progress along the path of reducing military forces is to be achieved.\n221.\tThe special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament and the consensus reached on the Final Document [resolution S-10/2J have proved that the international community is aware of the major imperatives of our time. Today more than ever, security\u2014an inseparable component of peace-can be attained only through a process of appropriately balanced and verified disarmament.\n222.\tWhile encouraging this process, we are none the less convinced that the maintenance of the balance of power remains decisive for the preservation of peace and for the conduct of a constructive dialogue, especially in Europe. For these reasons, the Atlantic Alliance constitutes an essential frame of reference for my country. This frame of reference allows us to make an active contribution not only to the efforts to achieve disarmament, but also to the Vienna negotiations for the balanced reduction of forces in Europe.\n223.\tThe negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union for the limitation of strategic weapons are of fundamental importance for reducing the boundaries of the realm of terror. We would like to address an urgent appeal to those two Powers in the hope that the expectations of our peoples will find prompt fulfilment in their decisions.\n224.\tBut this prospect, although essential, will prove illusory unless it is accompanied by a responsible joint\neffort to reduce the areas of conflict and tension. If this does not materialize, the risk, which may be diminished in terms of a strategic confrontation, is likely to increase as a result of dangerous and destabilizing military interventions.\n225.\tWe feel bound, therefore, to appeal to the major Powers in particular to adopt this comprehensive approach, without which all hopes of peace, civil progress and economic development can only remain ephemeral.\n226.\tMankind cannot rely indefinitely on a balance of terror between blocs of ideologically opposed States if it is to be able to seize the great opportunities presented to it. Although it is true that, following the signing of the Final Act of Helsinki, we were unfortunately faced last spring with some disappointing results at the Belgrade meeting, a new opportunity awaits us, as Europeans, at the third review session in Madrid in 1980. We have strong hopes that progress will be achieved in the Middle East negotiations as a result of the Camp David meetings. Following other important meetings in the past, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU was convened at Khartoum and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries at Belgrade this year. Let us all strive to ensure that international events of such great importance do not remain mere episodes without positive results of equal importance and without bringing about those gradual improvements in the international situation which we all consider indispensable.\n227.\tWe are all aware of the existence of grave situations in Which regional instability, and sometimes open conflict, ate the result of the internal difficulties of newly independent countries coupled with massive foreign intervention. Perhaps certain tense situations would not have reached the breaking-point without the prospect, unfortunately well grounded, of such intervention.\n228.\tItaly respects the identity of the newly independent countries. We, the members of the international community, must adhere to this principle if we wish to provide a credible basis for international equilibrium and the progress of our peoples. This is the line followed by Italy in the design and conduct of its foreign policy of detente and collaboration.\n229.\tThe interdependence of nations should encourage us to avoid as far as possible polemics based on preconceived positions and to seek realistically and gradually the conditions for greater comprehension and trust. It would be disastrous if either one of the great Powers thought it could achieve world-wide hegemony based on the strength of its own military force.\n230.\tThe possibilities, the size and the political influence of the Soviet Union on the world scene should enable it to take part more boldly and with greater trust in every constructive dialogue aimed at seeking appropriate solutions for outstanding international problems, a task in which the Soviet Union must obviously play a major role.\n231.\tIn the meantime, the dynamic foreign policy now being pursued by the People's Republic of China has given\nrise to expectations, preoccupations and even open polemics. In my view, this is a development which reflects the specific needs of that great people and it is in the interest of all to encourage this trend.\n232.\tIndeed, the substantial commitment of resources which China has made in order to raise the standard of living of its citizens is in itself a contribution of enormous importance to the strengthening of peace and the development of international co-operation. The more the Chinese strengthen their relations of mutual knowledge with other peoples, the less marked will become that sense of pessimism as to the inevitability of war which has so often characterized Chinese views of the future.\n\n233.\tThe method of research and dialogue, to which we again draw the attention of this Assembly, is the only way to achieve valid formulas and solutions for the major problems which beset mankind. Through long and often painful experience we have learned that, without a general commitment to the achievement of harmonious coexistence among peoples, cultures and civilizations, there can be no constructive dialogue, and that, if a course of increasing divergence is followed even the limited progress achieved so far in co-operation and detente may be halted or rendered useless.\n234.\tIn this respect we must consider as a most serious obstacle the pretext of raison d'Etat to impede the free, fruitful circulation of men, goods and ideas.\n235.\tAs regards Italy, which has made a substantial contribution to the process of European unification, the global commitment of its forces to the building of the European Community reflects a specific necessity and a clear conviction. It is a commitment to a goal of integration which we consider also as an effective contribution to the positive development of international relations and to the maintenance of peace in Europe and in the world.\n236.\tThe basic objective of Italy's policy is, therefore, the European Community which is currently being strengthened by the prospect of new accessions and even broader relations, while the election of its Parliament by universal suffrage is now imminent.\n237.\tUnemployment, inflation, the large margins of unused productive capacity, the indebtedness of the developing countries and monetary instability have added disturbing elements to the general picture and have further impeded the normal development of economic and commercial relations among the different areas.\n238.\tIt is now clear that we are not facing a cyclic crisis. It is towards a renewal and reform of structures that our work must be directed.\n239.\tWhen at the United Nations Italy welcomed the principle of establishing a new international economic order, it expressed the intention to participate in a process designed to promote a profound evolution in international economic relations, and in particular to launch an effort of co-operation among all countries with a view to a better\nand more rational international distribution of labour and production. The negotiations taking place in the North-South dialogue must be brought as soon as possible to a positive outcome.\n240.\tSuch success may be one of the prerequisite . for the rehabilitation of the world economy and for the initiation of a co-ordinated and general commitment to surmount the crisis.\n241.\tWe are also profoundly convinced that the strengthening of economic co-operation will make a decisive contribution to the reduction of conflicts and tensions.\n242.\tI do not believe, unfortunately, that since the last session of the United Nations General Assembly the factors of instability have been reduced or have shown a tendency to disappear.\n243.\tNo progress has been made towards a settlement of the painful state of confrontation that still exists in Cyprus.\n244.\tThe tensions in Lebanon remain tragic and are likely to become even more so. The deployment of the United Nations forces as part of a laudable peace-keeping operation, set up by a timely decision of the Security Council, gives ground for hope that increasingly uncontrollable situations can be avoided. This operation, like all the other operations in the Middle East and in other areas, has the unconditional support of Italy, which has similarly supported all the United Nations peace-keeping operations carried out in the past. We hope that this essential machinery provided for in the Charter will command the increasing support of all Members of our Organization.\n245.\tAn intensive effort to reconcile the basic interests involved in the question of the Middle East was set in motion at Camp David as a result of the personal efforts of President Carter and of the response that he elicited from President El-Sadat and the Israeli Prime Minister. This may be an important step along the road that must lead to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace. In order to achieve that objective with certainty, we have always advocated the joint involvement and the contribution of all the interested parties. Italy feels in duty bound to address to each of them a pressing appeal to follow the negotiating approach. It is true that, even if this approach is adopted, risks and uncertainties will continue to exist; but it is also true that for a question as complex and dramatic as that of the Middle East there is no alternative to the gradual method of compromise and negotiation.\n246.\tIn Africa also\u2014and we are looking in particular at the events taking place in the Horn of Africa\u2014it certainly cannot be said that the causes of concern have diminished. We are convinced that the countries and peoples of that continent must solve their problems within the African framework constituted by the OAU. Although we are unwilling to pass judgement on intentions, we must point out that in the long run foreign interference is dangerous and fraught with growing and unforeseeable implications. Indeed, it is obvious that solutions based only on the intervention of military forces generate situations in which crises are bound to explode again.\n247.\tIn reiterating, as I did last year, Italy's concern at the serious crises which I have mentioned, I wish to refer\u2014in regard to those problems as well as to the others with which the international community is dealing and which are included in the agenda of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly\u2014to the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany in his capacity as current President of the Council of Ministers of the countries of the European Community [8th meeting, paras. 135-200]. On each problem he put forward analyses, evaluations, positions and proposals which exactly reflect those of Italy and of the other countries of the Community.\n248.\tIn connexion with the grave problems I have dealt with, which have their roots in the complex reality of today's world, we have heard, in recent days, words of admonition, encouragement and hope from the new Supreme Pontiff, Pope John Paul I.\n249.\tThe Pope has defined as an expression of his desire to be of service to humanity the participation of the Holy See in the search for better solutions to the major international problems, where detente, disarmament, peace, justice, humanitarian assistance and development are at stake. For this service the Pope has invited the co-operation of all in order to put an end, within nations, to the blind and destructive violence that merely destroys and sows ruin and grief and, in international life, to bring about mutual understanding among men and the pooling of efforts aimed at progress, at overcoming the hunger of the body and the ignorance of the spirit, and at promoting the advancement of peoples less endowed with material wealth.\n250.\tThe solutions we seek at the United Nations are the ones called for in that appeal. We want a better world-a world in which all peoples can choose freely their own destiny and can maintain with each other peaceful and friendly relations; a world in which a new international economic order is established in a context of equilibrium; a world in which each country is allowed to develop in a spirit of justice; also, a world in which human rights and freedoms are recognized as a sacred patrimony and in which the dignity and value of the human person are reaffirmed and defended.\n251.\tA few days ago Italy deposited the instruments of ratification not only of the two International Covenants on Human Rights but also of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [resolution 22 A, annex] concerning communications or petitions from individuals and has declared its acceptance of the optional clause provided for in article 41 of the Covenant concerning communications from States. Previously, Italy had already declared its acceptance of the optional clause provided for in article 14 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106A (XX), annex]. We are convinced that, just as at the national level the legislative recognition of a right way remain a dead letter unless a citizen is given the possibility of appeal, so the international protection of human rights will similarly remain a dead letter unless the individual is allowed the opportunity of upholding such rights before international bodies and unless any State wishing to do so can challenge any other State and bring it before an international forum.\n252.\tA few months ago Italy lived through a tragic act of terrorism when Aldo Moro was killed after his kidnapping in the course of which all the members of his bodyguard were savagely slain. From this rostrum where Aldo Moro, in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, on numerous occasions made significant contributions to the work of the General Assembly, allow me to recall his image, that of a great Italian statesman and of a man passionately committed, with all his strength, to the attainment of the ends of the United Nations Charter: a just peace throughout the world and the moral, civil and social progress of peoples.\n253.\tI wish to reiterate solemnly to the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, our warmest thanks for having worked so hard and with such generous personal dedication to save the life of this great leader of Italian democracy. I wish also to convey our grateful thanks to Mr. Mojsov, President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly, to Mr. Young who was the President of the Security Council during the month of April last, and to Mr. Mills, the President of the Economic and Social Council, for their moving appeal for the life of Aldo Moro.\n254.\tThis frightening episode and similar episodes which have stricken so many other peoples bring home a need which concerns us all and which is also prompted by the respect we owe to the innocent victims: the need for international co-operation in the struggle against terrorism. The General Assembly is already dealing with various aspects of this question and has entrusted study of them to appropriate committees. This is a need which is becoming increasingly urgent and profound. The Heads of State and Government of the seven countries who met last July at the Bonn Economic Summit Conference to discuss problems of economic co-operation gave expression to this need by addressing a pressing appeal to all countries to intensify and strengthen measures to combat such acts of terrorism.\n255.\tThe United Nations\u2014and its supreme body, the General Assembly\u2014is above all an instrument in the service of peace and justice between nations. The causes of instability in the international system can be controlled and adequately channelled within the United Nations. Existing conflicts must not be aggravated in this body but must encounter a suitable context for mediation and settlement.\n256.\tTo that end, may I confirm that Italy's action within the General Assembly and its committees is constantly inspired by a \\\"strategy of collaboration\\\", aimed not at emphasizing conflicting viewpoints but rather at always seeking, on every problem, a growing area of co-operation.\n257.\tWe wish to ensure that our work and the co-operative efforts of our countries will not remain isolated but will have the increasingly aware support throughout the world of a broad movement of opinion, a movement of peace and freedom.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff160.\tI should like, on behalf of the Sierra Leone delegation, to proffer through you, Sir, our warmest congratulations to Mr. Lievano on his election as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. Mr. Lievano not only brings to this high office personal credentials of high distinction but also represents a country, Colombia, and a region, Latin America, which have contributed in no small measure to the elaboration and development of the rules that bind our international community in its search for a better world. We are therefore confident that he will discharge the duties of his office with the necessary sagacity and patience.\n161.\tI wish also to record the appreciation of the Government of Sierra Leone for the singular contribution made by Mr. Lievano's predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, the President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. His was undoubtedly a burdensome task, since it was his lot to preside not only over the thirty-second regular session but also over three special sessions\u2014a task which he executed with-ample endurance, skill and fortitude. We are indebted to him for his contribution.\n162.\tFounded 33 years ago, the United Nations represents the latest and most complex of man's continuous attempts to find a representative medium that would harmonize the conflicting policies, interests and actions of a world of nation-States. As a part of this endeavour we meet here annually to assess the progress and prospects of that objective.\n163.\tThe search for that objective has continually been beset by trials and tribulations, sometimes giving rise to despair and cynicism, sometimes even casting doubt on the continued relevance of the Organization itself, which has also had to contend with cold war rivalries and other divisive forces.\n164.\tAlso our Organization, caught in the ebb and flow of the reality of international politics of competing military and ideological blocks, has had to make a tactical retreat from its primary responsibility for collective security. However, drawing vitality from its Charter provisions and sustained by a convergence of luck, acquiescence in its innovations and the sheer boldness of the character and personality of its distinguished chief executives, the United Nations survived the onslaught and set about transforming inter-State relations from one of confrontation to one of co-operation and increasing concern for the welfare of the individual. This transformation, in our view, represents one of the finest testimonials to the United Nations in its thirty-third year of existence.\n165.\tParallel and contemporaneous with this effort at co-operation, and once again drawing inspiration from its Charter provisions, the General Assembly in the now famous resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, converted into an article of faith the right of self-determination of all peoples, thus legitimizing the process of decolonization.\n166.\tToday, after 33 years\u2014a human generation\u2014the intensity of the cold war is diminishing, but it must be kept in check; economic development is the principal objective; while the elimination of colonialism and racism are the political targets.\n167.\tOn this note and on the threshold of the thirty-third anniversary of this Organization, the Sierra Leone delegation welcomes Solomon Islands to the membership in this community of nations. We congratulate the people and Government of Solomon Islands. We particularly applaud the peaceful transition from colonial domination to sovereign and independent statehood.\n168.\tHowever, it is in our view a matter of comment that in the closing phase of the twentieth century nation-States are still being born from colonial domination. This is reflective of the fact that there are still areas in our world where we have subjugation of man by man.\n169.\tIt is therefore a matter of deep concern to my Government that the racist and colonial problems in southern Africa continue to elude the solutions prescribed yearly by this Organization. The emergence of Mr. Pieter W. Botha, one of the most unrepentant hardliners of apartheid, as the Prime Minister of South Africa, can, in my delegation's view, only mean a further consolidation of the bastions of racism. If, as we believe, Mr. Botha will preside over the continuous denial of basic human freedoms and fundamental rights to the millions of blacks in South Africa in the misguided belief in the superiority of one race over another, the threat to international peace and security which that regime has always posed will assume greater and horrifying dimensions.\n\n170.\tBy continuing its occupation of Namibia, in refusing to withdraw unconditionally all its forces from that Territory, by persistently violating the territorial integrity of the Namibian people, South Africa exacerbates a situation that is already poised on the brink of disaster and violent confrontation of wider ramifications.\n171.\tOnce again this Assembly has to review its position on South Africa against the background of events that have occurred and the new information obtained over the last year. This Assembly must condemn the recent decision by South Africa to proceed with its own plans for Namibia's so-called independence. We firmly believe that South Africa thinks it can flout international public opinion because it knows it has collaborators, overt or covert, in certain quarters. Indeed, according to a list recently published by the United Nations,  more than 500 of the 593 companies that have violated the embargo declared against the racist regime are incorporated in only two countries.\n172.\tI take this opportunity to express the support of the Government of Sierra Leone for the recently adopted Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on Namibia. That resolution marks, in our view, yet another milestone in the search for a peaceful solution for Namibia's transition to independent nationhood. It is our belief that if all the parties concerned adhere to its provisions we shall be able to see an independent and sovereign Namibia in our midst next year, and this fact must be brought home to South Africa at all costs. The international community must prove that it is irrevocably committed to securing that objective. That having been said, let me take this opportunity once again to reiterate our support of SWAPO, which we regard as the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people.\n173.\tAnother perennial and thorny problem which forms part of the sad and disturbing motif in southern Africa and which has engaged the attention of this Organization for many years, is the perpetuation of the illegal regime of Ian Smith in Rhodesia. It had never been our expectation that the unilateral declaration of independence in 1965, which the world community had unanimously condemned and rejected, would have survived so long,.\n174.\tMy delegation, last year, even expressed doubts that an \\\"internal settlement\\\" as then envisaged by Ian Smith would ever materialize. To our dismay and against the better judgement of enlightened mankind, a sham so-called internal settlement was hurriedly hatched and, as we had warned, is proving to be an absolute disaster and the perfect recipe for civil war. Far from stopping the war, as the unfounded and empty prediction maintained, violence has intensified' and bloodshed increased to alarming proportions. The responsibility for this tragic deterioration of the situation must rest squarely on the shoulders of Mr. Smith and his accomplices. .\n175.\tIt is truly regrettable, therefore, to. hear Her Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs says as he did last week here [ 10th meeting], that Britain never administered Rhodesia, when ail the facts and the evidence are to the contrary. Indeed, the United Nations was seized of the problem at the request and on the invitation of the United Kingdom, in recognition of the fact that it was the latter's responsibility.\n176.\tIn the light of recent disclosures concerning the activities of certain multinational corporations, it is painfully clear that if Britain had faithfully discharged its responsibility in the enforcement of sanctions, in which it invited the international community to join, the Rhodesian rebellion would have long ago been quelled, especially in view of assurances then given to the international community that the rebellion would be ended \\\"in a matter of weeks rather than months\\\".\n177.\tWe reaffirm that the Sierra Leone Government will continue to support the liberation fighters and we acknowledge with gratitude the heroic sacrifice the front-line States are making in the name of freedom and human dignity. We salute them.\n178.\tI will not attempt to catalogue here the numerous and significant events that have taken place in the year that has elapsed since I stated in this Assembly  my Government's view on the disquieting question of the Middle East and the tensions there. We in Sierra Leone have followed with keen interest the various efforts deployed to sustain the search for an enduring peace, a just and equitable peace, in the Middle East. I dare say that the international community entertained some hopes of the far-reaching possibilities for peace which the historic visit of President El-Sadat of Egypt to Jerusalem nearly a year ago engendered.\n179.\tThe ensuing round of negotiations between various cadres of the Israeli and Egyptian leadership have, to varying degrees of intensity stimulated the world's hopes for peace, but invariably the results have been vague and inconclusive. More recently, the much-heralded Camp David summit meetings came up with accords that were interpreted differently even by the participants themselves before the ink was dry.\n180.\tAgainst the backdrop of all these activities, total peace in the Middle East remains as much an enigma today as it was a year ago. While we appreciate the endeavours of the Camp David meetings to bring peace in that part of our troubled world, it is our view that the issues involved embrace a broader and larger area than that covered by the countries represented at Camp David and that a much broader framework for a just, honourable and durable peace is needed.\n18L This incontrovertible fact merely underscores the burning need for an intensification of the peace efforts, the broadening of the representative base for participation in future peace negotiations, and, indeed, the need to keep in clearer perspective the all-important ideals and principles that motivated and characterized both the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n182. My delegation believes that peace is indivisible: it is either wholly kept or wholly sacrificed. There can be no half-way measures. If peace is to be permanent, if peace is to be just and equitable, if peace is to be honourable, the preoccupations and the inalienable rights of all interested parties must be catered for and adequately safeguarded. Our acknowledgement of the right of Israel to exist within secure and recognized boundaries stems from this belief. It is therefore one of the ironies of our time that Israel, at the time when its right to exist as a State is universally accepted, should be denying the same right to the Palestinians and subjecting the fulfilment of their just aspiration to possess their own State to the caprice and the elusiveness of protracted negotiations.\n183.\tMay I state that General Assembly resolution 181 (II) of 1947 posited the creation of two entities: namely, a Jewish State and an Arab Palestinian State with Jerusalem as a corpus separatum. It is our view that respect for the spirit and letter of that resolution is still today the key to peace in the Middle East.\n184.\tHere I shall reiterate what we have always believed, namely that the establishment and universal recognition of a Palestinian State is a sine qua non for permanent peace in the Middle East. We believe that the continued occupation by Israel of all Arab lands acquired by force can only serve as an impediment to the search for peace and as the source of perennial instability in that area.\n185.\tTherefore, while we commend the genuine exertions of those who have sustained the peace efforts, we caution that a generally acceptable peace formula in the Middle East must be predicated upon the acceptance and application of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination in a State of their own. :\n186.\tI now turn to the problems of economic co-operation and development; in particular, I shall address myself to those issues associated with interdependence and cooperation among various groups of countries. Those issues, we believe, should remain the focal-point of informed debate within the United Nations system. To begin with, the Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the Organization [A/33/1 ], has indicated that over the last year the results achieved in our pursuit of a new international economic order and the progress of the North-South dialogue have not been commensurate with the efforts we have deployed in those areas.\n187.\tThat frustrating experience exemplifies a persistent and recurring situation within our Organization, wherein problems affecting privilege and economic power, the hesitations which were indicated by some parties at the drafting stage, and the reservations that were voiced at the time of adoption have been translated into seemingly insurmountable obstacles at the implementation stage.\n188.\tAn instructive case in point is the fact that the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 has not been able to make much progress because delegations could not agree on a common interpretation of the thrust and meaning of the resolution that created the Committee, even though, in our view, ambiguity was minimal or non-existent.\n189.\tThe history of our Organization is replete with examples of such situations in which practical action has been rendered ineffectual and in which the Organization is crippled because interested parties holding different and even antithetical views put forward solutions to universal problems in an atmosphere of mutual recrimination.\n190.\tWhen the United Nations rose phoenix-like from the ashes of the last global conflagration, the international community was determined to \\\"employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples\\\". Since those early years, the words of the Charter, the phrases of our resolutions and decisions, have been given as many interpretations as there are interests involved.\n191.\tMoreover, the thrust of the early resolutions on the promotion of economic and social progress would seem to indicate that the advanced nations were concerned primarily with the rebuilding of industrial strength and material prosperity in North America, Western Europe and Japan, now collectively and elliptically called \\\"the North\\\" in our current dialogue. While it is true that the institutions conceived at Bretton Woods were designed to reinforce the traditional economic relations dominated by the developed market\u2014economy countries, it cannot be denied that since those early years the General Assembly and its Economic and Social Council have given some attention to the improvement and advancement of the economic and social welfare of the peoples of the world.\n192.\tThe General Assembly at its twelfth session noted an attempt to reaffirm the Charter principles and extend its interpretation to promote meaningful international economic development. This attempt was vague, indecisive and somewhat indeterminate. In the light of experience it can be seen that the resolutions adopted at its fourteenth session were considerably in advance of general thinking at the time.\n193.\tNotwithstanding the engagement and commitment which genuinely characterized our efforts, the programme for the First United Nations Development Decade [resolutions 1710 (XVI) and 1715 (XVI)] \u2014and, I dare add, the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] \u2014 remained more a wish than a policy. The net aggregate flew of financial resources from the North to the South was still desperately short of. attaining the targets specified in the Strategy, and, even though there has been an over-all increase in economic growth over the last 30 years, the promise of the 1960s has not been maintained through the 1970s, and the gap between aspiration and achievement has widened.\n194.\tPermit me to take this opportunity to record the appreciation of the Government of Sierra Leone of the decision of Her Britannic Majesty's Government to waive the debts of the poorest developing countries. In our view, this is a decision in the right spirit and direction. In the same vein we commend and applaud those other countries that had earlier done the same.\n195.\tThe adoption in 1974 of General Assembly resolution 3281 (XXIX) on the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States provided the moral backbone which we hoped would support the Programme of Action adopted at the end of the sixth special session [resolution 3202 (S-Vl)] and the impetus given by the seventh special session, and many of us looked forward with self-congratulatory expectation to the realization of what we believed was the beginning of a new international economic restructuring for a more equitable allocation of human and financial resources. Here again our achievement could not match our aspirations in spite of the show of goodwill evinced since then. The reservations that had been expressed by certain Members of the adoption of those resolutions led to hesitancy on their part, and that in effect created obstacles.\n196.\tThat means that it is beginning to seem to us in the developing third world that one cannot put too much faith in the willingness of the rich industrialized nations to help bring about any meaningful change in the conditions of living and the quality of life of the peoples of the developing countries. Developing countries are therefore continuing to devise a strategy for self-reliance through regional co-operation.\n197.\tNotwithstanding this assessment, the Sierra Leone delegation still has every confidence in the United Nations system and its ability to redirect its efforts, and to intensify them in those areas in which it has hitherto been successful, for the attainment of our objective, which is to ensure self-sustaining development, a better quality of life and widespread application of the benefits of science and technology.\n198.\tAllow me in this context to refer to the ongoing Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The sea remains one of the last reservoirs of the earth's diminishing resources. To decide how those resources should be exploited in an orderly manner for the benefit of mankind as a whole remains the primary task of the current Conference on the Law of the Sea. The Conference itself represents a determined effort in international co-operation to design an international legal framework that will prevent international conflict in our endeavour to exploit the sea and its resources. It is against .this background that the Sierra Leone Government views any attempt at unilateral national legislation to exploit the resources of the deep-seabed not only as unhelpful and inappropriate but also as an act that will undermine the work of the Conference itself and jeopardize its achievements so far. Such an attempt should, in our view, be deprecated.\n199.\tThe Conference has virtually concluded the bulk of its work, but the system of exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed and the determination of the outer limits of the continental shelf are among the outstanding issues that remain to be resolved; The Sierra Leone delegation therefore calls for a genuine co-operative effort to find a common solution in the spirit of Caracas. We hope that the present exercise will be brought to satisfactory fruition as soon as possible because the protracted negotiations to agree on a Convention have been a considerable drain on the resources of countries such as mine.\n200.\tOver the last 30 years the achievements of the United Nations in the field of development of international economic co-operation have been mixed. The Sierra Leone delegation is, however, confident that progress is still possible with regard to the establishment of a New International Economic Order. Within the framework of the Committee of the Whole progress can be achieved on the basis of certain' apparent convergences of common interests such as the interdependence of all economies and the need to liberalize trade practices, taking into account the interests of the developing countries. More important still is the appointment this year of the Director-General for\nDevelopment and International Economic Co-operation, an appointment that is the result of two years of difficult negotiations on possible ways and means of making some organs of the United Nations more responsive to the needs and demands of the developing countries. This is, in our view, a step in the right direction. It is our hope that the appointment of the new Director-General will ensure the effective leadership of the various components of the United Nations system in the field of development and international economic co-operation. My delegation further wishes to express the hope that the Director-General will be given the support of all the relevant agencies and the opportunity to exercise over-all co-ordination within the system in order to ensure an integrated approach to the problems of development and international co-operation. The Sierra Leone Government therefore looks with some anticipation to the special session to be convened in 1980.\n201.\tMy delegation sees a real contradiction between economic development, which we consider should represent a primordial objective of the United Nations, and the staggering cost of the arms race, which today stands at nearly $400 billion annually.\n202.\tOver the years, my ct an try, in company with other non-aligned countries, has increasingly realized the great threat to international peace and security posed by the continuous arms build-up. Furthermore, the arms build-up, even at this stage of the depletion of the world's economic resources, has continued to devour a huge amount of those resources vital for economic development. The military budgets of many nations, great and small, but particularly the major Powers, continue to expand in geometric progression.\n203.\tWhen, therefore, the General Assembly met in its tenth special session, early this year, the first session of its kind under United Nations auspices devoted to the question of disarmament, that marked the culmination of 17 years of an incessant call by the non-aligned countries for a world disarmament conference, and the session provided a ray of hope for mankind.\n204.\tEvery one of the 129 speakers who participated in the 'debate at that session perceived that the only sure guarantee of survival lay in disarmament and that the only war mankind can afford to fight now is a war of survival.\n205.\tIt is therefore gratifying to my country to note that the Final Document that emanated from that session [resolution S-10/2J also acknowledged that universal concern and provided for both a deliberative organ and a negotiating body with a large membership, in an attempt to tackle the problem more meaningfully.\n206.\tAlthough we view the special session devoted to disarmament and the results achieved as a cardinal event, we still believe that a great deal needs to be done to decelerate the arms race in order to utilize the resources released thereby for equitable economic development. In my view, this is one of the exciting challenges to which the world must rise.\n207. In conclusion, as the United Nations embarks on its thirty third year, with an ever-growing agenda before the\nGeneral Assembly, I wish to express my delegation's hope that it will face the challenges ahead with fortitude and vigour; that we all\u2014great and small, strong and weak, rich and poor, but nevertheless equally sovereign under our Charter\u2014will fulfil our obligations to humanity, will learn how to disarm and will in fact disarm, so that we may release much-needed resources for the benefit and prosperity of mankind.\n208.\tThe task ahead of us is not only to undertake and ensure the limitation and avoidance of conflict but, fundamentally and in the context of international action, to tackle and solve problems relating to full employment, the eradication of disease, the elimination of hunger and the application of the world's vast energy resources to peaceful purposes, to the greater glory of man. My delegation is convinced that our Organization is supremely and uniquely equipped for the performance of this task.\n209.\tI should like once again to pledge the faith of the Government of Sierra Leone in the United Nations and in its continued relevance to the world of our time, and we hereby acknowledge with gratitude the efforts of our indefatigable Secretary-General and his dedicated staff and the help they give us to enable us to move towards and attain the goals we believe mankind deserves on this our own planet, earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff176.\tMr. President, as we come to the conclusion of our general debate today I am pleased to follow the example of my colleagues by congratulating you on your election to the presidency, though I may digress from the conventional phrases which you may have heard too often, to say something about your country, Colombia, which is so dear\nto us. In fact, there is much that we share. The election of Julio Cesar Turbay, the son of a modest Lebanese immigrant, as President of your Republic serves to indicate two important facts: first, that the free democratic spirit which characterizes your Government, and which is enviable, is the only means of building strong, impregnable and stable societies; secondly, that Lebanon, the tormented Lebanon that seeks peace from the nations of the earth, is the same country that has given to many of those nations, indeed to all nations, not only great men but also a great number of modest, steadfast and diligent builders who contributed to great achievements and who, generation after generation have participated in the building of civilization everywhere.\n177.\tNow the nations which you represent are, in this session as in previous sessions, testifying for Lebanon in return for Lebanon's testimony to mankind. One after the other your voices have rung out loud and clear speaking in the name of the. ties that bind us together, demanding that we have peace, security, freedom and stability.\n178.\tYet Lebanon has been not only a country from which people emigrate, but also a haven for strangers seeking knowledge, freedom and beauty. The Roman philosopher, Pliny the Younger, once said of Lebanon: \\\"O Stranger, remember that the country you now visit is the country beloved by the gods.\\\" We do not believe that the gods have forsaken our country or ever will.\t,\n179.\tOur faith in the land and in man remains unshakable, as does our faith in God and our faith in human rights. This year in fact we are celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Lebanon played a big role in the drafting of that Declaration. We will not forget that role and, similarly, we cannot imagine that the international Organization will forget that role or, indeed, forget us.\n180.\tThese are not words emanating from a bleeding country which feels alone among the tormented, for the agenda of this session of the General Assembly is full of issues that reflect tragedies that have been, and continue to be, experienced throughout the world ever since the inception of this Organization. Indeed, some of these tragedies continue to haunt us year after year as we continue to seek a just solution for them, and yet meet only with illusions. Today, from across heaps of ruins, the voice of my country is trying to be heard above the noise of bullets, cannons and rockets, trying to say, oh behalf Of the widowed and the Orphaned, the wounded, the disfigured and the homeless: \\\"Enough. Enough of bloodshed and tears; enough of destruction and anguish; enough of ruins and wars.\\\"\t.\n181.\tSuch was the passionate appeal which the President of Lebanon made on 23 September 1978 [see A/33/266-S/12863, annex), the second anniversary of his assumption of that most onerous office in that most complex, yet most ancient and beautiful republic.\n182.\tI am echoing that appeal at this high rostrum from which the President of the Lebanese Republic would have wanted to address you, as have other Heads of State, because we in Lebanon believe, with President Sarkis, that the international community was responsible for our wars.\nHaving canted its conflicts into our land, it now owes us a commensurate debt of peace. So let those who are without tin cast their stone at Lebanon.\n183.\tMay I how clarify some of the realities of the Lebanese question as it concerns us today. The first fact is that the war in Lebanon has been both Arab and international. Peace in Lebanon, therefore, should be achieved through Arab action and with international guarantees. This fact has been stated very often by many of us and was again reiterated by the President of Lebanon in his most recent message to the Lebanese people. circulated here as an official document [ibid.] and on file in the Secretariat.\n184.\tEvidence of this fact is quite abundant and comes from many sources and appears in many forms. However, I shall content myself with saying that the geographical position of Lebanon at the cross-roads of the world has made it the object of international ambitions and an arena for international conflicts - sometimes through pacts and alliances, and sometimes despite them. A cursory look at our recent successive and interdependent crises is sufficient to show that violence always erupted whenever the Middle East was going to war or preparing for peace-peace to which the road-was often paved with war or pseudo-wars. Our free and open system of government and our pluralistic society have provided a pretext as well as an opportunity for starting conflicts, wars and revolutions which have torn our society asunder and caused our Government to disintegrate. That has been occurring ever since the United Nations adopted its resolutions partitioning Palestine in 1947, and through successive wars up to the October War of 1973, not to speak of all that has been and still is happening in the course of peace negotiations, when Lebanon has again been the victim.\n185.\tSimple arithmetic shows clearly that what has been invested in Lebanon on terrorism and destruction far exceeds the financial capacity of the Lebanese. Furthermore, that price would have been exorbitant for whatever they, were fighting for, if it were true that the Lebanese were indeed fighting one another.\n186.\tAt this juncture, from this lofty rostrum, I should like to state the position of Lebanon on the recent peace accords. On 20 September 1978 the Lebanese Cabinet \\\"expressed deep concern at the unifications that these accords may have on Arab solidarity, as well as their disregard of the. legitimate rights of the Palestinian people-the right to their own land, their homeland, and their future\\\". The Cabinet also expressed \\\"its special concern that these accords may be conducive to the settlement of the Palestinians outside their own land\\\".\n187.\tIn. his message to the diplomatic corps on 1 January 1978, the President of Lebanon had already warned against any attempt to settle the Palestinians in Lebanon. Again, in his address of 23 September 1978, he drew attention to\n \\\". . . the difference, in approach and attitude, between the adverse effects of the armed Palestinian presence in our territory and our total commitment to the just cause  of the Palestinian people and its right to return to its own land and to self-determination\\\". [see A/33/266-S/12863, annex.].\n188.\tIs it not strange, indeed, that the war of Israel against peaceful Lebanon, in all its forms, should have inflicted greater losses, in terms of both casualties and material destruction, than the sum total of the losses of all the Arab countries that participated in all the Palestine wars?\n189.\tWhile the Security Council, in its resolutions 425 (1978) and 426(1978) of March 1978, made a valiant effort to assist Lebanon by dispatching peace forces which have made great sacrifices, the international community has been unable to help the country extend its authority over .its entire territory or to defend its internationally recognized boundaries. Quite the contrary, we find Israel, as well as other parties still utilizing the Lebanese arena to implement its diversified political and military strategies.\n190. The second fact is that the role of the Arab deterrent forces has to be reassessed and redefined. This fact, which emerges from the events taking place in Lebanon is what prompted the President of the Lebanese Republic to go to Damascus and the capitals of the Arab States directly concerned. We all hope that his visit will culminate in a conference of Foreign Ministers, to be convened m .Lebanon next Sunday, that will seek to find a satisfactory solution.\n191.\tSuch a solution has been the subject of a number of dramatic speeches made from this rostrum and in other important bodies. Many of Lebanon's friends have studied, in consultation with its projects and initiatives which will, we all hope, lead to what President Sarkis has called a \\\"new security plan\\\", which he already outline in his messages to the Lebanese people on 23 September and then on 2 October.\n192.\tThat is why we requested the Security Council not to hold a debate when it convened its 2089th meeting on 6 October 1978, to call for an immediate ceasefire, The resolution proposed was adopted with unprecedented and unparalleled unanimity. In this same spirit, we now restate that this is not the time for the settlement of accounts or discussions.\t\n193.\tSuffice, to say, as an end to long-standing controversies, that .emphasis must be placed today on the necessity of allowing the Lebanese Army to perform-its national role wherever conditions are such that \\\"deterrence\\\" has been transformed into \\\"repression\\\". In the words of President Sarkis, we view this army as being composed of the elements of the homeland; as a whole and, for the homeland as a whole, thus depriving any faction whatever of any pretext for taking up-arms illegally and enabling us to relieve Arab and international forces of their responsibility to safeguard peace and security in our territory.\\\" [Ibid.]\n194.\tIn taking this attitude, we draw strength from the following. The summit conference convened in Cairo by the League of Arab States - a regional organization whose responsibilities and rights are recognized by the United Nations Charter, on 26 October 1976 endorsed the resolutions already adopted in the summit: conference previously held in Riyadh on 18 October of that year. Those resolutions clearly defined the role of the Arab deterrent forces after their entry into Lebanon. This role has since become impossible to perform in the context of current Arab and international circumstances.\n195.\tThe President of the Lebanese Republic reflected this fact unequivocally and with the utmost frankness in his address to this Lebanese people, when he rescinded his decision to resign on 16 July 1978. He said:\n\\\"International conflicts and Arab paradoxes have since been reflected in the Lebanese arena, making it impossible to pursue the implementation of the resolutions of the Riyadh and Cairo Conferences. Those conflicts and disputes make it impossible to collect arms from the Palestinian organizations and to remove all armed presence. Hence collecting arms from the Lebanese has . become a thorny issue that does not lend itself to an immediate solution.\\\"\n196.\tIf we, with our Arab brethren and the whole world, have been eager to reach an immediate decision on a cease-fire, it is because \\\"the tragic issue, without parallel in the whole world\\\", of which President Sarkis spoke, could not be allowed to Continue, and with it the bloodshed, destruction and dispersal. Let us all, therefore, in a spirit of Arab brotherhood, to search for a new concept of security that would ensure, as the President himself expressed it; \\\"both the safety of the citizens of Lebanon and that of die Arab forces\\\".\n197.\tBefore I proceed to the third fact of the Lebanese situation; allow me to say that our concern for the Arab deterrent forces, especially for the Syrian Army; also has another dimension. We are, indeed, eager that these forces should retain the heroic image they acquired in the October war of 1973, which enabled them subsequently to become a positive factor of stability in the region. It is our concern that they should not be led into pitfalls and quagmires unknown to them, which, no doubt, they, too, wish to\n198.\tThe third fact is that Lebanon can only be saved through a national, political solution.\n199.\tThis fact has now been internationally recognized in the appeal of the Security Council in its resolution 436 (1978). It has also acquired sufficient forcer and effectiveness, we hope, to break the vicious circle created by the projection of international and-Arab conflicts into the Lebanese arena.\n200.\tThe international community addressed an appeal to us, which President Sarkis accepted as challenge, \\\"calling on the Lebanese people to close their ranks and unite their voice in order to preserve Lebanon\\\". Indeed. this challenge, for us, is a question of survival. Lebanon will either survive or dissolve. We state this fact unequivocally-not out of fear nor out of weakness.\n201.\tHowever, we know of no other State in the world, large or small, that could have faced what we have confronted throughout five years of war and 25 years of conflict and continued to exist by its own sheer determination. \n202.\tFurthermore, the appeal Of the Security Council corresponds to the resolution that was adopted unanimously on 23 April 1978 by the Lebanese Parliament. That parliamentary consensus might well be considered as a basis for the new \\\"national charter\\\" which Lebanon needs today.\n203.\tIt may be considered futile to speak of parliamentary recommendation at a time when Lebanon is in the throes of war and the House of Parliament can hardly be meet. Nevertheless we are anxious to preserve our legitimate constitutional institutions and desire that our; political and national development be attained through those institutions, rather than through two other courses\u2014both of which are objectionable-revolution and internationalization.\n204.\tRevolution we accept, but only in spirit, for we reject the terrorism which it inevitably breeds, and the hatred we fear remains with us as an offshoot of all the wars and all the revolutions that have saturated us in bloodshed and destruction.\n205.\tInternationalization we also reject, as long as there is one responsible voice in Lebanon to proclaim its confidence that the Lebanese people, once left to themselves, are capable Of settling their disputes, as they\tdone in the past, even during wars. when they were able to coexist and survive in unity. From internationalization, however, we will accept what it has given us at its best on previous occasions, such as in 1943, safeguarding our rights, guaranteeing our independence and confirming our sovereignty,' for if small nations cannot receive from the international Organization such protection and guarantees, what, then, can they expect? \n206.\tMy statement has perhaps been long, but the ordeals of my country are such that they have preoccupied all of us here. This question is not on our agenda, and I hope it will never be on the agenda as one of those items that remain there for many years, session-after session. \n207.\tBefore concluding, I feel that I must call attention to the annual report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization and to his special report to the Security Council of 13 September 1978 on UNIFIL. In both reports the Secretary-General deals with the Lebanese crisis, its relation to peace in the region and to the peace-keeping operations. Mr: Kurt Waldheim is now the world's foremost soldier of peace, besides being a wise friend. Rarely have friendship and wisdom been so combined in one man as they are in. his unique personality.\n208.\tMay I candidly state that the Lebanese people reject categorically the idea that peace in Lebanon is contingent upon the achievement of peace in the region. However, we find ourselves in full agreement with the Secretary-General concerning the necessity of exploring further the various\n options provided by the United Nations Charter should UNIFIL; despite its excellent performance, not be allowed to protect our land, guarantee our rights and assist us in restoring our sovereignty. '\\\"\t\n209.\tI should like, if I may, to quote what the Secretary-General said in his report:\n\\\"To resort to force is the last and least desirable course for a peace-keeping force. Negotiation and persuasion must be the primary method for achieving its objectives. However, if such methods prove unavailing, the Security Council may well have to consider what other approaches are open to it under the Charter.\\\" [See A/3311, sect. IV.]\nThat is the tremendous challenge the world community is faced with.\n210.\tI stand here before this Assembly-on this last day of this very long general debate during which all the issues of war and peace in the world have been discussed-to say on behalf of our bleeding country that the dignity of the United Nations is at one with the dignity of our land. The future of the United Nations, to us, can only mean the future of our liberty. We see no integrity guaranteed to the human being outside the guarantees that the United Nations can offer to each and all of us, individuals and States alike.\n211.\tWe must all reject a vision of a world community in which our homelands can be bartered as negotiable pawns in the game of nations, whether united or disunited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For the successful management of the special sessions and the related consultations, I should like to pay a particular tribute to our former President for his competence and to express the gratitude of my delegation for his achievement.\n5.\tThe increased activity in which our Organization has been involved is a clear indication of the quickening tempo of international events and of the role of the United Nations as a focal-point for the negotiation of issues arising from the rapidly changing international environment.\n6.\tIt is important that the United Nations should demonstrate a capacity to respond to these pressures. As the Secretary-General has said in his report on the work of the\nOrganization [A/33/1], the willingness of Governments to involve the United Nations in major issues depends on their confidence in its objectivity and capacity for impartial action.\n7.\tRelations among Member States have become increasingly complex and diverse. National prosperity and stability depend on a high level of exchange and contact between countries. No nation or group of nations can progress in isolation from the rest of the world community. The United Nations can provide the framework and the procedures which will permit the more orderly management of this increasingly interdependent world. The United Nations can ease the adjustments that the emergence of a global society requires.\n8.\tOur Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the Organization over the past year, drew attention to some of the factors which limit the ability of the United Nations to act as the guarantor of justice and peace for all nations. At the same time, the Secretary-General was able to point to other instances where the Organization is indeed playing a highly constructive role.\n9.\tThe great issues confronting the world community might best be summed up as how we meet the challenge of a rapidly changing world situation. Change, of course, is a characteristic of any period, but it has rarely posed more serious decisions for the world community than those which are now before us. Change inevitably disrupts existing balances and established attitudes. It may be evolutionary or radical; its results may be a new era of peace or a major disaster for mankind. Too much is at stake for the representatives of the world community to stand aside and permit the future to emerge as a product of uncontrolled and unpredicted forces. There is an urgent need for us to reconcile competing interests, and we should not be distracted from our task by mere rhetoric or invective.\n10.\tOn many issues progress will only be achieved if we work for consensus and harmonize the interests of the major groups of nations. This is the only way to arrive at practical and durable solutions. The United Nations must, of course, do more than simply provide the forum for debate on the great international issues. It must provide leadership and it must provide guidance to Member States. It is only if we can demonstrate new will and intent in the Organization that we shall build the confidence of which the Secretary-General has spoken.\n11.\tThe preservation of international peace and security remains a major preoccupation. We address aspects of this question in the efforts of the United Nations to promote \narms control and disarmament, to reduce international tension and to provide peace-keeping arrangements.\n12.\tArms control and disarmament were considered in detail at a most important special session this year, the tenth. While the session was not intended to produce specific agreements it did result in some notable achievements. For the first time there was international agreement about priorities and objectives in the disarmament field. As a result of the session new momentum for progress in disarmament will develop. An agenda of measures has been agreed upon. And the international community will devote a significantly greater amount of time to disarmament issues over the next few years.\n13.\tDespite these achievements we need to be realistic. Progress towards arms control and disarmament will require a commitment by States to the development of practical measures. Fundamental issues of national security, international confidence and survival are involved. We must recognize and seek to reconcile the important differences of approach and objectives. We must also be aware that competitive arms programmes may be as much an effect as a cause\u2014beyond a certain point, arms control can only progress if underlying international tensions are reduced.\n14.\tAustralia continues to believe that the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks offer the best prospects for substantial measures of arms control between the super-Powers and ultimately among all nuclear-weapon States. We welcome the announcement that the conclusion of the second series of the Talks by the end of the year is possible. We were pleased, too, to see that the Final Document of the special session [resolution S-10/2] reflected a proposal, advanced by Australia and other countries, for a halt to the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons purposes as one means of scaling down the arms race. It remains our view that this measure merits early action in future negotiations on the limitation of existing nuclear arsenals.\n15.\tThe decision of the special session to reaffirm the urgent need for a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty [ibid., sect III, para. 51] is consistent with Australia's long-held view. Such a treaty would be a barrier both to the expansion of existing nuclear arsenals and to the further spread of nuclear weapons. At this session we will continue our efforts to promote international support for the early conclusion of a comprehensive test ban.\n16- It was agreed at the special session that the non- proliferation of nuclear weapons was a matter of universal concern requiring undertakings by all States, and that international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy should be under effective safeguards [ibid., sect. II, para. 36]. Australia would have preferred to see more explicit recognition in the Final Document that the right of all nations to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes carries with it a reciprocal, obligation\u2014indeed, a binding commitment\u2014not to develop or acquire nuclear weapons. We believe, nevertheless, that the consensus reached provides a firm basis for the further development and elaboration of non-proliferation measures in the appropriate international bodies.\n\n17.\tAn important immediate result of the session was the undertaking by three of the nuclear-weapon Powers about the strictly limited circumstances in which they would contemplate using nuclear weapons. Australia was one of those countries which had been calling for strengthened assurances against the threat or use of nuclear weapons for non-nuclear-weapon States which had themselves renounced the acquisition of nuclear weapons. We welcome the unilateral assurances provided by the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union, which will do much to satisfy the concerns of non-nuclear-weapon States.\n18.\tThe special session also agreed on important improvements in international disarmament machinery. A wider and more representative group of countries will now be able to participate directly in discussions and negotiations on arms control and disarmament. Australia is glad to have the opportunity to join in the important work of the Committee on Disarmament and we will make an active and constructive contribution. We do not underestimate the task of the Committee; its time and resources are not unlimited. If it is to meet the expectations of the international community it will need to concentrate initially on practical and concrete issues where progress can be expected. Urgent consideration should be given to the conclusion of international agreements prohibiting the testing of nuclear weapons in all environments and prohibiting the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons. The achievement of early but worth-while results will do much to win the Committee the confidence and support of the world community.\n19.\tThere will still be an important, indeed essential, role for bilateral negotiations on disarmament questions, particularly between the super-Powers. Regional arms control arrangements can also be helpful. However, the Committee on Disarmament should be seen as the principal multilateral negotiating body on arms control and disarmament questions. It should be the means of achieving the long-term objectives of the world community in arms control and disarmament negotiations. This is a matter in which a global approach is absolutely necessary.\n20.\tThrough its tried and established peace-keeping machinery the United Nations has made a unique contribution to preserving international peace and security. Peace-keeping is a sensitive and difficult process, and the machinery which has been forged over the years has become an essential instrument of the Security Council in fulfilling its obligations. This machinery, which depends also on the key role of the Secretary-General and the active support of the General Assembly, is an encouraging example of how the United Nations can respond constructively to the concerns of the international community. My Government has given continuing support to United Nations peace-keeping operations, in men, materials and money, over many years.\n21.\tWe welcomed the establishment of UNIFIL and the recent renewal of its mandate in a very complex and dangerous situation. We believe it should be maintained until effective Government control can be restored in the areas of its responsibility. UNIFIL's mandate does not of course extend to Beirut and northern Lebanon, where continuing conflicts have caused heavy casualties and human suffering, which my Government deplores.\n22.\tUnited Nations peace-keeping operations can only be as effective as the parties to a dispute will permit. To be successful in the long term, they must be accompanied by intense efforts to resolve the underlying causes of the conflict. Peace-keeping is not an alternative, but an important contribution, to the negotiation and settlement of disputes. There is a responsibility on the parties to a dispute to work actively to resolve their differences and to remove the need for the continuing presence of United Nations forces. The peace-keeping role is intended to promote solutions, not to perpetuate disputes.\n23.\tThe United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus is of long standing, as is the question of Cyprus on our agenda. It is our hope that renewed consideration of the question of Cyprus by the General Assembly this year will lead to more urgent and productive negotiations in the intercommunal talks, in which we continue to place reliance.\n24.\tIn a similar spirit we approach the consideration of two key areas of> international tension: I refer to southern Africa and the Middle East.\n25.\tAs far as southern Africa is concerned, every avenue must be pursued for the peaceful achievement of just and lasting solutions in southern Africa.\n26.\tAustralia has followed with close interest and sympathy the negotiations for a settlement which would bring independence to the people of Namibia. We applaud the efforts made by the five Western members of the Security Council and the positive response of the front-line States in the common search for a just and peaceful settlement of the problem, which is the collective responsibility of the United Nations. Australia has a close understanding of the issues involved from its former membership in the Security Council and its present membership in the United Nations Council for Namibia.\n27.\tWe are encouraged that the Security Council, with the clear concurrence of the South West Africa People's Organization, has now adopted resolution 435 (1978) and has thereby approved the report of the Secretary-General and his explanatory statement. The Security Council has been obliged to act in the face of South African defiance of the will of the world community. For South Africa to reject this eleventh-hour chance for a peaceful settlement would be a historic disservice to all concerned and not least to its own people, and we would deplore it. We look to the new Government of South Africa to reconsider its position and to co-operate fully and faithfully with the Secretary- General in implementing the plan for a settlement.\n28.\tWe will continue to support efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement in Zimbabwe which provides for majority rule and independence. We believe that the Anglo-American proposals on Zimbabwe1 still provide the best available basis for such a settlement, and we see no alternative to the convening of an early meeting of all parties to discuss them.\n29.\tAustralia's position on the question of apartheid is clearly and firmly on record. We oppose and condemn a system which so grossly violates the basic rights of the black majority in South Africa. While some modifications have been introduced by the South African Government, it is quite clear that they do not represent a fundamental change of policy. Unless such a change occurs increasing violence appears inevitable.\n30.\tThe Government of South Africa must make fundamental changes. It must renounce the system of apartheid. It must cease to harass and humiliate the majority of its people. We are approaching a point where the possibility of conciliation and compromise will be lost.\n31.\tRecent developments in the Middle East have given us some hope that conflict will be avoided. The Australian Government welcomes the two agreements signed following the Camp David meetings  as a constructive framework for progress. In particular, the Australian Government welcomes agreement that further negotiations will be guided by the provisions and principles of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n32.\tThese positions accord with Australia's views. The Australian Government pays a tribute to the statesmanship of the leaders of Egypt and Israel in reaching these agreements and applauds the initiative and the assiduous efforts of the President of the United States in fostering them.\n33.\tWe recognize that long and difficult negotiations will be required if there is to be a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. It is our earnest hope that other Arab States, whose support will be essential to any lasting settlement, will be encouraged to accept the Camp David framework as a basis for future negotiations and will be prepared to join in the search for peace. For its part, the Australian Government stands ready to lend its support to any settlement agreed between the parties in the Middle East.\n34.\tMember States at this session of the General Assembly should in our view be careful to avoid any action which could have the effect of prejudicing the prospects for peace which these agreements offer. The momentum generated by the Camp David agreements should be maintained. This will require a favourable climate for intense diplomatic activity, and we should not disrupt this process.\n35.\tIn my address to the thirty-second session of the General Assembly  I drew attention to the dilemma Governments face in weighing commitment to human rights against other critically important concerns, including commitments to international peace and order and to national cohesion. Events during the past year have illustrated the difficulty\u2014to which I referred at that time\u2014of protecting the rights of individuals while also working for progress in detente. The international community is being brought to 460\naccept the fact that in cases such as this the pursuit of one objective should not exclude the other.\n36.\tThe reconciliation of what is principled with what is practical has never been easy. Bilateral and international responses to human rights situations must evolve over time, and responsible experimentation will be required. As a starting-point, the United Nations must uphold the provisions of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The United Nations must inspire confidence that it is prepared to promote basic human rights' and provide the framework for responsible action by Governments in situations where difficult choices may well have to be faced.\n37.\tAction by the United Nations should, of course, promote and not prejudice the observance of human rights. We must always bear in mind that the objective is not to strike attitudes but to improve the conditions of individual men and women, Care must be taken to avoid tackling situations in such a manner as to place at risk other valid objectives of the world community. Private persuasion can be most effective. The unobtrusive work of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights provides a very good example.\n38 As States Members of the United Nations we-must continue our search for means and mechanisms effectively to promote and effectively to protect human rights. Australia welcomed the adoption by this Assembly last year of resolution 32/130. We believe that there is a growing public expectation that the United Nations should be able candidly to consider situations where gross breaches of human rights appear to have occurred. The United Nations must also be seen to stand firm on the rights of the individual within the context of agreed international instruments.\n39.\tThe international community must have confidence that the Organization can provide workable multilateral procedures equally applicable to all and equally available to all. The United Nations should act, in the human rights area, without over-rigid adherence to restrictive interpretations of Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter. If it could be established that the purpose of such multilateral procedures was to consult and not simply to condemn, to work for improvement, not for impeachment, then a great step would have been taken in achieving a principal objective of the Organization.\n40.\tThe visit of a working group to Chile  has established a most important precedent and represents an approach which might be repeated and refined in other cases. We could also seek alternative means of enlisting the co-operation of States where human rights situations appear to require Investigation. We might seek to enlarge upon the method of self-criticism and self-reporting inherent in the implementation procedures of the various international human rights instruments.\n41.\tBut no matter what possibilities we pursue and what priority we give to them, we are required by recent circumstances to recognize that the United Nations must now deal with human rights issues in a fair and practical way. If it does not, we shall see its claims to moral authority eroded year by year. We are particularly conscious of this now as we commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n42.\tI wish now to turn to economic issues. It is a matter of great concern to my Government that so very little has been achieved in the negotiation of the serious international economic issues which confront us all at the present time. Although some progress has been made in the consideration of matters by UNCTAD, particularly the question of debt, and although the outcome of the recent United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries was encouraging, the over-all situation\u2014to put it mildly-is far from satisfactory. The difficulty of establishing a workable framework for the discussion of these issues was further highlighted by the problems surrounding the activities of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, also known as the Committee of the Whole.\n43.\tFailure to achieve substantial progress cannot be attributed only to a lack of political will. There is abundant evidence that Governments have been prepared to make broad political commitments to the search for a more just and more equitable economic order. There is now a greater understanding of the interdependence of our economies. But, while Governments have been able to make general undertakings, it has proved far more difficult to achieve agreement on specific action.\n44.\tThe problem has, of course, been complicated by the sluggish growth of the world economy, which has left Governments with difficult economic decisions in regard to their own national economies and in responding to international problems. The slow progress is due also to the technical complexity of the issues themselves. If agreements are to be implemented and to endure, they must be carefully and thoroughly negotiated.\n45.\tI believe also that some of the responsibility for our lack -of success may well\\\" lie in our approach to the North-South dialogue. The phrase itself has become hackneyed and it obscures the fact that \\\"dialogue\\\" seldom takes place. One cannot have a dialogue if each country or each group of countries approaches the subject from established negotiating positions. Moreover, the simple division into North and South presumes a uniformity of view on either side which simply- does not exist. The North-South distinction has dramatized the issues, but we should recognize the variety of attitudes which exist in both the North and the South and seek solutions which take account of the interests of all countries. .\n46.\tThe United Nations needs a forum in which a true dialogue can take place, a forum in which issues can be discussed frankly with a view to determining appropriate courses of action. The Committee of the Whole offers that chance and we hope that developments since its last meeting will enable the Committee to overcome its problems and take up early in the new year the substantive work which is on its agenda. Industrialization-is an example of the important matters on that agenda. Rapid changes in some areas of manufacturing have thrown into doubt a number of our perceptions about the development process. Technological advances have resulted in less emphasis on investment in countries with low labour costs and increasing investment m these sectors in the industrialized countries themselves.\n47.\tThe international community just cannot allow negotiations on international economic issues to proceed at their present pace. It is altogether too slow. There must be a renewed effort by Governments to achieve results. We face a full agenda over the next 12 months, including the resumption of negotiations on the common fund, the fifth session of UNCTAD and the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development. We must make a start on the preparation of the framework for a new international development strategy, a framework which can accommodate the objectives of growth and equity.\n48.\tMy Government believes that we must press ahead in a practical way with the discussion of the proposal for the common fund. Australia has been particularly active in seeking to make a positive contribution to the establishment of a common fund for commodities. In the long term, all nations would benefit from an institutional framework which would contribute to stability in commodity marketing. In Australia's view, the common fund would have to be financed by direct government subscription, by deposits by international commodity agreements and by borrowings from international financial markets. We consider also that the fund should have a role in financing what we term \\\"other measures\\\" and we would expect the activities in this area to be directed to needs not met by other institutions.\n49.\tAustralia attaches great importance to the round of multilateral trade negotiations, which are entering a decisive phase. Final results are proving difficult to achieve. There are grounds for concern that agricultural commodities have been neglected in the negotiations, and discriminatory safeguard measures, which could seriously disadvantage newly industrialized nations, are still under consideration. At a time of economic difficulty, when Governments come under protectionist pressures, it is all the more important that the multilateral trade negotiations should contribute to an expansion of global trade.\n50.\tMy Government believes that adjustments in the field of energy will be among the most challenging issues facing the world community over the next few decades. The world cannot continue to rely so heavily on oil to fuel its economic growth. We must begin now to develop alternative energy sources. It would be short-sighted to regard present surpluses as anything but short-term or make them the excuse for not confronting the coming problems. We are conscious of the long lead times involved in introducing new energy technologies. International co-operation in this area is essential and must be initiated urgently. It was with these considerations in mind that Australia took a modest initiative at the last session of the Assembly in submitting a draft resolution on international energy consultations. There is still no international forum for a wide-ranging dialogue on energy.\n51.\tIn the coming years Australia will be an increasingly important exporter of energy resources and we remain concerned to play an active part in fostering support for an international dialogue on energy. We firmly hold the view that the United Nations can provide a forum for broad- based participation in such a dialogue. My Government was pleased to note the recommendation of the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1978/61 that the General Assembly should give favourable consideration to convening a conference on new and renewable sources of energy. This also could assist the process of energy transition in the longer term.\n52.\tIt would be appropriate for me to refer to some developments in our own region. I recently attended the independence celebrations of Solomon Islands. Australia was a sponsor of the application of the Solomons for membership in the United Nations, and we warmly welcome its admission to our number.\n53.\tAlthough the attention of the United Nations in the field of decolonization has focused largely on developments in Africa, we in Australia have seen the emergence of a number of new nations in the Pacific in recent years. One of the first of these was our neighbour Papua New Guinea, with which we enjoy a specially close relationship. The latest is Tuvalu, whose independence celebrations I attended last week. The Gilbert Islands are due to become independent in 1979 and the New Hebrides in 1980. Most of our newly independent neighbours have small populations and a very limited land area, but their territories are widespread and they have substantial maritime economic zones. Their accession to independence has changed the political face of the South Pacific and has given a powerful impetus to regional co-operation.\n54.\tAustralia recognizes a special responsibility towards the new nations of the Pacific, and we shall continue our efforts to provide assistance for their development.\n55.\tThe South Pacific traditionally has been free from political tensions. We hope that this condition will continue. As I have indicated, this is an area where regional organizations are making an important contribution to the process of change. The South Pacific Forum and the South Pacific Commission have responded to the needs of the island States in the fields of economic development, health and social welfare. The United Nations should work closely with these and other regional bodies in these fields.\n\n56.\tRegional associations can be of great value in facilitating and developing harmonious and mutually beneficial relations among neighbours. Perhaps the most important grouping of this kind in Australia's vicinity is the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN], formed by five of Australia's close neighbours. The Australian Government welcomes the increasing confidence and economic growth of the members of the ASEAN, and we are working to achieve closer co-operation with them and their organization.\n57.\tThe success of ASEAN and the South Pacific Forum in furthering the interests of their members encouraged Australia to propose that a regional dimension be added to the Commonwealth. As a result of the Commonwealth\nHeads of Government regional meeting held in Sydney last February, working groups are now being set up in the fields of energy, trade, narcotics and terrorism. Their activities will supplement-not replace, but supplement\u2014and further encourage regional co-operation.\n58.\tHowever, the region of South-East Asia is not without its problems, some of which pose considerable difficulties for Australia and its neighbours. I would join other speakers in referring to the large number of refugees from the lndo-China area. There should be no doubt about Australia's attitude. We have a long record of receiving and assisting refugees from many parts of the world. We are doing what we can to help with the present problem and by the middle of 1979 we shall have received more than 20,000 refugees from the lndo-China area alone. However, the limited nature of the international reaction to the problem has caused growing concern to Australia, its ASEAN neighbours and traditional countries of resettlement. A broader based international response is needed and we look to a wider group of Member States to do more to support the work of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in assisting and resettling these people.\n59.\tI began by referring to the accelerating activity of the United Nations. Issues long defined, and no less urgent for that, remain before us, especially those of southern Africa and disarmament. They have been given new prominence and priority this year. Others to some extent still subject to delimitation, especially in the fields of international economic relations and human rights, demand additional agenda space. We can take heart that they continue to be brought to the United Nations. We are jointly responsible for ensuring that Governments are given further incentives to make proper use of this world body.\n60.\tSuch incentives cannot be provided without a realistic perspective of our activities in the United Nations from year to year. It is a Charter purpose that the United Nations should be a as centre for harmonizing national actions. Clearly, the present Organization is an imperfect instrument for that purpose, but the imperfections are those of its Members as well as institutional. We cannot expect to come here and find ourselves always in agreement. But we should expect to leave in greater agreement. If harmonization is to be achieved, the machinery available to us at all levels in the United Nations needs to be kept in good repair and its reputation must remain in good standing. Only the combined membership can impose quality controls on the Assembly's decision.\n61.\tIn many areas the United Nations has succeeded in suggesting standards to be observed by all Governments and in all communities. In far fewer cases has it succeeded in setting an example by its own conduct. We can be grateful that there has been some success in the control of international crises. But the one crisis that cannot be risked is a crisis of confidence in the United Nations itself.\n62.\tMr. President, in the important tasks that lie ahead your own role will be one of particular importance. On behalf of my Government, I should like to congratulate you on your election as President of this thirty-third regular sessions of the General Assembly. Your election reflects the standing of Colombia in the world community and your own valuable contribution to international affairs. You may be sure of the effort that my delegation will make to assist you in fulfilling the heavy responsibility of guiding our work to a successful conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288.\tAt the outset, I wish to reaffirm the faith of the Government and people of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the principles and ideals of the United Nations. The political and economic relevance of this Organization in the world situation of today stands beyond doubt.\n289.\tThe thirty-third session of the General Assembly must give further strength and impetus to the role of the United Nations in an interdependent world. This session has\nthe good fortune to be working under the able guidance of the Foreign Minister of Colombia, and I would ask you, Sir, to convey to him my warmest congratulations on his unanimous election as President. Much will depend on his wisdom and inspiration; much will also depend on the Secretary-General, whose untiring activities deserve deep appreciation. I wish both of them strength and courage.\n290.\tOn behalf of the Kingdom of the Netherlands I welcome the admission of Solomon Islands to the United Nations.\n291.\tSpeaking for the first time in my capacity as Foreign Minister of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the general debate I am deeply conscious of the continuity and tradition of Netherlands foreign policy through the centuries. Freedom, individual responsibility, tolerance, respect for minorities, and international co-operation have been characteristic of my country and its people. Freedom, prosperity and democracy were not achieved without struggle. Like many of the younger nations of today, we, too, had to go through difficult stages of slow and sometimes painful progress.\n292.\tForeign policy in the Netherlands is not a matter of Parliament and Government alone; it is a matter of the people in their daily lives. Questions of human rights, disarmament and development are questions of conscience, often hotly debated in broad layers of our society. Nothing is taken for granted; everything, every issue, is scrutinized in a spirit of global solidarity.\n293.\tNetherlands foreign policy is aimed at peace, security, the promotion of human rights and the eradication of poverty and inequality. In carrying out its foreign policy, the Netherlands Government is and will be guided by reliability, and will stand by its given word.\n294.\tForeign policy is a matter of international solidarity and conscience, but it cannot be divorced from national interest and power. Power, however, must be limited and guided by the human conscience and concern for human rights and individual freedoms. It must be channelled through international agreements and obligations. For the Netherlands., membership in the European Economic Community and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and co-operation in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] is the corner-stone of our foreign policy. We attach great importance to our relations with the third world, the countries of Eastern Europe and the great nations of the Far East. Ultimately, all nations and alliances are bound by the Charter of the United Nations.\n295.\tMy friend and colleague, Mr. Genscher, has addressed this Assembly [8th meeting] on behalf of the countries of the European Community. He has spoken of global interdependence as another and new reality as opposed to the reality of power politics. Indeed, global interdependence might well be the main theme and inspiration of this session of the General Assembly. The world has never before been so conscious of this reality of interdependence both in the political and in the economic sense, but also\u2014and this is new\u2014in the sense of the interdependence of human beings. In matters of peace and security all\nnations are affected by strife and conflict elsewhere. Every conflict can become a global conflict. East and West, North and South, are increasingly interwoven. In international economic relations and in matters of development the world has come to realize that growth and prosperity in the industrialized countries are no longer possible without growth and prosperity in the third world. Global economic interdependence has created an additional motive for development co-operation.\t\n296.\tBut renewed and acute awareness of political and economic interdependence must not distract attention and concern from those who are weak and defenceless, nations as well as people within nations. Awareness of political interdependence must go hand in hand with concern for human rights and basic human needs. Policies of economic co-operation and development based on interdependence must at the same time provide for assistance to the poorest nations, which as yet fall outside the scope of economic interdependence, and for meeting basic human needs.\n297.\tIt is in the context of the theme of interdependence and man that I wish to speak about detente, security and disarmament, the Middle East, human rights and international development. It is against that background that I wish to speak about the role of the United Nations system as an instrument for the management of global interdependence and the rights of man.\n298.\tThe Netherlands Government will continue to strive for detente in Europe on the basis of interdependence and respect for the dignity of man. I am convinced that interdependence will compel us in Europe to search for areas of common interest, and will eventually create a situation in which, despite ideological differences, mutual trust will prevail.\n299.\tIn historical perspective, I consider the Helsinki Final Act to be an instrument of major importance in international co-operation the effects of which will be of lasting significance. The Belgrade review Conference may have failed to produce significant concrete results, yet the process of detente must go on. The participating countries must continue to strive for a peaceful and durable world order.\n\n300.\tI consider the Helsinki Final Act to be the comer-stone for a future charter or common constitution for Europe. The Netherlands must insist on the equality and interrelationship of all the elements of the Final Act. In the process of detente and peace, we, as mature nations, must be able to discuss respect for human rights as defined in the Final Act. This is not a return to the cold war. Respect for human rights is an essential element in the process leading towards detente and mutual trust. In an interdependent world, concern for human rights does not stop at national borders. Detente is not a matter for Governments alone; interdependence in Europe is ultimately a matter for every woman and every man.\n301.\tInterdependence, security and disarmament are closely linked. In the face of the undiminished build-up of conventional and nuclear arms and of the interdependence of the political fate of nations, disarmament is a matter of compelling necessity. But there is also the question of\nsecurity, and here lies the dilemma in the quest for disarmament.\n302.\tThe tenth special session of the General Assembly was a step towards disarmament. My assessment of the session is positive. Although some basic problems, in particular the issues of nuclear proliferation and conventional arms control, remained unsolved, the significance of that special session is clear: it created new machinery ensuring a fair balance between deliberation and negotiation. It generated a process of understanding of mutual security concerns. For the first time a comprehensive exchange of views and ideas on disarmament, security and survival has taken place in the General Assembly. The dialogue which began with the tenth special session must continue.\n\u00ab\n303.\tMuch remains to be done to make the world a safer place to live in. Nuclear disarmament is of primary and vital importance. Our concern about the lack of progress in this field is real: we are still waiting for agreement to emerge from a new series of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks; the discussions on the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban are stalling; the negotiations in Geneva on a convention prohibiting chemical weapons have not yet produced tangible results. We have been assured time and again that progress is being made, yet I say with regret that we have been waiting too long for substantive steps to curb the arms race, and in particular the nuclear arms race.\n304.\tIncreased political commitments from all Member States, and especially from the nuclear-weapon States, are essential and urgent if we are to achieve the ultimate goal, which is, in the words of the Final Document, the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. In that respect the Final Document is unambiguous; it is, however, regretfully vague where it deals with the subject of horizontal non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. All efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate existing nuclear arsenals would be in vain and world peace would be in jeopardy if such proliferation were to take place. It is a matter of deep concern to the Netherlands Government that an over-all and meaningful consensus in this vital area could not be achieved.\n305.\tIn forthcoming discussions and negotiations in the new Disarmament Commission, the General Assembly, IAEA and other forums and in bilateral talks, priority must be given to the issue of non-proliferation. I recognize the right of all countries to develop nuclear energy for economic and social development, but the exercise of this right without restraint might lead to nuclear anarchy. Restraints, however, should be freely accepted. A fair balance is needed between the uncontrolled dissemination of nuclear technology and the necessity for restrictions and safeguards. This is a vital issue. A new consensus on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons among all concerned, nuclear and non-nuclear Powers, exporters and importers of nuclear materials and equipment, is urgently called for. The International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation is one of the instruments to achieve such a consensus. It can contribute to the success of the second Review Conference of-the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, scheduled for 1980.1 urge adequate preparation . and a serious political approach to that conference.\n306.\tThe conflict in the Middle East is still the most dangerous problem in the world today. No other conflict so directly affects world peace and security. No other conflict is so complex, so involved in contradictory claims and rights, so overshadowed by mutual fears and suspicions. My German colleague has stated the position of the nine countries members of the European Community and has thus fully reflected the position of my country.\n307.\tThe Netherlands has strong ties of friendship with the Jewish people which go back to the early days of our nationhood. Let me assure you, Mr. President, and my colleagues of the Arab countries here in this hall, of our equally close ties of friendship with and respect for the peoples of the Arab world. The relations between the Netherlands and the Arab nations and peoples go back many centuries. We want to maintain and develop those relations and that friendship.\n308.\tThe Netherlands eagerly wishes Israel and the Arab nations to live in peace with each other. This will only happen when there is lasting peace between all concerned, including the Palestinian people, and when security is guaranteed to all, Including Israel. The Netherlands is convinced that the participants in the Camp David meetings, to whom Mr. Genscher has already paid the tribute of the members of the Community, were inspired by a sincere desire for such a peace. In that perspective, the results of the Camp David meetings should be regarded as an important step towards that goal.\n309.\tIn addressing myself to the issue of human rights, I am conscious of the complexity of the problem, of its changing, and at the same time expanding, scope in a changing and interdependent world and of the need for constant reappraisal. Respect for and the promotion of human rights are deeply engraved on the conscience of the Netherlands people. Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, deep changes have taken place. We have witnessed the political emancipation of the third world and the coming to independence of new nations with their own cultural and philosophical backgrounds, new nations still suffering under poverty and economic inequality. There is an increased and encouraging world-wide interest in the issue of human rights. It cannot be denied, however, that there is an undertone of mistrust in the position of many developing countries with regard to the position of others on human rights. The adoption, last year, of resolution 32/130 clearly posed the problem of economic and social rights as distinct from and, at least in the view of some, opposed to political rights. The issue is serious. The Netherlands is ready to face this challenge of new thinking on human rights. I recognize the interdependence of political, economic and social rights. Indeed, the preambles to the two International Covenants on Human Rights are identical. I recognize that the social and economic emancipation of developing countries is an indispensable element of the promotion of human rights. One cannot urge respect for political rights if one is not prepared to work for the realization of economic and social rights. The Netherlands will, therefore, pursue its active development co-operation policy. At the same time we shall continue to advocate respect for the essential rights of the individual, not only because of their intrinsic value but also because we believe that, ultimately and in accordance with\narticle 28 of the Universal Declaration, political freedom is indispensable for human development in all other fields.\n310\tThe United Nations can be proud of its achievements in setting norms and standards concerning human rights, starting with the adoption of the Universal Declaration nearly 30 years ago. With the entry into force of the two International Covenants on Human Rights and the Optional Protocol to one of them, the international bill of rights that was envisaged by the founders of the United Nations has become operational. There is, however, still work to be done. In particular the General Assembly ought, during this session, to complete the work on the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Promotion of the equality of man and woman in society still remains, three years after the Mexico Conference,23 a matter of high priority.\n311\tPromoting actual observance of human rights has proved to be even more difficult for the United Nations than the drawing up of norms and rules. It is frustrating to see the United Nations powerless in the face of gross and persistent violations of human rights and cases of massive cruelty bordering on genocide. It is no less frustrating to see that in some cases the United Nations is reluctant even to discuss such situations. But, as pointed out by the Secretary-General /see A/33/1, sect. VIII], some progress was made over the past year, as witnessed by the visit to Chile of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Situation of Human Rights in Chile, the first instance of on-the-spot investigation, and by the fact that the human rights situation in several countries is being actively considered by the Commission on Human Rights.\n312.\tThirty years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration, the United Nations should now further develop this potential for the actual promotion and protection of human rights. I remain convinced that a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights would add significantly to this potential. The fight against racism and racial discrimination is a major objective of the United Nations. I regret that the recent world conference against racism took a course with which my country, along with several others, was unable to associate itself. However, this outcome will not deflect my country from its determination to fight racism and racial discrimination.\n313.\tThe position of the nine States members of the European Community on the issue of apartheid\u2014one of the most serious cases of gross violation of human rights\u2014has been clearly stated by the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany. He declared that the nine members are using their influence to bring about a change so that the State guarantees the enjoyment of human rights to all and ensures that they can all live together as equal citizens.\n314.\tInfluence can be exerted by persuasion and by pressure. We have seriously and honestly tried to engage in a meaningful dialogue with South Africa, but it takes two to hold a true dialogue.\n315.\tI had hoped that a peaceful solution of the question of Namibia reached in co-operation with the South African Government might have generated confidence and opened the way to developments in South Africa itself. However, the decision taken last week by the South African Government, in incomprehensible blindness to political reality, seems to indicate that South Africa wishes to pursue a collision course. I emphatically endorse what Mr. Genscher said about Namibia. The South African decision must be rejected as irresponsible and dangerous to peace and security.\n316.\tIf South Africa chooses to isolate itself from the world community, the only possible course of action will be to exert pressure on it. Quite apart from compliance with the mandatory arms embargo, the Netherlands Government has already demonstrated by a series of voluntary measures taken either unilaterally or in co-operation with its partners in the European Community that it is ready to apply pressure on the Government of South Africa. Up till now those measures have fallen short of economic sanctions. I realize that such sanctions can be effective only under Chapter VII of the Charter or, in the case of voluntary measures, if applied by a sufficient number of those countries which have the potential to exert effective pressure.\n317.\tTime is running out. South Africa will have to change its policy of racial discrimination. If it does not do so, there will be no choice but to increase pressure through economic sanctions. In that case, the Netherlands will promote and support such a policy.\n318.\tIt is in particular with regard to international development co-operation that the world is becoming acutely aware of the interdependence between the developing countries and the industrialized nations of both the West and the East.\n319.\tIn the Netherlands development co-operation and development aid continue to receive priority in government policy. Last week my Government announced in Parliament cut-backs in public expenditure in all sectors except development aid. In conformity with the agreed target of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], our development budget in 1979 will remain at the high level of approximately 0.85 per cent of the gross national product in terms of official development assistance.\n320.\tA major contribution, to co-operation for international development in the framework of growing interdependence was made by the OECD countries in their ministerial session of June last, when they decided on a programme of concerted action to promote growth and prosperity in the whole world economy, directed at growth stimulation in the North as well as in the South, among other things, by an increased transfer of resources. The recovery of the economy of the OECD countries is obviously of vital importance for the management of the world economy. The Netherlands will actively contribute to this recovery.\n321.\tI see no contradiction between the concept of growth and global interdependence and the strategy to\neradicate poverty and provide for basic human needs. The development policy of the Netherlands will in fact be guided by both these concepts. We shall strive for selective growth and positive readjustment measures in developed countries, for structural changes in the world economy and, thus, for the realization of the new international economic order. At the same time, the Netherlands policy will be directed at the eradication of mass poverty and unemployment.\n322.\tThe Netherlands Government is deeply concerned at the lack of progress in the dialogue and at the failure of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 to agree on its mandate and procedure. The General Assembly should without delay resolve the remaining differences of opinion, so that we can proceed with our urgent work on the substance.\n323.\tThe Netherlands Government welcomes the positive outcome of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held at Buenos Aires. In the building of \\\"bridges across the South\\\" a new dimension will be given to the attainment of collective Self-reliance by the developing countries.\n324.\tThe North-South dialogue ought not to deflect attention from creeping protectionism and other negative developments which directly affect the position of developing countries. Timely corrective and preventive measures in this field are at least as important as an increased transfer of resources. Here lies an urgent task for Governments and international organizations and their executive officers, in particular GATT, IMF, UNCTAD, OECD and the United Nations itself.\n325.\tWhat is the role of the United Nations in the management of global interdependence\u2014political and economic\u2014and in enhancing the dignity of man in an interdependent world? Has the United Nations the capacity and the strength to deal with the burning issues of today? These questions must be posed in all honesty and sincerity.\n326.\tThe record of the United Nations over the past year shows both positive and negative points. The thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly can be assessed positively. It showed, in the words of its President, \\\"a spirit of co-operation and mutual accommodation\\\".\n327.\tI see six areas for reflection, reconsideration and, possibly, further action for the United Nations.\n328.\tFirst and foremost, it is the duty of all Member States to reassess their own attitude towards the United Nations. If in the past the United Nations has often failed to act effectively in accordance with the objectives of the Charter, Member States themselves must be blamed for their failure to carry out the recommendations which they themselves sometimes solemnly had approved. Members should have more frequent and earlier recourse to the United Nations and, in particular, to the Security Council and the International Court of Justice.\n329.\tThe second area is that of peace-keeping operations. There is, in my view, a new consensus emerging on\npeace-keeping operations. The record of the last few years is positive. The United Nations has shown itself capable of setting up in various circumstances effective peace-keeping forces, and satisfactory procedures for cost-sharing have been agreed upon. On behalf of the European Community, my German colleague announced an initiative of its nine members on peace-keeping [AISPC/33/L.19]. The time is ripe for further action.\n330.\tThe third is the area of human rights. The recognition of interdependence will lead us nowhere without a recognition of human rights. The capacity of the United Nations to deal with human rights issues must be strengthened. The potential is there. It must be used and strengthened.\n331.\tThe Fourth area concerns the role and functions of the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the United Nations system. I firmly believe in the scope and possibilities for leadership and action by a strong and devoted international civil service. There is a close interaction between Member States on the one hand and the organizations and their executives on the other. Executive leadership can and must influence and guide action by member Governments. I urge the Secretary-General to continue to search for new initiatives. The Charter has given him the necessary power and authority. I urge him to use that power. Governments should be ready to support and follow him.\n332.\tThe Fifth is co-ordination and co-operation within the United Nations system. It is an anomaly that, while in numerous resolutions Member States are called upon to co-operate, the organizations of the United Nations system seem to attach too much importance to guarding their autonomy. Rivalry between international organizations belonging to the same system must come to an end. I call upon the Administrative Committee on Co-ordination urgently to tackle the problem of co-ordination and the cohesion of the United Nations system.\n333.\tSixthly, the uncontrolled proliferation of international organizations is creating problems of overlap and co-ordination. There is a lack of co-operation between United Nations organizations and organizations outside the system, including the non-governmental organizations, which I consider very important. The time has come to take stock of the situation and to start working for the consolidation of the family of international organizations.\n334.\tTo conclude, all nations and peoples are bound by the Charter of the United Nations. Peace, development and the dignity of man are interdependent. The recognition of this interdependence should guide us daily and be an inspiration for the General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff112.\tI should like at the outset to convey to Mr. Lievano through you, Sir, the warm congratulations of the delegation of Burma on his election as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly, and to assure him of our full co-operation in the discharge of the responsibilities of his high office. We are confident that under his able guidance we can look forward to a successful conclusion to our deliberations.\n113.\tWe owe a special debt of. thanks to our outgoing President, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, for the outstanding skill with which he presided over the deliberations of the last regular session, as well as the three very important special sessions of the General Assembly held during the year.\n114.\tWe are also happy to take this opportunity to offer our felicitations and friendly greetings to the delegation of Solomon Islands, whose members have taken their place among us for the first time. The addition of each new Member State is an advance along the path to the universality of this Organization.\n115.\tThe United Nations was founded a little over three decades ago with 51 Member States. Today it is nearly three times larger in size and symbolizes the conscious\ntheme of the universal brotherhood of man. To come to the General Assembly each year is to sense the growth of the world community and the continuity of the process towards the betterment of human relationships. The importance of the United Nations is thus underlined as a focus and framework within which the conflicting interests of States may find a degree of order and harmony.\n116.\tThis optimism becomes somewhat dimmed when we reflect on the current course of international developments. Much has happened in the period since we met in the Assembly last year and we cannot fail to notice some very disquieting features that dominate the international scene today.\n117.\tAs everyone knows, there have been major shifts in world political alignments, and international relationships have reached a disturbing degree of complexity. These relationships are markedly worsening in the highly important area of relations among major Powers. As a consequence, the struggle for strategic strongholds and spheres of influence has once again come to the fore, with a growing tendency towards extraregional intervention, notably in the regions of Africa and Asia. This imperils the national independence and peaceful development of smaller and lesser nations. It is also evident that long-standing areas of crisis have become aggravated, and dormant disputes and enmities have surfaced into local armed conflicts.\n118.\tThese adverse trends in the international setting do not augur well for peace and security. So long as no effective solution can yet be devised for the major contentious issues which are besetting nations, they will continue to place a heavy strain on our present-day world.\n119.\tThe principal problems to which the General Assembly will be directing its mind are not new, but are nearly as old as the United Nations itself. We refer here to the situation in the Middle East, the problems of southern Africa, the question of disarmament and the problems of world economic relations. For the first time in several years, we note that there is some visible indication that more headway is being made on these questions.\n120.\tThe Middle East continues to command world attention. Some unexpected impulses have brought about a new tempo in peace initiatives, which have the merit of breaching for the first time the emotional barriers set up in the region. On the other hand, the needs and interests of many nations within and around the Middle East are greatly compounded. It appears, therefore, that a viable solution would be difficult to attain, unless it be the result of a collective approach and be comprehensive in nature.\n121.\tThe delegation of Burma supports the view that the United Nations provides the most acceptable framework within which all parties should seek a solution to the Middle East problem. Clear guidelines have already been formulated in relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. A sound basis exists in Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which rightly calls for the withdrawal of Israeli aimed forces from Arab territories occupied in 1967. It also calls for the termination of the state of belligerency and the recognition of the right of Israel to exist as a State.\n122.\tThe delegation of Burma considers that a just and lasting settlement of the Middle East problem does not depend on the principles of the above resolution alone. Such a settlement also requires a solution of the Palestine question, which in turn means recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to an independent State.\n123.\tAfrica today constitutes the focus of international action. The area is one of crisis in which local conflicts tend to become prone to extraregional intervention, with all the elements of power-bloc rivalry. Such exercise of political pressure can only increase the range and level of tension in Africa and obstruct the United Nations ideal of international peace and security.\n124.\tIn southern Africa the process of decolonization has entered a new phase. In Namibia the continuing struggle of the liberation movements and the active support of the United Nations have led to the point where the illegal minority racist regime in power can no longer deny the Territory's right to become free and independent.\n125.\tFor Namibia the year 1978 marks a historic point in its march to independent statehood. In pursuance of its resolution 385 (1976), the Security Council has recently decided to take practical measures for the independence of Namibia at the earliest possible date. However, even at this last stage, the South African regime in power continues to hamper the process by trying to impose conditions on United Nations efforts.\n126.\tThe delegation of Burma stands by the United Nations position that South Africa's occupation of Namibia is illegal and that SWAPO is the authentic liberation movement of the Namibian people. We fully support the Security Council's call in its resolution 431 (1978) for free elections in Namibia under the supervision and control of the United Nations, and we agree that Namibia's territorial integrity and unity should be assured through the reintegration of Walvis Bay within its territory.\n127.\tThe present situation in Zimbabwe is one of mounting unrest and violence. Considerable efforts have been invested both inside and outside the United Nations to bring about a negotiated internationally acceptable settlement based on the transfer of power to the majority which would rule. But the illegal racist regime in power has ignored world public opinion in its unilateral action of imposing a deceptive internal settlement.\n128 The delegation of Burma considers that there can be no lasting solution unless all nationalist leaders, including the leaders of the Patriotic Front, are involved in the transition to majority rule. Burma has associated itself with all, Security Council decisions concerning the complete severance of all political and economic relations with the illegal racist minority regime.\n129. Burma has also faithfully implemented all United Nations decisions on South Africa, where there is as yet no sign of turning away from the basic policy of apartheid, which is institutionalized racial discrimination. Instead, massive reprisals have been taken against those who oppose apartheid. Burma severed all trade relations with South Africa in 1962. This year the necessary official action has\nbeen taken in application of the Security Council's mandatory arms embargo against that country.\n130.\tThe delegation of Burma firmly reiterates its support for the struggle of the people of Namibia and Zimbabwe for independence under majority rule as well as the struggle of the people of South Africa against apartheid and the policy of racism\n131.\tThere are two sets of comments which the delegation of Burma would like to make as we reflect on the problems of disarmament.\n132.\tThe world's major problem today is the urgency of halting the arms race and initiating the process of disarmament. Since the end of the Second World War the central issue of world concern has been the possibility of general nuclear war and the vital importance to human survival of avoiding such a tragedy. But this world-wide anxiety has been heightened over more than three decades by an unabated nuclear-arms race. The tremendous cost of the arms race and the range and destructive power of the weapons systems that have been devised are bewildering to the human mind. The futility and wastefulness of this becomes even clearer when we consider the fact that the opponents already have the capacity to destroy each other and even an over-kill capacity. Moreover, with every advance in the scientific and technological development of strategic weapons the process of negotiation on arms control and disarmament becomes increasingly complex and difficult. The fact is that the armaments race has become one of the greatest scourges of humanity and constitutes an obstacle to the improvement of the world's political relations and its economic development. Unless we can achieve some early steps to halt and reverse the arms race, fire ultimate objective of ensuring general and complete disarmament may recede further and prove elusive for ever Today the overriding imperative is to explore every avenue and method to bring the principal nuclear Powers into a binding agreement and a solemn undertaking to assure the international community that a nuclear confrontation will not take place.\n133.\tThis year's tenth special session of the General Assembly, on disarmament, provided a forum for the world community to demonstrate Its awareness of and concern at the unprecedented level and intensity of the arms race and the potential danger it poses for the security of mankind. The Final Document [resolution S-10J2/ provides an integrated and universal strategy for disarmament that enjoys the widest international acceptance known to date. Although it is the product of compromise and accommodation, the Final Document is a positive step forward. The United Nations, as the most representative and universal forum of today, has been brought into closer association with world disarmament processes. This marks a new departure in disarmament negotiations.\n134.\tThe task before the international community now is to translate into reality the principles and objectives embodied in the Final Document. The highest priority has been given to nuclear disarmament, and the principal nuclear Powers have a special responsibility to lead the way. If those Powers could take positive steps to halt and reverse the nuclear-arms race, that would imply a change in their\nattitudes and policies and would significantly affect future developments in the field of disarmament. Progress or the lack of progress in disarmament measures depends very much on the international behaviour of the principal nuclear Powers.\n135.\tAs everyone knows, the world economy is in a state of flux and remains unpredictable. Economists the world over seem to be in a dilemma over what steps should be taken to overcome the immediate pressures of world-wide inflation and monetary instability, declining growth rates, the increasing burden of debt on many countries, growing protectionism and the deteriorating balance in international trade and payments. No one has yet come forward with a viable solution to these problems.\n136.\tThe latent instability and the frequent recurrent crises in the world economy more than ever indicate that the present international economic system no longer serves the compelling demands of the times. In view of the reality of the existence of fundamental and structural defects in the present system, it is imperative to restructure the world economy in order to resolve the inequalities and imbalances in international economic relations.\n137.\tThe establishment of the New International Economic Order cannot be delayed any longer. If we indulge too much in the luxury of elaborating details and means of achieving that goal, there is the danger that we may lose sight of the objective itself. Above all, what is required in the initial stage is political will on the part of those who can contribute much to the realization of the New International Economic Order.\n138.\tWe are all aware of the growing interdependence of the international economy. The economies of both the developed and the developing world are becoming highly interdependent. Yet the world economy lacks an effective mechanism for mutual co-operation and benefit. The North-South dialogue, conducted with the main objective of setting up a just and equitable economic order, has resulted in a stalemate. The concerted action and strategy of the industrially developed countries to solve the world's basic economic issues have thus far produced few significant results. The Second United Nations Development Decade is coming to a close, but the objectives of the International Development Strategy for the 1970s have hardly been fulfilled.\n139.\tWe welcome the General Assembly's decision to convene a special session in 1980 to assess the progress made in the various-forums of the United Nations system, to realize the establishment of the New International Economic Order and to take appropriate action for the promotion of development and international economic co-operation, including the adoption of a new international development strategy for the 1980s.\n140.\tThere can be no doubt that the transformation of the world economic system is already well on the way towards a greater measure of equality in the life of nations in an interdependent world. Although at present it would seem that nothing of particular importance has happened that might be conducive to the solution of the major problems that confront the developing countries and the entire\ninternational community, the most cogent fact is the growth of an awareness of the need for concerted action in all sectors of economic life. This, we believe, opens up a hopeful prospect that the international community may be able to come up with negotiable answers, new attitudes and new decisions leading towards the establishment of the New International Economic Order which we all seek to create.\n141.\tThe delegation of Burma believes that the deliberations we shall have during this session of the General Assembly will lead to a better appreciation of the problems which confront the international community and the measures required to solve them. We very much hope that our efforts and deliberations will be fruitful and of benefit to all Members of the United Nations.\n"

By entrusting to him the burdens and responsibility of conducting its work, the General Assembly has sought to pay a tribute both to his abilities as a consummate diplomat and, through him, to his country and his distinguished President, who has succeeded in a short time in forging the destiny of his people and in transforming man's creative freedom into continued incitement to integration of the country's productive forces, and who continues to play a positive and important role in the international arena m the constant search for peace, unity and solidarity among the peoples of the world and in the relations among States.\n295.\tTherefore, we are proud to affirm our conviction that the General Assembly's present deliberations will have a happy outcome. The Togolese delegation will collaborate in the accomplishment of this exalting but difficult task.\n296.\tThe outgoing President, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, imparted a high decorum to the debates of the thirty-second regular session and the three special sessions that followed. He showed in full measure his competence as the accomplished diplomat that we all know him to be. That is why I wish to take this opportunity to convey to him our most heartfelt congratulations.\n297.\tAllow me also to tender to Mr. Kurt Waldheim the congratulations of the Togolese Government on his unremitting efforts and ceaseless endeavours for peace in the world, where, regrettably, dangerous hotbeds of tension still exist. We pay to the Secretary-General our sincere tribute for his highly commendable action.\n298.\tMay I also be permitted to salute, on behalf of the Government and people of Togo, Solomon Islands, which we welcome in our midst as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of our Organization.\n299.\tThis year again the world views with anxiety the recrudescence of the points of crisis in the world. Security, peace and co-operation are again threatened, and the international community stands helpless before the evils that beset it. In its disarray it turns its eyes towards our Organization.\n300.\tThe United Nations must rediscover the necessary resources, the indispensable impetus, that will help it remember the causes of the many convulsions tearing our contemporary world asunder. It must first persuade all Member States fully to assume their responsibilities and to give proof of a political will powerful enough to transcend their differences, in order to concentrate all the required attention on the grave issues afflicting the world today, which are capable of affecting international peace and security unless appropriate solutions are found.\n301.\tThe world today is an interdependent world, and it urgently needs peace, unity and solidarity in order to devote its energies to the international co-operation that is becoming each day more indispensable.\n302.\tIn this connexion, it is regrettable to note that the world, far from having understood the need for that co-operation, stands complacently by while useless hotbeds of tension grow in numbers, thus creating a flagrant contradiction between the desire of the peoples of the world for peace, unity and solidarity and the permanent state of belligerence which hangs over our world.\n303.\tThe problems of southern Africa, the Western Sahara, the Middle East and Korea are involved in that contradiction.\n304.\tIn southern Africa the paralysing indecision of the principal Powers involved in the settlement of the crisis there and their obvious inability to assume their responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia, who still languish under the abject yoke of colonialism, have engendered the suffering and rebellion of millions of human beings who ask only to live in freedom, peace and unity with all the other peoples of the region.\n305.\tThe delaying tactics of Ian Smith, at bay in Zimbabwe, undoubtedly reflect the insolence of a man accustomed never to look truth in the face. The negative attitude of the leaders of the white minority in that country cannot but strengthen the international community's support for the national movement'; which struggle to regain their freedom. The increasingly deceitful tactics used by Ian Smith should lead us to impose a stricter application and more consistent implementation of the\nsanctions against his regime. They are an additional reason why we should call on the Patriotic Front to be more vigilant in ensuring its ranks a greater unity, transcending internal differences, in order to face the common enemy-namely, the racist minority regime in Salisbury.\n306.\tIn Namibia, Pretoria stubbornly endeavours by successive twists and turns to delay the accession of that country to full sovereignty, and tries, by rearguard actions, to take Walvis Bay away from Namibia, thus seeking to deal a serious blow at the territorial integrity of that country. The international community should no longer remain powerless but should do everything in its power to ensure the application in its entirety of the Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the ninth special session on Namibia. By so doing, it will renew its support for the freedom lighters of SWAPO, the sole representative of the Namibian people, which is struggling for freedom and the integrity and independence of that country.\n307.\tThe situation in South Africa has scarcely changed since our last regular session. It is obvious to the international community that the inhuman apartheid regime continues to hold sway with all its shameless cynicism and barbarity.\n308.\tHow long must the international community endure the affronts of the heinous Pretoria regime, which persists in defying the whole world by its retrograde racist policy and in multiplying its acts of provocation and aggression against the peaceful population of the neighbouring States?\n309.\tThe Togolese Government has never failed to uphold the view that apartheid will not die a natural death and that, as long as the economic and political sanctions adopted by our Organization and many international conferences are not fully applied by all States, the racist minority will continue to subject the black majority to oppression and inhuman torture.\n310.\tIn this connexion, we note with regret that certain Member States have expressed their refusal to give the recent Geneva World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination the full weight that it deserves.\n311.\tWhile the large majority of the peoples of the world suffer from malnutrition, disease and other scourges, we see certain Powers involved in an unbridled armaments race involving ever more sophisticated weapons.\n312.\tThis race has led them to perfect devices capable of killing man and sparing die environment.\n313.\tWhat does this diabolical refinement mean if it is to preserve an environment without a soul? This is the problem posed by the discovery of the neutron bomb. The fact that mankind has had to start a debate on its own survival, as threatened by its own discoveries, reflects the anguish in which millions of human beings live. It is more indicative of a state of decadence than of a necessary stage in the progress of mankind.\n314.\tThe neutron bomb raises a problem of conscience for the whole of mankind. Thus human life is relegated to the lowest level in the scale of values.\n315.\tIt is in this context that South Africa, of whose bellicose attitude based on racial hatred everyone is aware, is also trying to acquire nuclear weapons.\n316.\tThe height of absurdity is that in this Satanic undertaking South Africa, the kingdom of apartheid, enjoys the goodwill and co-operation of countries which are well placed to draw the lessons of history and to measure the dreadful consequences of war.\n317.\tOur Organization is now at a crossroads and its responsibility has increased tenfold. It must ensure scrupulous respect for the territorial integrity of States. It must defend all countries, large and small. That is why the Togolese Government is profoundly convinced that France, in agreement with the international community, will assume its responsibility to ensure, in regard to the Comorian island of Mayotte, respect for the principle of the territorial integrity of States Members o- our Organization, and will enable the young Republic of Comoros resolutely to tackle its urgent development problems.\n318.\tWith respect to the Western Sahara, we hope that reason will prevail, that the initiatives to be taken on the basis of the principle - of the right of peoples to self-determination will lead to positive results and that peace will return to that region.\n319.\tThe Togolese Government, which has always supported the principle of self-determination of peoples, again proclaims its resolute opposition to the unlawful occupation of foreign territories by other States.\n320.\tIsrael's obstinacy in occupying by force the territories of other States in the Middle East represents inadmissible contempt for the sacred principles of our Organization's Charter. The situation of latent war that results is an almost permanent threat to international peace and security. As long as the Arab and Palestinian territories remain occupied, the imperialist expansionist policy pursued by Israel as it tramples underfoot the principles of our Organization will be rejected by the large majority of States. The Togolese Government subscribes to the idea of there being a resumption of the dialogue between all the parties concerned, with the effective participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the legitimate representative of-the Palestinian people, which must recover its national inalienable rights, and first and foremost its right to a homeland.\n321.\tThat is why the international community must bring Israel to reason in order that it may weigh the seriousness of the situation prevailing in the Middle East and work in all good faith for a return to peace in that part of the world in conformity with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and other United Nations bodies.\n322.\tSimilarly, the search for a peaceful solution to the Cyprus question necessarily involves the implementation of Security Council resolution 365 (1974) and General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) by the two communities living in that State. But the implementation of those decisions can be effective only if there is an immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Cyprus followed by the adoption of specific measures to facilitate the return to the island of all refugees.\n323.\tThus it is obvious that the Togolese Government encourages the resumption of negotiations between the Greek and Turkish communities under the aegis of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n324.\tWith respect to the problem of the Far East, we reaffirm our firm opposition to manoeuvres designed to impose recognition of the fait accompli of the fictitious' creation of two Korean entities. We again express our total support for the Korean people as a whole in their just struggle for the peaceful reunification and independence of their country.\n325.\tIt is also in conformity with its credo \\\"Peace, union and solidarity\\\" that Togo supports the Indian Ocean being a zone of peace outside the military rivalry of the great Powers. \n326.\tWe have the impression that certain Powers take pleasure in setting mankind on the road to self-destruction. We fail to understand their vicious tendency to play with the fire of war and the arms race.\n327.\tThe international community must bring the armaments merchants to reason. It was with every justification that, at its tenth special session devoted to disarmament, the General Assembly insisted that to be lasting peace must necessarily be based on full disarmament in order to halt the unbridled, senseless arms race that would lead to a holocaust, and relieve mankind from the terrible threat of a calamity that has long been hanging over our heads.\n328.\tThis need to halt the arms race is all the more urgent because the world economic situation has languished since the oil crisis of 1973.\n329.\tMr. President, in your remarkable inaugural address  you made an especially brilliant, realistic and edifying analysis of the international economic situation.\n330.\tThe situation of the developing countries continues to deteriorate. While in all international forums there is unanimity on the need to replace the old economic order with a spectrum of more coherent and better organized relations that effectively reflect the concerns of the large majority of mankind, the solutions advocated thus far remain inoperative because the wealthy countries continue at all costs to endeavour to safeguard their selfish interests by putting a brake on any attempt to speed up the establishment of a new, more equitable and hence more just international economic order.\n331.\tIt is true that goodwill has been shown throughout the world. There has been intensive activity, and research has been undertaken in many areas, making it possible to identify possible areas for the development of the world in the next few years. The majority of the conclusions arrived at in those studies show an accentuation of the imbalances between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\". The frustrations resulting from such a development may well compromise the possibility of a dialogue and will certainly lead the rich and the poor countries into a confrontation the consequences of which cannot be foreseen. International economic relations, the transfer of technology, financial\nflows and the terms of trade may, unless we are careful, be aggravated and may disrupt the world even further.\n332.\tIt is more than urgent to find a rapid solution to the crisis in the international monetary system, which was seriously shaken in 1971. This state of affairs is of particular concern to the countries of the third world because of the serious harm it causes their development. In\n' fact, the monetary instability with which the world appears to live complacently is detrimental to the developing countries and causes losses in hard currency that are accentuated through unchecked speculative movements.\n333.\tThe serious deterioration in their balance of payments has considerably minimized, some drastically, their possibilities of development. That is why they have become aware of the need to abandon the obsolete mechanisms that have thus far governed international economic relations. They are now seeking solutions likely to put an end to disorder and the confusion that has characterized world economic relations, in order to prepare together the course to be followed in the future within a more balanced economic order. That is why the countries of the third world have undertaken intensive activities of concentration in order to affirm, more adequately than in the past, the interdependent nature of their development, so as to reduce their dependency on the developed world. Their solidarity and determination have been underscored on a number of occasions, especially at the three most recent meetings of UNCTAD and in other international forums.\n334.\tThis solidarity has already, following the oil crisis of 1973, at the sixth special session of the United Nations General Assembly in April and May 1974 and at the seventh special session in September 1975, led to the adoption of the historic resolutions on the establishment of a new international economic order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI), 3202 (S-VI) and 3362(S-VII)], creating the framework for the application of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)].\n335.\tEquity, equality, sovereignty, interdependence and co-operation among all States\u2014the slogan of the new international economic order\u2014remain deadlocked within the attempts to give them effect because of the stubborn insistence of rich countries on tinkering with the situation.\n336.\tSo long an the imbalance between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\" continues peace, unity and solidarity among peoples will not exist.\n337.\tPeoples want progress and not an obstinate race towards the destruction of mankind. The peoples of the world aspire to serenity, quiet and peace in order to construct a better world. They do not want the world to be destroyed by these deadly weapons. The peoples of the world want to safeguard the human community, not to reduce it to chaos through Satanic discoveries. Yes, men want peace to ensure their full development. Yes, men want to live in unity to combat the scourges, calamities and disasters that beset mankind. They do not want to destroy human life and not, scattered and isolated, to confront the innumerable difficulties and obstacles to human life.\n338.\tYes, men aspire to a common approach to the resources of the world and condemn the obsolete selfishness shamelessly advocated by some to the detriment of the interests of the majority of the peoples of the world.\nPeace, union, solidarity: this is the moving appeal of the people of Togo and of its leader. General Gnassinge Eyadema, to all the peoples of the earth, so that together we may build the world of tomorrow, a world in which there is no spectre of war, division or selfishness.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff50.\tI congratulate you, Sir, as an outstanding political personality of Colombia, on your election to the lofty office of this session of President of the United Nations General Assembly, I wish you, as well as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, much success in carrying out your demanding and responsible work.\n51.\tWe welcome the admission of Solomon Islands to membership in the United Nations. It reflects the progressive elimination of the remnants of colonialism and contributes to strengthening the universality of our Organization.\n52.\tEvents over the past year have brought a great deal of new and positive changes favourable to the cause of detente and peace\u2014a fact that we sincerely welcome and encourage.\n53.\tThe situation in which we have opened the current session, however, is not at all clear. It is at the same time both favourable and complicated. It is contradictory, but it also holds promise for the future.\n54.\tIt is favourable because it clearly proves the historical futility of all the efforts by the champions of the \\\"cold war\\\" to revive the policy of acting from positions of strength.\n55.\tIt is complicated because the opponents of detente have not laid down their arms but have even stepped up their dangerous activities.\n56.\tIt is contradictory because, in confirmation of the laws of dialectics, it reflects the inevitable conflict between the old order, which resists progress, and the new order of world affairs in the spirit of the principles of detente.\n57.\tNotwithstanding this, it holds promise for the future because the desire of peoples for detente and for the ending of the arms race continues to be the decisive factor of international development.\n58.\tTherefore, If we do not want to grope in darkness there is no more urgent task ahead of us than to march together along the well-tested paths of detente, the salutary effects of which we arc only beginning to feel and whose almost unlimited possibilities we are only just discovering.\n51 , In that process we must orient ourselves to what brings peoples and nations together, what unites them, and not what divides them. We must try to push forward to new horizons, not just live passively next to one another and \\\"merely\\\" avoid conflicts. That might have sufficed yesterday for good-neighbourly relations but no longer does today. We must constantly develop the infrastructure of detente and strengthen its political, economic and legal foundations. We must improve the pattern of bilateral relations, build mutual confidence and cultivate political dialogue on all levels, including the highest levels. We must maintain a regular and smoothly functioning system of consultations, conclude mutually advantageous agreements and give them specific content. We must see to it that they are observed, because the old Roman principle \\\"Pacta sunt servanda\\\" is more valid today than ever before. We must bring about detente by developing economic, scientific and technical co-operation, and our aim should be further mutual cultural and spiritual enrichment. The striving for detente -this clearly defined, many-sided, dynamic and lasting asset, beneficial to all-must permeate more and more the body of international life and become universal and irreversible.\n60.\tOne cannot expect to see in the future any imposing, externally spectacular successes, because it will be necessary, as it is now, to wage a persistent day-to-day struggle to achieve what has already been agreed upon. It must not be permitted that the positive results achieved be brought to naught. We must prevent any risks being taken with detente. It must not be discredited or used as a pretext for interference in the internal affairs of others. At the same time, we must advance, often as pioneers, along unknown, untrodden trails.\n61.\tBut first of all we shall have to come to terms with max difficult but feasible task of extending detente to the military field. We must not succumb to those who wish to pursue a policy of flagrant disregard for mankind's aspirations. We must not allow them to place wolf traps on the path of detente by stepping up tension and the feverish arms race, by generating mistrust, confrontation and bleak instability.\n62.\tIt will therefore be necessary to remind them ever more often of the futility of counting on blackmail. Threatening gestures were without effect on the socialist countries in the past and are even less effective today. Nothing has been or will be gained by them. They merely are used to complicate the situation, and their use now would be too dear a price to pay for such a miscalculation in technological instrumentation due to erroneous information.\n63.\tThus the policy of detente is a policy of persistent, untiring, responsible endeavours. The question whether it is worth pursuing is answered by facts.\n64.\tIn Europe, that ancient epicentre of conflicts, political developments are, unquestionably and more successfully than anywhere else, crossing the fateful cross-roads at which we all stand, first of all thanks to the implementation of the ideals of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, effectively reaffirmed at its first review session held in Belgrade from October 1977 to March 1978 by the determination of all the participants to continue the policy of detente, despite the absurd attempts at ignoring the principles agreed on or even assuming the position of \\\"ordained\\\" arbiters.\n65.\tIn the micro-climate of Central Europe alone, that malignant source of wars as terrible as the Thirty Years War or the Second World War, detente is reflected in the longest period of peace in recent centuries. That is the level of benefits to be derived from detente.\n66.\tIt is with this basic philosophy, founded on undeniable facts, that Czechoslovakia approaches the policy of detente as a stable link in the community of the socialist countries, an active participant in the Warsaw Treaty Organization and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. We are purposefully implementing this philosophy in practice, in co-ordination with the fraternal socialist countries, guided by the principles of the Leninist concept of peaceful coexistence. The President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, Gustav Husak, declared, on the occasion of this year's visit by a Soviet Party and Government delegation headed by Leonid Brezhnev;\n\\\"Our Party and the entire Czechoslovak people highly value the peace policy of principle of the Soviet Union; they are fully supporting it and are doing their best to contribute to its implementation.\\\"\n67.\tThat is why we welcome every impulse, by any country, towards making the process of detente yet more vital.\n68.\tA valuable contribution to that development is, in our view, the positive results of Czechoslovakia's relations with its Western neighbours.\n69.\tTheir culmination was this year's official visit by the President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, Gustav Husak, to the Federal Republic of Germany, the first visit on that level, by the way, in the history of the two States. The joint statement reviewing the results of the talks clearly reflected the political will of both sides to deepen detente and to make it stable, as well as further to expand mutual relations in all fields. The following up of the invitations accepted by the leading representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany to visit Czechoslovakia will undoubtedly strengthen that determination.\n70.\tContinued favourable developments have been noted in our relations with Austria, in which, in recent times, foundations have been decisively strengthened for an all-round development of constructive, mutually beneficial relations between our two countries. The expected visit by\nthe President of Austria to Czechoslovakia will in that respect be a significant contribution to the development of peaceful co-operation between our two countries.\n71.\tIn fact, we have been enriching the process of detente by developing mutually advantageous co-operation with practically all European countries and other States in all continents, including those with which our relations in the past were Insignificant or did not exist at all.\n72.\tWe continue to deepen our traditionally good relations with the developing countries. We are most resolutely supporting their just struggle for political independence, economic development and social progress.\n73.\tThe -movement of the non-aligned countries is regarded by us as an Important and positive factor in international relations. We welcome the fact that the non-aligned countries consider it beneficial and objectively necessary for the process of detente to become universal and dominant in all continents.\n74.\tWe have therefore welcomed with a feeling of satisfaction the results of the Belgrade ministerial meeting.  We expect that the contribution to peace by the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, which is to convene next year in Havana, will be the more significant for that.\n75.\tWe arc placing special emphasis on the over-all restructuring of the international economic relations and the introduction of a new international economic order.\n76.\tThis task, however, must be resolved in accordance with that concept, which is based on equitable international division of labour, on the development of equal and mutually advantageous relations between all countries- socialist, capitalist and developing.\n77.\tValuable experience is being gained in the European continent thanks to the fact that the material tissue of the policy of detente is starting to be reinforced through multilateral economic co-operations.\n78.\tWe welcome the fact that the thirty-third session of ECE agreed to convene all-European congresses on the environment.  The current contacts between representatives of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the European Economic Community also demonstrate how important, as well as possible, it is to work out a joint agreement on the establishment of official contacts and thus to contribute to the development of multilateral co-operation among countries of the European region as well as other regions and to the strengthening of the material basis of detente.\n79.\tA few months ago, for the first time in the history of this Organization, in this highly representative forum and with the participation of almost all the countries of the world, we conducted deliberations on that key issue of our time, namely, disarmament. The specific nature of the tenth special session was marked by the untiring efforts of all the participants to help to resolve that vital issue; by their determination to remove the senseless burden of armaments from the shoulders of nations and to eliminate the incipient explosive situations which result in conflicts.\n80.\tThe tenth session confirmed clearly and positively the profound interest of mankind in halting the arms race. It confirmed the urgent necessity of complementing political detente by military detente without delay. It recognized that this problem was a universal one affecting the vital interests of all peoples and countries, which therefore could be resolved only through joint efforts.\n81.\tIt is in the light of this most urgent need of our day that we evaluate the Final Document of the special session [resolution S-10/2J. In our view, it gives, on the whole, a realistic assessment of the present situation in the field of disarmament and constructively sets out concrete goals.\n82.\tThus, we cannot complain about a lack of well-defined alternatives here, or about a lack of effective instruments to be used, as we fervently hope, for the dismantling of the hideous armaments monster.\n83.\tForemost among those alternatives is the document on practical measures for ending the arms race, submitted by the Soviet Union,  which calls for the halting of the arms race and the blocking of the channels through which it is spreading and crossing ever new thresholds of great destructive power.\n84.\tThe implementation of this comprehensive programme, beginning with international agreements to halt the production and ban all types of nuclear weapons as well as other weapons of mass destruction and including the prohibition of the development of new types of conventional weapons of mass destruction, would mean the removal for all time of the danger of a nuclear war and the establishment of lasting international peace and security throughout the world.\n85.\tWe firmly believe that the positive solution of the disarmament problem would be greatly assisted by a world-wide treaty on the non-use of force in international relations. As far as the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is concerned, it is ready at any time to sign such a treaty. Czechoslovakia, which, in September and October, exactly 40 years ago, as a result of the infamous Munich diktat, become the first front-line minefield of the Second World War, is,, as; a socialist and peace-loving country, vitally interested in the ending once and for all of all armaments and all the dangers of military confrontation. It is willing at all times to consider any constructive proposals by other countries and to co-operate with anybody who has a genuine interest In halting the development and manufacture? of weapons of mass destruction and the unbridled arms race.\n86. But effective disarmament measures the urgency of which was again shown by the special session, can acquire the force which they vitally heed and a lasting and, in particular binding nature for all States only through the holding of a World Disarmament Conference. We are Sincerely pleased that the special Session really became a prologue to such a conference when it recommended with all its authority the convening of that conference \\\"at the earliest appropriate time\\\". The time has thus come for us to reach an agreement oh that basis on when and how that conference should be held most successfully.\nLast summer the socialist countries including Czechoslovakia submitted another important proof of their sincere efforts and desire to reach a mutually advantageous agreement on the important subject of the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe, The new proposals and initiative of the socialist countries in many respects go a long way to meet constructively the position of the West, They are designed finally to break the deadlock at those talks. This step may eventually become a positive stimulus for the much-needed progress in the entire field of disarmament.\n88. The situation in the field of disarmament would be substantially improved by the early conclusion of an agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States on the limitation of offensive strategic weapons and their systems,\nS9, The same applies to a successful and early conclusion of the tripartite negotiations between the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom on the general and complete prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. Furthermore, we believe that the current session of the General Assembly should encourage the initiation of constructive negotiations on the conclusion of an agreement to prohibit the development, manufacture and deployment of neutron weapons.\n90. In our view, the adoption of a joint undertaking by all nuclear States not to use nuclear weapons against those countries which renounce them and which do not have them in their territories is most important. We resolutely support the proposal submitted by the Soviet Union that this undertaking be made into an international agreement as soon as possible and that reliable international measures be adopted to forestall the deployment off unclear weapons in the territories of States where they are sot as yet deployed. The achievement of concrete agreements to halt the arms race depends, first of all, on the policies of states, on their strong political will and also on the peoples of countries committing themselves to efforts aimed at ending the arms race. That is why we fully support the draft declaration on the preparation of societies for life peace, submitted to this session of the General Assembly by the Polish People's Republic. We share the view that such a document would contribute significantly to the support of the noble ideals of peace, security, mutual respect and understanding throughout the international community as a whole.\n91. A burning problem of our time is posed by conflicts which complicate detente and, if they were to worsen further, would gravely jeopardize that process. They are rightly described as hotbeds of tension.\n92.\tAlthough all these conflicts differ from each other, they have a common denominator. It is not only a question of disputed borders, or borders which some consider to be unjust, but also of that quest for oil, copper, cobalt, uranium and other raw materials, that greed for cheap labour that brings fabulous profits to the transnational corporations. It is also a question of the endeavour to hinder the process of the internal polarization of forces, to preserve or maintain the last colonial territories, and of the ominous efforts to turn some developing countries into strongholds or spring-boards for the struggle against the national liberation movements.\n93.\tThat is why any attempts at suppressing the national liberation movements, which are widely recognized as legal by the international community, are in no way a suitable response to the indomitable determination of the peoples of Africa to fight for their honour and dignity.\n94.\tOnce again we would point out that the obsolete anachronisms of the racist and colonial regimes in Salisbury and Pretoria continue to be a grave source of danger for the entire independent continent of Africa and for peaceful life, not only in that region but throughout the world in general. They are a contemptible insult to the dignity and intellect of the Africans. We categorically denounce the numerous acts of aggression by the South African and Rhodesian racists against the heroic people of Angola and Mozambique.\n95.\tWhile on this point, I should like to emphasize once more here in the United Nations forum that the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has always consistently and actively stood for the complete elimination of such political anachronisms as colonialism, racism and apartheid. Therefore, both here and in the Security Council, of which we are a member, we resolutely speak out in favour of the speedy granting of independence to the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia, in keeping with the United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. We support and shall continue to support all concrete measures leading to the attainment of that objective.\n96.\tWe have always held the view that any separate negotiations on the Middle East\u2014that chronic source of tension\u2014wherever they are held, in a tent on kilometre 101, in Jerusalem,. in Cairo or at Camp David, run absolutely counter to the vital interests of the Arab nations. Since they have never tackled the issue comprehensively\u2014 particularly from the point of view of the Arab people of Palestine\u2014they can never lead to peace but only to continued instability, to further complications and conflicts. Their essence has not changed, whether we call them \\\"a step-by-step\\\" policy or a search for \\\"the framework of peace\\\", and regardless of where they are held. We therefore continue to be firmly convinced that truly lasting peace in that explosive region of the world can be ensured only on the basis of a comprehensive settlement with the participation of all parties concerned, including the PLO. Such a settlement calls urgently for the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied by the aggressor in 1967, for the implementation of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination and to the establishment of their own State, and for the safeguarding of the right to independence and security of all States in that area.\n97.\tWe continue to believe that the most suitable framework for such a settlement is the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all parties concerned, including the PLO.\n98.\tWe firmly advocate the settlement of the Cyprus question on the basis of Strict respect for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus, in accordance with the appropriate United Nations resolutions. We reaffirmed that position during the recent visit to Czechoslovakia of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cyprus.\n99.\tWe are firmly on the side of the people of the reunified socialist Viet Nam who, after long years of war, still at the present time are courageously defending their sovereignty against hegemonistic tendencies, pressures and provocations. From this rostrum I should like to express our full support for their just cause.\n100.\tFurthermore, I should not like to omit the fact that this year 25 years have elapsed since the end of the Korean war. We emphasize once again that, according to the resolution adopted at the thirtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly [resolution 3390 (XXX)], it is necessary to provide all the prerequisites for turning the armistice into lasting peace and for a speedy, independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, as sought by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n101.\tThis month Czechoslovakia will commemorate 60 years of its existence. In the first half of that period my country lived under the old social order. We lived through the economic crisis, the Munich tragedy, the six years of Fascist occupation and cruel war, during which almost 400,000 Czechs and Slovaks lost their lives.\n102.\tThe second half, an incomparably happier one, represents 30 years of the building of socialism and all-round prosperity; of the exploration of outer space, thanks to the Soviet Union; of securing favourable conditions for the comprehensive spiritual as well as material development of our people, that is to say, first of all the right to work, to comprehensive medical care free of charge, free education, all-round care for mother and child, and security in old age. I mention these facts because firm, secure conditions on the home also make the foreign policy a firm and reliable instrument for advancing the interests of one's people. For us these interests are peace and social progress.\n103.\tThat is why I think that it is hardly necessary for me to repeat here once more our unwavering determination to see the United Nations acknowledged as an irreplaceable international body born in the earliest post-war years of general happiness, when the irrepressible cause of human freedom, triumphing over the unparalleled barbaric destruction, united the world community in a staunch effort to prevent a new world war.\n104.\tAn instrument which has stood the test of time, the United Nations Charter, that document of universal validity, has since then enabled us to struggle, according to our possibilities, with the problems of the post-war period. Its consistent unswerving observance is a guarantee of the effectiveness of the role the United Nations will play in the future.\n105.\tThe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, as one of the founding Members of the United Nations and at present also a member of the Security Council, is fully committed to the cause of the United Nations and in the future, encouraged by the enthusiasm of the peace-loving forces, will continue to give undiminished support to the process of detente and to the expansion of constructive international co-operation\u2014because that policy is fully in keeping with the humane nature of our socialist system and because that effort to create the necessary conditions for a peaceful life for all nations and the development of peaceful and fruitful co-operation among States is the main purpose of our foreign policy.\n"

Your election is a fitting tribute not only to your country but also significantly to your eminent qualities as a statesman, diplomat and academician.\n2.\tWe should also like to congratulate your predecessor, Deputy Federal Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Yugoslavia, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, on the excellent manner in which he presided over the thirty-second regular session and the special sessions of the General Assembly this year.\n3.\tWe pay a tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the dedication and efficiency with which he continues to lead our Organization. The personal commitment of the Secretary-General to the solution of problems of decolonization, international economic co-operation and international peace and security, among others, convinces us that, given the political will necessary for the implementation of United Nations decisions on the part of ail of us, success is not out of sight.\n4.\tAt this session we are pleased to welcome Solomon Islands, which has joined the world Organization as its one hundred and fiftieth Member, and we look forward to fruitful co-operation with it.\n5.\tThe question of self-determination and independence in southern Africa and elsewhere is a prime factor in the formulation and execution of Uganda's foreign policy. That is why in an international forum of this nature it is essential that we reaffirm our total commitment to and support for the struggle for self-determination and majority rule in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. There is no need to stress our conviction that our brothers and sisters in southern Africa must attain the freedom and liberties which are the legitimate right of all peoples.\n6.\tThe ordeals suffered by the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa under the racist and rebel regimes are too well known to this Assembly and do not need to be reiterated. Equally well known are various declarations and resolutions arrived at in various international forums. Of common knowledge, too, are decisions emanating from such declaration's and resolutions.\n7.\tUganda pledges itself, just as it has always done, to extend total support to any such decisions which are geared towards the goal of total independence for the people of Namibia and Zimbabwe and the end of apartheid in South Africa within the shortest possible time.\n8.\tIt may be recalled that in 1966, by General Assembly resolution 2145 (XXI), South Africa's Mandate over the Territory of Namibia was supposed to be terminated. In the following year a special session of the General Assembly set up the United Nations Council for Namibia to take on full responsibility for the Territory until independence [resolution 2248(S-V)J. Both the Security Council and the International Court of Justice endorsed those decisions.\n9.\tWe are convinced that, in spite of the difficulties that have faced the United Nations Council for Namibia since its establishment and despite the atrocities committed daily against the Namibian people by the racist Pretoria regime, victory is round the corner, thanks to the unswerving determination of the people of Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPOJ. Indeed, the increased armed struggle by SWAPO, the only authentic representative of the people of Namibia, has demonstrated to the world that the people of Namibia will achieve true and genuine independence. SWAPO's efforts for the cause of independence must therefore be commended.\n10.\tOn behalf of my delegation I wish to restate that my country will continue, within its means, to render unwavering support, both material and otherwise, to SWAPO in this noble struggle. We believe that it is essential for SWAPO to continue the armed struggle despite, and even alongside, the diplomatic offensive.\n11.\tWhereas we note with appreciation the concern that this Organization has expressed by holding the ninth special session of the General Assembly, on Namibia, as well as Security Council meetings on the Territory, we are seriously concerned at the way racist South Africa is left with liberty to continue its repression of the Namibian people.\n12.\tIn our opinion, the Security Council at its last meeting on Namibia should have come out with a definite stand on racist South Africa rather than merely requesting it to \nco-operate in the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Should South Africa not take heed of the Security Council decision, we support the stand that the United Nations should take punitive measures, including the invocation of Chapter VII of the Charter. We hope that when that stand is taken those Powers and their transnational corporations which have always opposed the invocation of Chapter VII, because they are leading trading partners of the South African regime, will put the interests of mankind before material advantages.\n13.\tWe support those measures, notwithstanding the fact that it is taboo to advocate such steps in some quarters, which see Namibia and Rhodesia as the cushion or periphery of the Pretoria regime, a regime which must be protected as the custodian of the legacy of imperialist, colonialist and neo-colonialist domination. We oppose that stand. We reject the proposition that nobody should touch the nerve-centre of imperialism and racial hatred, the stage on which the active domination by the Western transnational activities of the continent of Africa, the south Atlantic and the Indian Ocean is enacted.\n14.\tIn spite of all this, is Africa still gullible? Do all believe that those who created the southern African situation, the very ones who are behind the status quo and of whose values South Africa is a legendary example, will turn around to destroy it? This does not appear to be very logical. Of course a change of heart there can be, but if there is such a change it should be manifested in concrete action: action that should involve the ending of support, military, economic and moral, to Pretoria.\n15.\tIt is within the framework of the foregoing thoughts that my country views with scepticism some of the overtures that we have heard of in recent months. Needless to say, we should be very happy if the problem could be solved diplomatically.\n16.\tWe fully support the armed struggle in Zimbabwe and hope that there will be more and more unity emerging within the liberation movement in order to accelerate the freedom and independence of that Territory.\n17.\tIn order to arrest the situation in South Africa, we call upon the international community, through this Assembly, to step up concrete measures that will reinstate social justice in the Territory and peace and security in the entire region.\n18.\tThe situation in the Middle East constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security, and we support the declaration of the non-aligned countries that Palestine is the core of this question [see A/33/279, para. 5J. We believe that no durable peace can be achieved in that part of the globe until Israel withdraws from all occupied Arab territories and the inalienable national and legal rights of the Palestinian people are restored, with freedom to exercise those rights, including the right to return to their homeland, to self-determination and to establish an independent Palestine, with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole representative of the Palestinian people. We hope that every effort will be exerted by all concerned to avoid further divisions among the Arab peoples during this crucial period.\n19.\tThe world is no nearer to peace and global tranquillity than it has been in the past. Despite attempts to achieve an agreement at the second series of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the Soviet Union and the United States of America, we continue at the same time to witness the release of more funds for the further development of even more sophisticated weaponry by those concerned.\n20.\tMy delegation welcomes the Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the tenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly, devoted to disarmament. We hope that, given the political will, headway towards the achievement of the desired end will be made. We believe that, instead of astronomical amounts of technical and financial resources being diverted to armaments, such resources should be utilized for the socio-economic betterment of poor nations.\n21 My delegation views with serious concern trends in the world economic situation whereby the rich developed nations continue to get richer while the poor developing countries are getting poorer. The old international economic system that was designed by the exploiters to serve their own interests, without any regard for the interests of the developing countries, continues to flourish in spite of the landmark consensus decisions of the sixth special session which launched the New International Economic Order.\n22.\tMy delegation is concerned by the intransigence of some developed countries in negotiations regarding the implementation of United Nations decisions concerning the establishment of the New International Economic Order. Our concern is all the greater in view of the worsening economic situation prevailing in most developing countries. The restructuring of the world economic system is not only necessary but also inevitable. Therefore any attempts on the part of some developed countries to frustrate the North-South dialogue and maintain the status quo are doomed to failure.\n23.\tThe developing countries cannot accept the perpetuation of the relationship of dependence which has for long characterized international economic relations. We demand\na system based on equality, fairness and justice in which all countries must participate fully in the decision-making process. The continuation of the existing disparities and inequalities poses a serious threat to international peace and security, without which development efforts cannot succeed.\n24.\tThe stalemate obtaining in the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, sometimes called the Committee of the Whole, over the mandate and functions of that Committee is living testimony to the lack of political will on the part of some developed countries, particularly the major industrialized countries, to engage in the genuine and meaningful negotiations required for the establishment of the New International Economic Order.\n25.\tThe recent break-down in the work of the Committee of the Whole and the failure to agree on the manner in which the Committee should fulfil its mandate are a clear reflection of the reluctance of some developed countries to come to grips with the structural and other changes in international economic relations which are vital not only to the interests of the developing countries but also to the future of the world community.\n26.\tIn this regard we share fully the views of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77, who in their joint declaration issued on 29 September 1978 (A/33J278} strongly reaffirmed that the United Nations system is the only framework within which all negotiations of a global nature relating to the establishment of the New International Economic Order should take place.\n27.\tIt is against this background of deterioration in the international economic situation and its inherent dangers that Uganda has seen fit actively to encourage and engage in co-operation with other developing countries in the economic, technical and other fields. We firmly believe that the worsening economic conditions of the developing countries can be alleviated through collective self-reliance on the part of the developing countries. Co-operation among developing countries, in our view, offers the most promising way out of the economic plight of those countries. In this regard we fully support and endorse the Plan of Action adopted by the United Nations Conference on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries.'\n28.\tWe welcome the appointment of one of Africa's outstanding sons, Mr. Kenneth Dadzie, as Director-General for Development and International Economic Co-operation, and it is our earnest hope that he will receive the necessary support from all concerned and that adequate resources will be made available to the Director-General in order to enable him to discharge effectively the heavy responsibilities that have been entrusted to him.\n29.\tRegarding the law of the sea, Uganda is very much concerned about the slow progress of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. It has almost become an annual jamboree and a heavy drain on the meagre resources of the poor developing countries. Certain developed countries have deliberately obstructed speedy progress in the negotiations while at the same time threatening to \\\"go it alone\\\" and exploit the resources of the deep sea-bed area with total disregard for the principle of the common heritage of mankind. To my delegation, this unilateral action of \\\"going it alone\\\" reminds us of the period of grabbing colonies when some of those same Powers were making such declarations to each other as: \\\"From this mountain to the sea is my colony\\\", and the partitioning of Africa at the Berlin Conference of 1884 and 1885. We earnestly hope that during this period, when we are putting the last nail in the coffin of colonialism, its attributes will not be shifted from the land to the deep sea-bed area. Let us expedite the conclusion of negotiations, which should be carried on by all parties as equal partners in development on behalf of mankind as a whole.\n30.\tIn the social sphere, with regard to the status of women, my Government continues to give top priority to projects and programmes concerning women. We do recognize the United Nations Decade for Women and the\nprinciples laid down in the World Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Women's Year, adopted by the World Conference of the International Women's Year; held at Mexico City in 1975. To implement that programme, my Government has established a National Council for-Women with a permanent secretariat to provide a single machinery through which the full integration and participation of women in national, regional and international development can be intensified during the Decade for Women. The secretariat is also to facilitate the establishment of, and to work with, the ECA African Training and Research Centre for Women, which will be responsible for research and surveying to identify women's aspirations, needs and problems and to advise Governments on ways and means of solving them.\n31.\tEqual importance and high priority is given to the over-all integrated services for children within our development programme. It is in this spirit that we welcome the International Year of the Child. During this period, countries will review their programmes for the well-being of children, mobilize support for national and local programmes, heighten awareness among decision-makers and the public of children's special needs and promote the vital link between programmes for children and economic and social progress.\n32.\tIn conclusion, I should like co inform the Assembly that at the beginning of this year my President declared 1978 a year of peace, love, unity and reconciliation. To this end, the Government has been pursuing a policy geared towards the realization of those ideals, both domestically and internationally.\n33.\tWe are confident that with the goodwill and cooperation of the international community we shall be able to succeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Collective security, peace and development are topics which concern all peoples in this world in which interdependence is becoming an increasingly clear reality. It is with pleasure that we note the consolidation of the principles for which we have always fought and the increasing acceptance of the\n\naspirations and legitimate demands of the countries of the third world for a greater and more equal participation in the resolution of the problems that trouble us all.\n214.\tIt is in this framework of a progressive and salutary democratization of international relations that we greet the admission of Solomon Islands as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of the United Nations and at the same time we wish its people and Government, as they begin to enjoy the natural euphoria of freedom and the responsibility of an independent life, great success on the long road of progress and development.\n215.\tMr. President, your recognized qualities as a statesman and a diplomat experienced in international affairs convince us that the work of this session will be directed with all the skill required by the complexities of the problems we are going to discuss.\n216.\tWe should also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President, the representative of a country which for many decades has given an example of a consistent policy in defence of international legality. We must recognize that Mr. Mojsov guaranteed the success of the thirty-second session of this Assembly.\n217.\tIt would be no more than simple justice to take advantage of our presence in this Assembly to draw attention to the tireless and skilful work of the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who, by his consistent activity in the service of international peace and security and healthy co-operation among nations, has contributed undeniably to the strengthening of the credibility and effectiveness of our world Organization. Therefore we wish to offer to Mr. Waldheim all our support in his efforts to give concrete form to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and we reiterate our constant readiness to take part in joint action by nations in favour of the freedom, independence, development and the well- being of peoples.\n218.\tWe have just left a world in which a fierce struggle was necessary to gain recognition of the rights of peoples to be independent and to choose the ways they consider most suitable for their development.\n219.\tWe are the beneficiaries of this new legality which allows us to believe in the possibility of increasingly peaceful coexistence among countries at different levels of development and with different social structures. We are the beneficiaries of this struggle, which has been our struggle too for a very long time, since it can be asserted that our diplomatic history began, like that of Guinea- Bissau, at the moment when the PAIGC  began the struggle for the independence of our peoples. However, our struggle in fact was merely a concrete expression of the principles which have been reiterated year after year in this Assembly and which are embodied in all the fundamental documents of this Organization.\n220.\tWe believe that we have contributed by our efforts to the effective recognition of these principles, which constitute the basis of the international law of our time.\n221.\tThe geographical situation of my country, at the crossroad? of peoples and continents, constitutes one of its advantages. This position has always enabled Cape Verde to play an important role in bringing peoples together, which is perfectly in keeping with the guiding principles of our policy of non-alignment.\n222.\tThus we reaffirm that the Republic of Cape Verde will never shelter foreign military bases or serve as a liaison or support centre for aggressive operations against sovereign peoples and States.\n223.\tWe believe that peace, the necessary condition for development, will become a reality only when the rules established by all are implemented by all and guide the daily relations among nations. That is how we view our participation in the international community.\n224.\tThis Assembly, as in the past, continues to be a forum for repeated condemnation of attempts to perpetuate in Africa anachronistic situations marked by colonial and racist domination and apartheid. The praiseworthy and patient efforts of the international community, an echo of the liberation struggle of the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, which are reflected in the many resolutions of the United Nations condemning the minority regimes of southern Africa, have merely prompted the intensification of the terror inflicted on defenceless populations, the aggression against independent African States, the absolute lack of respect for and permanent defiance of the international community and the desire of the peoples of southern Africa for a life of dignity and peace. The indisputable evidence of this defiance of our world Organization is the recent decision of the South African Government to proceed unilaterally with a process leading to elections in Namibia which will inevitably be falsified, deliberately and dangerously disregarding the legitimate claims of the people of Namibia and its authentic representative, SWAPO, and flouting with barefaced arrogance every initiative aiming at a peaceful transition to independence.\n225.\tWe have always been convinced that the racist and apartheid regimes, since they are working against the tide of history, have never been ready to accept dialogue or to abandon the savage methods by which they trample underfoot the most fundamental human rights and resort systematically to violence against sovereign peoples and States, and this conviction has been reiterated year after year in this Assembly. Recent events persuade us that it is necessary and urgent that the international community multiply, diversify and centralize its efforts to assist SWAPO, the liberation movement fighting for the national independence and the territorial integrity of Namibia.\n226.\tThe people of Zimbabwe today are compelled to try to deal with a new farce: those who practise colonial oppression and defend apartheid have now taken up the banner of majority power and are claiming to lead the process for the transfer of power to the majority, oblivious of the freedom fighters united in the Patriotic Front. The kind of solution that neglects the profound aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe to genuine independence amounts to nothing but ad hoc concessions to the pressure brought to bear by the liberation struggle, which, we solemnly reaffirm, deserves our complete solidarity.\n227.\tIn 1975, when welcoming the independence of Mozambique and Angola, we welcomed at the same time the emergence of a different stage in the struggle of the people of southern Africa. The buffer States disappeared and were replaced by two independent countries, strengthened by the example they gave to others and determined not to accept the situation prevailing south of their borders.\n228.\tThe growing isolation of that bastion of colonialism\u2014to which the efforts made in the United Nations have contributed significantly and were certainly consolidated by the decisions of the recent World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination and the heroic resistance of the people of South Africa, led by their liberation movements, are driving the regime to exasperation, and, becoming even more defiant, it is systematically committing aggression with impunity against neighbouring countries.\n229.\tWe pay a tribute to those true interpreters of noble objectives who presided over the creation of the highest international body. It is the duty of the international community throughout the International Anti-Apartheid Year and the' Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination to try to find effective ways of further isolating the anachronistic Pretoria regime and wiping out the historic shame of apartheid. Experience shows that this requires the strengthening of the capacity for action of the liberation movements.\n230.\tIn keeping with our experience of the national liberation struggle and as a country recently liberated from colonial oppression after two long decades of political and armed struggle, we understand the true dimensions of the immeasurable suffering imposed on the people of the Western Sahara in its struggle for the liberation of that Territory, which is illegally occupied and divided. Our solidarity with the peoples struggling against all kinds of oppression and opposition to the exercise of their right to self-determination and independence in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) reinforces our conviction that the dispute between the Saharan people and those who occupy its national territory can be peacefully and justly resolved only by the effective exercise by that people of their right to determine their own destiny in sovereignty and freedom.\n231.\tIn the same way, we stand shoulder to shoulder with the peoples of East Timor who are fighting for the total realization of their desire for freedom and independence.\n232.\tIn the Middle East, a situation persists which defies the general feeling of the international community, which has been clearly, repeatedly and unambiguously expressed in this Assembly and in other bodies of our Organization. The persistence in a policy of aggression, occupation and expansion, accompanied by attempts to transform demographic, economic, cultural and religious structures of regions conquered by force, represents a flagrant violation of the principles of the United Nations and furthermore constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.\n233.\tSince our country is one of the youngest Members of this great family of sovereign and independent nations, and since we received from the United Nations considerable support during our national liberation struggle and even after independence, we are accustomed to viewing the Organization as the main guarantor or' international legality and the defender of the just claims of peoples for a life of peace, justice and progress.\n234.\tAs stubborn defenders of the ideals of the United Nations, of the movements of the non-aligned countries and of the OAU, we note with great concern the acts of aggression committed against Lebanon and the frequent violations of its territorial integrity and sovereignty. All States of the region are entitled to live in peace, independence and security. But a just and lasting peace will never be achieved until Israel decides to withdraw completely from all the Arab territory which it has occupied since 1967 and until it recognizes the legitimate, permanent and inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and agrees to the effective exercise of those rights, including the right to establish a national and independent State.\n235.\tWe should like to reaffirm our unstinting support of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of that martyred people, and our conviction that a definitive solution of the problem of the Middle East cannot be found without the active participation of the freedom fighters of the Palestine Liberation Organization on a footing of equality with all other parties directly involved in the conflict. Meanwhile we are following with keen interest the continuing efforts that are being made to try to establish suitable conditions for negotiations which, while respecting the basic and inalienable claims of the Palestinian people, would point the way to a peaceful and just solution.\n236.\tAs we commemorate this year the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we should like to take this opportunity to express our satisfaction at the positive role which the United Nations has played in the field of human rights. Indeed, the establishment of norms of international law in this connexion, the consecration of the right of peoples to self-determination and independence, and the initiatives taken in the field of the struggle against discrimination, racism, apartheid, torture and crimes against peace and humanity, as well as the special attention accorded to cases of the flagrant violation of human rights, are results of unquestionable importance to the credit of United Nations activity in this field, and it is a pleasure for me to emphasize them here.\n237.\tThe Republic of Cape Verde, the fruit of a genuine battle for human rights consisting in the long and hard political and armed struggle successfully carried out by PAIGC against Portuguese colonialism, can only rejoice at the visibly positive balance-sheet of the activities of our world Organization on behalf of human rights and freedoms.\n238.\tAfter independence a new administration was set up in our country based on broad popular participation, which is being restructured and consolidated and which is dedicated to guaranteeing to all citizens fundamental political and civil rights and freedoms. However, we feel that the struggle is continuing beyond the time of national independence, because the question of human rights cannot be dissociated from the economic, social and cultural context. Indeed, the effective, total and conscious exercise of civil and political rights is practically impossible without the establishment of certain basic economic, social and cultural conditions. There is consequently an essential interdependence of fundamental human rights which cannot be ignored.\n239.\tThe struggle for human rights is therefore in our country a process that is still continuing. Internally we are establishing the basis for economic development without which it would be impossible to free man from the spectre of hunger, poverty, disease, ignorance and illiteracy.\n240.\tOn the other hand, the question of human rights goes beyond the purely national sphere and is closely tied to certain questions of an international nature which are among the most important of our time. The effective exercise of human rights is not possible while the present international order persists and while colonialism, racism, apartheid and foreign domination and occupation prevail. However, the extension to the international level of problems of human rights must not make legitimate their use as a means of pressure, which might give rise to a climate of tension in relations between States.\n241.\tWe think that the United Nations should continue to play an important role in the promotion and safeguarding of human rights through the organs that it has set up, whose possibilities have not yet been exhausted and whose effectiveness has already been demonstrated on several occasions.\n242.\tWe should also like to express' our solidarity with those who deplore the incongruity of the fact that in a world where the spectre of hunger afflicts millions of human beings, nations continue year after year to spend enormous sums of money on the manufacture and stockpiling of arms. It is also to be deplored that an increasing part of the trade between nations is made up of the buying and selling of military equipment, while a large part of the population of the world remains without support in its struggle for the protection of the environment and the production of food and against ignorance, disease and natural disasters.\n243.\tThe continuance of a system where peace is merely the result of the permanent fear of reciprocal destruction cannot but contribute to increase tension in international relations and to divert States from their main task, which is to guarantee the well-being of their peoples. The need to put an end to the arms race and to initiate a procedure that will lead to real disarmament is felt very deeply by the whole of the international community. In this process at different regional levels great progress has been made, and laudable initiatives have been taken for the conclusion of agreements on the limitation of strategic weapons and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. In this process the United Nations, as the sole body capable of giving a universal dimension to the struggle for peace, security and development, should play an important role.\n244.\tThe fruitful results of this kind of thinking have already been confirmed by the tenth special session of the\nGeneral. Assembly devoted to disarmament, convened in accordance with an initiative of the non-aligned countries.\n245.\tWe hope that the United Nations Disarmament Commission will be in a position to ensure the implementation of the decisions taken at that special session and to provide elements for a global programme of disarmament . At the same time we welcome the creation of the Committee on Disarmament, a body in which the nuclear Powers and a number of countries including many non-aligned countries will participate on an equal footing.\n246.\tIt is a fact that the existence of large stocks of weapons, particularly of non-conventional weapons, is a constant threat to the survival of all mankind.\n247.\tIn such conditions we think that through the United Nations all countries will be able to participate actively in\nthe creation of a lasting policy for international security.\n\n248.\tInternational economic relations are still hampered by the contradictions that arise from the imbalance that exists today between the rich and industrialized countries on the one hand and the poor underdeveloped countries on the other.\n249.\tIt is that system of international economic relations, the mechanisms of which contribute to the accentuation of this imbalance and hinder efforts towards development, which has been and continues to be the subject of debate in the United Nations, particularly, in the sixth and seventh special sessions of this Assembly.\n250.\tIn this context we are witnessing a growing awareness of the need to create a new order with values that will govern international economic relations. The various sessions of UNCTAD, the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held at Buenos Aires, and the agreements between the African, Caribbean and Pacific group and the European Economic Community, among others, are examples of such concern.\n251.\tThe pursuit of this objective, we must admit, has met with obstacles which give rise to doubts and questionings and might make a really constructive dialogue more difficult to achieve. The existing monetary disturbances, the growing monetary erosion, in particular in countries with relatively weak economies, the deterioration in the terms of trade between countries supplying raw materials and industrialized countries, together with the protectionism practised by certain countries, justify our concern.\n\n252.\tWe are at a stage in the history of mankind when the existing basis of the international economic order is being questioned and it is our great responsibility to reflect on and consider the principles which should govern future international economic relations.\n253.\tIn our opinion the creation of a new international economic order should comprise: first, the recognition of the objective needed to alter the existing economic order and to achieve the participation of all countries on an equal footing in the solution of the problems which afflict mankind, and, with that recognition, the political will to give it effect; secondly, an increase in the technical and technological capacity of the developing countries, to enable them thus to benefit from the achievements of science and technology; thirdly, financial assistance in order . attain at least the objective of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product as established by the United Nations; fourthly, special assistance to the least developed among the developing countries, which, besides suffering the injustice of the present system have to confront naturally unfavourable conditions; and fifthly, effective support for the Buenos Aires Programme of Action on technical co-operation among developing countries.\n254.\tWe are convinced that the United Nations has a considerable role to play in the realization of the objectives that we have mentioned.\n255.\tWe \\\"expect, moreover, the constructive co-operation of members of the Committee of the Whole so that that Committee may fully exercise the functions which we consider to be extremely important in defining the new international economic order.\n256.\tWe are an island country, a small territory with limited natural resources, and consequently we attach particular importance to questions concerning the appropriation and distribution of maritime resources and, generally, to all problems relating to the law of the sea. When in December 1970 General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV) was adopted, it was welcomed as an invaluable instrument for the definition of a new international economic order and as a legitimate expression of the hope of countries which, like our own, do not have the necessary technological means successfully to exploit the resources of the sea-bed on their own.\n257.\tHowever, the results of the latest session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea have cast a shadow on the promising prospects that had opened in the course of continuing negotiations towards a definition of international law in that field. Indeed, at that session we heard talk of unilateral legislation, an idea which, if maintained, would run counter to the positions previously adopted by the international community.\n258.\tWe are certain that an understanding of the importance of a successful conclusion of the work of that Conference will ensure that our efforts will not end in a failure which would seriously affect international relations.\n259.\tIn Cape Verde we are now totally involved in the struggle for national reconstruction, a struggle that is particularly difficult if one considers the chaotic situation which we inherited.\n260.\tWe are reduced to constituting, almost inch by inch, the land that we shall have to work, to creating out of nothing the conditions for the survival of our people and to building the structures of a democratic State on what was left us by the ruinous inertia of a colonial Power.\n261.\tWe have to waste a great deal of energy and effort to reverse the situation of impoverishment created in our country by centuries of neglect. Desertification, emigration and social imbalance are still the deep-rooted signs of the system which we fought and abolished.\n262.\tThe United Nations, which has always supported and been able to channel and stimulate international solidarity with our people, will evaluate during this session the report prepared by the United Nations mission which, in pursuance of resolution 32/99 [A/331167 and Corr. l], recently visited our country.\n263.\tWe should like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to all those who have given our country timely and much-needed assistance. We are certain that, duly enlightened by this document, the United Nations and the donor countries will then be in a position to increase their co-operation with our country. That co-operation continues to be an invaluable aid in the solution of the many very urgent problems which we face and is a significant contribution to the establishment of suitable infrastructures for the economic and social development of Cape Verde.\n264.\tBefore concluding, we wish to express our ever growing confidence in the activities and the future of the United Nations which, while consolidating year by year both its prestige and its representativeness with the admission of a growing number of States, is also making praiseworthy efforts to improve its structure and inculcate new dynamism into its bodies in order to be able to resolve the many serious and complex problems that afflict mankind.\n265.\tWe are convinced that the United Nations provides the appropriate and privileged forum in which to find solutions which will meet the fundamental concerns of our time, and in which the nations which emerge in future from the struggle legitimized by the noble purposes which inspire this Organization will be heard.\n266.\tAs the head of the Government of the Republic of . Cape Verde, I wish to reaffirm our support for the principles which have always guided our actions, in particular those of the non-alignment, self-determination and independence of peoples, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, mutual respect, reciprocal advantage and peaceful coexistence among all the peoples of the world.\n267.\tWe sincerely hope that the work of this session will constitute a step towards the consolidation of the progress already made in the building of a future which promises freedom and happiness for all people, and will lead to the progress that we all so earnestly desire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "26.\tIt is my great pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly and to wish you well in the discharge of your onerous responsibilities.\n27.\tI also extend a special welcome to the newest Member of this Assembly, Solomon Islands, whose application for membership New Zealand was privileged to sponsor. We are neighbours in the South Pacific, members together of the South Pacific Forum and the Commonwealth. In those settings, and now in this one, New Zealand looks forward to a close, warm and co-operative relationship with Solomon Islands.\n28.\tNew States enter upon their nationhood today at a difficult time. As an international community we face enormous political and economic problems. If the measure of a healthy civilization is its ability to govern itself, to match its demands to its resources, to manage its technology and its institutions in a sane and rational way, then we are heading for trouble. The problems we face as a global community, as a group of \\\"united nations\\\", are both menacing and daunting: issues of peace or war in many parts of the world, the crippling and dangerous arms race, the risk of nuclear catastrophe by deliberate decision or mischance, the widespread denial of human rights, food shortages, energy problems, population pressures, dwindling non-renewable resources and a whole range of economic ills, including high rates of inflation, unemployment and protectionism, low levels of investment and unstable commodity markets.\n29.\tIt is not altogether surprising that, confronted with these awesome and intractable problems, some countries, in effect, opt out. Consciously or not, they decide to hold on to what they have, to settle for the protection and enjoyment of whatever resources they possess without too much regard for the effects of that policy on others. If, by way of regional or other association, this self-interest can be reinforced, then the wider grouping is pursued, with great emphasis on the value of regional co-operation. The motive in fact is national self-interest, and the manifestations of such groupings are high walls and barriers of one kind or another to keep the world at bay.\n30.\tThis is not, in New Zealand's view, the way to deal with the great issues of the day. Self-indulgence and self-interest proved fatal to earlier civilizations; they may well, unchecked, be fatal to ours. The international community, of which the United Nations is the symbol, cannot survive let alone prosper if we, the members of it, withdraw into our shells. The agenda of international problems, however frightening, needs to be addressed by all of us squarely and determine and, mindful of course of our responsibility for the security and welfare of our own people but mindful also of the needs of the global community. We need, in short, fewer barriers between us, better machinery for consultation in the economic, social and political spheres, and above all the political will to engage in the sort of co-operation which allows us at least to make a start towards correcting the gross social and economic injustices that now prevail.\n31.\tThis is not simply an economic issue. If we are to move in a discernible way to cure current ills the issues of national security, of international law, of intergovernmental organization\u2014all the major political issues of the day\u2014are of paramount importance. Solutions to those problems will determine the freedom of States to make the appropriate responses in the economic sphere. Nor is it, as I have pointed out, the concern of just a few States; the problem is an immediate one for all of us.\n32.\tThe great Powers, however, have a primary role. Their attitudes to each other condition the environment in which we all live and operate. What the great Powers do, and what they do not do, carry consequences for all of us. We welcome therefore those co-operative arrangements that betoken an effort to contain crises, to co-operate in the avoidance of nuclear war, to reach agreement on arms- control measures, to extend relations over a broad range of social and cultural fronts and to reduce the harshness of the rhetoric between them.\n33.\tIt is not, of course, only up to the great Powers. International relations are both intricate and complex and there are opportunities for constructive contributions from the small and middle-sized Powers as well as from the great.\n34.\tThese opportunities would be immeasurably enhanced if the smaller States learned to work together. In New Zealand's part of the world, the south Pacific, we are making an effort to do so and we are attempting to build up a sense of partnership in the region. I have just come to\nNew York from a meeting earlier this month of the South Pacific Forum-a regular conference of the Heads of Government of all the independent and self-governing States of the south Pacific. Among the major topics discussed at the Forum was the enactment of legislation creating a 200-mile exclusive economic zone by the countries of the region. This offers to many of these smaller island States an opportunity, for the first time, to capitalize on what is in some cases their only substantial resource. These Pacific island States, together with New Zealand and Australia, have decided to move at once to set up a Forum fisheries agency to advise their Governments, many of whose scientific resources are slender, on the conservation, utilization and management of the living resources, including highly migratory species, of their 200-mile economic zones. At the same time, they are continuing to explore the question of what kind of long-term regional fisheries arrangements will serve the Pacific best.\n35.\tAnother major topic discussed at the Forum was economic development and ways of minimizing the twin evils of protectionism and declining terms of trade. We suffer from these in New Zealand and we understand the difficulties facing developing countries and in particular our south Pacific neighbours, most of whom have an even narrower range of export products and less stable markets than we do. To tackle these problems we have together established an industrial development scheme to provide financial backing and incentives for companies to develop manufacturing industries in the islands. In addition, we are currently reviewing the numerous factors affecting entry of island exports to the New Zealand market. Our bilateral aid programme continues to have its primary focus in the south Pacific and this year 60 per cent of New Zealand's bilateral aid will be directed to the region. In the fields of shipping and civil aviation substantial progress has been made. A regional shipping line started operations in May and the number of direct air services between countries of the region is increasing.\n36.\tThese are practical issues-a serious effort on the part of all the regional States to stimulate new thinking and to create greater opportunities for the development of trade and economic advancement in our part of the world. Their purpose, however, goes beyond mere economic considerations. Solutions are vital if democratic processes and political stability are not to be placed in jeopardy.\n37.\tIn New Zealand's view, the same sort of co-operative effort\u2014and for the same reasons\u2014is needed in the global arena. As I see it, the world's economy today is distinguished by two rather paradoxical characteristics-its interdependence and its diversity. We have to grapple with both. Take interdependence. I do not question the argument for individual countries fostering a degree of economic self- sufficiency. There are certain skills and certain industries which every country needs to have even when the cost of establishing those skills is, by international standards, high. I believe, however, that most countries, including my own, have far snore to gain from participating in the international economy than from standing outside it. Decisions made in the world's major trading nations have a critical effect on the economic well-being and on the development patterns of the more peripheral economies. In the reverse aspect, recent years have shown that the world's major trading\ncountries also depend, to varying degrees, upon economic events in the less economically powerful countries. Raw material supply is an obvious area. Another is the importance of some developing countries as sources of demand and as areas of investment for the products and capital of the richer nations. There is evidence stretching back over a long period of the economic benefits for richer countries of increasing their imports, particularly of labour-intensive goods, from the newly industrializing countries. For these countries political stability is inseparable from economic stability.\n38.\tIf countries are to produce and export those things which their human and material resources and their historic development priorities suggest as logical and economically efficient, they must do so within an international economic environment that allows scope for their diversity. That means an open international trading system. Protectionism must be resisted, especially in the area of agricultural commodity, trade, where there is a dangerous disposition among the richer developed countries to apply more restrictive policies than in the industrial commodity area. I recognize that the principles of an open multilateral trading system raise difficult domestic political problems, but economic development is about change and innovation and we need to look at today's problems with our eyes very firmly fixed on the longer term. These wider principles are very much at stake in the current series of the GATT negotiations. Only to the extent they are recognized, and acted upon, will the Tokyo round of negotiations be judged successful.\n39.\tThe maintenance of an international trading system is not, by itself, enough. An international economy to which all countries and all people are contributing to the maximum extent possible needs to take account of the diversity of the international economy in another sense too. We need to recognize that there are very different kinds of economies. I do not mean that we should endeavour to come up with a new and sophisticated classification; rather that we should recognize, in the interests of the international economy, as well as in the interests of peace and justice, that some countries will need special assistance on a long-term basis, the world's poorest nations will need special aid and trade measures; so might the land-locked countries and the developing island countries. The aid and trade policies of some. countries, including my own, are already taking account of these special requirements, and the more advanced developing countries are following suit. Technical co-operation among developing countries, a concept which the United .Nations had done much to promote, has in this last month been the subject of a world conference in Buenos Aires.  It is a most welcome development and one which exemplifies the sort of practical co-operation I have been advocating.\n40.\tThis sense of community, of co-operative partnership, of working together to discuss and solve problems, not only must underpin our aid and trade initiatives; it must be demonstrated also in our- treatment of political problems if our systems and institutions are not to become irrelevant.\nThere are few people in the world who do not wish for peace. There are even fewer who believe that peace can be secured other than through the co-operation and partnership l the people concerned themselves. Enforced solutions rarely endure. The only sure foundation for the peaceful settlement of disputes is the will of the parties involved to work for reconciliation and peaceful co-operation.\n41.\tThis is surely the lesson of what is now happening in the Middle East New Zealand has no special knowledge of the Middle East question nor would we presume to offer an answer to the tangled web of issues at stake. But it does seem to us that certain fundamental principles need to be accepted if the will to reconcile and co-operate, which has been demonstrated in a dramatic way by the leaders of Egypt and Israel over the past year, is to be turned into a fair and lasting peace. Above all, we believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) contains the essential elements which should form the basis for a negotiated settlement. But just as our support for Israel's right to exist as a sovereign State within secure and recognized boundaries is fundamental to our approach to the dispute, so we are convinced that the rights of the Palestinians, including the right to self-determination and to establish an independent Palestinian State if they so desire, must be recognized. It is clear that a settlement which meets these -two criteria requires that Israel withdraw from areas occupied in 1967, so as to permit the Palestinians full freedom to exercise their right of self-determination. A Middle East settlement would not only confer inestimable benefits on Israel and its Arab neighbours, but would remove a potential and ever-real danger to world peace. We have therefore been tremendously encouraged by the will for peace and reconciliation displayed at the recent Camp David summit meetings. Early progress in pursuit of the agreements reached at Camp David by the leaders of Egypt and Israel, with the active partnership of the United States, must be our common hope in this Assembly.\n42.\tIt is true also that these lessons of co-operation have still to be learned in southern Africa. The history of relationships between black and white in that continent, between those who exercise power and those who, though in an overwhelming majority, have had no say in their destiny, is one - of so many opportunities lost to work together in harmony and co operation. In Namibia recently, it is true, there has been encouraging progress towards independence as a result of the persistent efforts of the five Western members of the Security Council and the front-line African States. It would be tragic if progress were to be held up now by intransigence on the part of any of those involved. It is New Zealand's hope that free elections will be held at the earliest practicable date and that Namibia will soon be able to take its rightful place as a Member of this Organization. New Zealand is anxious to support this process in practical ways. Most recently my Government has contributed substantially to a Commonwealth fund for the education and training of Namibians who will soon be in a position of responsibility in their own country.\n43.\tIn Rhodesia it is clear from the increasing scale of the armed conflict that the \\\"internal settlement\\\" introduced in March of this year  has failed to produce the cease-fire that\nthe Salisbury regime predicted. On the contrary, there has been an escalation of violence, with innocent people as the not infrequent victims. These senseless and tragic killings must be stopped. The only way is through the speedy conclusion of a negotiated settlement. The best hope is for all the elements in Rhodesia and the Patriotic Front to come together in an all party conference on the basis of the Anglo-American proposals.  This is a course which we urge as the first step towards a cease-fire, the holding of fair and fair elections, and ultimate independence for Zimbabwe and its people.\n44.\tOther States, and especially the neighbouring African States, can play a constructive part in creating the climate for a settlement through mediation and diplomatic support. Or they can meddle, as some States far from Africa have chosen to do in various parts of the continent, by encouraging divisions and even by direct intervention. That is a prescription for conflict, not for settlement. We trust that the pattern we have already seen in some African countries will not be repeated elsewhere.\n45.\tEven after peace is established in other parts of southern Africa, the most difficult problem of all will remain in South Africa itself. It is there that a co-operative effort, even a dialogue, is most desperately needed. The institutionalized racism which is apartheid offers no hope of a peaceful future for South Africa. It must be abandoned. Change must come. There is no other way. A policy of apartheid is not only wrong; it is suicidal. It seeks to impose what cannot be imposed, to deprive people of rights and freedoms that cannot be denied. The delusion of those in power in South Africa that they can succeed in their purpose if they are tough enough and determined enough is a delusion common to Governments which refuse to listen to the voices of those they oppress. Sooner or later those voices make themselves heard and the result is both predictable and destructive. There is still time to avoid that result in South Africa, but not much. New Zealand is and always will be utterly opposed to apartheid. We want to see justice and common sense prevail. This is the oily way to prevent conflict.\n46.\tOur concern for human rights in southern Africa must not blind us to deprivations that occur elsewhere. New Zealand upholds the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed 30 years ago by this Genera] Assembly\u2014among those rights: freedom of movement, the right to leave one's country and to return, the right to a nationality, the right of freedom of opinion and expression. We are concerned when these rights are denied, wherever that denial takes place, and it is shameful that, 30 years on, there are countries, including some who were founder nations of this Organization, who still deny their millions of citizens these basic human rights. How can the international community ignore that?\n47.\tIn New Zealand this year the Human Rights Commission Act came into force, establishing a national Commission on Human Rights to deal with complaints of racial, religious or sexual discrimination, in conjunction with the\nRace Relations Act of 1971. This new legislation codifies that respect for human rights which has had a central place in our traditions. We have regarded the two International Covenants on Human Rights as legal documents of substantial value and importance, and have not wished to ratify them merely on the basis of our general attachment to the principles they enunciate. We have now completed a comprehensive review of our legislation and are satisfied that our laws are in compliance with the requirements of the two International Covenants. I am pleased to announce therefore that New Zealand will ratify the International . Covenant on Political and Civil Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide during this session of the General Assembly.\n48.\tI want before I close to turn very briefly to two major issues that have preoccupied the international community, and this Assembly in particular, over the past year\u2014the law of the sea and disarmament.\n49.\tOn 1 April of this year New Zealand brought into force its jurisdiction over a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. Some 330 foreign fishing vessels from three countries are now licensed, pursuant to agreements with New Zealand, to catch fish which is surplus to the capacity of the New Zealand fishing industry. The expansion of the New Zealand industry, upon its own initiative and through joint ventures, represents a significant economic opportunity for us.\n50.\tI want to emphasize therefore the importance for New Zealand, and for very many of the small and middle sized countries in the Pacific and elsewhere, of a speedy and successful conclusion to th3 Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The adoption of a widely acceptable international convention will give us and many other countries a secure and stable basis upon which to plan and develop the utilization of the resources within the 200-mile zone. It is in no one's interests that the oceans should become a battleground for competing claims and the focus of conflicts over the extraction of resources. Both our national interest and a wider interest in the rule of law and a stable regime for the oceans lead my Government to attach great value to the achievement of a wide-ranging treaty along the lines on which the Conference is now working.\n51.\tIn last May and June this Assembly met in its tenth special session in an attempt to stem the arms race and to begin, in a real sense, the process of disarmament. There will be differing views on the success of that session. New Zealand's view is that we have made a small beginning, that the special session has given a modest impetus to the disarmament cause and that the establishment of machinery for discussion and negotiation marks a step forward. We hope that other steps will soon follow, among them the early conclusion of a treaty putting an end to nuclear- weapon testing in all environments. Time is short, but it should still be possible, in New Zealand's view, to present this treaty to this thirty-third regular session of the General Assembly.\n52.\tMy Government sees disarmament as among the most urgent requirements of our time. Progress has been slow.\nWe must do better, not by calling for far-reaching measures that have no hope of acceptance, but by working for and participating in a realistic short-term programme of action which will result in agreements that are balanced, practicable and verifiable. Between now and the next special session, New Zealand will support each and every measure of disarmament that meets these criteria.\n53.\tThe world is an increasingly complex place. Within our own societies, and in our international life, there are forces at work that are changing our perceptions, altering our values and demolishing our traditions at a bewildering pace. There are many competing interests to be accommodated, conflicting philosophies and approaches to be reconciled. We can accommodate and reconcile them only by being honest, understanding, straightforward and fair with each other-not only with our friends, for that is relatively easy, but more importantly with those with whom we may disagree. If we can work towards this sense of co-operation and partnership as a world community we can, I believe, if not solve all our problems at least reduce them to a manageable dimension. For its part my Government pledges itself to work with others in this spirit and to this end.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff1.\tMr. President, before starting to address the Assembly I have the honour and the pleasure to congratulate you most warmly on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly during its thirty- third session. Your election is both a recognition of your skill and wide diplomatic experience and a tribute to your country, Colombia, for the constructive role it plays in world affairs.\n2.\tI also seize this opportunity to pay a tribute to Mr. Lazar Mojsov, Deputy Federal Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the sister nation Yugoslavia, with which my country maintains strong ties, for the skilful and wise manner in which he presided over the thirty-second regular session as well as the ensuing three special sessions.\n3.\tI also wish to join other delegations in expressing to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, my deep appreciation of his dedicated and unremitting efforts to promote the role of the United Nations and of his firm commitment to the spirit of its Charter.\n4. I extend my congratulations, too, to the people and\nGovernment of Solomon Islands on their independence and\nI welcome them into the community of nations. Their\nindependence will, without doubt, add to the triumphs of\nthe third-world countries and will represent a positive step\nin implementing the spirit and letter of the United Nations\nCharter.\nS. Egypt will spare no effort to give every support and\nassistance to the peoples striving to achieve their freedom\nand independence, in particular the peoples of Palestine,\nZimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia.\n6. Owing to its strategic position in the region, Egypt is\nconsidered to be one of the most important economic areas\nin the world; Egypt has been compelled to shoulder\nresponsibilities, which it has undertaken with conviction\nand sincerity, whether within the Arab, Islamic, African or\nnon-aligned group. Indeed, Egypt has had to make sacrifices of immense magnitude in discharging those responsibilities. Egypt is motivated by a strict commitment to the principles and philosophy emanating from the conscience and from the deeply rooted values of the Egyptian people, who are a. product of their ancient civilization. But regardless of its sacrifices, both in the past and in the present, Egypt is proud of its role in what has been positively achieved within the third world, and will continue its determined efforts, along with all peace-loving countries, to promote the role of the United Nations.\n7.\tEgypt's foreign policy stems from the philosophy of the non-aligned movement, a philosophy based on a keenness to abide by the principles of international legitimacy, mutual respect, respect for sovereignty and free will, and openness with all nations. The non-aligned movement is a fundamental and essential element of global stability, and Egypt, as a founding member of the movement, endeavours to restore to it its original perspective. If the movement is to continue to play this role of paramount importance, it must be protected against outside interference.\n\n8.\tEgypt, in its persistent quest for the promotion of peace, believes that the international community should develop a new approach in solving political problems. Such an approach should be more courageous and pragmatic as regards confronting difficulties. There must be a determined will to uproot envy, intolerance and hatred, for the sake of establishing a society in which peace would prevail.\n9.\tIn this context, the Egyptian peace initiative constitutes a new approach in international relations. In fact, this initiative aims at breaking the vicious circle which plagues our area and at restoring amity and peace to a region that was the cradle of the three heavenly religions.\n10.\tThe African scene is fraught with developments which provoke our deep concern. Africa, having only recently rid itself of colonialism and foreign domination and having' embarked with all vigour on the arduous task of reconstruction and development, finds itself subjected to malicious foreign conspiracies which aim at diverting it from the attainment of its goals and aspirations.\n11.\tEgypt most strongly condemns all attempts to transfer big Power conflicts to the African continent. It is precisely these developments that make it all the more pertinent to revive the principle of the non-alignment of Africa. Only when such sinister plots and conspiracies are ended will the African nations be able to pursue their development and attain their lofty goals and aspirations. \n\n12.\tThe racist regimes in southern Africa persist in their acts of aggression and violation of the human and other legitimate rights of the African people in Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa.\n\u00ab\n13.\tThe racist regime of Ian Smith in Rhodesia has recently resorted to a new manoeuvre by announcing an internal settlement;  but this so-called settlement is, in fact, only one more link in the chain of attempts to perpetuate the rule of the racist minority under a new facade. In this connexion, Egypt will continue its unwavering support of the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe and their patriotic forces under the leadership of the Patriotic Front. Egypt also lends its support to the genuine efforts undertaken to achieve a peaceful settlement that would ensure the exercise of their legitimate rights by the people of Zimbabwe.\n14.\tOn the other hand, Salisbury's racist twin in Pretoria continues to practise its policies of apartheid and the ugliest forms of oppression against the people of South Africa. Not surprisingly, it does not confine its practice of abominable policies to the people of South Africa, but arrogantly and unlawfully extends its jurisdiction beyond its territory. It continues its illegal occupation of Namibia in unabashed defiance of the relevant United Nations resolutions.\n15.. It should not escape us that it was only when the Government of South Africa realized that the people of Namibia, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization SWAPO \u2014their sole legitimate representative\u2014were on the verge of realizing their legitimate goals that Pretoria reluctantly accepted the five Western countries' proposals for the independence of Namibia. These proposals received international endorsement, and thereby legitimacy, when they were approved by Security Council resolution 431 (1978) and welcomed by both the Assembly of Heads of State and Government, of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], at its session recently held in Khartoum and by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries in Belgrade.\n16.\tYet the ink had hardly dried on that resolution of the Security Council when the Pretoria Government rejected what it had pretended to accept. This leaves no doubt in our mind that that racist regime is simply manoeuvring in order to gain time to proceed with its designs and impose an internal settlement in Namibia by setting up a puppet regime that will ensure South Africa's continued domination over the Territory. It was those manoeuvres that prompted the Security Council to adopt resolution 435(1978), in which it approved the Secretary-General's report  on the role of the United Nations in supervising the processes of election and the transfer of power to the people of Namibia upon the attainment of their total independence.\n17.\tNeither is it new for the Pretoria Government to ignore the United Nations and its resolutions, nor should we expect the Smith regime in Rhodesia to respond in good faith to the efforts made for the transfer of power to the African majority.\n18.\tAccordingly, we must stand firm against the defiance of the international community by those racist regimes. We should stand ready to increase their isolation and impose further sanctions against them. This may bring them back to reason, thereby ensuring the realization of the legitimate aspirations of the people of that area.\n19.\tAnother problem looms to the north of the African continent-namely, the problem of Cyprus. That problem, too, calls for a just and speedy solution that will preserve the independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the island. Such a solution should be based on the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions. The concerted efforts of both the Greek and the Turkish communities and all the parties concerned and the resumption of negotiations in good faith are required in order to achieve a lasting and peaceful solution.\n20.\tThe increased instability in the international economic situation and the exacerbation of the problems of development and international economic co-operation are matters\\\" of great concern to my country. The over-all picture of the international economic scene is still gloomy, in spite of some initiatives undertaken in the past few years. Unless effective and substantive measures are taken, the remaining years of the Second United Nations Development Decade will prove to be a wasted opportunity. The debt problem, inflation, the persistent deficit in the balance of payments and mounting protectionism have become salient features of the present international economic picture. This situation has invariably produced negative effects on the development process in the developing countries.\n21.\tThe decisions that this Assembly adopted at its sixth and seventh special sessions [resolutions 3201 fS-VI), 3202 (S-VI), and 3362 (S-VII)J and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] contain the elements of a fair and equitable system in which inequalities will no longer exist. But this in itself requires profound changes in the present economic order. We are convinced that it is necessary to establish a new international economic order that will ensure prosperity and guarantee a better standard of living for everyone.. Injecting minor changes into the present international economic order will not enable us to realize our cherished goals.\n22.\tIn spite of the adherence to the concept of greater interdependence between the developed and the developing countries and the need to promote and to create a general framework to solve the problems that we face, it- is regrettable to note that the results of the efforts undertaken in this direction have been disappointing. Many problems remain unresolved, such as the problems of commodities, external debt, balance-of-payments deficits, transfer of real resources and access to the capital markets and consumer markets of developed countries. Therefore, it has become necessary to concentrate all efforts on creating the appropriate climate in order to achieve more progress on these matters. More political impetus is needed to permit the resumption of the work of the Committee\nEstablished under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, also known as the Committee of the Whole, with appropriate functions to negotiate and reach agreements.\n23.\tThe establishment of the new international economic order depends to a large extent on the political will of the developed countries. In the meantime, the developing countries bear the main responsibility for the development of their economies. In addition, their genuine freedom, in both the individual and collective sphere, constitutes a fundamental feature of their development. Furthermore, we attach the utmost importance to economic co-operation between developing countries. In this connexion we view with satisfaction the results achieved at the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held in Buenos Aires. That Conference adds new dimensions to the framework of the new international economic order and to the action programmes adopted by the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held in Colombo in 1976  and the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries held in Mexico City in 1976. Thus the international community has reached a critical stage, and it has become imperative to seek practical and effective solutions To the economic ills of our world.\n24.\tI should like to refer to another issue which is of the utmost importance at the present time and has been one of the most crucial issues discussed by the United Nations during the past 20 years: that is, the question of general and complete disarmament-a problem closely linked to the international political, economic and social framework. Egypt has been persistently calling for general and complete disarmament and has worked with the non-aligned group to develop the necessary measures that would achieve our objectives. This is based on our intrinsic belief that any miscalculation by a big Power which possesses weapons of destruction and annihilation could bring our civilization to an end. The continuance of the arms race has drained the economic and human potential of our planet.\n25.\tWe cannot live under the constant threat of nuclear terror, nor can we acquiesce in the circumstances which have led to the stockpiling of nuclear weapons and the increase of military arsenals under the pretext of maintaining international strategic equilibrium.\n26.\tWhile we cannot belittle some arrangements that have been pursued on a bilateral bases between the two super-Powers or on a regional level to curtail the arms race, the fact remains that these measures have not contributed effectively to curbing the escalation of the arms race; nor have they provided better safeguards for international peace and security.\n27.\tWe all know that, at the present time, there are numerous difficulties on the road leading to general and complete disarmament. But the fact remains that until we achieve that objective we must intensify our efforts by adopting concrete and balanced measures to end the stockpiling of nuclear weapons, to stop both horizontal and vertical proliferation and to halt the production and\n\ndevelopment of these weapons. We believe that the major Powers must assert in their collective efforts to a degree commensurate with, the rate they have played in increasing armaments in the whole world. All this must be done under effective international control.\n28.\tEgypt still requests the implementation of a mutually acceptable balance of rights and obligations between nuclear and non-nuclear States, for the world cannot accept the limitation of arms in one region or its disarming and the exemption of another. However, disarmament and non- proliferation measures must never impede the exercise of the legitimate right of States to utilize nuclear technology for peaceful purposes under effective international control.\n29.\tEgypt was one of the first States to call for the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones, in accordance with the provisions of article VII of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]., Egypt has also called for the establishment of zones of peace, taking into consideration the regional circumstances of each zone. The process of the establishment of these zones must be concomitant with the provision by nuclear Powers of guarantees that they will respect the status of such zones and refrain from the introduction of nuclear weapons into them and from the use or threat of the use of nuclear weapons against them. It is still the solemn objective of Egypt to establish a zone free of nuclear weapons in the Middle East. Genuine peace will never prevail in that strategic area unless Israel puts an end to its acquisition of nuclear weapons and until it accedes to the non-proliferation Treaty\u2014g treaty which we have signed\nand will immediately ratify if these conditions are met.\n30.\tI should like now to turn to, an important event that took place during the past 10 months\u2014namely, the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament. It had been the fervent hope of the non- aligned countries that at that session concrete and specific results would be reached in the domain of disarmament so that all human and natural resources could be channelled towards development and the restructuring of the new international economic order.\n31.\tAlthough that session produced modest results and the Assembly did not manage to resolve the basic problems involved, particularly those related to nuclear matters, it is our view that it did give impetus to disarmament efforts aimed at achieving tangible and substantial progress in that area. The session also showed the importance of the role which could be played by the United Nations and its main organ, the Security Council, in the field of disarmament, especially in fact any attempt to obstruct the establishment of zones free of nuclear weapons. The special session also paved the way for both France and China to participate in disarmament efforts within the framework of the new negotiating body. It strengthened the link between the United Nations and that negotiating body.\n32.\tThe consolidation of international peace and security can be accomplished only by building international confidence and by establishing principles affirmed by measures binding on all Members. The non-use of force in international relations, the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force\u2014in principles laid down in the provisions\nof the United Nations Charter\u2014and the peaceful settlement of disputes on a just basis are all principles complements y and parallel to disarmament efforts.\n33.\tThe United Nations celebrates this year the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I should like to commend the efforts exerted by the United Nations in this field, even though we are all aware of the many difficulties surrounding this sensitive issue. Egypt, for its part, has exerted much effort, at both the national and international level, to ensure and protect the fundamental right of individuals to freedom in all its forms, whether political, economic, social and cultural.\n34.\tAs members are well aware, some people are still deprived of their fundamental and legitimate rights. The anniversary we are celebrating provides a great opportunity for the peoples of Palestine and southern Africa to regain their rights. In this connexion, we consider the role of the United Nations essential and important. The realization of the rights of the peoples of Palestine and southern Africa would be a crowning of the efforts exerted by the United Nations since its establishment in the field of freedom, independence and human rights.\n35.\tThe people of Egypt are profoundly agonized by the .present sufferings of the Lebanese people. Egypt, led by its President, Anwar El-Sadat, was the first to warn against the deterioration of the situation in Lebanon caused by foreign intervention. President El-Sadat has called upon all parties to keep their hands off Lebanon.\n36.\tPresident El-Sadat has followed with great interest and concern the recent developments in Lebanon. In outlining Egypt's position on the deplorable events in Lebanon and what should be done to save the situation there before it gets out of hand, the President laid down the following principles. First, Israel should desist forthwith from supporting and strengthening those who are defying the legitimacy of Lebanon and the legitimate Government of President Elias Sarkis. Those violators are represented by the militia forces of Haddad and Camille Chamoun. The Lebanese army should be allowed to extend its control over all Lebanese territory, including the south. Secondly, parallel with the cessation of this Israel support, Syrian forces must be withdrawn in order to create the proper atmosphere for all the parties to the conflict in Lebanon to conduct a dialogue among themselves in peace. Thirdly, the Lebanese leaders, both Moslem and Christian, should join together in a peaceful atmosphere to formulate a charter for the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon to replace the 1943 charter.\n37.\tEgypt is fully prepared to contribute to any effort to achieve this end. It supports, therefore, the initiative of the President of France, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, concerning the settlement of the Lebanese crisis. We also call on all parties concerned to respect and abide by Security Council resolution 436 (1978) of 6 October.\n38.\tFor the past three decades our part of the world has been subjected to many wars, which led to much destruction and suffering for its people. This situation impeded our development and endangered international peace and security. The Arab nation, and especially the Palestinian people, have been the victims of those wars, as well as of Israeli occupation.\n39.\tIn fact, the Secretary-General was right when, in his latest report to the General Assembly on the work of the Organization during 1978, he stated:\n\\\"The Middle East situation, for a mixture of compelling reasons, vitally affects not only international peace and security, but the interests of the world community as a whole.\\\" \nThe Secretary-General went on to say:\n.. we cannot afford to relax for a moment the attempt to find a peaceful way forward. It bears repeating that in the Middle East time is not in favour of peaceful developments.\\\" [Ibid.]\n40.\tThere is no doubt that in its concern with the situation in the Middle East the General Assembly is fully aware of the dimensions of this situation and its possible consequences, as well as the obstructionist manoeuvres facing the drive towards peace. Hence, the General Assembly is undoubtedly conscious of its responsibility to express, on behalf of the international community, its categorical rejection of anything that could lead to the perpetuation of the Israeli occupation, to impeding the achievement of a solution or to continued disregard of the purposes and principles of the Charter. It must also be aware of the need to take the necessary initiative, at the appropriate time, if no progress is made towards a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n41.\tThe international community is quite familiar with Egypt's policy and objectives, which it has consistently pursued before and since the October war of 1973. This policy affirms Egypt's sincere desire and persistent search for a just peace. This is also confirmed by Egypt's participation in all the efforts geared to this end, in order to spare the area the conflicts and the scourges of war by which it has been afflicted since the people of Palestine were denied their legitimate right to exit. This holds true particularly in this era in which the United Nations Charter constitutes a landmark in the march and progress of mankind. Peace, to be worthy of its name, must be based on justice, and will be devoid of meaning if it is not.\n42.\tThis is a factual description of the situation in the Middle East, and this is the cause of the trouble. It means that if this situation continues it will inevitably lead to an explosion the dimensions of which will far exceed anything that has occurred in the area before. In this eventuality, the entire world will suffer the moral, spiritual and material consequences of such an explosion.\n43.\tI should like to recall here what President Anwar El-Sadat declared in his address to the Egyptian Parliament on 9 November of last year before his historic initiative:\n\\\"Our nation was sincere when it engaged in the glorious battle which took place four years ago. It continues to be sincere in advocating peace and in its desire to establish it throughout the region. Our ultimate objective is to have all peoples of the area living each in its homeland, secure within its boundaries, free from any threat to its sacred places, capable of contributing abundantly to the progress of mankind and mobilizing all its energies to meet the challenge of development and progress.\\\"\n44.\tThis concept has served as the basis for Egypt's actions and policy in the past. It is also the source of Egypt's historic initiative undertaken by President El-Sadat on 19 November last when he visited Jerusalem, which was the culmination of many Egyptian initiatives during the previous few years, as witnessed by the international community. Egypt has faced the battle of war and with the same courage it now faces the battle of peace. To any rational observer the battle of peace is much more arduous than the battle of war. It is easy to touch off a war, even though it entails many horrors and sufferings. But to launch a battle for peace, with all the continuous historical responsibility it requires, is much more difficult and calls for the same capability, energy and courage as are needed for a battle of war. In both cases Egypt has proved its faithfulness as well as its willingness to shoulder its responsibility.\n45.\tEgypt has been working patiently and tirelessly to restore Arab rights and to rid the Arab territories of the Israeli occupation. There is no doubt that the entire world community followed the efforts which resulted in the Camp David documents  and appreciated the positive role played by the President of the United States, Mr. Carter, I should like to emphasize there that these documents are not in themselves the end of the road but only the beginning. They serve as the framework for the just and lasting peace to which we all aspire and towards which we have been working. They constitute, as President El-Sadat has said, a significant step in this direction.\n46.\tI should like to expound before this Assembly the following points concerning the Camp David documents.\n47.\tFirst, ever since the Israeli aggression against the Arab countries in 1967 and the subsequent occupation of the territories of three Arab States, the world community and the United Nations have been consistently calling for the full implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in all its parts. They have been affirming the right of the Arab people to use any and all means in the struggle to terminate Israeli occupation of the Arab territories, to restore the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and to establish a just and lasting peace in the area, in conformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, the first Camp David document, entitled \\\"A Framework for peace in the Middle East\\\", states in its preamble that the agreed basis for a peaceful settlement is United Nations Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in all its parts. The crux of that resolution is the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war. The preamble also states that the achievement of peace in the Middle East must be guided by the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and other accepted norms of international law and legitimacy, which constitute the accepted basis for the conduct of relations among ail States. There is no doubt but that such a provision in the document strengthens and corroborates the Arab position. Furthermore, the document refers to Security Council resolution 338 (1973), which has been accepted by all the parties concerned.\n48.\tSecondly, the international community has on many occasions expressed its grave concern over the stagnation and the perpetuation of the status quo in the Middle East, and has urged greater efforts to create the necessary momentum to overcome the obstacles and difficulties which Israel had attempted to force on the international community. It has also reaffirmed that a just peace in the Middle East can be achieved only on the basis of total Israeli withdrawal and the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.\n49.\tThirdly, that concept has dictated Egypt's policy, and since 1967 Egypt has been working and struggling by all available means to achieve these goals in order to secure the fulfilment of these two fundamental principles. This policy has been pursued since the adoption of Security Council resolution 242 (1967), through the mission of Mr. Gunnar Jarring, the Special Representative of the Secretary- General, to the four-Power talks in New York, and the many deliberations in various international forums. Then came the October 1973 war, which altered the situation drastically and moved it from the stage of deadlock which had prevailed because of the intransigence of Israel.\n50.\tFourthly, Israel tried to contain the results of the October war and to resort to its previous method of procrastination and obstruction. Then came President El-Sadat's peace initiative of November 1977 to reactivate the efforts towards a just and lasting peace in the area.\n51.\tFifthly, with that background in mind, I should like to emphasize two basic principles: that the two Camp David documents represent a framework and a basis for the achievement of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East; and that Egypt is seeking, not a separate solution, but a comprehensive settlement which takes into consideration the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and ensures the withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, which is an integral part of the West Bank. This fact, which is not open to interpretation, has always constituted Egypt's policy, and it will continue to do so in the future. Egypt's position is that Israel cannot claim sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza, because sovereignty belongs to the Palestinian people who live in those territories. We recognize that a long way lies ahead before the conclusion of final peace treaties. The success of this process will depend largely on the amount of sincerity shown by the parties in carrying out their obligations.\n52.\tSixthly, a close and objective consideration of the Camp David document entitled \\\"A Framework for Peace in the Middle East\\\" clearly shows that: first, it contains the general framework for the implementation of Security Council resolution 242(1967) in all its parts and on all fronts; secondly, it emphasizes respect for and implementation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the general rules of international law and legitimacy; thirdly, the general principle is that a comprehensive settlement requires the participation of all the parties concerned; fourthly, it confirms the principle of mutuality in security arrangements to be agreed upon, and this means that security is not the exclusive privilege of one party only, which could insist on security measures for itself and deny the other party the same right.\n53.\tSeventhly, the articles concerning the West Bank and Gaza are intended to create a new situation that will lead gradually to the nullification of the Israeli designs and to the achievement of just Arab aspirations to the following: first, the participation of all the parties concerned in the negotiations to resolve the Palestinian problem in all its aspects, and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, and this has always been a basic requirement for Egypt and the whole international community, which have emphasized that the core of the problem is the Palestinian question; secondly, the ending of the Israeli military occupation through the termination of the military rule in those two areas, and the withdrawal of the Israeli civil administration and Israel military forces, with the stationing of what is left of them in specified security posts; thirdly, the creation of Palestinian institutions consisting of a self-governing authority established through elections and taking the form of an administrative council for the West Bank and Gaza, the formation of local police forces and the participation of the elected Palestinian representatives in the permanent committee of four to negotiate an agreement concerning the final status of the West Bank and Gaza, and providing for the elected representatives of the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza to participate in the determination of their own future; fourthly, the freezing at the present time of the establishment of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, the destiny of which will be resolved in the negotiations in which the representatives of the Palestinian people will participate\u2014all Members recognize the importance Egypt attaches to this problem and the initiatives it has undertaken with the support of the Security Council and the General Assembly which considered Israeli settlements illegal and determined that they constitute an obstacle to peace; fifthly, the elimination of the sufferings and oppression of the people in the West Bank and Gaza, inflicted upon them by Israeli occupation and military rule; sixthly, the regulation of the mode of the return of persons displaced from the West Bank and Gaza since 1967, in accordance with Security Council resolution 237 (1967) in this context; and lastly, the conclusion of an agreement concerning the implementation of a just and immediate solution to the problem of the refugees.\n54.\tEighthly, the principles and framework for Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai are a confirmation of the principle of withdrawal to international boundaries which could also be applied to the Golan. This reinstates the Arab interpretation of Security Council resolution 242(1967) concerning a complete withdrawal from all the occupied territories and not just from part of them. Also, the implementation of the principle of the removal of Israeli settlements from Sinai could be utilized on the Golan, the West Bank and Gaza.\n55.\tNinthly, with regard to Jerusalem, Egypt has reaffirmed its long-standing position which comprises the following points: first, Arab Jerusalem is an integral part of the West Bank, and legal and historical Arab rights in the city must be respected and restored; secondly, Arab Jerusalem should be under Arab sovereignty; thirdly, the Palestinian inhabitants of Arab Jerusalem are entitled to exercise their legitimate national rights, being part of the Palestinian people in the West Bank; fourthly, relevant Security Council resolutions, particularly resolutions 242 (1967) and 267 (1969) must be applied with regard to Jerusalem; fifthly, all the measures taken by Israel to alter the status of the city are null and void and should be rescinded; sixthly, all people must have free access to the city and must enjoy freedom of worship and the right to visit and travel to the Holy Places without distinction or discrimination; seventhly, the Holy Places of each faith may be placed under the administration and control of the representatives of that faith; and eighthly essential functions in the city should not be divided and a joint municipal council composed of an equal number of Arab and Israeli members could supervise the performance of those functions. In that way the city would remain undivided.\n56.\tThose are the principles which Egypt accepted and by which it will be guided in its efforts. Our adherence to the aims and principles of the Charter and the consensus of the international community regarding the establishment of a just and lasting peace is clear. We consider that what has been achieved is only part of the comprehensive framework for peace.\n57.\tI am happy to state that the overwhelming support extended to Egypt in its efforts for the establishment of a just and lasting peace, support which has not diminished in recent years, crowns the tireless efforts and sacrifices which Egypt has made in order to restore Arab rights. It is also a manifestation of the belief of theirs in Egypt's responsible role in the world. On behalf of the Egyptian people I should like to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to all those who stood and still stand by Egypt in its endeavours to liberate Arab lands and to establish a just peace in the area. Only a tiny minority does not participate in this overwhelming support. That tiny minority prefers to continue to oppose any peace effort. It is high time to put an end to such manoeuvres and political overbidding. Egypt hopes that all those concerned will study the two documents carefully before passing any judgement on them.\n58.\tThe whole world is witness to our intentions. Our aim is a just peace for the entire Middle East area. We do not aspire to peace at any price; we want to achieve the kind of peace that would restore to the Palestinian people its inalienable rights and to the Arab nation its occupied territories. Any initiative by Egypt is undertaken from a position of strength, not weakness, from a position of courage and not hesitation; it is intended to achieve peace, not to wage war. The road to peace is open and all concerned must contribute with the utmost sincerity to these efforts, otherwise in the area there will be a sliding back to the risks of war and destruction which will endanger international peace and security.\n59.\tThroughout its history Egypt has consistently shouldered its national responsibilities and has endured much suffering. It stood firm during crises and spared no sacrifice, including that of its dearest possession\u2014its sons- who died as martyrs. Egypt refuses any tutelage from any source. It does not try to tutor anyone and does not accept any lessons from anyone. It will place itself always above slander and petty attacks.\n60.\tIn conclusion I should like to reiterate what I declared last year from this very rostrum, namely, that Egypt has faced four battles of war, so let us devote the fifth battle to the cause of peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff70.\tMr. President, permit me to join the representatives who have spoken before me in this general debate by offering you the congratulations of the delegation of Israel on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that you will guide this session with fairness and wisdom.\n71,\tIt is my pleasure also to congratulate Solomon Islands on its independence and admission to the United Nations.\n72\tAs we reflect upon the work of the United Nations over the past year one undertaking stands out above all others: it is the noble attempt to reach an agreement on disarmament, to divert precious resources to improving the lot of the common man\n73\tIn the Middle East we recently witnessed an unprecedented escalation in the quantity of weapons purchased by the Arab States, amounting to $11 billion in orders since the beginning of 1977. Indeed, over the past five years the arms agreements signed by those States mean that they have outstripped both the countries members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the countries members of the Warsaw Pact Organization in the ratio of their arms build-up.\n74.\tIsrael is prepared to play its part in the reduction of the arms race and it remains ready to enter into agreements on arms limitation with all States in the Middle East. There is no doubt, however, that the appropriate way to bring about an arms reduction in the Middle East is through peace treaties which would include limitations on armaments within their framework Indeed, the mere transformation from a state of war to one of peace will move the States involved to dedicate their resources to economic development rather than military aims.\n75.\tTerrorist groups continue to threaten the lives of innocent men, women and children in different parts of the world. Once again it must be emphasized that terrorism could be virtually eliminated if certain countries did not continue to provide arms, training and refuge to its practitioners. Yet we are gratified that States which once stood helplessly by have begun to assert themselves.\nMention should be made, for example, of the Federal Republic of Germany's rescue operation in Mogadishu and of the joint statement on international terrorism of the Heads of State 'or Government at the recent Bonn Economic Summit Conference,6 wherein they recognized the need for immediate action to cease all flights to and from a country which refuses to extradite or prosecute hijackers of aircraft. It is only through such concerted and effective action that the world can be freed from organized terrorism.\n76.\tIn the field of human rights no State should ignore a violation of human rights wherever it may occur in the world.\n77.\tIsrael continues to follow closely the situation of Jews in the Soviet Union. We welcome the recent increase in the number of exit visas issued, although a large number of Jews are still denied the elementary human rights to emigrate. In addition, administrative obstacles and arbitrary restrictions still threaten the social and economic livelihood and personal freedom of Jews seeking to emigrate.\n78.\tWe have been particularly concerned by the harsh prison sentences passed this year on Jews whose only crime is their desire to rejoin their families in Israel-Grigorij Goldstein, Iosif Begun, Ida Nudel, Vladimir Slepak, Simon Shnirman and Anatoly Scharansky. Those sentences caused bitter protest and indignation throughout the world. The Soviet Union should release these and other prisoners of conscience and allow those who want to emigrate to Israel and rejoin their families to do so.\n79.\tWe cannot be silent in the face of the increasing incitement of feeling against and defamation of the State of Israel and the Jewish people, their religion, culture and national movement, manifested day after day in the official Soviet media. Those anti-Semitic attacks, unprecedented in their intensity, may have most dangerous consequences. In this regard it must be noted that the Soviet authorities still do not permit Jews to practise their ancient traditions and culture, and in fact take severe measures against Jews who wish to do so. We appeal Jo the Soviet Union to allow Jewish culture to be expressed freely.\n80.\tWe also deeply regret that the Syrian Government continues to violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant international conventions by refusing to permit its Jewish citizens to leave and be reunited with their relatives residing in other lands.\n81.\tOne of the most important trends in world , politics today remains the determined aspiration of the new and under-developed nations to take their place in the international political and economic arena. Being a developing nation itself, Israel strongly identifies with the aspirations of nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America to transform their political independence into a full and equal economic partnership with the older-established nations of the world.\n82 To that end the North-South dialogue, with its guidelines on the transfer of resources, marks an important\nbeginning, and the Government of Israel appreciates the efforts of the United Nations and its agencies in encouraging this process. My Government particularly welcomes the results of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries in Buenos Aires, where Israel proposed a voluntary agreement for the exchange of technical assistance among developing countries. Israel has been co-operating for more than 30 years with other developing nations in fields such as irrigation techniques, seed production, desalination, solar energy and the agricultural development of arid and semi-arid zones. We view the expansion of such co-operative efforts as vital if the serious food shortages that still exist in so much of the world are to be overcome .\n83.\tA year ago I addressed this Assembly on the prospects of launching a peace process in the Middle East. Today I have the satisfaction of being able to address the General Assembly on the new and positive developments that have taken place recently.\n84.\tAs all members of the Assembly know, a few weeks ago at Camp David two framework agreements8 were signed by President Anwar El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and witnessed by President Jimmy Carter of the United States of America. Within a very few days from now negotiations will start between Israel and Egypt for the conclusion of a peace treaty between them.\n85.\tIt is my hope that these negotiations will be successful and that before the year is out we shall witness the beginning of a new era in the Middle East. It is our desire that the peace process should eventually embrace the other States that are our neighbours\u2014Jordan, Lebanon and Syria-so that we may achieve a comprehensive settlement in the area.\n86.\tThe gratitude of my country goes out to President Jimmy Carter, whose devoted efforts have made the Camp David developments possible When this achievement ends with an Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, President Carter's name will be recorded in history as that of a great peacemaker.\n87.\tI also wish to express my country's deep appreciation to President Anwar El-Sadat of the Arab Republic of Egypt for his wisdom and faith. His visit to Jerusalem in November 1977 turned a new page. He decided to enter into negotiations with Israel, to recognize Israel and to make peace with Israel. This change in policy ushered in a historic change in the relations between Egypt and Israel. The previous policy based on the \\\"three Nos\\\" of Khartoum 19679\u2014no negotiations, no recognition and no peace with Israel\u2014prevented any progress towards a peace settlement.\n88.\tNow the road to peace lies open. The warm reception accorded to President El-Sadat by the people and Government of Israel constituted an acknowledgement of this change in the Egyptian policy. A new era of peace, for which Israel has been longing since its establishment, has started. Prime Minister Begin's courage and leadership were a decisive factor. Without his readiness and ability to assume responsibility for very painful decisions, the achievements reached at Camp David would not have been conceivable.\n89.\tNot only since the founding of the State of Israel but since the very beginning of the Zionist movement our dream has always been of a Middle East in which Jew and Arab would live in harmony and co-operation for the mutual advantage of both peoples.\n90.\tThe Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel is a step in this direction. It provides for a withdrawal of Israeli armed forces and civilian population from Sinai; for the establishment of normal relations between the two countries, including diplomatic, economic and cultural relations, and full recognition; the termination of economic boycotts and of barriers to the free movement of goods and people, and mutual protection of citizens by due process of law. It also stipulates that there shall be free passage of Israeli ships through the Gulf of Suez and the Suez Canal, and that the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba are international waterways to be open to all nations for navigation and over flight.\n91.\tIn view of the several wars launched by our neighbours, we are conscious of our security needs. Therefore, in addition to the establishment of normal relations between the two States, there will be security arrangements concerning the limitation of armaments and forces in the different areas on the basis of reciprocity.\n92.\tMoreover, the framework for the conclusion of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel also provides for the stationing of United Nations forces at Sham el Sheikh to ensure freedom of passage through the Straits of Tiran. Similarly, there is a provision for their being stationed in northern Sinai, thus creating a \\\"buffer zone\\\" between the forces stationed in El-Arish and those in Gaza. These forces will not be removed unless such removal is approved by the Security Council of the United Nations. It should be noted here that in recent years the United Nations forces in the Middle East have played a constructive role with the framework of the various agreed arrangements in the. region.\n93.\tIt has never been the wish of Israel to exercise control over the lives and activities of the Arab inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza.\n94.\tWe want to live as equals with the Arab inhabitants of those areas. We want to live with them, not to replace them; but at the same time we do not regard ourselves as foreigners in those areas. The Israeli settlements in Judaea and Samaria and in the Gaza district are there as of right. It is inconceivable to us that Jews should be prohibited from settling and living in Judaea and Samaria, which are the heart of our homeland.\n95.\tWe maintain our army positions in those areas in order to ensure the security of the population of Israel, the majority of whom live in the Mediterranean coastal area. The Israeli forces are there in order to protect Israel and not in order to interfere in the lives of the Arab inhabitants. Under the agreement for the Framework for Peace in the Middle East, the Israeli military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn from those areas once a self-governing authority is freely elected by their inhabitants. The Israeli defence forces will be redeployed in those areas and maintained for security purposes. The final status of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza and their relationship with their neighbours will be negotiated during a period of five years following the establishment of the self-governing authority.\n96.\tOne of the subjects that will be discussed between the parties will undoubtedly be the question concerning Jerusalem. For us, the city of Jerusalem is the one and only eternal capital of Israel. We have not, and we shall never have, any other capital city, whether or not others recognize it as such. This eternal city is holy to three religions\u2014Judaism, Christianity and Islam. However, our connexion with it is not just religious, but derives from the totality of Jewish national history. Jerusalem is the heart and soul of the Jewish people. It is now united once again, as it should be, free and open for all to come and go. All religious communities should be in complete control of their own holy places and of their own religious life, and all should enjoy the rights of free worship. The inhabitants of the city should live together in harmony with a representative municipal council supervising all essential functions. We have resolved never again to compromise the unity of Jerusalem, and it is our hope that other peoples will share our position.\n97.\tIt was agreed at Camp David that a peace settlement in the Middle East should be based on resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the United Nations Security Council. Resolution 242(1967) is a carefully worked out set of principles establishing a framework of peace to be negotiated among the contending States. It makes clear mat the final borders must be negotiated bilaterally among the States concerned.\n98 Let us hope that all those whose co-operation is essential in obtaining peace in the Middle East will not short-sightedly remain outside the peace process. We have to find agreed and appropriate ways for Jews and Arabs to live together in equality, trust and mutual respect.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n194.\tWhile this United Nations General Assembly session is being held a number of conflicts have attracted the attention of the peoples of the world.\n195.\tAn African poet once said that there is something ominous about silence. Today we cannot, and do not wish to, remain silent about the situation confronting the worthy people of Nicaragua, the legendary homeland of Augusto Cesar Sandino, who was called the glorious \\\"General of Free Men\\\". It was Sandino who once told the United States imperialists;\n\\\"Then come and kill us in our land; I await you at the head of my soldier patriots, and we do not care how many of you there are. But understand this: if that happens, our blood will stain the white dome of the famous White House, that den of criminal plans.\\\"\n196.\tStriving to attain political power, inspired by Sandino's example to open up new avenues to a different and better future, fighting from improvised barricades thrown up in the cities and from entrenched columns in the wild mountains, the Nicaraguan revolutionaries have pushed the dictator Somoza and his regime to the verge of collapse using hunting rifles, side arms and home-made bombs.\n197.\tThe scientific analysis of social processes shows that when an idea becomes a part of mass consciousness it is transformed into a powerful material force and that when the people decide to throw off the yoke that oppresses them, nothing can stop them.\n198.\tSomoza has resorted to every type of repression in an effort to crush the popular uprising. He has trampled upon human rights, violated public liberties and enthroned barbarity and genocide, and has even used groups of mercenaries, among them Vietnamese and Cuban counterrevolutionaries recruited in a number of countries, particularly the United States and certain Central American States.\n199.\tThis situation has created a real source of possible attacks by the Somoza regime against neighbouring States, as has already occurred with the bombing of Costa Rican territory, which has endangered peace throughout the area.\n200.\tOur Assembly should denounce the Somoza regime as a monster that has emerged under the generous shadow of the Yankee occupation and reject the credentials of the delegation from that dictator, who is repudiated by his people and by all progressive mankind; it should condemn the use of mercenary groups sent to crush the struggle of the Nicaraguan people, and condemn all military or economic assistance to the tyrannical regime in Managua.\n201.\tThe Middle East is another focal point of crisis on the international scene. If we believe what the great press of the capitalist world says, we can assume that advances towards peace in the Middle East have been made, but if, instead, we look at what has happened in recent months we shall be forced to admit that the reality is quite different.\n202.\tAt the last regular session of the General Assembly we stated that \\\"the allies of Tel Aviv and other reactionaries seek by their diplomatic and military manoeuvres to ignore the rights of the Palestinian people .. .\\\".  Those manoeuvres have been deviously expressed in the dubious results of the Camp David meetings, which pretend that the Arab States follow the downward path of unprincipled concessions to the enemy even to the point of betraying the Arab peoples-as the Arab States of the Front for Steadfastness, other Arab Governments and the Palestine Liberation Organization have charged.\n203.\tThere is no acknowledgment of the fact that Israel, with the ever-present help of its allies, chiefly the United States, continues to occupy territory belonging to the Arab States of Egypt, Jordan and Syria. There is equally stubborn refusal to allow the Palestinian people to satisfy their most basic national rights. The fact that Israeli troops recently launched a new act of aggression by driving deep into Lebanon and occupying part of its territory for a time, fiercely repressing progressive forces and attacking the Palestinian refugee camps, is completely overlooked. That act of war took place at a time when every effort was being made to make the world believe that peace was at hand.\n204.\tThe truth, which cannot be brushed aside by defeatist statements or agreements, is that, when Israel was faced with the undeniable existence of the Palestine nation and the determination of its representatives to struggle for their infringed rights, it chose to practise genocide against that people.\n205.\tThe history of diplomacy has recognized peace by treaty. The history of the people will recognize peace by conscience. There is no peace of conscience when the principles of those who died fighting for a social ideal are betrayed. One does not have to be a prophet to know that accounts will be settled some day, and not exactly on the Day of Judgement.\n206.\tRepresentatives should ask themselves whether the Tel Aviv Government could take this action without the material and moral support of the United States Government.\n207.\tThe struggle of the Arab peoples is important for all the countries of the world. It is not admissible for an aggressive, expansionist State to establish the borders it wants or deprive an entire nation of its legitimate rights by means of war.\n208.\tThere will be no just and lasting peace in the Middle East, nor can the international community accept pseudo- solutions that do not respect the legitimate national rights of the people of Palestine, including the right to establish their own State and the right to self-determination; nor will there be real peace until the territories occupied in 1967 are returned unconditionally to the Arab States.\n209.\tCuba pledges its firmest support to the cause of the Arab peoples and especially to the cause of the long-suffering Palestinian people, whose only legitimate representative is the Palestine Liberation Organization, as has been recognized by this Assembly, the movement of non-aligned countries, the League of Arab States, the OAU and especially the Palestinian people itself.\n210.\tMr. President, before continuing, I should like, on behalf of the Cuban delegation, to congratulate you on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. Colombia and Cuba are linked by a close fellowship of history and culture. The close relations that have always linked our fraternal peoples have been strengthened since you became Minister for Foreign Affairs of your country, and they are being extended daily to our mutual benefit. We are certain that in the weeks ahead you will skilfully guide the work of this Assembly and we pledge the support of the Cuban representatives in this task.\n211.\tThe October Revolution, a social product emerging from the class struggle of contemporary society, marked the start of the genuine crisis of capitalism and opened the wellspring of the struggle of the colonial peoples against imperialism. The world has changed profoundly since then.\n212.\tThe international balance of power today is nothing like that which existed in 1920, when the Soviets were alone, surrounded by a hostile world. The balance of power L not even comparable with that in the 1950s or at the beginning of the 1960s. Today, the struggle of the peoples, particularly in the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, has inclined the balance towards the cause of peace, independence and progress. This change in the correlation of forces and this tendency that favours peace are evident within the United Nations itself in the community of interests between the socialist countries and the underdeveloped countries, which has made possible a fruitful period of major definition -and decision, particularly in the struggle against colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism and apartheid and for the establishment of a new international economic order.\n213.\tAs a product of that world correlation and an immediate result of the long internal struggles and difficult battles for national liberation, new independent States have emerged, founded on principles of fraternal and disinterested support. But where are those peoples who have experienced the long darkness of colonial exploitation- without hospitals or doctors, without schools or teachers, without industrial development-and who are prisoners of the dependent relationships they have inherited to find that support?\n214.\tOnly a social revolution that eliminates the internal structures blocking the productive forces, combined with unconditional outside support based on principles of justice and internationalist solidarity, can help those peoples to move towards a new, full life. Imperialism is not the natural ally of the peoples in their aim to achieve independent development. Its so-called assistance, generally in the form of loans, is one of the mechanisms it has created to pull its own economy out of a state of permanent structural crisis.\n215.\tColonial and neo-colonial relations are the source of under-development, poverty and ignorance.\n216.\tCuba urges that colonialism be ended once and for all through the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination and independence.\n217.\tWe therefore energetically support the independence of the Saharan people and the people of Belize. The territorial integrity of the latter people is being threatened by the pro-imperialist regime in Guatemala, with the support of the transnational corporations.\n218.\tDuring the last two years the United States Government has pressured and threatened the Member States of this international Organization, demanding that the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples suspend its debate and any decision affecting the colonial case of Puerto Rico. Nevertheless, on 12 September, following two weeks of intensive work, that Committee approved a resolution calling upon the United States to transfer all power to the people of that territory so that they might exercise full sovereignty in freely determining their own future [see A/33/23/Rev.l, chap. I, para. 73]. The United States Government was completely isolated. Representatives of all the political forces in Puerto Rico attended the meetings of the Special Committee and not one of them failed to recognize the colonial status of that territory.\n219.\tCuba will continue to uphold the pertinent decisions of the Conference of the non-aligned countries  and the mandate that stems from our history of struggle shared with the Puerto Rican people to support their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.\n220.\tThe imperialist Powers and the reactionary Governments of other countries are creating new pacts which threaten the security of peaceful States that are engaged in the immense task of building happiness for their peoples.\n221.\tWe refer first of all to the heroic people of Viet Nam, whose defeat of imperialist aggression in Indo-China was a decisive contribution to the struggle against colonialism and neo-colonialism. When the war was over the Vietnamese people dedicated themselves to carrying out President Ho Chi Minh's expressed will that a Viet Nam 10 times more beautiful should be built on the ruins left by the war, in which indiscriminate and criminally massive use had been made of all kinds of weapons except nuclear arms.. At the same time, the Vietnamese Government proceeded rapidly to the normalization of relations with all its neighbours, in an effort to bring peace, neutrality and progress to South-East Asia.\n222.\tHowever, the Chinese Government leadership, wishing to please its Western allies and leaving no doubts about its anti-progressive and anti-socialist militancy and its dreams of hegemony and expansion in Asia, is now threatening heroic Viet Nam. The Peking leadership is acting in flagrant alliance with United States imperialism and with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO].\n223.\tIn Latin America, the Chinese leadership's best friend is the Fascist junta of Pinochet. In Africa, it takes an active part in the aggression against Angola and expresses its solidarity with the threats levelled against the revolutions of Ethiopia and Yemen. In Asia, it seeks to impose its chauvinistic dictates on Viet Nam and other countries. Finally, it works actively against the extension of international detente, the halting of the arms race and the protection of the world from the threat of war.\n224.\tCuba believes that the immoral policy of the new Chinese mandarins should be energetically rejected.\n225.\tWe believe also that it is just and necessary for this Assembly to support the independence and territorial integrity of Namibia and Zimbabwe and we reiterate here that Cuba supports the legitimate representatives of those people, the Patriotic front and SWAPO and that, as President Fidel Castro stated in his speech at the International Conference of Solidarity with the Struggle of the African and Arab Peoples against Imperialism and Reaction,1 1 Cuba does not oppose any peaceful negotiation that would solve the problems of both cases, so long as such negotiation is just and is accepted by the legitimate representatives of those peoples and by the African States supporting them.\n226.\tIndeed, the very forces that have obliged the fighters of SWAPO and the Patriotic Front to resort to arms provide all kinds of assistance to the regimes of Smith and Vorster and benefit from the exploitation of the black peoples of southern Africa. It is precisely the determination of the patriots of those countries to keep on fighting until victory is won that has forced the racist regimes and their NATO allies to seek peaceful, negotiated solutions.\n227.\tIt should be recalled that the United Nations recently published a list of companies that have violated the embargo declared against the racist regimes,  and it is highly significant that more than 500 of the 593 Western companies mentioned in the list are British and American. It is therefore absolutely necessary to remain vigilant concerning any attempt to evade the liberation aims of the fighters of the Patriotic Front and SWAPO by replacing the present white racists with another regime which would perpetuate the criminal exploitation to which those peoples are subjected and block the institution of regimes that \nrepresent the majorities, the black peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe.\n228.\tWe believe that the decisions this Assembly adopts should leave Pretoria and Salisbury in no doubt concerning the international community's determination to put an end to racism and colonialism in southern Africa. We support full independence and territorial integrity for Zimbabwe and Namibia. We urge that Pretoria be further isolated and we support the patriots confronting that regime.\n229.\tThe recent decision of the South African regime announcing the implementation of its own plan for so-called independence for Namibia proves how strongly South Africa believes it can count on the support of its most important commercial partners and providers of arms and military and nuclear technology. In fact everything seems to indicate that the imperialists regard with veiled pleasure the fact that the authorities of Pretoria are trying to impose a neo-colonial regime upon Namibia.\n230.\tWe consider that the moment has come for the Security Council to approve sanctions capable of bringing about the economic, military and political isolation of South Africa and for SWAPO to receive every assistance it requires in order to continue its armed struggle in favour of Namibia's independence, the only alternative left open for the Namibian patriots in view of the attitude of South Africa and the Western Powers.\n231.\tWe also condemn the incursions by Rhodesia into the Republic of Mozambique, and we stress Cuba's support for the valiant people of Mozambique, who will not take a backward step, despite these acts of aggression. We believe that this Assembly should call upon all Member States to offer Mozambique and the other front-line States all necessary assistance to meet successfully the actions of the Pretoria and Salisbury regimes.\n232.\tWs also alert this Assembly to the intentions of the forces of imperialism and reaction in regard to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, a strong bulwark of democracy, freedom and progress in the Arabian -peninsula. We send the Yemeni revolutionaries a warm message of identification and solidarity.\n233.\tWe support the right to self-determination of the people of East Timor and Argentina's legitimate aspiration to recover the Malvinas Islands.\n234.\tWe demand the complete, unconditional withdrawal of ail foreign troops remaining in Cyprus in flagrant violation of the sovereign rights of that country and we call for complete respect for its independence and territorial integrity.\n235.\tWe call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops and materiel from South Korea and for the dissolution of the United Nations Command. We support the just demands of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at attaining those objectives..\n236.\tWe salute the successes achieved by the people of Panama in their long, courageous and heroic struggle to obtain full sovereignty over all their territory.\n237.\tWe reiterate our demand that foreign air, naval and military bases in Guam, the Philippines, the Indian Ocean, Malta, Cyprus, Panama, Puerto Rico and Guantanamo - to mention but a few-be dismantled. This would make a substantial contribution to the strengthening of international peace and security.\n238.\tWe support the heroic struggle being waged by the people of Chile for their freedom and against the policy of unemployment, poverty, repression and surrender of the country's resources to the transnational companies that helped the Fascist junta seize power. We are confident that the Chilean people will emerge victorious over fascism.\n239.\tMuch speculation has been voiced over the status of and prospects for our relations with the United States. Cuba can negotiate these relations, but never on the basis of abandoning any of our principles. The prerequisite for any negotiation must be that the United States lift its unjust and unilateral blockade of Cuba and end all its hostile acts \u2022 and attacks. We cannot have discussions on the basis of force and blackmail; it is not possible to conduct a dialogue with a dagger in the chest. We cannot say when such a discussion will be possible, but it is certain that the Cuban people's right to determine their own future in freedom and sovereignty, to take a specific position in international conflicts and to act in solidarity with the peoples struggling for freedom and independence can never be questioned; that our people will win their right to exercise sovereignty over all our territory; and that the Yankee troops that now illegally occupy a part of our island will have to withdraw.\n240.\tPart of the booty the United States obtained when it intervened in Cuba's war for independence from colonial domination was the territory that it usurped and that is occupied to this day by the naval base in Guantanamo. The military Government of occupation imposed upon the Cubans the concession of that part of our fatherland, in spite of the strong opposition of our people.\n241.\tOver 70 years have elapsed and the United States military presence still continues in the naval base of Guantanamo, a truly colonial enclave in our land. The Government and the people of Cuba strongly voice their demand for the restitution of the territory occupied by that base.\n242.\tThis Assembly is meeting after an interval of a year in which the most aggressive forces of imperialism, supported by reactionaries of all types, have tried to prevent the strengthening of detente and push the world back to the days of the cold war, stepping up the arms race and blocking the progress to and consolidation of national independence by the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America and their struggle for economic and social development based on just and equal international relations.\n243.\tIn the months since the thirty-second session a series of international conferences have also taken place, including three special sessions of the General Assembly, the seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing\nCountries and the Conference of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries.\n244.\tIn analysing the international situation we cannot fail to refer to the critical situation at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea after haying held seven sessions. Its success or failure will determine whether a regime of law that will benefit world peace will prevail or whether there will be anarchy, with its unforeseeable consequences. This topic is, therefore, of vital interest to the developing countries; which, with the establishment of anew law of the sea, would make the first real gain in their just struggle for a new international economic order.\n245.\tOnly through an international regime will the community of nations be able to prevent the unrestricted exploitation of those resources by the imperialist consortiums seriously harming the inland producers of minerals similar to those found in the sea-bed and guarantee that the benefits obtained from their exploitation will provide resources for the countries that are relatively less developed.\n246.\tCuba wishes explicitly to state its firm support for the energetic protest formulated by the Group of 77 in the session of the Conference on the Law of the Sea that was concluded recently, expressing opposition to the bills being considered by the United States and other countries that will pave the way for the large consortia to exploit those resources unilaterally. At the same time it emphasizes the responsibility that weighs on all countries-especially the large capitalist Powers\u2014to help to overcome the present deadlock in the Conference.\n247.\tIf we can draw any conclusion from what has happened in the last few months, it is first of all that there is duplicity in the foreign policy of the imperialists, who use their diplomatic activities to hide attempts to maintain their neo-colonial rule where it still persists, supporting racist and expansionist reactionary regimes such as those of South Africa and Israel, and to maintain intact the system of international economic relations that favours the exploitation by their consortia of the riches of the so-called third-world countries.\n248.\tSuffice it to recall what happened while the tenth special session of the General Assembly, which was devoted to disarmament, was being held. While in this building the vast majority of the representatives of Member States sincerely and insistently tried to find solutions that would slow down the arms race and use the money thus saved to benefit all humanity, strengthening the international peace and security that all people seek, at the same time the NATO Heads of State met in Washington to adopt the most costly programme of military expenditure ever approved by that aggressive military pact. Where is the imperialists' real policy shown-in the New York disarmament negotiations or in the boost given the arms race in NATO?\n249.\tMoreover, it is important to emphasize that the relative success of the special session, which created conditions favourable for continuing efforts to achieve general and complete disarmament, the goal of all progressive forces, was a victory for the non-aligned countries which requested the special session, for the countries of the socialist community, which gave it their support and for all the other States which worked with dedication in the special session.\n250.\tAllow me to reiterate that Cuba strongly urges the attainment of that goal and that we support the prompt calling of a world disarmament conference and the conclusion of the negotiations to reach partial agreements on such matters as the elimination of chemical weapons, the prohibition of all nuclear weapon testing and a ban on the use of force in international relations. In that regard we salute the proposals presented by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.\n251.\tAlso while: the special session was being held many extremely aggressive, slanderous statements were made against Cuba for its fulfilment of its international obligations to help the peoples of Angola and Ethiopia. A whole campaign of lies was 6rchestrated to try to accuse Cuba of having participated in the events which took place in the Shaba Province in Zaire, but the truth prevailed and it was further proved that it had all been a means to justify intervention by NATO forces.\n252.\tOn 14 September, President Fidel Castro said:\n\\\"The imperialists and their reactionary servants oppose Cuba's presence in Africa....\n\\\"We could answer them with the words of several African Heads of State, who have said that there are no Cubans in Africa who have not been asked to come by an independent State exercising its sovereignty to defend a just cause.\\\"\n253.\tFollowing the defeat of the attack made on the people of Angola by the racist regime of South Africa everything possible has been done to prevent the peoples of Africa and the Middle East from consolidating their independence, to hold back all demonstrations of solidarity with them and to try to divide them. Forces of intervention have even been sent, in an attempt to recolonize Africa, and all possibilities for military confrontation between the countries in the area have been enhanced.\n254.\tThe enemies of the people seek to destroy the organizations established to strengthen their solidarity; an example is provided by the efforts made recently on the international level to divide, weaken and destroy the movement of non-aligned countries. We can state, however, that those efforts have failed; the members of the movement are now more united and their presence in the struggle is more active because they have reached basic solutions that respond to the true interests of the people in every one of the main conflicts on the international scene today.\n255.\tClearly the imperialist forces have been unable to obtain a favourable balance. The revolutions of Angola and Ethiopia have been consolidated, the front-line countries maintain their unswerving support for the national liberation movements that are fighting against racism, and no force can deter the moral and material solidarity and aid given those peoples. The failure of all the manoeuvres to sabotage the last OAU Assembly of Heads of State and\nGovernment and the Conference of the foreign ministers of non-aligned countries is evidence of a deep awareness that international solidarity is particularly significant in the current struggles of the African and Arab peoples.\n256.\tFour years ago at its sixth special session the General Assembly adopted a Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)], initiating a phase of intense negotiations in the economic field in which the developing countries felt confident that their minimum demands for obtaining access to economic development would be met. Without fear of being called pessimistic we can say that the results obtained since that Declaration was adopted have been frustrating. The situation of the non-oil-producing developing countries has become steadily worse. Foreign debts have risen, balance-of-payments problems have increased and purchasing. power and access to Western industrialized markets have declined.\n257.\tThe developing countries have not obtained a single concession on any of the basic demands made to the developed countries that control economic relations in the developing world. Instead of a reduction in customs and trade barriers to provide entry to capitalist markets, there has been an increase. The current blockade of my country is perhaps a typical example of the kind of commercial discrimination that is employed; the prices of manufactured goods, of machinery and of agricultural and industrial products which the developing world imports in order to turn out finished goods, continue to rise and the prejudicial relationship between those prices and what the developing world is paid for the exploitation of its natural resources remains unaltered. The crisis of the monetary system \u2014especially the crisis facing the United States dollar which is its base\u2014has caused even greater damage to the economy of the under-developed world.\n258.\tUnfortunately, it seems that no serious effort is being made to change this situation. The recent failure of the committee of the whole created by the General Assembly by its resolution 32/174 demonstrates that it takes just one country blindly set on maintaining its privileges to block the mechanism established by the vote of the overwhelming majority of Member States of the United Nations.\n259.\tWe believe that it is necessary to continue demanding discussion, debate and negotiation within the United Nations and that any attempt to find solutions outside this universal body will only constitute delaying tactics like those employed in Paris in the so-called North-South dialogue. We also believe that the developing world should continue to do everything possible to extend the ties of economic co-operation among the under-developed countries and between them and the industrialized countries that do not exploit the existing unjust and unequal international economic relations. Mechanisms such as the Latin American Economic System must continue to be supported as a step towards increasingly closer co-operation among our peoples.\n260.\tInternational bodies must facilitate this process of co-operation and act with initiative and boldness in doing so Cuba hopes, and will do everything possible to see to it, that progress is made during this session towards providing the committee of the whole, as a negotiating body, with the status and the authority to satisfy the just demands presented by the developing countries.\n261.\tMy comrades and I come from a small island that is no more than a dot on the world map. Ours is not a rich country; it does not have any great energy resources. Before the revolution that triumphed in January 1959, it was known only for its rum, cigars and music. Today it is much more than that, because a country's worth is measured not in square kilometres and millions of inhabitants but rather by the morale of its people and these struggles.\n262.\tIt is on that small island, placed like a key at the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico, that the Heads of State and Government of the members of the movement of non- aligned countries will meet next September. Cuba is making enthusiastic and careful preparations to welcome the representatives of the 86 States Members of the movement of non-aligned countries and to provide for all their needs at the sixth Conference.\n263.\tThe upcoming summit Conference of non-aligned countries, the first to be held in Latin America, will help to strengthen the principles on which the movement was founded, and its aspirations to affirm the independence and sovereignty of the peoples and their right to independent development.\n264.\tOur President, Comrade Fidel Castro, said on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the attack on the Moncada Barracks:\n\\\"The world revolutionary movement has made tremendous progress in the present century. Its forces grow; its ranks increase; its experience is enriched. The betrayal by, and the insanity, weakness and blindness of, those whose vanity, arrogance, stupidity, petit bourgeois attitudes, chauvinism and opportunism kept them from following the luminous path of the Revolution will never hold back mankind's victorious march.\n\\\"Mankind will not return to the past; peace will be preserved; the people will march forward in progress, and nothing and no one can stop them.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff83.\tMr. President, first of all may I, with infinite pleasure, offer you my warm congratulations and my best wishes for total success in connexion with your brilliant election to the post of President of the General Assembly. There is no doubt that in entrusting to you the highly important responsibility of directing the work of the thirty-third session, the General Assembly wanted to pay a tribute both to your eminent qualities as a statesman and seasoned diplomat, well versed in international affairs, and to the persevering efforts of your Government in favour of peace and international security and co-operation. I am particularly pleased since you are the head of the diplomatic corps of a country with which mine is honoured and pleased to maintain excellent relations of friendship and co-operation. I should like to assure you of the entire co-operation of the delegation of the Ivory Coast in the fulfilment of your mission.\n84.\tMay I also associate myself with the homage paid to your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, by expressing to him our great gratitude for the outstanding way in which he presided over the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly and the three special sessions which followed.\n85.\tI should also once again like to give assurances of our total support for the efforts made by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in favour of peace and progress in the world and of friendly co-operation between nations. Mr. Waldheim's high sense of duty and dedication to the cause of our Organization have always called forth the admiration and respect of the Government and people of the Ivory Coast.\n86.\tWe wish to welcome with particular satisfaction the admission of Solomon Islands to the United Nations. In addressing to the representative of that new Member our most heartfelt congratulations and our wishes of welcome, I should like to assure him of our readiness to co-operate with him within the United Nations and to maintain with his country sincere relations of friendship and confident co-operation.\n87.\tIn spit? of certain laudable efforts, particularly by our Organization, to promote peace, the international situation remains characterized by the persistence of certain hotbeds of tension and war, by the selfish behaviour of human beings and States, and the emergence of new crises.\n88.\tAfrica, unfortunately, offers just such a spectacle. The harsh rivalry between the two blocs is one cause. The problems of decolonization and the aftermath of colonization itself are another.\n89.\tAlthough the western part of our continent is in a state of relative peace which can promote regional economic co-operation, the situation prevailing in other regions is, as far as we are concerned, a reason for major concern, not only because it sows dissension between friendly States whose proximity requires them to be co-operative and understanding but also because it plays into the hands of certain Powers which, while claiming to help Africa to settle its problems, are in fact trying to expand their zones of influence.\n90.\tThese Powers justify their military intervention in Africa by the argument that the States concerned requested it, and by the claim that that request was based on the \\\"inherent right of individual or collective self-defence\\\" of any Member State subjected to armed aggression, as recognized by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. That is entirely understandable, but what is much less so is that these same Powers reproach others for their intervention, although it is justified by much the same reasons.\n91.\tAfrica wishes to have peace, because it cannot develop except in peace. Africa aspires to freedom, because it knows the value of freedom all too well. It aspires to genuine independence, because it wishes to be true to itself and be master of its own destiny in order, with the selfless assistance of its genuine friends, to exploit its immense riches in the manner best suited to its own interests and deepest aspirations, and to the creative genius of its sons.\n92.\tTo those who claim to seek no advantage for themselves in Africa, we wish to renew our invitation to take part in the only valid battle on that continent: peaceful competition in the economic, technical, social and cultural fields to help Africa to emerge from the quagmire of under-development.\n93.\tAfrica needs no foreign ideologies that would cause it to lose its personality; it has no use for cannon or other means of mass destruction which, after having sown death and desolation, would mortgage its development and its aspirations to well-being, peace and security.\n94.\tGiven the division of the world into two blocs, the Ivory Coast has always felt that peace in Africa requires neutrality. Indeed, only absolute neutrality, which would protect Africa from foreign interference, will safeguard the independence and soul of that continent. The essential conditions for this are: domestic peace for each one of the African States, peace between African States, and peace between Africa and the rest of the world. \n95.\tHence our understandable satisfaction at the results of the meeting between the Presidents of Gambia, Guinea,\nIvory Coast, Liberia, Senegal and Togo, held in Monrovia from 18 to 19 March 1978, which set its seal on the reconciliation between Guinea and Senegal, on the one hand, and Guinea and the Ivory Coast, on the other hand.\n96.\tThe decisions that followed that summit meeting reflected our firm desire to strive, in the spirit of Monrovia, for the strengthening of fruitful brotherly relations between our two countries for the greatest good of our peoples.\n97.\tHence also our understandable gratification at the recent reconciliation between Zaire and Angola, and at the happy prospects which it offers for the harmonious development of their relations and their co-operation. We ardently hope that it will be crowned by total reconciliation within each of the two countries.\n\n98.\tAgainst that background, one may also appreciate our satisfaction at the successes already achieved by the Government of Chad on the road to national reconciliation. We heartily encourage it to persevere in its efforts to resume the dialogue with its citizens who are still alienated from the Chad family, with a view to a reconciliation among all the citizens of Chad and the consolidation of national unity.\n99.\tWe would very much have liked to be able to say as much of the other conflicts or disputes which still divide African countries. We can only venture to hope and to voice the wish that those conflicts or disputes will similarly find a rapid solution which will strengthen peace and security in Africa. The Ivory Coast, for its part, is quite ready to make its modest contribution to the pursuit of such a solution, if those countries deem it necessary and appropriate.\n100.\tThe results of the Monrovia Summit Conference, the dialogue between Zaire and Angola, and between the Government of Chad and the opposition, are eloquent evidence of the fact that, when left to themselves, Africans will always rely on authentically African criteria for the peaceful settlement of the disputes that may from time to time set them against each other, and that it is pointless to try to divide them, because African brotherhood will always triumph in the long run and allow Africans to come together again. \n101.\tWhen all our hopes for a peaceful settlement of the Namibian problem appeared, well-founded, the South African Government has just unilaterally decided to hold elections in Namibia in December, arguing primarily that the measures contemplated by the Secretary-General for the implementation of the process of the Territory's accession to independence are not in accordance with the plan elaborated by the five Western Powers members of the Security Council.\n102.\tThe arguments invoked by the South African Government in support of its decision are unacceptable. Indeed, as has been recognized by all the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five Western Powers, the report of\nthe Secretary-General  is entirely in keeping with their plan. According to one of them, it contains an objective evaluation of the human and financial resources necessary for the implementation of that plan, for which we are pleased to renew our full support.\n103.\tThe South African Government's decision, the unavowed purpose of which is to achieve an internal settlement of the Namibian question, appears to us to be dangerous. If put into effect, it would result in an escalation of violence and would lead to a great loss of human life in Namibia. Moreover, it would harm the cause it claims to serve, especially since the international community would not recognize a Power about which all that could be said is that it would have emerged from elections decided upon and organized unilaterally, outside United Nations framework, and excluding SWAPO militants and other Namibian nationalists.\n104.\tThe Government of the Ivory Coast can only deplore that unexpected, disconcerting and unfortunate decision by the South African Government. In the face of such a decision, the temptation would seem to be great to resort to radical solutions, in particular to the sanctions provided for in Articles 41 and 42 of the United Nations Charter.\n105.\tThe Government of the Ivory Coast believes that such measures would be inappropriate because there is still a chance for a peaceful settlement of the Namibian problem. We therefore urgently appeal to the five Western members of the Council to persuade the South African Government that the course which it initially chose in accepting their plan is the best, and that it must implement it fully so as to turn the page in the dispute which still pits South Africa against the international community.\n106.\tThe clarifications made by the Secretary-General in submitting his report to the Security Council on 29 September,  and the support accorded him by the members of the Council, should lead South Africa to reconsider its position and to postpone its decision.\n107.\tWe fervently hope that the Government of South Africa will turn back to the path of wisdom and reason, so that the hopes for Namibian independence aroused by the Security Council's adoption of the five-Power plan in its resolution 435 (1978) will materialize.\n108.\tIn Rhodesia, after a considerable number of delays, the head of the illegal regime has finally acknowledged the principle of universal suffrage and accordingly has agreed to the accession of the majority of the Rhodesian population to power. But he has thought that he could attain that objective by what is commonly known as an internal settlement.\n109.\tThat solution, which has excluded the nationalist forces living outside the country, in particular the Patriotic Front, from the process of accession to power is doomed to failure. The appeal for a cease-fire has been answered by an intensification of combat. The spectre of widespread civil war is hovering over the country, with everything that this implies in terms of loss of life, destruction of property, unspeakable suffering and horrible misery.\n110.\tIt would therefore seem urgent to abandon the fiction represented by the so-called internal settlement in order to embark, without reservations or bitterness but resolutely and with tolerance, on the course which will lead to the genuine decolonization of Rhodesia through the peaceful and democratic transfer of power to the majority, and to concord and unity among all its inhabitants. In this respect, we are pleased at the British and American initiatives to convene a conference of all the parties to the, conflict in order to break the present deadlock and ensure Zimbabwe's rapid accession to independence.\n111.\tPeace and security in southern Africa are similarly threatened by the odious policy of apartheid and of racial discrimination prevailing in South Africa, in spite of its condemnation and the indignation it arouses among the international community.\n112.\tThe Ivory Coast has constantly condemned that inhuman system without reservation or ambiguity. But we believe in the possibility of its elimination by peaceful means. Hence we shall continue trying to make the South African Government understand the grave danger posed by its apartheid policy to peace in Africa and to the neutrality of that continent. We shall also try to convince it of the need to engage in dialogue with the blacks of South Africa in order to overcome mutual distrust, promote mutual understanding and confidence between the different communities, bring about racial equality, and guarantee to all South Africans the same rights and obligations, as well as equal opportunities for social progress.\n113.\tIn the case of the conflict brought about by the decolonization of the Comoros, we are pleased by the willingness expressed by the Comorian Government to solve the problem of Mayotte through dialogue with France and the people of Mayotte, and by the understanding shown in this respect by France. The normalization of relations between the two countries and the useful contacts that have been established are quite encouraging in this respect. We hope, therefore, that when this problem is examined the General Assembly will adopt a decision that will not jeopardize the chances of a peaceful settlement but will encourage a dialogue between the parties concerned with a view to settling of the dispute and make it possible for the Republic of the Comoros to recover its unity.\n114.\tThe Government and people of the Ivory Coast, which have made of dialogue a genuine dogma, could not but applaud the historic and exceptionally courageous initiative taken by President Anwar El-Sadat last November. But we had no illusions about the difficulty of the task, especially since the positions of the parties to the conflict in the Middle East were so far apart and it was clear that all the problems of the region could not be removed on that single visit, as if by magic, from one day to the next. Direct negotiation between these parties, which was unthinkable yesterday, has become possible today.\n115.\tWe wish to pay a particular tribute to the President of the United States of America, Mr. Jimmy Carter, for having helped in maintaining the dynamic of peace brought about by the initiative of the Egyptian Head of State and for having made possible the summit meetings at Camp David and the conclusion of the agreements that resulted there from.\n116.\tTo be sure, those agreements are only a framework for peace that still has to be filled in and that leaves open or only touched upon some of the crucial questions. Some of the aspects of the Palestine question in particular which are at the heart of the conflict have not been resolved. But it appears to us that the Camp David agreements have created the necessary conditions for the continuance of the dialogue and for negotiations between the parties and have made it possible to hope for a just and lasting settlement of the tragic Middle East problem. In our opinion they are an important step along the difficult road that should lead to peace.\n\n117.\tAdded to all those which preceded it, the Camp David meetings are striking proof that when the protagonists in a conflict, whoever they may be, meet and enter into dialogue the wall of mistrust and hatred crumbles, understanding and confidence are established and the conditions and hope for settlement of the dispute are created.\n118.\tThat is why we wish to express the hope that all the parties concerned, including the PLO, will take part in the negotiation at some stage with a view to arriving ?t a global, just, equitable and lasting settlement of the conflict on the basis of the pertinent resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly which stipulate, inter alia: the withdrawal of Israel from Arab territories occupied since 1967 and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including its right to a homeland, and the right of all the people of the region to live in peace within secure, recognized and guaranteed borders.\n119.\tThe situation prevailing in Lebanon is closely linked to the Middle East conflict, and is very distressing indeed. The United Nations should not remain indifferent faced with such terrible massacres and destruction, which in recent days have acquired unprecedented dimensions. We deem it to be the absolute duty of the international community, in particular the great Powers and the Arab countries, to do everything in their power to stop that bloodshed and put an end to the suffering of the people of Lebanon, to help Lebanon to find peace and national unity and to ensure respect for its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. We believe that the General Assembly, through its President, should make an urgent appeal for the immediate cessation of hostilities.\n120.\tThe prolongation of the Cyprus crisis likewise causes us concern. The foreign interference puts a brake on the attempt to settle this crisis. It is therefore desirable that an end be put to it and that, under the aegis of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, a sincere dialogue should be begun between the two Cypriot communities so that on the basis of General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) and Security Council resolution 365 (1974) a settlement may be found that will preserve the territorial integrity, independence and non-alignment of Cyprus and guarantee the harmonious coexistence of the two communities on the island. \n121.. The Ivory Coast welcomes the results obtained at the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament. The conclusions and recommendations of that session [resolution S-10/2], in particular those relating to the limitation of conventional weapons and nuclear disarmament, must be followed by concrete measures and rapidly implemented if we are not once again to disappoint the expectations of mankind.\n122.\tWe consider, in this respect, as a realistic and important action the creation by the General Assembly at that session of new machinery to ensure the participation of all States in the negotiations on this vital question. We hope that that body will make it possible to make substantial progress on the way to general and complete disarmament, which is so strongly desired by the international community but which still remains a distant goal.\n123.\tThat goal could be brought closer if everyone sincerely considered peace to be a fundamental and natural requirement of man. In order to be able t > disarm, it is necessary to desire peace. To desire peace is to renounce struggles for prestige, the thirst for hegemony, the arms race and the threat or use of force; it is to resort to peaceful means for the settlement of international disputes. This means that general and complete disarmament will only be possible as the result of a profound transformation of our mentalities and our concepts of relations among peoples and nations.\n124.\tUntil that transformation takes place we shall see a constant growth in military expenditures throughout the world. Those expenditures, as is known, have now reached the astronomical figure of $400 billion per year. What waste that represents in the face of the wretchedness, the disease, the poverty, the famine and the ignorance of more than two thirds of the population of the globe, before the haggard eyes of so many thousands of famished children; and what irresponsibility!\n125.\tPresident Houphouet-Boigny has said, \\\"Man has gone to the moon, but he still does not know how to make a tree or a bird-song\\\".\n126.\tIs it not time for the achievements of science and technology, as well as enormous human and material resources, finally to be oriented towards life and progress rather than towards death and destruction?\n127.\tOne is scandalized when one is not revolted to see the revenues of the inhabitants of the developed countries growing at a much more rapid pace than those of the citizens of the developing countries.\n128.\tIndeed, the change in the world economic system is typified by an alarming and asymmetrical contrast whereby the rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer and getting even further bogged down in their wretchedness.\n129.\tThis calls urgently for the establishment of the new international economic order, which has been spoken of at such great length but the implementation of which has not yet gone beyond the stage of good intentions.\n130.\tThe Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order adopted at the sixth special session of our Assembly in 1974 [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)J and the resolution on development and international economic co-operation adopted at the seventh special session in 1975 [resolution 3362(S-VI)] which laid down the principle of the restructuring of international economic relations have not been followed by any concrete measures that might have satisfied our aspirations and hopes.\n131.\tThe Ivory Coast hopes that the thirty-third session will make it possible to resume the North-South dialogue at the level of the competent authorities and, in particular, that the Committee of the Whole will resume its work in tranquillity and play the role incumbent upon it.\n132.\tMy country hopes in the year 1979 to see substantial progress or fundamental questions relating to trade in commodities, through the adoption of the Integrated Programme; to the indebtedness of the developing countries and financial aid that the developed countries can give them; to the transfer of technology and the multilateral trade negotiations; to technical co-operation among developing countries; and to the law of the sea.\n133.\tBut this great work of restructuring the world economy must not make us overlook the special problems of the least well endowed countries. In this respect, special attention should be given to Africa, a continent that lags farthest behind economically and has enormous needs that it cannot satisfy by itself.\n134.\tThe Ivory Coast hails with great hope and deep gratitude the proposal by the President of the French Republic, Mr. Valery Giscard d'Estaing, supported by other heads of State, concerning the creation of a development fund for Africa. We hope with all our heart that the other Members of our Organization, and particularly the most developed\u2014whether of the East or West-will favourably consider this project, which answers the needs of Africa.\n135.\tHaving as its objectives the prosperity and dignity of all men, the new international economic order is an indispensable condition for the effective enjoyment of human rights by all peoples.\n136.\tAs President Houphouet Boigny has asked,\n.. what is the use of speaking of equality among citizens and of fundamental freedoms to those who have only the freedom to die of hunger, or speaking of the freedom to work to those who find no work? \\\"\nThe economic, social and cultural rights of man and of societies are inseparable from the civil and political rights of the individual. Development must be conceived of in an integral way. It is necessary to guarantee to all men decent living conditions and free access to education, work, information and culture.\n137.\tThese are our positions with regard to the problems to which I have just referred. They give expression to Ivory Coast's devotion to peace and friendly co-operation with all countries, without exception, to the exclusion of none, with respect for their individual choices and the sovereign commitments of each, and its unshakeable will and determination to resort to dialogue for the settlement of all disputes. They are inspired by faith in human destiny and by a supreme goal\u2014the happiness of man in peace, dignity, justice and liberty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

His outstanding qualities and personality are widely known and justly appreciated, and his presence here bears witness to the appreciation of his erudition and experience. The delegation of the Republic of Honduras congratulates Mr. Lievano and pledges its fullest cooperation in the discharge of his lofty responsibilities.\n296.\tSimilarly, we wish to express our thanks to Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia and to praise his dynamic leadership. He presided with admirable competence and firmness not only at the thirty-second session but also at the eighth, ninth and tenth special sessions of the General Assembly concerning the stationing of peace-keeping forces in Lebanon, the question of Namibia and disarmament, respectively. We are all witness to the fact that his devotion and political vision helped to enhance the positive results achieved through his conduct of our deliberations.\n297.\tI am also happy to congratulate, on behalf of my Government and on my own behalf, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General, for his unremitting efforts in pursuit of peace, security and international co-operation. It is only fair, likewise, to express to Mr. Waldheim our warmest thanks for his report on the work of the Organization [A/33/1], which sets out in a simple and clear manner the details of all that was discussed and resolved in this Organization for the benefit of the international community last year.\n298.\tWe wish to extend a cordial welcome to Solomon Islands on the occasion of its admission as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of our Organization.\n299.\tFully aware of the paramount importance of the arms question, my country attended the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, which was held in the first half of this year.\n300.\tDisarmament and security are decisive factors for the establishment of peace, by virtue of the fact that the possession of a military arsenal by one State presupposes the obligation for another State or States to balance forces, not because they nurture any ulterior or secret intentions of committing aggression, but because of their fear of being attacked without warning, which would place them at a disadvantage as regards the defence of their territorial integrity and the safeguarding of their sovereignty. At the special session on disarmament31 the delegation of Honduras analysed this threatening situation, which by creating fears and misgivings among States compels them to start or speed up the arms race which, in a way, forms a threshold to the logical outbreak of war.\n301.\tWe have stated and continue to demonstrate through deeds and not with slogans devoid of sincerity that Honduras has the proud stature of a pacifist nation which struggles to achieve the harmony of nations, is totally opposed to war and advocates the proper application of international law.\n302.\tIt is painful to think that products of. man's intelligence and the astounding technology he has created\ncan be a constant danger to coexistence in the world unless a barrier of common sense is placed in the way of the warmongers.\n303.\tI believe it necessary to pose a number of questions with respect to disarmament and security. These subjects will be inexhaustible until such time as we can devise a formula that reconciles them in order to achieve, not a balance of forces, but the express and binding commitment to renounce force on the basis of new international mechanisms and to limit the arms race, which, as is only logical, consumes the capital of the powerful States and renders the poor countries poorer since the acquisition of modern offensive and defensive weapons represents a constant drain on national resources.\n304.\tDuring the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament the delegation of Honduras emphatically stated that we cannot continue to live in the situation of uncertainty and fears represented by the existence of armed peace, of a precarious peace. One false step from that dangerous threshold would plunge us into the holocaust so much feared by all but senselessly encouraged, no doubt involuntarily, by a few. We live the bitter reality that man can unleash massive explosions capable of annihilating the human species.\n305.\tIn spite of this, this world body on repeated occasions has been the forum in which we have heard speakers who apparently have forgotten the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and which were conceived to bring peoples together, not to divide them . Those principles were laid down for a world society which, having fought in and witnessed the greatest war of all, aspires to a convergence of goals and action which would remove the suspicion, hostility and atavism that still regrettably turn men into wolves towards each other.\n306.\tPeace will be achieved and preserved only if all those of us who gather here are ready to adopt the international machinery that will serve as the unequivocal guarantee of the security of our peoples.\n307.\tThe United Nations is called upon to play a special role Li disarmament matters; its participation must be active and vigorous, since otherwise it will be unable to fulfil the precepts enshrined in the San Francisco Charter.\n308.\tOur delegation to the special session devoted to disarmament supported in particular a Programme of Action whose final objective was to be general and complete disarmament under effective international control, so as to ensure man's survival by eliminating the danger of war and the holocaust of nuclear war. My Government believes that the adoption at that session of the Declaration and Programme of Action on Disarmament [resolution S-10/2, sects. II and III] constituted an important milestone in the ceaseless struggle of peaceful peoples to maintain and ensure peace in the world. In spite of the short-comings of the Final Document, we must emphasize the importance of \\\"the negotiating machinery established therein. This machinery will allow for more representative participation in negotiations for a disarmament programme\nas well as the exercise of greater influence to persuade the nuclear Powers to assume wider responsibilities.\n309.\tHonduras continues to nourish the hope that greater and more rapid results will be achieved in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States of America and the Soviet Union as well as in the negotiations for the reduction of forces in Europe by all the States directly concerned.\n310.\tMy country attaches special significance to the historic and all-important Declaration of Ayacucho, subscribed to by eight sister Republics on our continent on 9 December 1974, which states:\n\\\"We undertake to promote and support the building of a[n.. .J order of international peace and co-operation and to create the conditions which will make possible the effective limitation of armaments and an end to their acquisition for offensive purposes, so that all possible resources may be devoted to the economic and social development of every country in Latin America.\\\"32\n311.\tOn this occasion we reaffirm our unshakable readiness to participate in any conference designed to ensure the practical application as soon as possible through specific measures of the principles contained in that important Declaration, principles which were ratified in the Washington Declaration of 22 June 1978.\n312.\tHonduras attended the Latin American and Caribbean Preliminary Meeting on Conventional Weapons, held in Mexico City between 21 and 25 August last. On that occasion we took part in the meeting in the same spirit that led us to support the Declaration of Ayacucho.\n313.\tThe Government of Honduras is convinced, moreover, that any disarmament measure should be accompanied by the maintenance of the levels of defence and security to which all States are legitimately entitled and that, in order to make progress towards the conclusion of a treaty on the limitation of conventional weapons, full account must be taken of the fact that it is necessary also to strengthen the procedures for the peaceful settlement of international disputes.\n314.\tMy Government shares the concern of other States Members of this Organization about the proliferation of nuclear technology, especially when it occurs in sensitive areas where, owing to the existing political problems, it could well give rise to armed conflicts of incalculable dimensions. Nevertheless, Honduras is aware of the fact that, in view of the paucity and eventual exhaustion of traditional energy resources, nuclear energy should be used for peaceful purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the mechanisms likely to facilitate the peaceful use of that energy in conditions of security and open co-operation and in good faith on the part of the members of the international community.\n315.\tHonduras favours the continuation of special studies to define further the relationship that exists between the\nreduction of military budgets and development, in particular in order to achieve the gradual but effective transfer of the resources released by disarmament measures to increased assistance for the promotion of the economic progress of the developing countries.\n316.\tMy Government has been advocating the improvement of institutional and legal means available to States for application to situations which seriously threaten international peace and security and has vehemently insisted that the future of mankind depends on the conclusion of agreements which reconcile the various interests at play in the international community. Honduras professes its faith in continued negotiation and in compliance with the decisions of the international bodies of which it is a member, because it believes that the most important thing for a people is to live in peace and security and that, if efforts devoted to particular negotiations do not suffice to eliminate forever the spectre of war in relations between States, room must be made for the action of international bodies and institutions which might assist in the achievement of the desired goals of harmony and peaceful coexistence between nations.\n317.\tWe are still experiencing difficulties in our attempts to provide the United Nations with sufficiently effective supporting instruments for the preservation and restoration of peace.\n318.\tIn line with the pacifist spirit of the people and the Government of Honduras, to which I referred earlier, we share the view that United Nations peace-keeping forces are necessary and that in emergency situations we will encounter greater difficulties unless we universally accept the principle of the need to establish them and to share in financing them. For the sake of peace, we must reach an understanding facilitating the  rapid contribution of funds, resources and equipment, as well as the establishment of a contingency reserve or, at least, a preventive system to which we could resort rapidly, if necessary, for the maintenance or restoration of peace.\n319.\tRecent events in' the Republic of Nicaragua have aroused great concern among the people and the Government of Honduras. The geographical proximity of that country to our own, and the historic, cultural and human ties that bind us, as well as the economic links of Nicaragua with Honduras, have increased our concern over the distressing events generated by the political situation.\n320.\tSince the very first moment of the crisis the position of the Government of Honduras has been based on the most absolute respect for the principles and norms at present governing relations between States. We have maintained our unshakable determination not to intervene in the internal affairs of other States, to uphold the principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States as well as to provide our disinterested assistance to all those requesting humanitarian aid from the people and Government of Honduras.\n321.\tAt the very beginning of the crisis we welcomed with interest Costa Rica's initiative on the understanding that an offer of friendly co-operation, to assist in resolving the Nicaraguan crisis through peaceful means did not violate\nthe principles that govern our international conduct, and that in so doing we would be contributing to the cause of peace and harmony in the Central American region.\n322.\tSubsequent events made it impossible for that initiative to crystallize, and we supported the convening of a Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of States members-of the OAS, which we thought provided the best forum in which to resolve this type of situation in the light of the fact that the problem was extending to other States of the region. There was no possible course other than action by the continental body t. achieve those objectives that were then impossible at the Central American level.\n323.\tWe attended that Meeting of Consultation prompted by a spirit of regional solidarity, and we endeavoured to ensure that the Seventeenth Meeting of Consultation of American Ministers for Foreign Affairs would produce decisions that would help to moderate the Nicaraguan conflict and its implications at the international level. We know that the resolution adopted by that body34 has not satisfied the whole of Central American public opinion, yet that was the view of the majority of members of the OAS, and we believe that it can help positively in the endeavours still being made to solve the problems besetting the area.\n324.\tThe States of America as well as all States on earth must face the international reality that was created by States themselves. Especially in situations such as that prevailing in Nicaragua, some States would want to go further than the structure of the present-day international world permits. However, when the time comes for the adoption of decisions, and when we come to judge their effectiveness, we must face realities rather than desires.\n325.\tThe Seventeenth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers for Foreign Affairs will remain open until we achieve a definitive solution of the situation that has arisen in the Central American area, and therefore at any time it may adopt new resolutions which, since they will fall within the juridical and institutional context of America, may make it possible to safeguard the values that underlie the system of co-operation and friendship we have struggled to establish in our America.\n326.\tFinally I wish to refer to the situation of the 8,000 Nicaraguan refugees Honduras has received in its territory in order to provide them with humanitarian assistance. I wish to express my gratitude for the rapid, effective assistance provided to the Honduran Red Cross by the United Nations and in particular its specialized bodies such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Food Programme, as well as those friendly Governments and intergovernmental and private institutions in other States.\n327.\tLast year, at the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly, I stated that Honduras and El Salvador were about to initiate a mediation procedure that might lead to the restoration of peace and the relations of\nfriendship that should exist between our two peoples. I am happy to announce that both States are carrying out the written procedures envisaged in the mediation, a stage that should come to an end in January 1979. Following that, we shall for a period engage in direct oral negotiations that will be attended by the distinguished Peruvian jurist Mr. Jose Luis Bustamente Rivero, who. was appointed mediator in that conflict.\n328.\tOn this occasion, as on previous occasions, Honduras is bending every effort to resolve fully and for ever those questions still outstanding between our. two States. We would have liked to make more rapid progress in our direct negotiations during the first stages of mediation, and although that has not been possible we trust that during the first half of next year we shall make resolute progress towards the achievement of agreements on those questions that are still in dispute.\n329.\tHonduras is profoundly concerned by the fact that the conflict between the two nations has been prolonged for so long. That is why we request the co-operation of all countries gathered here, especially the Latin American States, and ask them to assist in and recognize our efforts to overcome the existing situation, which undoubtedly hampers normal development of the relations that should exist between the members of the international community. May we also express our special gratitude to those sister Republics that at this rostrum have expressed their hope for the satisfactory conclusion of the procedure we have adopted.\n330.\tHonduras, a country that is a friend of Lebanon, cannot but again express its concern at the prolongation of the fratricidal struggle that is destroying a prosperous country and Seriously threatening the social and economic welfare of its inhabitants.\n331.\tOur country expresses its best wishes for the success of the initiative of President El-Sadat and now urges the Governments of Israel and Egypt to redouble their efforts and persevere in the quest for the course that will lead to the restoration of peace, while enabling other interested parties in the region to participate in the full settlement of the dispute that so seriously affects the security of the region and has been doing so for three decades.\n332.\tWe followed with the closest attention the Camp David meetings and we hope that the resultant agreements may be extended, giving the Palestinian population the opportunity to express its will in keeping with its best interests. Honduras has always maintained that, however remote national positions may appear to be, no international conflict can remain unsolved indefinitely. This is a principle my country has unreservedly applied in its international relations, and it invites other Governments confronting international problems to do so also.\n333.\tWe note with great disappointment that there has been no substantial progress in the negotiations between representatives of the two Cypriot communities and that the passage of time favours territorial division and undoubtedly gives advantages to those who use force.\n334.\tWe wish to reiterate our support for the maintenance of the territorial integrity, independence and non-alignment of Cyprus as the best guarantee of peace in the region. We repudiate the use of force and trust that equitable solutions will be found in the interest of the populations involved.\n335.\tThe lack of more rapid action in Rhodesia has led, with the passage of time, to a deterioration of the possibility of an agreed settlement, something the international community has so anxiously awaited. The so-called internal settlement, which from the beginning did not have sufficient political acceptance, appears to have created new difficulties, and we see the breaking-down of the negotiating structure that might have allowed us to expect more favourable results in respect of the establishment of a majority Government and the early independence of Zimbabwe.\n336.\tThe recrudescence of indiscriminate military action and particular cruelty has also served the worst designs of the partisans of apartheid and the repression of the Rhodesian people.\n337.\tHonduras considers that the Security Council should consider this problem anew and seek the agreement of the parties concerned without interference by Powers outside the African continent and without weakening the effect of the economic sanctions imposed on the illegal regime.\n338.\tDespite the latest events, we believe that tie re are favourable prospects for the independence of Namibia. The acceptance by the parties of the so-called Western Powers' plan36 and their influence in the corresponding resolution of the Security Council, resolution 435 (1978), open the way for the holding of free elections guaranteed by the United Nations.\n339.\tWe are very happy at the role played in this process of pacification by the General Assembly and recall in particular the debates of the ninth special session of the General Assembly and the adoption by it of a comprehensive resolution [resolution S-9/2J which supports the just and legitimate struggle of the people of Namibia for their independence, while establishing greater assistance for the Namibians. Honduras, from this the greatest world forum, expresses its solidarity with the just struggle of the people of Namibia.\n340.\tWith respect to the outstanding dispute between Guatemala and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the Territory of Belize, I wish to express the unchanging position of my country in support of a negotiated settlement of the problem, in accordance with the procedures for the peaceful settlement of international disputes, and without side-stepping historic and juridical antecedents in which the rights of the Guatemalans are based, as well as the interests of the people of Belize, with which my country has maintained relations of true friendship and growing economic relations.\n341.\tThe world economy in this past year has registered no marked improvement that enables us to be optimistic\nwith respect to the immediate future. We regret that the Tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of GATT should not have yielded the expected results. We are also concerned at the growing protectionist trends that we see in many sectors of the developed economies. For the countries of the third world, all of the foregoing makes it much more difficult for them to promote the task of economic and social development of their peoples. It is for this reason that we have supported the unpostponable establishment of the new international economic order which would promote the full development of the countries of the third world. This has become an even more urgent necessity in view of the recent evolution and future prospect of international monetary relations and the consequential increase in the cost of primary commodities, machinery and equipment for the developing countries.\n342.\tThat new international order should be based on equity, the common interest of all and co-operation between all States, with full respect for their sovereignty. The survey that the member States of ECLA set forth in its resolution 372 (XVII) of May 19773 7 when assessing at the regional level the application of the International Development Strategy is still valid. That study tended, inter alia, to seek action to promote negotiations on commodities; obtain formulas to enable the developed countries to comply before 1980 with the undertaking to provide a minimum of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product as official aid to developing countries; the removal of obstacles to the expansion of important manufactures in Latin America; the creation of appropriate mechanisms to facilitate the transfer of technology in adequate conditions; and the effective participation of Latin America in the decision-making processes in the monetary, financial and commercial forums.\n343.\tOur Government is, moreover, extremely concerned at the standstill in the work of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 and would urge developed countries to concur with the Group of 77, both in the reaffirmation of its mandate and in the supervision and promotion of negotiations that have begun in various forums. My country is ready to assist in such action. The world community asks of all Governments that they take realistic, beneficial. action to promote international cooperation and the economic and social development of the third world.\n344.\tThe Government of the Republic of Honduras believes firmly in development as. the basis of peace and is making a series of efforts to consolidate a stage of economic growth and social welfare. Special mention should be made of a draft for a project for the Olancho Forestry Industrial Corporation, the Cajon hydroelectric project and the expansion of our port infrastructure. My country has every hope that those projects will decisively help to give new impetus to our economic development and to promote the social well-being of thousands of Hondurans.\n345.\tWe must emphasize the valuable co-operation we have received in those plans from the Government and\npeople of Venezuela, which, together with other friendly countries and international institutions, are at present helping some countries which, like Honduras, are making every effort to promote their development and need external financial assistance. For that expression of genuine solidarity, I wish from this universal body to express our gratitude to the Government and the brotherly people of Venezuela.\n346.\tI cannot fail to mention the importance that Honduras attaches to co-operation between the countries of Central America, especially for the forms of economic integration laid down and based on the principle of the just distribution of costs and benefits. Under these premises, my country is ready to continue to participate widely in the restructuring of the Central American Common Market.\n347.\tThe international policy of Honduras is based unequivocally on friendship with all peoples. In this connexion, we are interested in and ready to co-operate with all the developing countries.\n348.\tCo-operation between countries with similar problems should be increased, since together we can more effectively face up to the conditions of the international economy which today are so adverse to us.\n349.\tOn the other hand, my Government attaches particular importance to the results of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held last month in Buenos Aires, and we sincerely hope and trust that both the industrialized Western countries and the planned-economy countries will give real effective and disinterested assistance for the programmes that were drawn up at that Conferences.\n350.\tWe wish to emphasize that Honduras sincerely wants greater support to be given to UNICEF, convinced as we are that the best reserve for the noble purposes and ideals of each and every one of our nations lies fundamentally in the attention and care that we offer our children, while creating stimulus for solidarity and eliminating the scourge of malnutrition, illiteracy and physical abuse.\n351.\tThe year 1979 has been declared the International Year of the Child, and my country would advocate an increase in national and international projects and programmes designed to solve the very serious and important problems confronting the world's children. We must unite our efforts so as to ensure protection of children within the priority tasks of this Organization.\n352.\tHonduras has the keenest interest in a more just order for the seas and oceans. Bearing in mind that in future years we shall have to resort more frequently to the sea as an important source of food-stuffs and mineral resources, the rational exploitation of the seas is an important objective of my Government.\n353 On the other hand, while the results of the negotiations at the seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea were not spectacular, we believe that there are possibilities for a treaty of universal acceptance designed to favour the co-operative exploitation of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond national jurisdiction, so as to avoid the unnecessary sources of conflict which would be inherent in unilateral actions such as those announced and which would finally only weaken the solidarity that should exist between nations and the solemn commitment assumed in this Assembly in the Declaration of Principles of 1970.\n354.\tLast September Honduras became the fourth State to deposit with the Secretary-General of the OAS the instrument of ratification of the American Convention on Human Rights. The entry into force of that Convention is to us a reason for great satisfaction and my Government will give its complete support and co-operation in the rapid establishment of the bodies advocated in that instrument. With such a procedure the Government of Honduras seeks to emphasize the importance it attaches to this subject.\n355.\tWe are in favour of a detailed analysis of the situation of human rights in the world, bearing in mind the close relationship that exists between under-development and respect for human rights. This year we are commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and as we remember its adoption we think that any international action in this field should take into account the fact that there can be no possible respect for human rights if the present international economic relations remain unchanged. Our fulfilment of the most elementary duties in respect of human rights implies the ineluctable need to introduce substantial changes in the conditions at present governing the international economic system. United Nations action in this field should not be limited to the ascertainment of particular violations of human rights, for the most part motivated by political considerations. Hunger is as tragic as torture, and it is not the drama of human pain that establishes the feelings of a whole people or of an era. My country firmly believes that this problem should be tackled at its roots and here is a responsibility that the industrialized and the developing countries alike must share.\n356.\tWe believe that the United Nations can play an important part, and for that reason we support the initiative of Costa Rica for the creation of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, convinced as we are that such a machinery would be of particular importance for the promotion of and respect for human rights.\n357.\tMy Government profoundly regrets that in the present circumstances the policy of apartheid should still exist. Such a practice is a denial of the noble principle of peoples concerning the dignity of man as enshrined in the San Francisco Charter. That is why the Government and people of Honduras strongly condemn discriminatory practices based on racial considerations. On this occasion we reiterate our full support for all international action designed to eliminate this unjust practice from the face of the earth.\n358.\tWe firmly believe in the purposes and objectives of the United Nations and my Government considers that only through joint action at the political, social and economic\n38 Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof, beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction (resolution 2749 (XXV)).\nlevels shall we find the road to peace, to which we all aspire. We feel, moreover, that these lofty purposes will not be achieved if the developing countries maintain the attitude of mere spectators of the great problems afflicting mankind. We could be a decisive factor in all these world events if we abandoned, once and for all, our passive attitude and resolved to assume the role that history has bestowed on us. That change of attitude must be preceded by signs of effective co-operation and not by confrontation. The industrialized nations must join with us in a common and vigorous effort towards peace and development.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n1.\tMr. President, may I congratulate you warmly on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I should like to thank the outgoing President, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, and also our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for another successful year at the helm of our Organization.\n2.\tThe two greatest threats to international peace and security are the unresolved problems of the Middle East and southern Africa.\n3.\tOn the Middle East, I wish to reiterate Singapore's position. First, we believe that the Government of Israel must recognize the right of the Palestinians to a homeland of their own and that the Palestinians must recognize the State of Israel and respect its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Secondly, we believe that the issue of borders must be settled by negotiation on the basis of the principles of non-acquisition of territory by the use of force and the rights of States to live within secure and recognized borders. Thirdly, we remain convinced that Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) provide the framework for an over-all settlement of the problems of the Middle East. We ..welcome the two agreements concluded between President El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Begin of Israel at Camp David as being a step forward. The two leaders have shown great courage. They deserve our support and commendation. We wish also to pay a tribute to President Carter of the United States for his remarkable statesmanship.\n4.\tOn the question of Namibia, we are dismayed by the decisions of the Government of South Africa to reject the\n1 A Framework for Peace in the Middle East. Agreed at Camp David, and Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty -between Egypt and Israel, signed at Washington on 17 September 1978.\nproposals of the Secretary-General2 and to hold elections in Namibia without United Nations involvement. We hope that the new Government of South Africa will reverse those decisions and resume co-operation with the United Nations for the peaceful transition of Namibia to independence.\n5.\tOn Zimbabwe, we hope the time for a peaceful transition to majority rule has not run out. We make an urgent appeal to the United Kingdom, the United States and the front-line States to make one last effort to bring about a negotiated settlement acceptable to all the parties involved. As for South Africa, unless the abhorrent system of apartheid is rapidly dismantled, the prospects of a bloody racial confrontation will become inevitable.\n6.\tReflecting on the sorry state of our contemporary world, Antonio Gramsci, and Italian Communist ideologue, offered humanity this piece of advice: \\\"We need\\\", he said, \\\"the pessimism of the intelligence and the optimism of the will.\\\"\n7.\tI can think of no better formula for survival for humanity. It is one that I would commend to this Organization and to political leaders who are also statesmen. I have therefore attempted in this address to reflect the necessary spirit of hopeful pessimism about human prospects. Though the United Nations was formed for the specific purpose of addressing itself to the problems of humanity as a whole, in practice most of us have generally avoided manifesting any earnestness about humanity lest we be thought somewhat eccentric and unpragmatic.\n8.\tSo I hope members will bear with me if for a change I dedicate this address to the cause of global problems.\n9.\tI begin with a quotation from a speech by a man we all knew well and who cannot be charged with having been intemperate in either his choice of words or his expression of ideas, the late U Thant, for many years our Secretary- General:\n\\\"I can only conclude from the information that is available to me as Secretary-General that the Members of the United Nations have perhaps ten years left in which to subordinate their ancient quarrels and launch a global partnership to curb the arms race, to improve the human environment, to defuse the population explosion, and to supply the required momentum to world development efforts. If such a global partnership is not forged within the next decade, then I very much fear that the problems I have mentioned will have reached such staggering \nproportions, that they will be beyond our capacity to control.\\\"\n10.\tThat speech was made in 1969. The 10-year respite he gave for mankind to put its house in order will expire next year. None of us can honestly say that the links of a global partnership have been strengthened in the intervening years. On the contrary, the evidence points strongly to a contrary process. The presumed partnership between the rich North and the poorer South is even more tenuous than it was in the early days of the United Nations when the rich were more forthcoming in helping the needy nations to\\\" be less poor.\n11.\tAs for U Thant's hope that what he called \\\"ancient quarrels\\\" would disappear, there has been not only a more vigorous revival of ancient feuds since 1969 but also the proliferation of new enmities. The arenas for these expanding contests are almost wholly in the third world. According to the SIPRI World Armaments and Disarmament Year Book for 1976, there have been, between 1945 and 1975, in all 119 civil and international wars, involving the territory of 69 States-that is, nearly half the United Nations' membership-and the armed forces of 81 nations. There have also been more than 300 coups and attempted coups in the third world during the same period. Moreover, the authors of the year book also estimate that these wars have killed more people than did the Second World War,\n12.\tHas the arms race abated since 1969? Has the tenth special session of the General Assembly, which was devoted to disarmament, had any visible impact on the arms race? The answer to both questions is unfortunately in the negative. From 1970 to 1978 world military expenditures increased from $200 billion to the current $400 billion. After allowing for price inflation, the world's military spending has increased at an annual rate of 15 per cent. From 1970 to 1978 the total strength of the world's armed forces increased from 21 million to 23 million; exports of major weapons to third world countries reached an estimated $8 billion annually, in constant 1975 dollars, almost three times such exports in 1970; and the strategic nuclear stockpiles of the United States and the Soviet Union increased by 8,000 to a total of 14,000 war-heads. Governed by these facts and figures, one is driven to the inescapable conclusion that, to borrow U Thant's words, the \\\"mad momentum of the arms race\\\" continues unabated.\n13.\tAs for defusing the population explosion, though there has been deceleration of population growth in some of the developing countries, generally the situation is worse. Most developing countries are caught in a bind in which even a most dramatic upsurge in the economy would be negated by a still higher rise in population.\n14.\tThe old belief that the vast untapped resources of the earth and technological miracles could cope with any population increase has been in recent years shattered by contrary evidence. There are, we now realize, limits to technological miracles. The planet's resources are finite and we cannot sustain life beyond those limits. There is considerable evidence to support the view that we have come dangerously close to those limits.\n15.\tUntil about 1972 food prospects for the world looked moderately hopeful. The population rose steadily by about 2 per cent annually, but it was hoped that this would be offset by a 3 per cent increase in food output,\n16.\tGreat hopes were placed in the so-called miracle rice developed in the Philippines and on the high-yielding wheat strains developed in Mexico. But that optimism turned out to be short-lived. In 1972, for a variety of complex reasons, total food production fell for the first time in more than 20 years.\n17.\tWe now realize that the comforting statistics of earlier years concealed a number of unpleasant facts about world grain production. The food demands of the third world were met less by the output of the developing countries themselves than by the increased output of wealthy countries like the United States, Canada, Australia and Argentina. Those countries were able to do this because their farming was on a vast scale, highly scientific, highly capitalized and highly organized. It was also energy- intensive so that, say, one American farmer could feed 57 people whereas a farmer in a developing country would be hard put to it to feed his own family.\n18.\tUnfortunately, the production processes of those few advanced agricultural grain producers involving the use of fertilizer, machinery, freight, processing, marketing and pumping for irrigation depended on one crucial product: cheap oil. And we all know that suddenly and unexpectedly the era of cheap oil came to an end, and with it hopes of cheap food.\n19.\tThe rise in the price of oil has invariably made for dearer grain. Let me add that in stating this fact I am not giving credence to the somewhat misleading thesis that dearer oil is at the root of the global economic crisis, including the food crisis. The drift towards world recession and inflation had begun well before the rise in the price of oil.\n20.\tSo the prospects for developing countries of maintaining steady growth\\\" simultaneously with a population explosion are pretty bleak. Because the resources of the earth are finite, both rich and poor nations must now reshape plans for economic growth on the basis that mankind has entered an age of resource scarcity. We must develop, therefore, new economic life-styles.\n21.\tMankind, in particular in the affluent North, has been consuming raw materials at a rate which could leave posterity with little or nothing. The contemporary attitude of what is called in the West the \\\"consumer society\\\" to the warnings of the ecologists is best summed up in a quip by the American comedian, Groucho Marx, in connection with another matter: \\\"So what? \\\" he said. \\\"What has posterity done for me? \\\" Gun technology has made it possible for the first time in human history for one generation to deprive future generations of their due inheritance. For example, there is considerable evidence to show that at current rates of growth raw materials like aluminium, lead, manganese, nickel, tungsten and platinum could be exhausted within a century and copper, silver, sine and mercury within 50 years, that is, within the lifetime of most of us; The only consolation offered is that we would have enough iron to last us for the next 150 years.\n22.\tThe biggest consumers of world resources are the nations of the North. They consume nine-tenths of the world's oil output, most of its minerals, four-fifths of its fertilizers and three-fourths of its fish catch. The average Northerner consumes perhaps 50 times more of the world's resources than the average consumer k a developing country. All these estimates would have to be revised drastically should the third world, the deprived two-thirds of humanity, start consuming at even half the Northern rate. For & start, so I am informed, should this happen, nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers, among other things, would run out within a few generations.\n23.\tSome people look with hope to the oceans to provide the resources the earth is incapable of providing in the near future. As I will attempt to show in a moment, this, too, may turn out to be an illusion. Going on the available evidence, the oceans of the world, too, must be listed in the category of endangered environment.\n24.\tSo long as our economic activities are directed towards satisfying human greed rather than human needs there is no way of reversing wasteful consumption of the earth's resources. To avert it, we need to recover the traditional reverence mankind has always had for what it calls \\\"Mother Earth\\\". Our attitude to it today is more akin to, more like, that of the locust swarm which consumes without conserving.\n25.\tI therefore commend an old farmer's saying as suggesting a possible way out of our dilemma. \\\"One should live\\\", so the saying goes, \\\"as if one would die tomorrow, and farm as if one would live for ever\\\". This is the essence of ecology in one simple, irrefutable sentence.\n26.\tI referred a short while ago to the hopes that the ocean will be the new economic frontier. After all, the ocean covers some 70 per cent of the earth's surface and must contain enough untapped resources to sustain a permanent age of affluence for all mankind, or so it is hoped.\n27.\tSensibly treated, the oceans can no doubt add considerably to our resources. But then, so could the earth if economics became a science of balancing consumption and conservation, which at the moment it is not.\n28.\tIn 1969 some 63 million metric tons of fish came from the sea. This is estimated to be approximately one- fifth of what the ocean can yield. The catch can be tripled within a short time without damage to the ocean provided fishing methods are changed. At the moment fish are hunted down. We \\\"catch\\\" fish, we do not \\\"farm\\\" fish. We have yet to move from the hunting stage to a farming stage in respect of the sea, Given the modern technology of fishing it is more than possible, if there are no restraints, that within a short time fish resources could be so depleted as to preclude our ever being able to move to a fanning stage, to look to the ocean to provide us with alternative sources of food. Unfortunately for mankind, fish, despite their small brains, are global in outlook and habits. They migrate freely in an ocean without frontiers. We may divide the oceans of the world into the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, but fish and other sea organisms less intelligent than we are see only a single body of water over 300 million cubic miles in volume in which to roam freely. They follow the ocean currents, which also move without regard to national frontiers. A species of fish may spawn in one part of the ocean and graze in another hundreds or thousands of miles away. The bountifulness of marine life is conditional upon what we humans, too, until recently accepted as the freedom of the seas.\n29.\tNow that we have abandoned this concept in favour of territorial frontiers on the sea it is problematical whether the oceans will be as rich in marine resources as they have been. Unless we can persuade fish to cultivate strong national loyalties the chain of life in the oceans could be broken. Excessive harvesting at one point of the ocean, or the disruption of the migratory routes, or the destruction of the spawning grounds of fish through pollution or other causes could soon deplete the organic wealth of the seas. Because of the close interdependence of marine life, an act by one nation within its territorial waters could destroy the vital assets of other nations thousands of miles away.\n30.\tApart from being a source of food, the ocean is a photosynthesizer that provides 70 per cent of the world's oxygen supply, the basis of all living life. Ocean currents follow established patterns and convey immense quantities of heat and moisture thousands of miles, and in the process regulate the climate from the equator to the poles. It is also a highway for world trade, provided free by nature for all nations. A carve-up of the oceans into sovereign zones could disrupt the global function oceans have performed from time immemorial.\n31.\tMoreover, even as we debate how the oceans should be divided, we, mankind, are also gradually converting them into global sewers. The oceans are now recipients of millions of tons of industrial waste and poisonous chemicals discharged by increasingly polluted rivers as well as by oil slicks, which are likely to multiply through unregulated oil exploration and sea mining. Here, too, these pollutants, like the sea creatures they have already killed off by the thousands, move without regard to frontiers to injure the culprits as well as nations not responsible for these offences.\n32.\tNot only the sea, but soil, forests, rivers and the atmosphere itself are being progressively degraded. All these constitute the basics for any kind of life on earth-what ecologists call the \\\"biosphere\\\".\n33.\tThe problems I have dwelt upon so far are problems that transcend national frontiers and, if left unresolved, will, as the pessimists prophesy, bring disaster on all nations-the developed and the developing, the rich and the poor.\n34.\tIs such a disaster inevitable? It is only inevitable if we refuse to face the facts that make it inevitable. We, not the stars, are the authors of the human predicament. Since we are the authors, we can rewrite the story to make for a happier ending.\n35.\tHow can we do this? I revert to the speech by U Thant that I quoted earlier. Only by entering into a true \\\"global partnership\\\", as he called it, to cope with ever- accumulating global problems can we resolve these seemingly intractable problems.\n36.\tBut, given the intensity of contemporary nationalism, some would argue, it is not pragmatic to suggest approaches that require constraints on national interests on behalf of global interests. On the contrary, I believe that the global approach is the only pragmatic policy in a shrunken world.\n37.\tThe authoritative definition of pragmatism is the adoption of ideas, policies and proposals which are \\\"useful, workable and practical\\\". In other words, pragmatic policies, must produce the desired results, and the whole of my address has been devoted to showing that, so far, policies based on narrow national interests not only have failed to resolve national problems but also are helpless before the accretion of the global problems that threaten us all.\n38.\tHowever, I take courage from the fact that narrow nationalism is already being undermined by the counter- forces of globalism. Even where this is not acknowledged publicly, quiet concessions are in practice made to globalism as a pragmatic convenience. The three major bastions of national sovereignty\u2014autonomy in respect of the national economy, culture and defence\u2014are increasingly being forced to come to terms with the reality of global interdependence. There is a growing realization that solutions to national problems have to be sought outside national frontiers. Year by year the areas where global co-operation has to be acknowledged are growing remorselessly, even though the concessions are made ungraciously.\n39.\tThis is reflected in the phenomenal growth of intergovernmental and non-governmental international organizations to co-ordinate and regulate functions of national importance. In 1910, according to the Yearbook of International Organizations, 1978s there were 250 such international organizations, by the early 1970s the number had increased to 2,500, and there must have been further additions since then. Their concerns range from commercial, industrial, financial, scientific and technological matters to co-ordinating matters relating to commodities, trade, health, aviation, shipping, communications, weights and measures and, I understand, even refrigeration.\n40.\tIn theory, it is true, we continue to behave as if, and possibly even believe that, we are sovereign, hut in practice we are increasingly caught in a web of interdependence.\n41.\tThe cumulative and incremental expansion of global partnership is a process which can avert the disasters we fear. It is a slow process; it is undirected; but it is there. 1 take comfort from the fact that all the great historic transformations in history have also occurred through cumulative increments. This is how humanity evolved from u society of hunters to a society of agriculturists, from feudalism to capitalism and socialism, from autocracies to democracies, from savagery to civilization of a sort. In none of those instances was the change instantaneous. What is now required, therefore, is leadership which allies itself with the emerging force of interdependence and speeds up its triumph.\n42.\tIt is my hope that new nations will give that leadership for the following reasons: first, they constitute the vast majority of the world's population; secondly, the burden of the worsening world crisis will bear more heavily on them than on the developed North; and, thirdly, they stand to gain the most, should human affairs be conducted on the basis of an interdependency of nations.\n43.\tWhat is really required to help the new force of globalism struggling to be born is what our Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, has referred to as the \\\"political will\\\". Although we live in an era of growing interdependence, the Governments of Member States are primarily motivated by the pursuit of national interests. The pursuit of national interests by 150 Member States does not equate with global interest. Global partnership is the only alternative to global disaster. The achievement of a global partnership will be a long and difficult task; but, for those of us who may feel intimidated by that task, I offer the following quotation from another Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold:\n\\\"Those are lost who dare not face the basic facts of international interdependence. Those are lost who permit defeats to scare them back to a starting-point of narrow nationalism. Those are lost who are so scared by a defeat as to despair about the future.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff51.\tMr. President, your unanimous election is a great tribute to you personally and to your country, with which Kenya maintains cordial relations. Kenya is proud that a distinguished son of Colombia, a country with which it has strong bonds of friendship and\ncommon aspirations, is to guide the work of the thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. My delegation is most satisfied to work under your enlightened and able leadership, and I should like to assure you of our full co-operation.\n52.\tI wish also to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to your eminent predecessor, Mr. Mojsov of Yugoslavia, who guided the work of the thirty-second session and the eighth, ninth and tenth special sessions on Lebanon, Namibia and disarmament, respectively. It was through his vast experience, wisdom and strong sense of duty that so many problems were tackled effectively. We owe him a debt of gratitude for all he did for the United Nations and the world.\nMr. Rodriguez Porth (El Salvador), Vice-President, took the Chair.\n53.\tWe wish to express our sincere appreciation to the distinguished and untiring Secretary-General and his staff for their devotion to duty and loyalty to the Organization; they have our full support in their endeavour to execute the decisions and resolutions of this Organization.\n54.\tMy delegation would also wish to congratulate Solomon Islands on its independence and on joining the community of free and sovereign States. We welcome it most sincerely as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of this Organization.\n55.\tAt this point, I would like to take a few moments to convey to this session the warm appreciation and gratitude of Mzee's family, of my President, His Excellency Mr. Daniel Arap Moi and the entire Kenyan people for the immense tributes paid to the founding Father of the Kenya nation, His Excellency Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, who passed away on 22 August 1978. In his passing away, Kenya lost not only its liberator but also its guiding light for the period since independence. We are keenly aware that, as an unyielding fighter for freedom, justice and human dignity, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta was loved by many people of the world outside Kenya's borders. While for us in Kenya the loss of the Father of our Nation has been irreparable, we are heartened by the knowledge that our grief and sorrow were shared by so many people in the world. To the many heads of State and Government, as well as leaders of delegations, who came personally to pay their last respects in Nairobi, we are truly grateful. We are equally grateful to the many thousands from all parts of the globe who sent their messages of sympathy. Not least, we are grateful to the many United Nations institutions and conferences which paid glowing tribute to our departed leader. All these expressions of sympathy have given us great comfort and hope, renewed strength and confidence in our determination to continue the policies which our great leader had laid down for us. We thank you all.\n56.\tSince the founding of the United Nations and the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples notable developments have taken place in this field. Seventy formerly colonial countries have attained independent and have taken their rightful place among the free nations of the world. We applaud the efforts and achievements of the\nOrganization. In spite of these achievements of the Organization, however, there remain a number of dependent Territories whose peoples are still struggling for their independence and self-determination. The administering Powers in these Territories have an obligation to speed up the process of decolonization with a view to ending this sorry chapter of history.\n\n57.\tIn recent years there have been many instances where external forces have made efforts to bring about annexation and fragmentation of Territories either before or after independence. These influences must be strongly condemned inasmuch as they obstruct the progress to self-determination of peoples. We urge the United Nations to stand firmly for the maintenance for each and every country of territorial borders as at the time of independence.\n58.\tWe once again call the attention of the United Nations to southern Africa, where the white racist minority regimes scandalously continue to defy United Nations resolutions and continue to deprive the black people of the region of the right to enjoy basic human rights. In all walks of life, the black people in South Africa have no say in the conduct of human affairs affecting them. Their demands for social, economic and political changes for the benefit of all the people of the region, designed to put all on an equal footing regardless of racial background, are ruthlessly suppressed. Meanwhile measures are designed and implemented for the forceful exploitation of their human and natural resources. These inhuman practices have constituted a source of tension in the region for a long time and the patience of ''he oppressed majority has been stretched to breaking-point. Thus the stage has been set for a grave threat to peace and security, with all the consequences which would ensue from a definite breach of international peace and security.\n59.\tAlthough the international community has recognized the dangers accompanying the racial policies of these regimes, recognition alone has not proved to be a sufficient deterrent to the threat to international peace and security. To avoid the dangers, we -consider the provisions contained in the Programme of Action adopted by the International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia, and the Declaration adopted by the World Conference for Action against Apartheid, and approved by the thirty-second session of the General Assembly [resolutions 32/41 and 32/105], as having the force to change the course of events in southern Africa. They must be fully and faithfully implemented by all of us if peaceful change is to come.. It is, however, our view that the execution of these action programmes has fallen far short of expectation and thus been unable adequately to shake the conscience of the racist regimes in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. My delegation wishes to reaffirm Kenya's pledge fully to observe and unswervingly implement these action programmes as best as our capabilities will permit.\n60.\tReferring specifically to South Africa, the institutionalized and deliberate practice of apartheid continues unabated. The racist regime continues further to intensify the application of its instruments of racial discrimination, segregation, separation, repression, oppression and suppression to the disadvantage of the black people of South Africa. Programmes are continually being implemented for the unending exploitation of their human and natural resources. The effectiveness of the instruments is constantly increased by the use of the weapons of terror, police brutality and intimidation, all deployed under the sanction of law. These brutal and inhuman methods are used whenever the regime can create or find its own opportunities for a show of force. The oppressed and suppressed black African people are the victims, who suffer for no other reason than that of being black people and opponents of the internationally condemned system of institutionalized racism and racial discrimination. To ensure its own survival, the regime continues wantonly to maim, imprison and murder innocent black people of South Africa and all opponents of apartheid. Its history is drenched with innocent blood and the humiliation of the black people, whose only crime is to demand their basic and inalienable rights to dignity and equality. My delegation, representing a people who fought a bloody and bitter struggle for the freedom and independence of our own country, is deeply concerned over the barbarity of the South African racist regime and over the economic encouragement it receives to maintain its oppressive systems. We note with the gravest concern that some countries still maintain economic, military and other links with the racist regime of South Africa in spite of their being party to Security Council resolution 418(1977) of 4 November 1977. We appeal to them to reconsider their position and without any reservations to adopt measures which would contribute meaningfully towards the total isolation of the racist regime and the eradication of apartheid.\n61.\tWe cannot allow ourselves to be deceived by the moves mooted by the racist regime to remove petty apartheid in public places. The regime maintains repressive policies based on the stereotyped dogma of racial superiority, in complete disregard of the principle of human equality as enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Thus, we consider such moves as clandestine endeavours to compromise our people's struggle for the attainment of full human equality both in principle and in practice. The racist Pretoria regime must be told in the most unequivocal terms that no such spurious device will serve to divert the movement to achieve freedom and dignity. Instead of its fruitless and persistent efforts to entrench and broaden apartheid, it ought to take full measures to preserve human dignity in freedom for each and all. It is only in this way that the Pretoria regime can build peace and create confidence among the people of South Africa, the rest of Africa and elsewhere, and avoid confrontation.\n62.\tThe reported preparedness of South Africa to explode a nuclear device is a matter over which we have expressed serious concern. Africa had warned against, giving South Africa any technological assistance in the field of nuclear weapons, but its warnings have unfortunately not been heeded. Similarly, Africa had warned against assistance being given to South Africa to arm itself to an extent that is obviously dangerous to peace and security in the region. All\nprevious pretensions that these arms were being given for the defence needs of South Africa have all along been unconvincing. South Africa wants to use nuclear capability and its huge arsenal of armaments to intimidate and carry out aggression against black African States and the freedom fighters of Azania. South Africa's possession and use of these weapons will not, however, deter the African fight for freedom, dignity and equality.\n63.\tIn view of the unremitting misery and deprivation inflicted upon our people in South Africa, and considering the ruthlessness of the racist regime and its scandalous defiance-of the international community, Kenya is resolved to continue its support of the liberation movements of South Africa in every way within its abilities and calls upon all others to do the same until South Africa abandons the inhuman practice and policies based on apartheid.\n64.\tThe United Nations has for many years now been seized of the question of South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia. After a protracted and bitter struggle by the liberation movement, the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], and the efforts of this body with the assistance and intervention of a group of five Western countries, it appeared that the South African regime was at last prepared to accept reality and to co-operate with the United Nations in ensuring the speedy and unimpeded transfer of power to the people of Namibia. With patience and understanding, as well as determination and foresight, members of the Security Council worked long hours, culminating in the adoption of resolutions 431 (1978) and 432 (1978) and, previously, resolution 385 (1976). I should like in particular to commend the leaders of SWAPO for having agreed, in spite of their reservations and warnings about the doubtful intentions of the South African Government, to go along with the United Nations in its efforts to organize a realistic programme for the introduction of independence in Namibia. During all these discussions, there has been evidence that the racist regime of South Africa had not entirely accepted the inevitable course of history and the impossibility of stopping the march of the Namibian people to independence. The continued registration of voters in Namibia by the Pretoria regime and their being forced to join the puppet Democratic Turnhalle Alliance; the illegal and fraudulent registering of Angolan defectors as voters in Namibia; the insistence by the regime that it retain its armed forces and police to supervise the transfer of power; the refusal to allow free pre-election political activity under supervision of the United Nations representative-all these were clear signs that the South African regime was not ready and willing to facilitate the course of orderly achievement of independence in Namibia.\n65.. The decision by Vorster to announce in his resignation speech that South Africa intended to \\\"go it alone\\\" in implementing an unacceptable and fake transfer of power in Namibia has come as a big disappointment to all of us. While it has set the clock back, this decision has also proved conclusively the impossibility of any honest and honourable dealings with the racist regime. In addition, it has proved that the racist regime, ignoring the bitter suffering which will inevitably be caused to the Namibian people, has chosen the path of armed confrontation to the end. In its obduracy and in total defiance and disregard of the United\nNations and the entire international community, the South African Government has now decided to follow a path which will only lead to further bloodshed and an increase in the threat to international peace. We the Members of the United Nations must now decide-firmly and unequivocally\u2014whether we shall condone or tolerate this dangerous and arrogant attitude in spite of the real threat it poses to international peace.\n66.\tIs the United Nations totally impotent and incapable of dealing with this recurrent defiance by the South African regime? Will international opinion and the genuine efforts of various Member States to introduce rational thinking in South Africa continue to be so casually and callously trampled on by a minority regime, which uses crude brute force to sustain itself in power? And for how long shall we continue to allow this racist clique to use the lives of the African people of Namibia as a pawn in its political game?\n67.\tMy delegation is convinced that the South African regime would not have found it so easy to defy the wishes of this body were it not for the tacit support it gets from all those Members which continue to provide it with support in technology, investments and commerce. We are convinced that the regime will always treat the decisions of this body with disrespect, as long as it believes that the application of total sanctions will not be supported by all the Members of the United Nations. It is therefore our view that the time has now come when we must all agree to the need for full mandatory sanctions against South Africa. Any more talking and adopting ineffective resolutions will only serve to highlight the weakness and impotence of this body to deal with a situation which clearly threatens peace and stability in the world today.\n68.\tIt is incumbent upon all Members of this body-now more than ever before-to afford SWAPO every assistance to continue the struggle. As time goes on the South African racist regime will be bound to succumb or be forcibly eliminated from African soil. There is no good reason whatsoever why the whites of South Africa should continue to see themselves as a special gift to Africa and to flout world opinion with impunity.\n69.\tFox the past 13 years the problem of Zimbabwe has continued to constitute a crisis of the most serious dimensions. All efforts to overcome the problem through negotiations have failed and have been replaced by expressions of hope fox another effort. It has become the practice of the illegal regime to create conditions which deceive the world into continuing to hope that a peaceful solution may be in sight, while it feverishly tries to strengthen its hold on power. In our view, there is nothing to negotiate about concerning the independence of Zimbabwe other than the modalities for the transfer of power.\n70.\tWe have recently noted pronouncements that the rebel Ian Smith was prepared to accept majority rule in Zimbabwe. Hopes ran high that at last a solution might be at hand. What has transpired has been the so-called internal settlement reached between the white racists under Ian Smith and a handful of African opportunists. The \\\"settlement\\\" - if it to be called that - has failed to bring about a cease-fire. Kenya rejected and will continue to reject the Eternal settlement arrangements as being unworkable and\n\nfruitless. A properly constituted conference in which all the liberation movements of Zimbabwe are free to participate would have been the answer, but this will become impossible with martial law in operation.\n71.\tRecent information reaching us indicates that the partners in the internal settlement are at loggerheads with one another. Ian Smith is reported to be seeking avenues to revert to the Anglo-American proposals,9 which he refused not so long ago, while the other partners are divided over the question of the Patriotic Front, whose involvement in a future conference to decide on the destiny of Zimbabwe is, in our view, essential. The Anglo-American proposals are a suitable basis for further negotiations. As far as those proposals go, Kenya accepts them as a matter of principle, but the proposals should not provide a reduction in the ultimate responsibility of the administering Power to ensure a rapid and complete transfer of power to the black majority of Zimbabwe. Our position on this issue has always been clear. We have stated on many occasions that lan Smith cannot be trusted. He and his white racist followers must be forced out of power if a peaceful settlement is ever to be achieved. Until he goes, and as long as he continues to deter progress towards Zimbabwe's freedom, Kenya will continue to support the armed struggle and the strict application of sanctions against the rebel colony.\n72.\tMy country is very concerned about the pressure which is now building up in some quarters for the recognition of the so-called internal settlement which would lead to further pressure for the lifting of United Nations sanctions against the illegal Rhodesian regime. While Africa and the world as a whole have all along been aware of the breaches by some Member States of the mandatory sanctions against Southern Rhodesia, it has been our hope that there exists an adequate consensus that the illegal regime of Ian Smith must never be given any signs of recognition. In this connexion, we have noted with dismay and disbelief the admission of Ian Smith to the United States, which is in violation of the mandatory sanctions. This is an action which completely undermines the spirit and resolutions of the United Nations and the cause of liberation in southern Africa. It therefore calls for the strongest objection from this body.\n73.\tWe thus appeal to all peace-loving countries to increase their material and moral support to the freedom fighters of Zimbabwe led by the Patriotic Front until genuine prospects for majority rule in Zimbabwe can be realized. At the same time, we urge all Member States to implement strictly the sanctions against Rhodesia and leave no room for sanction-breakers. Similarly, we urge the international community to support in all ways possible those neighbouring African States whose economies are suffering due to their strict compliance with and implementation of the relevant United Nations sanctions against Rhodesia.\n74.\tTurning now to the Middle East region, it is saddening to note that no acceptable solution to the problems of the area have been found. The tensions in the region continue\nto threaten international peace and security. Hopes that had been raised at the beginning of the year for peace in the area have been severely shaken by the events which have taken place in Lebanon.\n75.\tKenya has expressed publicly on several occasions its views that peace in that area can be achieved subject to fulfilment of the following three conditions: first, the right of all States in the region to live in peace and within secure and recognized boundaries in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973); secondly, the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab lands occupied since the 1967 war; and thirdly, the recognition of the human rights of the Palestinians as a people and their right to a homeland of their own. Kenya believes further that, if everyone in the area took measures to respect this august body and desist from doing anything calculated to weaken it, such as ignoring its resolutions, progress towards a peaceful settlement could be achieved and justice for all would be in sight. Failure to so act will certainly lead to a conflagration that could easily engulf the whole world.\n76.\tWe believe that no peaceful settlement in the region is possible, however, without the full involvement and participation of the Palestinians on an equal basis with all the other parties concerned. 1 take this opportunity to appeal to all, including those most concerned with the problem, not to obstruct any chances for a peaceful settlement that could bring enormous advantages to all the people of the Middle East and the rest of the world.\n77.\tTurning to the question of Cyprus, Kenya is of the view that the people of Cyprus are capable of resolving their own problems peacefully if external interference is removed. We therefore call for the resumption of the intercommunal talks. We continue, as we have done before, to uphold and call for respect for the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of Cyprus. We urge the people of Cyprus to bury their sectional interests for the benefit of the entire population of Cyprus and to stand firmly united in rejecting external interference in the internal affairs of the Republic of Cyprus. We further call upon all nations to condemn most strongly any interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus.\n78.\tA growing challenge has been building up over the question of declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. At the same time, very little progress has been made by the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean set up by resolution 2992 (XXVII) of 15 December 1972 owing to the reluctance of a number of major Powers to participate in the projected conference on the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. The escalation and expansion of great-Power military and naval presence in the Indian Ocean is a flagrant disregard of the fears and sentiments expressed by all the littoral States that have solemnly declared they would like the Indian Ocean to be designated for all time as a zone of peace free of great-Power rivalry. Recalling that Kenya was a sponsor of the Declaration on the Indian Ocean,10 my delegation wishes once again to call on all States to respect this solemn Declaration and to ask those that have bases in\nthe zone to remove them so that the peace-loving peoples of the region can pursue their development efforts without fear of intimidation and possible nuclear warfare.\n79. The harnessing of nuclear energy constitutes a technological advance which presents both fears and hopes for the future. Nuclear technology properly used can bring about rapid improvements in the living conditions of mankind everywhere. But if used recklessly and wantonly it can spell a catastrophe capable of exterminating all that lives. We who do not have nuclear energy believe that nuclear technology should be made available to all for peaceful purposes and under strict safeguards. We object to the notion that the knowledge remain a preserve and a monopoly of those who have it today.\n80 On the question of disarmament we are pleased that the tenth special session, the first that the United Nations devoted entirely to disarmament, was held earlier this year. This session should be looked upon as a unique opportunity to take a step along the difficult road to the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament. There is need for more than mere recognition of the continuing nature of the disarmament process. Recognition must be supported by actions and follow-up meetings to review and monitor progress and failure. Otherwise, the special session's impact will be quickly lost. Kenya therefore welcomes the idea of convening another special session on disarmament in 1981.\n81.\tLet it be said again that the already excessively high level of armaments and the continuing international arms race represent an enormous overspending for destructive purposes. In absolute terms the arms race has reached absurd and ridiculous dimensions. It is not justifiable for the international community to continue pouring billions of dollars into an industry whose aim is the development of the most sophisticated machinery of destruction, while more than half of the world goes hungry and lives without decent shelter. The time has now come when the fruits of human intelligence should be used for more constructive purposes, with a view to improving the quality of life for all mankind.\n82.\tWhile we do recognize that immediately meaningful disarmament negotiations depend primarily on the improvement of relations between East and West, we also believe that concrete progress in international disarmament negotiations presupposes international detente. However, while detente has had, and could have, an important effect in relaxing international tensions, we are greatly concerned that political detente has not been accompanied by corresponding measures of disarmament and military disengagement. Instead international detente is being undermined by the momentum of the technological development, the refinement of armaments and the deployment of new weapons.\n83.\tWe are all agreed that nuclear weapons constitute the major threat to our world today. Kenya is against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and we should like to appeal to all Governments to support efforts towards halting the dangerous process of nuclear proliferation. Successful efforts to create a fool-proof non-proliferation regime presupposes a will to co-operate on the part of the nuclear-weapon States, which have heavy responsibilities.\nMany of us who have voluntarily renounced any right to acquire nuclear weapons under the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] are, however, interested in the potential benefits of the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. We do not believe that the peaceful application of nuclear energy automatically leads to the proliferation of nuclear weapons so long as all States, nuclear and non-nuclear, agree strictly to observe the safeguards laid down by the IAEA. We strongly appeal to the nuclear-weapon States, as well as the developed countries which possess sophisticated civilian nuclear technology to implement article IV of the non-proliferation Treaty.\n84 , Having given up our right to acquire nuclear weapons, we believe that we have every right to demand that the efforts to stop horizontal nuclear proliferation should be matched by equal efforts on the part of the nuclear-weapon Mates themselves to stop vertical proliferation. We cannot be convinced of the sincerity of the nuclear-weapon States as long as their actions in the increasingly sophisticated use of nuclear energy for war do not conform with their frequent protestations of willingness to decelerate and subsequently to halt the nuclear-arms race altogether.\n85.\tI would now like to refer briefly to another subject of paramount importance to my country, namely, the ongoing negotiations on the law of the sea. The seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was held in Geneva from 28 March to 19 May 1978 and the resumed seventh session was held in New York from 21 August to 15 September 1978.\n86.\tThe Kenya delegation to the seventh session, as well as our delegation to the previous sessions, has played an active and constructive role in a genuine endeavour to arrive at a convention that is generally acceptable to all parties. The first part of the seventh session, held in Geneva, was, in the view of my country, the most fruitful session of the Conference since its commencement. The compromise formula on the system of exploration and exploitation of the international sea-bed resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction,11 arrived at after very intensive and difficult negotiations, clearly represents a major breakthrough in the Conference.\n87.\tThe broad framework agreed on for the financial arrangements relating to contracts concluded between the authority and contractors and the financing of both the authority and the enterprise12 also marks a significant advance In the work of the Conference. We believe- the figures suggested by the Chairman of Negotiating Group 11 on financial arrangements are both fair and equitable.\n88.\tAlthough there are a number of outstanding issues for which satisfactory solutions have not been found, Kenya believes that, judging by the very significant progress so far made, a real possibility now exists of arriving at a generally acceptable convention at the next session of the Conference, Kenya will go to the next session with an open\nmind, prepared to proceed in the spirit of compromise in the earnest hope that all other delegations will do likewise.\n89.\tIt is therefore not surprising that there was strong resistance on the part of most delegations to reopening the issues dealt with in the compromise formula during the recent resumed session held in New York this summer. We strongly believe that the compromise formula represents the basic minimum the developing countries will accept if the parallel system of exploration and exploitation that has been accepted is to be of any benefit to them. The developed countries must accept the Geneva compromise if they are at all serious in their often expressed desire for a negotiated convention,\n90.\tOn the other hand the Kenya Government is very concerned about the spate of unilateral legislation for the exploitation of deep sea-bed minerals currently in the process of preparation in a number of countries. Kenya is of the view that such proposed national laws are completely illegal since they represent an attempt to misappropriate resources which were unanimously declared to be the common heritage of mankind in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV). It is also cynical that such laws should be under consideration when the Conference is on the threshold of adopting a generally acceptable international convention. The countries concerned should be aware that they will bear full responsibility for the chaos and the breakdown of the negotiations which may well result if the proposed unilateral laws are enacted. In such a situation each country would have no option but to protect its interests in the best manner open to it. The short-term gains the developed countries hope to achieve through unilateral legislation will be far outweighed by the risks that would ensue from the chaos into which such areas as territorial seas, straits, scientific research and freedom of navigation would be plunged.\n91.\tMy Government has followed with keen interest the work being done by the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Organization, in which we have actively participated. While conceding that the United Nations Charter was a very carefully drafted document which has on the whole worked well, we are of the view that the changed circumstances in the world since the founding of the United Nations some 33 years ago make a review of its Charter not only desirable but necessary.\n92.\tOne area in which, in Kenya's view, the Charter requires review is that concerning the power of veto. The world economic and political balance and priorities have shifted substantially in the 33 years that have elapsed since the founding of the United Nations. The membership of the Organization has greatly increased. We therefore strongly feel that-the distribution of the power of veto should be reviewed with a view to making it reflect the changed situation in the world. Africa should also have the power of veto.\n93.\tAnother area that Kenya feels needs serious consideration is the strengthening of the role of the Security Council as a peace-maker and a peace-keeper. The primary responsibility of the Security Council under the Charter is the maintenance of peace and security.\n94.\tWhile we are fully aware, and are. appreciative, of the role played by the Security Council in averting major armed conflicts, we note that there have been a number of lesser wars and armed conflicts which the Security Council has not been able to prevent or stop. The Special Committee on the Charter should seriously consider how to make the Security Council much more effective in its extremely important and noble role of ridding mankind of the scourge of wars and armed conflicts.\n95.\tRecently the United Nations Conference on Succession of States in Respect of Treaties was reconvened pursuant to General Assembly resolution 32/47 of 8 December 1977, and adopted yet another Vienna Convention, the Convention on Succession of States in Respect of Treaties.13 Kenya fully participated in both sessions of the Conference and congratulates the Conference on the successful execution of its mandate. In our view the Convention, which was worked out from a draft text prepared over many years by the International Law Commission is a balanced one and should commend itself to all States Members of the Organization.\n96.\tFor our part, we are studying the Convention with a view to taking steps to becoming a party thereto in the near future. In this respect we are gratified to note that 15 States are required to ratify the Convention so that it may generally enter into force, and we feel that is a reasonable figure which should facilitate its early entry into force. We therefore hope that States will find it possible to ratify the Convention without undue delay.\n97.\tI should like now to turn to other pressing issues which my delegation feels are just as important as those already discussed and which require urgent attention and solutions in the interests of justice, equity and peace in the world.\n98.\tThe sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly, attended by Government representatives at the highest political levels, emphasized the realities of our interdependence and solemnly and unanimously adopted new guidelines and principles which were to govern our future international economic relationships. We all recognized then that the time for pious expressions of international economic solidarity was definitely over and that words had to give way to a tangible demonstration of-this interdependence and our common destiny. Consequently the General Assembly unanimously adopted both a Declaration and a Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202(S-VI)J, an order which would be based on equity, justice, sovereign equality, interdependence, common interest and genuine cooperation among all States.\n99.\tFour years have passed, and it is indeed sad to note that very little progress has been achieved on this matter of vital importance. Indeed, I should like to put on record here the strong concern of the Kenya Government at the slow pace at which the decisions of that milestone sixth special session of the General Assembly are being implemented The progress of the negotiations in the various\nUnited Nations and other international forums towards the achievement of the New International Economic Order has been very disappointing.\n100.\tDespite the solemn commitments entered into at the fourth session of UNCTAD in 1976 with respect to the establishment of an Integrated Programme for Commodities,14 no substantive agreements have so far been reached on its establishment. Although the UNCTAD Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Committee for the Integrated Programme for Commodities has so far met five times and the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities twice, significant conceptual differences still exist on the basic issues and principles involved in the setting up of such a programme.\n101.\tOn the industrialization front, most of the key recommendations contained in the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action on Industrial Development Co-operation concerning the strengthening of the industrial capacity of the developing countries are still being held up by the fact that the international community has not as yet agreed on the transformation of UN1DO into a specialized agency. As we are all aware, the developing countries have on several occasions urged that UNIDO should be transformed into a specialized agency so that it may better perform the duties it was created to carry out, namely, to accelerate the industrialization of developing countries.\n102.\tOn monetary issues, the international community has not yet agreed on the reforms required in the international monetary system in order to meet the needs of the developing countries for a better distribution of international monetary benefits, including a more equitable distribution of international liquidity and a full part in the decision-making machinery of the IMF. As regards the transfer of resources, all the developed countries have not yet given an unqualified commitment to increase their official development assistance to attain the target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product by 1980. The only concrete, positive developments in the monetary field have been the recent announcements by the Governments of Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom cancelling the official debts of the least developed among the developing countries. We welcome that step and should like to urge other developed countries to follow this noble example. Action is, however, still pending on the reorganization of the entire debt system, including renegotiation of existing debts, so as to give it a more developmental and less commercial orientation.\n103.\tAs regards the transfer of technology, the Intergovernmental Group of Experts who were charged with the preparation of an international code of conduct on transfer of technology have so far had six sessions in Geneva. Nevertheless, substantial differences still exist between the different groups on key issues, such as the questions of guarantees, the responsibilities or obligations of parties,\nnational regulation of the transfer of technology and the applicable law and procedures in the settlement of disputes.\n104.\tThe scenario is indeed discouraging. While we move from one conference to another, the social and economic conditions of the people in many developing countries, especially in the continent of Africa, continue to deteriorate rapidly. Millions of human beings in Africa, Asia and Latin America are today living in subhuman conditions, waiting for the international community to do something concrete to alleviate their misery, hunger and economic deprivation. Many of our economies are in fact declining to unacceptable levels with each day that passes without any action being taken in those critical fields.\n105.\tThe constructive spirit and the favourable climate which prevailed towards the end of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly and also at the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi, had raised great hopes for the peoples of the developing countries. The successful conclusions of those meetings and the comprehensive resolutions which were adopted had indeed led us to believe that at last there existed an opportunity for the international community to resolve effectively issues which had been the subject of discussions and confrontations for over two decades.\n106 Unfortunately, given the pace and nature of the ongoing negotiations for the establishment of the New International Economic Order, it would appear that we still have not crossed that philosophical threshold which we had hoped we would have crossed when the development of the poor nations is considered an essential element in the sustained development of the world economy and where the interests of both rich and poor nations are regarded as complementary and compatible rather than as conflicting and irreconcilable. We are not demanding a massive redistribution of past income and wealth-in fact if all the demands are added up they do not exceed about one per cent of the gross national product of the rich nations. What we are asking for is simply a redistribution of future growth opportunities. How can the international community continue to expect the developing countries to acquiesce in the prolongation of an irrational economic system, which is in itself the greatest constraint on our development and on the physical and cultural well-being of our peoples?\n107.\tWhile expressing our increasing disappointment and frustration at the lack of progress in the evolution of a more meaningful international economic order, may 1 unequivocally state here that we have not given up hope, and are not going to do so, and that we intend to continue to press our case, though success may not be wholly achieved in the coming year. But we still believe in the justice of our cause and are sincerely convinced that the\n\\\"developed world has the ability to resolve the prevailing international economic problems, given a little more political will and determination on its part. In our view, what is really required if the current negotiations between the rich and poor nations are to succeed is a political vision that is inspired by the promise of the future and not clouded, as it is at present, by past controversies and by the desire to cling to the short-term privileges of the present.\n108.\tI said there was hope. May I conclude my remarks on a happier note.\n109.\tMy delegation would like to express appreciation to the Secretary-General for his supporting and co-ordinating role in organizing the United Nations- Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, recently held in Buenos Aires. That was the most practical demonstration on a global scale that the countries of the developing world are prepared to seek areas where they can co-operate and maximize the use of their own resources for their mutual benefit, rather than always looking to the developed countries for assistance.\n110.\tWe urge that the Plan of Action adopted at the Conference should be adopted by this Assembly and that the United Nations system as well as the developed countries, individually and collectively, should support the developing countries in their search for ways and means by which they can assist themselves.\n111.\tAt the regional level, the Kenya Government would like to thank ECA for the very good work it has done, and continues to do, with regard to the creation of a preferential trade area for 17 countries of the eastern and southern African subregion. My Government has fully participated at all the preparatory meetings and will continue to contribute fully at all future meetings to see the ideas and ideals currently being discussed at those meetings turn into reality. It is our hope that the international community, and in particular the developed countries and those in a position to do so, will give technical, financial and other assistance to the new group of countries being formed. Such assistance will be particularly needed in the field of joint industrial projects for the subregion, where large amounts of capital and technical know-how, beyond our capacities, will be required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff90.\tDuring the past year the struggle of the non-aligned peoples and countries, the third-world States and the nations that love independence and justice has made ever-greater strides. The cause of defending national independence, State sovereignty, territorial integrity and the right of peoples to decide for themselves their own destiny has made great progress. The imperialist and expansionist big Powers and their followers have been engulfed in greater difficulties in the face of the successive waves of revolutionary movements, movements for national liberation and movements for the defence of the national independence of peoples the world over.\n91.\tIn South-East Asia and in Asia the will for independence among peoples has defeated the interference, interventions and plan of expansion of the expansionist big Power and its followers. The latter have made an about-face and have striven to change their attitude towards the South-East Asian countries. Before, there was nothing but criticisms, insults and invective; now there is nothing but diplomatic smiles, affability and amiability. But, in face of all these efforts and manoeuvres, the peoples and countries of South-East Asia have remained constantly vigilant. The Sino-Japanese peace and friendship Treaty,50 with its article against hegemonism, is a new event which has strengthened the course of history. This clause against hegemonism has greatly encouraged and strengthened the struggle in defence of the independence and peace of the peoples and countries the world over, and especially those in Asia and the Pacific. The just cause of the independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean motherland and the reasonable measures proposed by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in order to solve the Korean problem have been actively supported by peoples the world over. The struggle of the coastal countries of the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea against the military presence and the threats of the imperialist and expansionist big Powers has also been strengthened. In this situation, when the movement for independence is in full development, Solomon Islands has attained independence and become a Member of our Organization. We should like to express here our warm greetings and welcome.\n92.\tIn the Middle East the struggle of the Palestinian people and all the Arab peoples to exercise their national\nrights and recover their territories has not developed according to the will of the imperialist and expansionist big Powers, that struggle will be long and bitter. The Palestinian and Arab people have learned valuable lessons through their sacrifices. Their will to independence will continue, to light the way of their struggle.\n93.\tThe OAU Assembly held in Khartoum last July reflected the common will of the 400 million Africans to prevent all intervention and interference on the part of the expansionist and imperialist big Powers and their followers, and to be responsible for their own destiny. The peoples of Zimbabwe, Azania and Namibia, using revolutionary violence in their struggle for independence and for the right to decide their own destiny against colonialism, racism and apartheid, are on their way towards victory, despite the obstacles created by the rivalries of the imperialist and expansionist big Powers.\n94.\tThe struggle of the countries of Latin America to exercise their national rights has also made progress. The victory won. by Manama in recovering its sovereign right over the Canal is the result of the stubborn struggle waged by the Panamanian people. It is also the result of the solidarity among the peoples of Latin America.\n95.\tThe peoples of Europe have had to undergo great sufferings, during two successive world wars kindled by imperialism. At present they have been made aware of the danger of a new war, resulting from the rivalry between the expansionist and imperialist big Powers with the aim of taking possession of Europe; and thereby dominating the world.. That is why during the past year the upswing in the struggle of the peoples of Europe against the policy of hegemonism has become more and more dynamic.\n96.\tAs an anti-bloc force, representative of the will for independence of the struggling peoples of the third world, the non-aligned movement has always developed with dynamism. In Belgrade at the end of last July the Conference, of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of-Non-Aligned Countries crushed the manoeuvres of interference and division on the part of the imperialist and expansionist big Powers and their followers. In particular, the Conference defeated the attempts of that expansionist big Power and its followers that wanted to modify the principles, of non-alignment in order to force the non-aligned movement, to accept its ideology and to serve its activities of  aggression and expansion. The non-aligned countries at present are waging an active struggle to prevent the expansionist big Power and its followers from taking advantage of the forthcoming Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries to drag this movement into its bloc. If only a few Heads of State or Government participate in it, that Conference will not reflect the common concept and position of the non-aligned movement  as did the- previous Conference in Belgrade, Cairo, Lusaka,. Algiers and Colombo. The documents adopted by that Sixth Conference would be stamped with the ideology of the expansionist big Power. But this would not be a lasting factor. The permanent and fundamental feature of the non-aligned movement resides in the will for independence and the will to remain outside blocs, the struggle for national liberation and the struggle for the defence of national independence which encourages whole\npeoples consisting of several billions of men and women and the truly non-aligned countries. This will and these struggles are developing dynamically from day to day.\n97.\tParallel with their struggle to defend and safeguard their independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, the peoples all over the world have fought to demand that the imperialist and expansionist big Powers proceed to nuclear and conventional disarmament. They have not been misled by the propaganda of those big Powers because they know full well that it is precisely those big Powers which are over-arming themselves, are carrying out a policy of aggression, expansion and rivalry, are threatening world peace and security and are preparing for war. The relative peace which prevails in the world at present has been achieved because of the stubborn struggle of peoples all over the world and is not due to the imperialist and expansionist big Powers.\n98.\tThe victories won successively by the peoples of the non-aligned countries, the third-world countries and the countries that love independence and justice have thrown into confusion the imperialist and expansionist big Powers, the colonialists, the neo-colonialists, those who believe in apartheid, the racists, the Zionists and all the forces of aggression, exploitation and domination. The will of the peoples to be further united in solidarity in their struggle has crushed all manoeuvres to sow dissension. The peoples which wage their revolutionary struggle, the struggle for national liberation and the struggle to defend their national independence have on the basis of equality and mutual respect, expressed their political and moral encouragement and support of each other and this has strengthened their determination to struggle. Such reciprocal encouragement and support are powerful material forces which have routed all the criminal activities of the demoniac forces.\n99.\tThis excellent situation is very favourable for the pursuit of the struggle of the peoples of the world. But it is normal that there should still be complex problems caused by the development of the struggle which brings the revolutionary forces and the forces that favour independence, peace and democracy into opposition to the imperialists, expansionists, colonialists, neo-colonialists and counter-revolutionary forces and also caused most specifically by the contradictions, which are becoming more and more bitter between the. imperialist and expansionist big Powers that have confronted each other in the different regions of the world. At present, regional wars are still continuing in many places in the world. The possibility of a world war remains. Faced with such a situation the peoples of the world have constantly increased their revolutionary vigilance and readied themselves for all eventualities so that the cause of revolution, independence and democracy may triumph.\n100. In this situation we believe our General Assembly has every opportunity to strengthen the cause of genuine independence and peace by contributing to the elimination of the illusions sowed by the expansionist and imperialist big Powers with respect to certain positions and concepts, such as the so-called need to depend on a big Power, the spirit of Munich, the false disarmament measures, and so on. The forces of many billions of people armed with an unshakable will for independence and an increasingly\nawakened political consciousness are the immense forces, which decide the future.\n101.\tThe great upsurge of the struggle of people all over the world has brought great encouragement to the people of Kampuchea, who are struggling to defend the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Democratic Kampuchea and who are striving to build up the country during its new stage of revolution by abiding by a position of independence, sovereignty and self-reliance under the just leadership of the Communist Party of Kampuchea and Comrade Secretary Pol Pot.\n102.\tThe situation in our country is excellent.\n103.\tThe people of Kampuchea, who were exploited, poor, oppressed, despised and downtrodden for a very long time, have put an end to that dark period forever. Through the glorious victory of 17 April 1975, which marked the total and definitive liberation of Kampuchea, our people, as masters of their country, have taken into their own hands the right to decide themselves their own destiny and that of their country. A new society where equality, justice and genuine democracy prevail, with neither rich nor poor, with neither an exploiting class nor an exploited class, has been definitively established in Kampuchea. In their capacity as masters of this society our people have enthusiastically waged a struggle to fulfil their tasks in the new stage of their revolution by establishing an immense and dynamic revolutionary mass movement throughout the whole country.\n104.\tDuring the past year in the field of national construction, the people of Kampuchea have achieved new results. This year the. total area of lands irrigated in all seasons has reached 700,000 hectares. Modern agriculture is beginning to develop. The new countryside has been changing from year to year. Cottage industries, industry in general, mass technology and science have begun to take form progressively on the basis of agriculture. The objective of the people of Kampuchea is to fulfil the plan of building up modern agriculture within 1.6 to 15 years and industry within 15 to 20 years. According to the first results achieved this plan will be entirely fulfilled within the framework of a collectivist, socialist society which is completely new in the history of mankind.\n105.\tThe living conditions of our people have changed greatly in all fields. Corruption, depravity and debauchery have been totally eliminated and have given way to a new, healthy society which is in keeping with the genuine national traditions of our people. In addition, 90 per cent of the population, including the poorest peasants, peasants who are not quite so poor, peasants at an intermediate stage of poverty and other workers who formerly lived a life of extreme poverty, now enjoy a very much improved standard of living, which is fully guaranteed. All enjoy to the same extent the advantages of the revolution and the new society; all eat their fill; all have decent clothing and shelter; all have medicines, medical care and hospitals in each co-operative and trade Union. All also have every opportunity to improve their cultural level. The people are satisfied with the revolution and resolutely defend their new regime.\n106. Therefore, is such a regime good or not? Does social justice prevail or not? Who has the right to judge this? It is\nsurely not the imperialists, the expansionists or the Vietnamese, who have an enormous debt of blood to pay to the Kampuchean people. Only the Kampuchean people have the right to judge, and the people have judged that this regime is good and just. That is why they support and defend it with such great determination. If this regime were not good and just the finest speeches and propaganda would not satisfy the people, if this regime exploited and. oppressed the people the people would surely have no confidence in it and would rise up and overthrow it. The history of Kampuchea is filled with such experiences. The same applies to other countries.\n107.\tAs for those who had an easy life in the old society\u2014that is, nearly 10 per cent of the population-their material living conditions have been cut down more or less to the level of everyone in the country. They can therefore live like everyone else. They participated in the revolution for they, too, are patriots. They are becoming increasingly more aware that it is only under this new social regime that the nation of Kampuchea can live as it does today in genuine independence, national honour and dignity. Moreover, they see that justice and equity prevail and that the exploitation of man by man does not exist any more in this society. They are increasingly aware that this regime is genuinely democratic, in accordance with their wishes and guarantees the democratic rights of the poor, .who constitute the overwhelming majority, as well as of all the other strata of society.\n108.\tWhat is the basis of democratic rights? What rights had the poor in the old semi-colonial and semi-feudal society of Kampuchea? In the imperialist, expansionist and Vietnamese societies, where the system of exploitation prevails, what rights have the immense majority of the population, such as the poor and the workers, if they have no means of production at all? Indeed, they have only the right to be exploited and to sell themselves and their labour, this being so, Where are the democratic freedoms? They exist only in. form and on paper. As for the reactionary, exploiting feudal and capitalist classes, they have the right to exploit, to oppress, to suck the blood of the people, to kill, them in indirect and camouflaged ways. They live in opulence and affluence paid for by the sweat and blood, of the people. Several million poor people live in misery and suffering; they have no work, they are forced to sell themselves, their sons and their daughters, and they have no future at all. And those who dare to struggle in order to overthrow the regime of exploitation are repressed in the most atrocious Fascist manner.\n109.\tIn Democratic Kampuchea, where there is a collectivist regime, the people are masters of all the means of production. Every peasant is master of the rice fields and the land. The workers are masters of the factories. Thus they exercise the right of decision, management and administration. These are genuine democratic freedoms, the genuine guarantees of a life as real masters of their own destiny. The old relations of production and exploitation and oppression have been totally abolished. Under the new regime, the new independent, equal, socialist and collectivist relations and production have been developed and strengthened. The production obtained as a result of the sweat and the blood of the people is entirely in the hands of the people.\t.\n110.\tThat does not mean that there are no longer any contradictions in Democratic Kampuchea, but if there are contradictions, that is normal. However, 99 per cent of the people of Kampuchea agree fully with the policy of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea, which is to defend and build up the country and a new society and constantly to improve the people's living standards. The Government of Democratic Kampuchea is constantly concerned to ensure the moral and material happiness of all the people of Kampuchea and is working to this end. It considers this noble duty to be a revolutionary virtue and is mobilizing all the national forces and the people to fulfil it. As for the existing contradictions, we are resolving them fundamentally through education by relying on the forces of the collectivist people, because our motivations are reasonable, legitimate, realistic and known to everyone, for our movement of national defence and construction and of the improvement of the people's standard of living is powerful. As for the enemy's agents who are obstinately fighting against the revolution and the people of Kampuchea, there are a mere handful of them and they are isolated from the nation and the people; they ace firmly under the control of our people, who are armed with an awakened political consciousness.\n111.\tDuring these more than three years our people have successfully defended and safeguarded the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country. They have successfully solved the weighty and important post-war problems, such as that of food, without begging from anyone, as Viet Nam has done. They have successfully built up and developed their country in full independence, sovereignty and self-reliance. That, has been achieved thanks in part to proper leadership, but the fundamental and decisive factor has been the people. If revolutionary Kampuchea has defeated the United States imperialist aggressors in the more than five year-long war for national liberation, it is because the entire people took part in the revolution. At present, if Kampuchea can be self-sufficient in food, develop through its own means and struggle successfully against the intervention and aggression of its enemies of all kinds and especially against the Vietnamese aggressor, which is annexationist and a swallower of territories,  it is again thanks to the active participation in the revolution of the people as a whole. Thanks to the firmly united people of Kampuchea, deeply devoted and faithful to the collectivist regime, and their successful and enthusiastic struggle to defend and build up the country in an immense and dynamic mass revolutionary movement, the future of Democratic Kampuchea can be no less than brilliant.\n112. In this situation when Democratic Kampuchea is continuing to develop and advance and there is not a single expansionist or imperialist on  its territory, it is natural that a all its enemies should feel a deep bitterness for Kampuchea and carry out a feverish campaign of slander against it. In the history of mankind have the imperialists, expansionists, colonialists and neo-colonialists ever expressed their satisfaction  and congratulations to the countries and peoples which have conducted their revolution and conquered their independence? They not only oppose  revolution and independence in words but. at the same time as they have uttered insults and  expressed disparagement and contempt, they have also massacred millions of people. Among the countries of the third world is there a people which has succeeded in escaping those massacres? More specifically in regard to Democratic Kampuchea, from 1970 to 1975 the aggressive barbaric war of the United States imperialists who wanted to place Kampuchea under their neo colonialist yoke killed and. wounded more than 1 million inhabitants and devastated 80 per cent of the country. At that time was there a single imperialist country which so much as expressed its concern for the people of Kampuchea? The imperialists, expansionists, colonialists, neo-colonialists and ail the forces of exploitation and domination have always been at all previous periods, in the present as in the future will always be the implacable enemies of revolution and independence. The great leaders of the world revolution, including Lenin in the Great October Revolution have also been the subject: of attacks accusations and slander by. the enemies of the revolution which mobilized in order to attack them savagely.\n113. But the problem that our General Assembly must take; into consideration is that of determining whether or not we- have to let the imperialists, expansionists and their followers continue to attack, despise and slander the other countries, interfere in the- internal affairs and violate the sovereignty of independent countries. Must we let them continue to use the United Nations forum to propagate their logic of exploiters, of brigands and murderers\u2014in complete contravention- of the United; Nations Charter-or not?\n114. In: order successfully to build up a new society and improve their standard of living, the people of Kampuchea have to wage a. stubborn and bitter struggle to defend the gains of the revolution and; of Democratic Kampuchea. Since 17 April 1975 the date which marks the complete and final liberation of that country enemies; of all kinds have not only slandered and. disparaged Democratic Kampuchea and its revolution- butt they have also implacably sought to thwart and: destroy the peaceful efforts of the people of Kampuchea, and the results that they have achieved.\n115. The United States imperialists who have never digested their defeat have continued to foster the ambition of retaking Kampuchea and transforming it once again into a neo-colony of theirs.. Their activities designed to destroy the gains of the revolution of Kampuchea have all been defeated by the people and revolutionary army of Kampuchea. Since the middle of 1977 their strategic forces, present both inside, and outside Kampuchea to foment coups d'etat: and overthrow democratic Kampuchea in coordination with the attacks launched from the outside have collapsed. The hopes of the United States imperialists to take possession of Kampuchea once again have died away.\n116. Working in a parallel direction with the activities of the United States imperialists the Viet Nam aggressor and swallower of territories carried out feverish and most barbarous activities to destroy Democratic Kampuchea.\n\n117. The reason is that Vietnam has for a long time had the ambition of annexing and swallowing Kampuchea and exterminating the Kampuchean race. It was not only since the liberation of Kampuchea that Viet Nam started to seek to destroy our country. In the recent past -- before the beginning of the Second World War - Viet Nam had swallowed the Kampuchean territory called Kampuchea Krom, an area of 65,000 square kilometres, with a population at present of nearly 4 million inhabitants. That territory makes up the south-western part of the present Viet Nam, from the region of Prey Nokor\u2014 at present Saigon\u2014to the west, and the Mekong River delta. Is the Viet Nam of today any different from the Viet Nam of feudal times or of the time when it was under the colonialist or imperialist yoke? Is there any change in its ambition with regard to Kampuchea? The only difference is that the Viet Nam of today has hidden itself behind the so-called banner of revolution in order to attack and try to take possession of Kampuchea. In 1930 Vietnam founded a party to which it gave the name \\\"Indo-Chinese Communist Party\\\". Its aim was to create a Vietnamese \\\"Indo-China Federation\\\" to replace the French \\\"Indo-China Federation\\\", that is, to gather the three countries in that federation to be ruled with a rod of iron by Viet Nam. In that way Viet Nam would swallow up Kampuchea within a given period of time. But as the label \\\"Indo-Cnina Federation\\\" could not achieve the anticipated results, in 1975 Viet Nam renamed its plan \\\"special friendship and special solidarity\\\", while maintaining the same objective, that is, to make Kampuchea a puppet of Viet Nam. The Vietnamese plan is, first of all, to take possession of .Kampuchea and subsequently to extend its expansion over the other countries in Southeast Asia.\n118.\tViet Nam's ambition for regional hegemonism squares with the expansionist plan in South-East Asia of the expansionist big Power, which has an ambition for world hegemonism. The principal aim of that expansionist, big Power is to dominate Europe, which is the key for its world domination. To that end it has Striven to mobilize all its main strategic forces to take possession of Europe, strangling it from the north and the south. In parallel with that, it has intervened in many countries in Africa and in the Middle East. However, as it has world ambitions, it has already tried several times to dominate Asia through what it calls the \\\"Asian Collective Security System\\\". Within that framework South-East Asia is the zone that it wants to dominate politically, militarily and economically.  Most specifically, it wants to control the sea lanes passing through the Malacca Straits, which link the countries of Asia, Europe and Africa. In order to carry out that strategic plan, the expansionist big Power has used Viet Nam as its pawn; in South-East Asia. Viet Nam itself has proclaimed that in South-East Asia it is the bastion of the bloc which it calls \\\"socialist\\\", that is, the bloc belonging to the expansionist big Power. The mad persecutions carried out by Viet Nam against Chinese nationals and its frenzied and impertinent provocations of China along its borders, as well as the efforts of the expansionist big Power to strengthen its naval base and missile bases in Viet Nam - all those are part of the plan to encircle China and dominate South-East Asia. The numerous Vietnamese divisions stationed on foreign territories are supplied by the expansionist big Power; indeed, they occupy that country and are used to intervene in others.\n119.\tBut the expansionist big power and Viet Nam can  dominate South-East Asia only if they succeed in taking possession of Kampuchea. Our country is not a big one and has no very great abundance of natural resources; however, its geographical situation in the middle of South-East Asia constitutes a key position in the plan of the expansionist big Power and of Viet Nam. If they succeeded in taking possession of Kampuchea they would have additional forces and a spring-board to carry out their expansion throughout the whole of South-East Asia.\n120.\tFrom 1970 to 1975 the Vietnamese plan to take possession of Kampuchea was defeated on a number of occasions, although during that period the people of Kampuchea had to deal with the war of aggression of the United States imperialists. After the liberation of Kampuchea, the Vietnamese army unceasingly provoked incidents along the borders. At the beginning of June 1975 Viet Nam attacked and occupied the Koh Way islands belonging to Kampuchea. The world was then beginning to understand the true annexationist nature of Viet Nam. However, more important than these border attacks was the fact that Viet Nam and the expansionist big Power relied on their agents who had been infiltrated into the army and State administration of Kampuchea to foment coups d'etat, overthrow Democratic Kampuchea and set up a puppet regime in Phnom Penh; The attacks launched from outside by the Vietnamese army along the borders were designed to encourage those accomplices inside and also to sabotage the efforts of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea and to prevent it from solving its great post-war problems and from attending to the national defence, although those attacks did not leave aside the possibility of encroaching on one or two kilometres of territory inside Kampuchea's borders. However, that Vietnamese plan has been defeated on a number of occasions, thanks to the revolutionary vigilance of the people and the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea. We did not inform the people of the world of this at that time because we sought to solve the problem peacefully, in-a spirit of solidarity with Viet Nam; but Viet Nam took advantage of this to carry out a campaign of odious slander against Democratic Kampuchea throughout the world.\n121.\tIn the middle of 1977 Viet Nam exerted great pressure on Kampuchea to accept the \\\"special friendship and- special solidarity\\\" that Viet Nam has been successful in selling in other places. It launched attacks along the ground and sea borders. Its aircraft carried out savage bombings of -the south-west zone of Kampuchea. .At the same time, it was preparing its strategic forces to launch against Kampuchea lightning attacks of the kind launched by the expansionist great Power in 1968 in central Europe. At the end of 1977, 14 Vietnamese divisions, including 5 elite divisions, launched large-scale acts of invasion and aggression against Democratic Kampuchea. The expansionist big Power, which was the master of Viet Nam and which took part in the preparation of that plan, hoped to win a victory . That is why its nationals took part in the aggression against Kampuchea as advisers and members of tank crews.\n122.\tHowever, the heroic Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea most judiciously followed the line of the people's war of the Communist party of Kampuchea by waging everywhere an essentially guerrilla war and by using conventional war to destroy the vital forces of the enemy. Thus they destroyed the large-scale aggression of Viet Nam and inflicted on it an ignominious defeat on 6 January 1978. This strategy of \\\"lightning attack and lightning victory\\\" of Viet Nam and the expansionist big Power was thus totally crushed. Nevertheless, Viet Nun tried to continue to attack Kampuchea from outside at the beginning of February and in March, April and May 1978, and each time it suffered defeat. Being desperate, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Party gave direct instructions to a member and many assistants of its Central Committee which led to their personally organizing, with their remaining agents in Kampuchea, a coup d'etat aimed once again at overthrowing Democratic Kampuchea. This was towards the end of May 1978. However, Viet Nam was once again most ignominiously defeated. Since the middle of 1978 Viet Nam has been driven to the strategy of the protracted people's war against Kampuchea, a strategy which will exhaust more Vietnamese forces militarily, politically and economically, as well as internationally, until such time as it is annihilated, if it persists in its aggression against Kampuchea.\n123.\tIn the fight against the Vietnamese acts of aggression and annexation the people and the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea have overcome all obstacles. They have firmly adhered to the position of independence, sovereignty, self-reliance and control of their own destiny in their country. They have endured all difficulties and accepted many sacrifices. This is a noble national task that they have to carry out. Our people and our Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea have made all of these sacrifices in the sacred interests of our country for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Democratic Kampuchea and their right to control their own destiny. That is unquestionable: If the people of Kampuchea had not held high the banner of independence, national honour and dignity, if they had not struggled with determination to tear down the banner of aggression and annexation, the banner of \\\"Indo-China Federation\\\" and the banner of hegemonism, what would have been the. situation in Southeast Asia and in Asia as a whole? The expansionist big Power and the annexationist and territory-swallowing Viet Nam would have been even more arrogant and presumptuous and they would have continued their expansion in South-East Asia. Consequently the interest of many countries of Asia, Africa, Europe and America would have suffered.\n124.\tTherefore the victory won by the people of Kampuchea: against Viet Nam's acts of aggression 'and annexation, and the position of Democratic Kampuchea as an independent, neutral and non-aligned country, with no foreign troops or foreign military bases in its territory, are favourable factors in the cause of independence and peace, particularly in South-East Asia, and the interests of Asia and the world in general. Indeed, the struggle of the people of Kampuchea does not concern Kampuchea alone; it is also the struggle against strategies of the expansionist big Power in Asia. That is why the peoples of the world, especially the peoples of Asia and South-East Asia, have expressed their sympathy and their encouragement and have given their active and sincere support to the present struggle of  the people of Kampuchea to defend their national independence. We are very grateful for this just stand and we wish to take this opportunity to express to them our warm thanks.\n125.\tAfter being defeated on the Kampuchea front, Viet Nam has to face insuperable difficulties at home and internationally. Having been driven to the strategy of a protracted war, the Vietnamese forces are being worn down more and more. The Vietnamese people have to face increasingly more severe starvation and are rising against-the Vietnamese administration. Insecurity is growing in south Viet Nam and is reaching the northern part of the country. In the' international area the peoples of the world have clearly discerned the perfidious and hypocritical face of the aggressor, Viet Nam, which is an aligned country and an instrument of the expansionist big Power.\n126.\tForeign and United Nations aid has been used directly or indirectly by Viet Nam to maintain and develop its forces so as to carry oh its aggression against Kampuchea and thereafter to continue its expansion in South-East Asia. An increasing number of-countries are now asking themselves the following questions. Will not the co-operation and the moral, political, diplomatic, economic and financial assistance they give to Viet Nam help Viet Nam to take possession of South-East Asia? Will they not serve the strategy of the expansionist big Power in South-East Asia and in Asia as a whole? Viet Nam is receiving aid from various sources; but this does not mean that it is independent. Its master, the expansionist big Power, has told it to receive such aid, for that Power has not enough-bread for itself and therefore is not able to give Viet Nam enough assistance. The countries - and international organizations which have given aid to Viet Nam are becoming more cautious and are reconsidering the question of their aid. At present Viet Nam is trying to mislead various countries by begging them for aid on its knees which it uses to strengthen its forces and continue its aggression against Kampuchea.\n127.\tBefore it was defeated in its aggression against Kampuchea, Viet Nam was very arrogant and presumptuous. It bragged about the power of its army and engaged in threats and insults against the countries of South-East Asia. But since the defeats they suffered on 6 January 1978 and during the entire first half of 1978, the expansionist big Power and Viet Nam have been forced into a 100 per cent change in . their strategy;, their tactics and their attitude towards the countries of South-East Asia. Before, for them, all was bad; now, all is good. They are trying to carry out diplomatic manoeuvres in South-East Asia and, like a cat that pulls in its claws, they are all smiles. Their objective is to rid themselves of the guilt for their aggression against Kampuchea and for the insults they have hurled against the Southeast Asian countries, and they aim also at isolating Kampuchea from the other countries in South-East Asia, surrounding it from behind so that when the situation is favourable to them they can launch a new larger scale attack against Kampuchea. The diplomatic manoeuvres of Viet Nam and the expansionist big Power are all too obvious. They have failed even before they have been carried out thanks to the vigilance of the peoples of South-East Asia, who are fully aware of the perfidious nature of Viet Nam and of the expansionist, big Power.\n128.\tLike all other aggressions, the Vietnamese aggression will never pay. That is the lesson of history.\n129.\tThe people of Kampuchea want only to live in peace in order to be able to mobilize all their time and forces to,\nbuild up the country, to build a new and prosperous society, in national honour, dignity and independence.\n130.\tDemocratic Kampuchea does not set any conditions on Viet Nam for the solution of the problem. It is, rather, Viet Nam - the aggressor, the annexationist, the swallower up of territories - which, in the style of Hitler, has placed conditions upon Democratic Kampuchea. Indeed, when he threatened and committed aggression against the countries of Eastern Europe, Hitler forced those countries to negotiate, to capitulate and to put their territories under his rule. Viet Nam acts in much the same way. It has committed aggression against Kampuchea in a savage and Fascist way, and it says that Kampuchea has to negotiate with it. Such are the conditions of Viet Nam, which, on the one hand, wants to force Kampuchea to capitulate and come under its yoke and, on the other, wants to hide its face of an aggressor and swallower of territories, to mislead world public opinion and to legalize its acts of aggression and annexation in the world's eyes. If the problem created by the Vietnamese aggression against Kampuchea has not been solved, it is not because there has been no negotiation or intermediary. From 1970 to 1977, before as well as after liberation, negotiations between Kampuchea and Viet Nam took place almost 100 times, at the summit as well as at the level of the Central Committee, in the revolutionary bases of Kampuchea, in Hanoi and in Phnom Penh. Moreover, many negotiations were held along the borders at the level of the zone, regional and district committees. But the problem could not be solved. Solving the problem would require eliminating the root-that is, eliminating the Vietnamese ambition to swallow up Kampuchea and the Vietnamese strategy of an \\\"Indo-China Federation\\\".\n131.\tIf Viet Nam were immediately to cease its aggression against Kampuchea, the War would automatically stop. If Viet Nam were to respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kampuchea and abandon its strategy of an \\\"Indo-China Federation\\\" and the annexation of Kampuchea, if it were to do that by means of concrete acts, in conformity with the principles of non-alignment, the Pancha Sila and the United Nations Charter, then friendship between the two countries, Kampuchea and Viet Nam, and between the two peoples, would be born automatically and would be developed and strengthened progressively. The Government of Democratic Kampuchea has already put forward this position on a number of occasions.\n132.\tIn June 1975, during the visit of the top delegation of the Communist Party of Kampuchea to Hanoi, the Kampuchean side officially proposed to the Vietnamese side that a treaty of friendship and non-aggression be signed between die two countries. But the Vietnamese side did not take this proposal into consideration and did not respond to this gesture of goodwill on the part of Kampuchea. Despite that, if today Viet ,Nam were to cease its .aggression against Kampuchea and to agree to respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kampuchea, and if it were to do that by means of concrete acts, the Government of Democratic Kampuchea would propose once again to Viet Nam that a treaty of friendship and non-aggression be signed. The high-ranking leaders of Democratic Kampuchea will sign this treaty either in Phnom Penh or in Hanoi, or elsewhere, if Viet Nam shows\nthat it really wants to have relations of friendship with Kampuchea.\n133.\tBut, as in the past, Viet Nam has not taken any account of the goodwill shown by Democratic Kampuchea. It persists in committing acts of aggression and annexation against Democratic Kampuchea. At present the Vietnamese army is constantly launching its aggressive attacks all along the borders. Moreover, Viet Nam is now actively mobilizing its forces in preparation for the launching of a new large-scale attack during the forthcoming dry season-that is, beginning next November. The diplomatic activities that Viet Nam has been feverishly carrying out in South-East Asia, Africa and other regions of the world are also part of its plan to attack during the forthcoming dry season. Several divisions of the Vietnamese army which are stationed on foreign territory are also getting ready to carry out this plan. The activities of the expansionist big Power, which is increasing the number of its advisers and. the quantity of its armaments in order to reinforce Viet Nam, are an integral part of this plan.\n134.\tIn such a situation, the people and the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea are maintaining their vigilance at a high pitch. They are closely united with the Communist Party of Kampuchea, led by Comrade Secretary Pol Pot, in their resolute struggle to defend Democratic Kampuchea and ensure that it will live forever.\n135.\tThe present struggle of the people of Kampuchea cannot be separated from the, struggle of the peoples the world over. The people and Government of Democratic Kampuchea continue to mobilize all their physical and floral force to express their solidarity with and their support for the revolutionary struggles, the struggles for national liberation and the struggles for the defence of national independence that are being waged by the peoples the world over, the non-aligned countries, the third-world countries, and all the countries that love independence, peace and justice. Along side our efforts to defend and build up our country so that it can be rapidly strengthened and developed during the new stage of the revolution, we consider this solidarity and support to be a noble duty. Our country is small, our people are still poor; they have just come out of a devastating war and still have to face the war of aggression by Viet Nam. However, that may be, we shall use all our possibilities and capabilities to demonstrate our support, especially in the moral field and in the determination to struggle against imperialism, expansionism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, apartheid and Zionism.\n136.\tThe problem which is before this session of the General Assembly , as it has been before other sessions, is the following. Must all these demoniac forces be allowed to Cast a slur on and destroy the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of various countries in the world, to sow dissension and to trample under foot the inalienable right of the peoples to decide their own destiny?\t'\n137.\tTake, for example, the Korean problem. In 1975, the General Assembly adopted resolution 3390 B (XXX). The Government of the Democratic People's Re public of Korea, under the leadership of President Kim H Sung, proposed certain reasonable measures to solve the Korean; problem\nindependently and peacefully, without foreign intervention. But the United States of America is obstinate in carrying out its policy of aggression and division of Korea, violating with impunity the provisions of resolution 3390 B (XXX). We demand that the United States of America withdraw all its troops and dismantle all its military bases in South Korea, that it stop interfering in the internal affairs of Korea and carrying out its policy of \\\"two Koreas\\\", and that it dissolve the so-called \\\"United Nations Command\\\" and transform the military Armistice Agreement into a peace agreement. The problem of the reunification of Korea has to be solved by the Korean people themselves.\n138.\tAnother example is that of Walvis Bay, which is an integral part of Namibia. There should be no ambiguity that would make it possible for the colonialists and racists of South Africa to continue to control that port. Namibia has to be independent in the enjoyment' of its territorial integrity. We have always resolutely supported the struggles of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania for independence and the right of those peoples to decide their own destiny.\n139.\tThe independence, unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of each country and the right of each people to decide its own destiny are sacred and inalienable.\n140.\tWe think that our General Assembly can carry out its task only if it stands firmly on the side of the peoples which are struggling and resolutely opposes all acts of expansion or dissension directed against a country and all acts that cast a slur on its independence.\n141.\tWe have always firmly supported the struggle of the Palestinian people and of all the Arab peoples. We understand perfectly well the struggle against Israeli Zionism, for at present our people are shedding their blood to prevent Viet Nam from annexing and swallowing Kampuchea's territory and exterminating the Kampuchean race as the Israeli Zionists have acted against the Palestinian people and annexed Arab territories. The true nature of Viet Nam is identical to that of Zionism. The Palestinian people must be allowed-to exercise their national rights, in particular the right to return to live in their motherland, the right to decide their own destiny and the right to create an independent State on Palestinian land. The Arab territories must be returned to the Arab countries.\n142.\tWe have always resolutely supported the struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America for independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, for their right to decide their own destiny for themselves, and for the establishment of a new international economic order.\n143.\tIn a situation where the forces of the imperialist and expansionist big Powers have been everywhere attacked and paralysed by the peoples the world over, the struggle to defend and safeguard independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and the right to decide one's own destiny has continued to develop progressively. The people of Kampuchea, who are shedding their blood so that the banners of national independence, national honour and dignity may always fly high over the soil of Democratic Kampuchea, are resolutely in solidarity with the struggle of the peoples the world over for the triumph of the cause of\nthe revolution, the cause of national liberation and the cause of national independence. The future of the struggle of the peoples the world over is brilliant.\n144.\tOur present session of the General Assembly can make a direct contribution to this struggle. In this sense, Mr. President, you have assumed an important role in our work. We should like to express to you our congratulations and to wish you great success in the fulfilment of your high functions.\n"

His election is a unanimous endorsement by the international community of his outstanding qualifications and qualities and the constructive and positive role played by his country, Colombia, in the work of the United Nations. My delegation is confident that his mature knowledge of the work of the United Nations in this contemporary age will bring clear insight and guidance to the proceedings of this regular session of the General Assembly.\n296.\tI should like to convey warm and sincere congratulations to Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who presided over the thirty\\\" second session and three important special sessions of the General Assembly with efficiency, dedication and wisdom. He won the admiration of the world community through his outstanding contribution to the success of those sessions.\n297.\tI take this opportunity also to thank the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the comprehensive report this year in which he has evaluated the work of his Organization /A/33/1J and for his effective and untiring efforts deployed in the service of international peace and co-operation and the achievement of the objectives and ideals of this Organization.\n298.\tThe delegation of Maldives welcomes and congratulates the people of Solomon Islands, a sovereign and independent State, on that country's admission to the United Nations family as its one hundred and fiftieth Member. The accession to independence of that island group is a tribute to the important role played by the United Nations in the field of decolonization. Its admission to our family is a significant step forward in the eradication of colonialism and it brings our Organization closer to the attainment of its goal of universality.\n299.\tMy delegation deems it important to recall the three special sessions of the General Assembly held earlier this year. They highlighted the urgency and gravity of and global concern over the problems dealt with during those sessions.\n300.\tThe situation in the Middle East has been changing rapidly. It remains in an uncertain state of frustration. Recent developments, also, left behind some of the fundamental aspirations of the peoples concerned and the international community. The United Nations resolutions, especially Security Council resolution 242 (1967), remain ineffective. The demographic and physical changes in the sacred land of Jerusalem and in the occupied Arab land still continue. The inalienable legitimate rights of the Palestinian people must be recognized. A just and lasting peace can be achieved only through the participation of their authentic representative, the Palestine Liberation Organization, in all deliberations. The people of Palestine have been subjected to extreme hardship and insecurity for far too long and their right to settle in their legitimate and true homeland should be recognized.\n301.\tToday, in this modern world, while the peoples of some nations enjoy a life of convenience, we cannot sit and ignore a whole community of people that is being deprived of a homeland as a result of imperialism and foreign occupation of their land by force. It is imperative that a comprehensive solution be sought and that will be possible only after Israel has withdrawn unconditionally from every inch of the occupied Arab land. We have lived far too long with this sad and complex problem, and no progress towards a comprehensive solution has been made. It is surely the duty of the international community to leave no stone unturned and no leaf unswept in clearing the way for a just and lasting settlement. We must end the sufferings of the people of Palestine. They want to live in peace and security in a homeland of their own. In thinking about this, the world community and the parties immediately concerned must show greater wisdom so as to bring about a solution which will not result in further dissection of the Middle East and in particular of the Arab world. All actions must be guided by the need for justice and permanent peace.\n302.\tWhile we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights let us make a pledge that the coming years will free the world from the evils of inhuman practices. Today, racism, apartheid and colonial domination have become household words. Those words have often been linked with the situation prevailing in the African continent. The remaining tentacles of colonialism still cling fast to African soil. There is universal recognition of the need for firmer action to blow away the dark cloud that hangs not only over that continent but over the entire globe. The time has come to replace colonial ideology by realism. Human beings cannot be deprived of their right to self-determination and their fundamental freedoms on the basis of colour or creed. In South Africa the indigenous majority of its people is suppressed by an alien minority racist regime. Attempts to put an end to that unacceptable situation in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa have been frustrated by further inhuman and calculated repressive policies of the minority regimes.\n303.\tThe South African regime, which withdrew its acceptance of the plan for bringing independence to\nNamibia under the auspices of the United Nations as a challenge to the Charter of this international body, has brought more shame to this Organization. It is therefore now evident that no permanent settlement can be found for the unfortunate state of affairs prevailing in that great continent unless the principles of justice, equality and self-determination are applied jointly.\n304.\tMaldives has always taken a firm stand on world peace and the question of disarmament. The tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, was especially inspiring to my country, a member of the non-aligned movement, for it set forth the essentials of the new strategy for disarmament, prescribing goals and priorities, upon which future negotiations will be based. Although the achievements of the session cannot be interpreted in tangible terms, we hold the opinion that our deliberations took us a step closer to a comprehensive solution that would make the world more peaceful. We reaffirm our commitment to the United Nations and call upon Member countries to strengthen its capacity to carry out its sacred role through effective implementation of the principles enshrined in its Charter.\n305.\tAnother item on this session's agenda is the question of the implementation of the New International Economic Order. It is a universally recognized fact that no one single nation, whatever its economic capacity or technological advancement, can build its economy in isolation from the rest of the world. We have good reason to believe that as the nations of the world are becoming more and more interdependent the United Nations and its co-ordinating bodies can solve the existing global economic problems only through efforts of collective action. However, this goal seems to be drifting further away as the years go by since this Organization adopted resolute measures to combat the economic disparities among nations. The United Nations is now fully aware of all the dimensions of the problem, and we should certainly be wrong if we considered that it was in the interest of the developed countries to rectify the faults in the current economic situation and not change to a different order based on more fair, just and equitable international relations.\n306.\tWe know too well that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer as time goes by, and no progress has been made to narrow the gap between the developed and the developing countries. It is the opinion of my delegation that the global economic relations must improve to establish an international relationship that could lead to a stable and prosperous world which would be beneficial to all. \n307.\tIt has been our sincere hope and desire to make the Indian Ocean, which washes the shores of our nation, a zone of peace. Maldives will continue its efforts both inside and outside the United Nations to achieve that objective and keep that zone free from conflict and great-Power rivalry.\n308.\tMaldives, being an island country which largely depends on the resources of the sea, attaches great importance to the outcome of the recent session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. We view the achievements of that session with great hope and optimism.\n309.\tThe Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, which was recently held in Buenos Aires, highlighted some very important aspects of cooperation among developing countries. The efforts being made to bring the countries of the world to an equal level of economic participation and co-operation are viewed by my country with interest. Maldives has always believed that emphasis should be placed on involving all developing countries in order to share the benefits of technological progress. The gap between the developed and the developing countries has become far too wide. Therefore the grassroots of disparity which are the smaller gaps that exist between developing countries themselves will first have to be bridged.\nIn conclusion, I wish to add here that it was not the intention of my delegation to elaborate on the state of the internal political structure of our country and the continued efforts being made by the people of Maldives to improve the socio-economic level of their life. It is mainly because our problems, difficulties and achievements have been recognized and fully exposed to our close neighbours and sympathetic friends all over the world who are a great source of inspiration to us. However, it is somewhat disheartening to note that in a number of recent articles the international media failed to see our problems and our achievements in their true perspective. The fact is that Maldives was relatively little known to the world until its political independence in 1965, and it has never at any time had the intention of propagating publicity about itself, realizing that its energies and resources are limited and more needed for upgrading the quality of life of its people. Those who have visited our country will bear witness to those facts. Maldives hopes that the international media will understand its internal structure and external relations in a more realistic manner.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff87.\tMr. President, I am pleased by the happy coincidence that in my first statement in this debate in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile the General Assembly should be presided over by one of the most distinguished members of the Latin-American community, Mr. Indalecio Lievano. Your outstanding merits, together with the dynamism and wisdom that marked your service as your country's chief, diplomatist for several years, make you worthy of a glowing and exceptional tribute. Your election further represents a demonstration of appreciation of Colombia, which has contributed so much towards peaceful coexistence and the furtherance of human rights in America.\n88.\tI take this opportunity to welcome to the international community Solomon Islands, with which we feel particularly linked by the Pacific Ocean. We feel certain that Solomon Islands will provide valuable co-operation in the cause of peace and will support the principles which prevail here.\n89.\tIn this general debate, in which the chairman of each delegation expresses his views, his concern and his suggestions on the most important international events, I wish to express first the eager desire of all Chileans for peace, co-operation, broad-minded views and understanding.\n90.\tThe desire for peace and justice is often discussed within an emotional and selfish environment. What we want is unity, but this requires great generosity, which is often absent from international relations.\n91.\tThese feelings prompt me, on behalf of the Government and people of Chile, to pay public homage to the memory of His Holiness Pope John Paul I, who, despite his short pontificate, brought faith, love and hope to the world. At the very time of his death he was pleading for peace. His short but heartfelt plea was addressed to all of us in order that through dialogue we might come to understand each other. In one of his few official messages, addressed to the bishops of Chile and Argentina, he said:\n\\\"We wish to encourage all laudable and worthy initiatives designed to protect and spread peace and calling for the co-operation of all good, just, honest and righteous people.\\\"\n92.\tI hope that the Pontiffs inspiring words will guide us in our work in this General Assembly as well as in relations between Member States.\n93.\tThis Assembly is meeting in a critical atmosphere which affects the actions of international organizations. Despite the enormous task performed by this Organization, we cannot ignore the fact that among our peoples there is frustration and scepticism with regard to the work carried out here. There is a gradual loss of faith in the United Nations. There is no relation between the seriousness of our performance and the receptiveness of public opinion.\n94.\tYear after year the world listens to these extended debates, hoping for an adequate response to the legitimate aspirations of the peoples. But we have not yet found the way to a happy future. Despite the work performed by this Organization, we must honestly admit that it has not always met the vital requirements of mankind. Nothing is achieved by making lengthy speeches containing whatever statements anyone wishes to make. That is a dialogue of the deaf.\n95.\tIt is with deep concern that I must point out the danger involved in the progressive loss of faith felt by many people in the effectiveness of this Organization. The serious and positive task performed within the Organization is minimized by some nations' political and selfish use of it, which prevents the adoption of objective resolutions. These negative tendencies usually affect the weaker countries.\n96.\tWe are facing a struggle between hegemonic blocs\u2014to which we are opposed\u2014whereby the fundamental principles that gave rise to this Organization are constantly endangered. This compels some less powerful nations to shelter under the protection of the great Powers. This situation endangers the historical and cultural values that give its particular life to each people and give expression to its legitimate identity as a sovereign State.\n97.\tIt is therefore necessary to point out certain problems, such as the difficulty in making decisions, the ineffectiveness of some procedures, the politicization and absence of objectivity in examining situations affecting certain countries, the policy of blocs and the tendency to solve common problems outside the framework of the Organization, all of which are gravely eroding the prestige that the United Nations should preserve.\n98.\tIt is also essential that this forum cease to be, for some, the trench from which the most brutal attack is launched against an opponent, and that instead it serve as an inspiring source of understanding and respect.\n99.\tWe must think about this reality. It is our duty to overcome this through united action. Chile, which was one of the founders of this Organization, continues to put its faith and hope in the United Nations: its faith in the great principles and objectives that inspire the Organization, and its hope in the ability ultimately to build, through international co-operation, a world without fear, a world in which poverty, malnutrition and lack of culture will become things of the past, and solidarity will replace the threat or use of force.\n100.\tChile believes in political, economic and social co-operation among the peoples, in the interdependence of nations, and in the absolute need for peace, justice and security to prevail within the framework of the dignity and mutual respect that nations deserve. To this end it is indispensable that in each circumstance and at all times the high principles of law enunciated in the Charter be applied.\n101.\tTherefore we reaffirm that our international policy is based on the obligation to settle disputes peacefully and not to use or threaten the use of force against the integrity or political independence of States or to intervene in any form, regardless of the motives, in their internal affairs. Those principles, together with respect for the self-determination of the peoples and strict compliance, in good faith, with obligations undertaken and with decisions of international organizations or courts of justice, are and will continue to be the basis of international relations.\n102.\tInternational law is designed to rule relations between States, as internal law rules relations among the citizens of a country. Violation of the law results in the obstruction of peace and gives rise to disruption and chaos. If we really aim at achieving a world in which tranquillity reigns we must apply all our skill and determination to ensure that the law retains all the majesty of its inestimable worth through full and unrestricted respect for it. Only in this way shall we be able to comply with the wise principles of this Organization.\n103.\tDue acknowledgement should be given to the fact that the United Nations has, throughout the 33 years of its existence, attempted to apply these same principles in order to establish peace and security, achieve economic co-operation and decolonization, and promote the progressive development of international law.\n104.\tEven though results have not been spectacular, anyone who examines in good faith the task performed will have to acknowledge its broad scope-especially the fact that it paved the way for progress from which the international conscience will allow no retrogression.\n105.\tI shall refer briefly to but a few of the international problems to be considered by the Assembly at this session.\n106.\tIn the search for stable peace in the Middle East, despite the continued efforts of our Secretary-General-to whose efforts I wish to pay a tribute-the United Nations has not achieved the desired success, undoubtedly because of the special characteristics of the problem and because of the contingent interests of some of the great Powers. Fortunately, the desire for peace on the part of the peoples and Governments most affected by this conflict, as well as the mediation efforts of the President of the United States, enable us to envisage optimistically a possible solution. My Government earnestly hopes that the agreements reached will lead to a comprehensive settlement of the profound differences which have prevailed so far.\n107.\tWe are also concerned over the tragedy afflicting the people of Lebanon. The United Nations should speed up its efforts to ensure that that country-the cradle of so ancient a civilization which had succeeded in preserving its unity through mutual tolerance-survives as a State, with full territorial sovereignty and political independence.\n108.\tWe wish the African continent peace and prosperity. We believe that its problems should be solved by the\nAfrican countries themselves, through their regional organization and without any foreign intervention. They have their own identity and are eagerly and tenaciously engaged in building their future. A continent which is expected to play an even more important part within the international spectrum should not be-exposed to actions arising from outside the area, motivated by the unacceptable desire to take advantage of its problems. Therefore, we condemn foreign intervention in Africa or in any other part of the world.\n109.\tIn the face of each conflict situation in connexion with that continent calling for a decision by this Organization Chile has maintained a consistent position, which I reaffirm here today. This has been especially true of our attitude in the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and in the United Nations Council for Namibia ever since their establishment.\n110.\tWe assign overriding importance to that region of the world because we are convinced that, on the basis of mutual interests, we can forge solid links of understanding with the nations of Africa. We offer them our co-operation, which in certain specific cases is already effective, and at the same time we request their assistance.\n111.\tNor are the nations of Asia and Oceania exempt from foreign intervention. Their enormous efforts to solve vital problems are being obstructed by the continued interference of forces which in no way help to satisfy the aspirations of those peoples.\n112.\tIndeed, America is no exception to this rule in international activities. We hope that the delicate problems peculiar to the region will be solved on the basis of respect for the law, the only source of peace in our continent.\n113.\tI would be less than candid if I failed to voice Chile's disappointment at the scant progress made towards disarmament. While this matter is a complex one and is closely related to security, achievements have been discouraging for those of us who regard armed peace essentially unstable. The accumulation of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction constitutes a growing threat to peace.\n114.\tToday peace continues to be maintained by what is justly known as the \\\"balance of terror\\\". Should this balance be upset, mankind could be exterminated. Therefore there is no problem more urgent than that of finding the way to disarmament. Only when the arms race has ceased and the arsenals of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction have been reduced will the world feel relief. Until then, the peoples will continue to witness with astonishment the squandering of vast resources which, if applied to goals of humanitarian co-operation, could put an end to the misery and hunger that affect millions of human beings.\n115.\tSome will say that small countries cannot do much when it comes to disarmament except lend, their moral support in the efforts exerted\u2014or which should be exerted\u2014by the great Powers. Nevertheless, it must be recognized that the arms race has not been limited to those\nPowers; like gangrene, it has spread, and is now seen in countries at a medium or low stage of development.\n116.\tThe lack of confidence in the ability of international machinery to prevent conflicts or settle them appropriately and expeditiously has induced many countries to embark upon an arms race which drains their economic resources. Hidden influences, attempting to create a climate of distrust, also prompt them towards an illogical and disproportionate arms build-up, and the merchants of death take advantage of this situation. To deny this would be to shut our eyes to a sad reality.\n117.\tConsequently the need arises for establishing mandatory procedures for the settlement of international disputes. It is the duty of the United Nations to provide them. Possibly these objectives could be achieved most appropriately through the use of regional organizations; the Charter envisages the necessary interdependence of those bodies and the world Organization.\n118.\tAmong these regional systems, the oldest and, in its time, the most dynamic was the inter-American system. Thirty years ago, a covenant concerning the peaceful and mandatory settlement of disputes was signed in Bogota. Chile is a party to that covenant. We believe that its observance by all the countries of the system would provide the security our peoples desire. Pending the achievement of this objective, for which we should persevere, we shall have to sign bilateral agreements.\n119.\tEarly in this century Chile and Argentina set an example to the world in this respect. Seventy-six years ago our countries signed a treaty on the limitation of naval armaments,  together with another on mandatory arbitration. The latter was in force for 70 years and made possible the settlement of important differences. Before it was denounced, a treaty on the judicial settlement of disputes1 4 was signed; it compels the parties to submit to the International Court of Justice all disputes, regardless of their nature, that might for any reason arise between them, and on which a settlement has not been reached, through direct negotiation.\n120.\tI wish to recall here the efforts made by the countries of our continent, in connexion with the limitation of weapons on the regional level. Chile, together with other American States, signed the Declaration of Ayacucho. On 22 June, on the occasion of the session of the General Assembly of the OAS held in Washington, D.C., it was agreed to expedite that initiative, and we most enthusiastically endorse that proposal.\n121.\tMy country is especially interested in the development of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the task of which it is to prepare an international convention on that important matter. In this regard, credit must be given to the progress achieved by that Conference. Among its principal achievements is the acceptance of a 200-mile exclusive economic zone, a new international concept in the elaboration of which Chile participated actively from the start.\n122. However, it is essential that existing difficulties in connexion with those negotiations be settled so that the Conference may complete its task in 1979, thus permitting the signing of a universal convention in 1980 in Caracas.\n123. In this regard, we cannot conceal our concern at the preparation of unilateral legislation for the exploitation of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, which constitutes the common heritage of mankind. The Government of Chile fully shares and decidedly endorses the recent statement of the Group of 77, which declares such actions null and void under international law and further points out the dangers which they could represent for the successful conclusion of those important negotiations.\n124.\tThe Government of Chile is not concerned with political tensions only. The developing countries have continued to insist on the need for the creation of a new system governing international economic relations. The new international economic order, which we advocate, would allow the two-thirds of mankind representing that world to share in the fruitful results of technological advances.\n125.\tIn the last 30 years the world has witnessed the most vigorous and extraordinary expansion of international trade. In view of this process the industrialized countries have constantly increased their share of world trade while the share of the developing countries, particularly in Latin America, in that trade has continually diminished.\n126.\tThe systems governing the transfer of technology to developing nations and foreign investments require, likewise, a profound readjustment to adapt them to the level of interdependence reached in international economic relations.\n127.\tThe Integrated Programme for Commodities, which should represent an example of collective equity in the treatment of an essential tool for development, is today an example of impatience and frustration.\n128.\tAll these important aspects of international life will be considered at the fifth session of UNCTAD next year in Manila. At that session the degree of compliance with the main agreements reached in Nairobi in 1976 will be reviewed, unless real progress is made in the next few months. While expressing my desire for the success of the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities,\nwhich will resume on 14 November next, I offer my country's sincere co-operation in order that the meeting of UNCTAD in Manila may result in a positive contribution to the realization of the aspirations of the developing countries.\n129.\tThese problems and many others have not been solved because of the lack of political will of the industrialized nations. The North-South dialogue, sponsored by the President of France, failed precisely because of the absence of that political will. Furthermore, some of those industrialized nations, under the pressure of internal unemployment, have reached the contradictory position of abandoning the free trade, which was the basis of their prosperity, in favour of the protectionism which caused their bankruptcy in the decade of the 1930s.\n130.\tThis new and dangerous trend seriously and directly affects the developing countries. Because of their limited domestic markets their growth expectations are limited to the real possibilities for their raw materials and their manufactured products to have access to the markets of the industrialized countries.\n131.\tProtectionism is a threat to the progress of the developing world and a disturbing element as regards the political stability of the international community. It constitutes a form of unacceptable neo-interventionism. Time will prove that it also contains its own seeds of self-destruction.\n132.\tI now wish to refer to a matter to which my country has always attached the utmost importance. I am referring to human rights.\n133.\tI reaffirm today what we have been contending for years: the undoubted international jurisdiction and competence of the United Nations as regards human rights. That competence stems not only from the provisions of the Charter but also from the concept that the human being is superior to all intellectual creations and all legal structures and therefore the protection of his essential rights should be one of the major concerns of the international community.\n134.\tNevertheless it is obvious that such international competence must be in harmony with the legitimate exercise of the internal sovereignty of States. That harmony between the two jurisdictions is difficult to achieve. However, I believe that the solution is. contained in the Charter of the United Nations itself when it states wisely and cautiously, that in matters of human rights, co-operation between the international organizations and the State involved should be sought.\n135.\tThat concept of co-operation also implies that the matter of human rights should not be handled on the basis of political criteria used to make judgements, present or historical, on certain regimes,, but for the sole and highly significant purpose of improving the enjoyment of human rights in a particular State and in specific circumstances\n134. Cooperation means, that between the competent organ of the United Nations, and the sovereign State there\nmust be a dialogue in conditions of equity and with respect for their respective competence, prerogatives and rights.\n137.\tFully respecting this concept of co-operation, the Government of Chile readied an agreement with the Ad Hoc Working Group appointed by the Commission on Human Rights. That agreement did not affect the independence, competence or effectiveness of the Group, but rather ensured respect for the dignity and rights of the sovereign State. On that basis the Group visited my country and thus fully carried out its mandate.\n138.\tI believe that this co-operation by Chile establishes a valuable historical precedent. However, it is indispensable that such a precedent be used most carefully and objectively. Only in this way can other countries be prompted to accept, as Chile has, the visits of competent and credible commissions to their territories.\n139.\tThe organs of the United Nations must therefore act with the highest motives and with great moderation and caution; above all, they must be above political motivations and strictly subject to the rules of procedure which the Organization has determined according to the principles of the Charter and those pertaining to natural equity. Only in this way can those organs fulfil their mandate, earn, the respect of the public opinion of the country visited, and establish between the Government and the international Organization the confidence which it indispensable if co-operation is to be reciprocal, respected and useful.\n140.\tCountries which do not share this position should be consistent in their attitude and not demand from others what they are not willing to accept-themselves. We should recall that there are important Powers which in 1948 did not even subscribe to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, alleging that that Declaration implied the possibility of interference in their internal affairs, an attitude which is still obstinately maintained.\n141.\tThe precedent created by my country enables the United Nations to give effect to the concern of its founders with human rights. From now on it cannot be alleged that those principles are a dead letter, that theory is separated from reality, or that the international community is unable to find the means and procedures to ensure universal respect for those rights.\n142.\tThe Government of Chile also expresses its concern for problems deriving from the international conduct of the great Powers. They have the greatest responsibility in the search for a lasting peace based on full respect for the principles of international law and the sovereignty of States. None the less, there are super-Powers which do not stop- at physical aggression against other nations in order to impose their ideological hegemony; and there are others which respect those principles in general but nevertheless . use their economic power to exercise pressure on third countries.\n143.\tIn view of those alternatives, it is difficult to be a medium-sized or small nation. Nevertheless, Chile is confident that this; situation may be eliminated for good, provided the great Powers in their bilateral relations abide by one of the most fundamental principles of the United\nNations Charter, that of respect for the sovereignty of States.\n144.\tI have outlined the position of Chile in connexion with certain problems confronting the United Nations. We are aware of the Organization's performance in the fields, among others, of co-operation between peoples, the progressive development of international law, decolonization and the quest for peace, all of which we fully support.\n145.\tWe reaffirm our firm intention of complying with the principles and rules which inspired the Charter we adopted in San Francisco. We are certain that we can thus contribute to the supreme cause of peace.\n146.\tOnly v. hen all States comply with obligations voluntarily undertaken and accept in good faith the resolutions deriving there from shall we establish a healthy and effective international relationship.\n147.\tChile invites all States represented here to contribute to the achievement of that high objective and hopes for friendly relations with all of them, based on mutual respect, and with none of the hegemony often exercised through political pressures or by the fomenting o' internal differences. Otherwise, confidence and harmony will not prevail.\n148.\tI would not wish to end without appealing to the members of the international community, whatever may be the ideological and political differences between us, to renew their efforts to make a reality of the ideals which led to the foundation of this international organization \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff135.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany at present holds the presidency of the European Community and in the European Political Co-operation. Therefore, I should like to begin, Sir, by addressing you in my capacity as the spokesman of the nine member countries of the European Community. Let me first carry out a particularly pleasant duty by congratulating you on your assuming your high office. In you we greet the distinguished representative of a country with which the members of the Community maintain close and friendly relations. I am confident that you will give the thirty-third session of the General Assembly firm and effective leadership.\n136.\tWe also congratulate the outgoing President, who was probably the first to preside over four General Assembly sessions-the thirty-second regular session and the eighth, ninth and tenth special sessions. During those sessions we were able to admire the skill with which he guided the proceedings and conducted negotiations.\n137.\tOur Community also thanks the Secretary-General, who has continuously and untiringly placed himself at the service of the United Nations. We appreciate his efforts to manage the many divergent trends and currents within our Organization for the benefit of us all.\n138.\tIt gives me special pleasure to welcome a new Member in our midst\u2014Solomon Islands. With the admission of every new Member we are moving ever closer to our common aim of the universality of the United Nations.\n139.\tThe world today is in a state of transition, with two realities and philosophies in conflict with one another. The one reality is that of power politics. It finds expression in a gigantic arms build-up, which is constantly escalating and spreading to more and more regions, including regions of the third world. Behind this is the obsolete idea that a State can best safeguard its interests by force and by striving for predominance.\n140.\tThe other, the new, reality is global interdependence. Today, all States need reliable access to the markets of others, to the technology of others, to the raw materials of others. They all need the growth of others to stimulate their own growth. They need co-operation in the fight against international terrorism. They need co-operation to protect the threatened ecological balance.\n141.\tIn our complex world, however, this cannot be achieved by means of power politics. Force means chaos and destruction; force means bondage and loss of freedom for all. But co-operation for everyone's benefit can result only from an order that is accepted by all nations because all nations consider it to be just and because it is in their own interest to contribute to it.\n142.\tIt is this perception that engenders a new international consciousness and awareness. It is nourished by respect for the independence and equality of States, by joint decisions and joint responsibilities of all, by the settlement of conflicts through negotiation and the reconciliation of interests.\n143.\tIt is this consciousness that will determine the future. No one can turn back the wheel of history, however strong and powerful he may be. This world of ours, confronted as it is with huge common tasks, cannot but drift into self-destruction if countries still persist in trying to steer its fortunes by outmoded power politics.\n144.\tThis new consciousness, this awareness of interdependence, gave birth to the Europe of the Community, which believes in a future of equality and partnership all over the world. The Europe we are building aims at realizing the great idea of the dignity and rights of man. It is by its very nature a democratic Europe. It is open to other European democracies, and we are looking forward to the accession of Greece, Portugal and Spain, making the Community of nine members soon a community of twelve. We feel ourselves linked with those European democracies which for reasons of historical tradition or other reasons have not, or have not yet, become members of the Community.\n145.\tHowever, the Europe of the nine is not an inward- looking community. Indeed, it endeavours in the wider world as well to promote peace and the welfare of all. It is the biggest trading partner in the world, especially for the third world, and it is the biggest donor of development assistance. It wants to be a centre of co-operation in the world, and it sees itself on the side of those who seek to create an order for that co-operation founded on equality and partnership.\n146.\tWe want one world in which the nations will meet the challenge of global interdependence through global co-operation. But we by no means want a uniform world\u2014quite the contrary; we want a world in which all nations can themselves determine their political, economic and cultural ways of life. Mankind needs diversity if its creative forces are not to fade away.\n147.\tThe European Community is founded on respect for the equality of all its members and on the principle of joint decision-making. On the strength of these qualities and principles it can serve as an example for a global order giving all States, big and small, the same right and the same opportunity to play a part in the shaping of their common future. It can also serve as an example of the countries of a region forming an association and combining their efforts so as to accomplish the tasks at hand and to strengthen the independence, the political stability and the economic growth of that region.\n148.\tWe are glad to see that the idea of regional association among States with equal rights is gaining ground in all parts of the world, and we support this trend.\n149.\tUnder the Lome Convention we are co-operating with 53 African, Pacific and Caribbean States. Another expression of the new form of interregional co-operation is the Euro-Arab dialogue, with which both sides are pursuing the common goal of placing the interdependence of the two regions on a stable basis of comprehensive and long-term co-operation. In Asia, the Europe of the Community is establishing ever closer links with the Association of South-East Asian Nations.\n150.\tWe follow with great interest also the work of other regional organizations, in particular, the Organization of African Unity and the Organization of American States.\n151.\tThe Europe of the Community welcomes the fact that the People's Republic of China is becoming more outward-looking, as is in keeping with its size and its political weight. The trade agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Community expresses the desire of both sides constantly to expand their economic relations and exchanges.\n152.\tIt is now my privilege to describe the role of the Europe of the Community in the world and thus our\nposition on the central issues up for discussion at this thirty-third session of the General Assembly.\n153.\tAs in previous years the conflicts in Africa and the Middle East again figure prominently on the agenda. With both those regions the Europe of the Community is most closely connected. We have a vital interest in the peaceful settlement of those conflicts.\n154.\tIn large parts of Africa peace has been seriously disrupted. Many African States are in the difficult process of nation-building. In southern African an end to racial discrimination and independence for Namibia are still to be achieved. Thus Africa is confronted with the difficult task of settling internal and external conflicts by peaceful means and at the same time promoting its economic development. The rest of the world must assist Africa in this task. But, instead, conflicts are being aggravated by outside Powers which use the opportunities provided by those conflicts to establish new spheres of influence in Africa. Africa needs peace and Africa needs economic development. It needs, as the Nigerian Head of State said at the Fifteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held at Khartoum from 18 to 22 July 1978: \\\".. . massive economic assistance ... and not military hardware for self-destruction and sterile ideological slogans\\\",\n155.\tWe, the members of the Community, support the countries of Africa in their quest for peaceful development. We do not seek to impose our political and social system on Africa. We want to see an independent and united Africa whose nations will find African solutions and answers to African questions and problems. And with that Africa we want to co-operate on a basis of partnership, that is, on a basis of equality.\n156.\tIn Namibia\u2014after a hopeful development had begun-we are now confronted with a serious situation. The nine members most deeply regret the decision taken by the South African Government to hold elections in Namibia without the United Nations being involved. We are disappointed at this unilateral step taken by the Government of South Africa. Its action brings forth great dangers for Namibia and, beyond that, for the whole of southern Africa. South Africa in this way is playing into the hands of those who advocate violent solutions in southern Africa.\n157.\tOver the last 18 months efforts have been made in dogged and persevering negotiations within the framework of the United Nations to pave the way for Namibia to gain independence by peaceful means. Thanks to the understanding and goodwill of all parties concerned it has proved possible time and again to overcome deadlock, crises and setbacks. The South African Government has now conjured up a new serious crisis which calls into question all the efforts undertaken so far. Where the negotiations had helped so far to develop an atmosphere of confidence, understanding and readiness for compromise, the old differences are now re-emerging. The results achieved in laborious and complex negotiations involving African States as responsible participants-in particular the front-line States-are in jeopardy.\n158.\tThe Europe of the Community supports the appeal made by the Secretary-General to continue efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the Namibia problem on the basis of Security Council resolution 431 (1978) and on the basis of the report of the Secretary-General.  We are convinced that the report by the Secretary-General is in line with the Western plan for Namibia.\n159.\tThe Community urgently appeals to the South African Government to consider the far-reaching consequences of its action. The new South African Government to be formed in the next few days is faced with a historic responsibility. The five Western members of the Security Council-Canada, France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany-yesterday decided to ask for a meeting of the Security Council in the course of this week and they expect that at that meeting the Waldheim report will be accepted. Such a decision should give an opportunity to the new Government of South Africa to reconsider its position, as we have requested it to do. It will then have an opportunity to put developments back on the right track, on a positive track. Without the participation of all political forces in Namibia and without the involvement of the United Nations, a peaceful, internationally recognized settlement is not possible.\n160.\tThe dangerous situation produced by South Africa constitutes a challenge to the people of Namibia, to the United Nations and to all those who struggle to achieve a peaceful and internationally recognized solution to the Namibia problem. Furthermore the opportunity\u2014and nobody should overlook this-to set an example for the peaceful solution of other problems in southern Africa would be missed.\n161.\tWith regard to Zimbabwe, the members of the Community hope that in spite of all difficulties it will still be possible even at this late hour to arrive at a peaceful settlement with the participation of all parties involved. We are convinced that the British-American plan for Rhodesia still offers the most realistic possibility for peaceful transition to independence. The European Community is ready to offer its aid for development to a Zimbabwe which will substitute for the present minority regime an internationally accepted democratic majority Government.\n162.\tThe nine members of the Community are urgently pressing for peaceful and rapid change in the system of apartheid in South Africa itself. That system of racial discrimination is contrary to everything in which the Europe of the Community believes. South Africa is a multiracial society. That society can find a peaceful future only in a State that guarantees the enjoyment of human rights to all and ensures that all can live together as equal citizens.\n163.\tWe appeal to the future Prime Minister who will be elected shortly to make a new beginning here, too. The nine members of the Community are using the influence they have to bring about a change in this direction. We are still waiting for others to follow the code of conduct for companies of the Community in South Africa'0 which is designed to ensure equal treatment for black and white employees. We have furthermore supported the Security Council decision to impose an arms embargo on South Africa.\n164.\tThe eyes of the world are also on the Middle East.\n165.\tThe events that have occurred since the last session of the General Assembly, especially the courageous initiative of President Fl Sadat and the Camp David meetings, have renewed hope for a settlement to the bitter Middle East conflict which has threatened the security of the world for the past 30 years.\n166.\tIn view of the close ties between Europe and the Middle East, efforts to achieve a peace settlement in that region are of vital interest to us, too. This is reflected in our determination to support all efforts to bring about such a settlement.\n167.\tThe nine member States of the European Community have therefore paid a tribute to the achievements of the participants in the Camp David meetings and its successful conclusion. They have expressed their hope that the results of those meetings will represent another important step on the path to a just, comprehensive and therefore lasting peace settlement.\n168.\tIf such a peace settlement is to be achieved it is imperative that all parties concerned participate in its negotiation and completion. Meanwhile no obstacle should be placed in the way of this process, which should be kept open and should through further development and wider participation lead to a comprehensive settlement.\n169.\tProceeding from Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973), which would have to be applied in all their parts and on all fronts, the nine members of the Community continue to believe that the settlement should be founded on the principles which they last set out in their declaration of 29 June 1977 in London, namely: the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force; the need for Israel to end the territorial occupation which it has maintained since the conflict of 1967; respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of every State in the area and its right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries; and recognition that in the establishment of a just and lasting peace account must be taken of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. It remains our firm view that all these aspects must be taken as a whole.\n170.\tWe uphold the view that a peace settlement in the Middle East will be possible only if the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to give effective expression to its national identity is translated into fact. This would take into account the need for a homeland for the Palestinian people.\n\n171.\tIn this context it is important that Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) have been accepted by both Israel and its neighbours. This must be the starting-point for any progress in the peace-making process.\n172.\tThe situation in the Middle East is inseparably linked with the situation in Lebanon. After three years of crisis and conflict the restoration of peace and order and the rebuilding of that country still seem remote. The members of the Community are still deeply concerned about this situation, which threatens not only the existence of Lebanon but the stability of the entire region.\n173.\tOnce more they appeal urgently to all who have an influence on developments in that country to be fully conscious of their responsibility for peace, and they hope that all parties concerned will support efforts to strengthen the authority of the Lebanese Government in the whole territory, as called for in the Security Council resolutions on Lebanon. The members of the Community welcome the fact that the Security Council has renewed the mandate of UNIFIL. They appeal to all parties to give that Force their full support in exercising its mandate.\n174.\tOn the Cyprus question there has still been no breakthrough, A solution to the conflict must be based on the principles of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. It can be achieved only through direct negotiations between the two communities in Cyprus. The United Nations can facilitate such negotiations, but can be no substitute for them. The Republic of Cyprus is linked with the European Community by an association agreement. The Community will continue to give every support to the efforts of the Secretary-General to bring the parties together for constructive negotiations.\n175.\tThe efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflicts in Africa, the Middle East and Cyprus have demonstrated time and again how indispensable is the role of the United Nations peace-keeping forces.\n176.\tThe members of the European Community as well as other responsible Members of the world Organization have consistently contributed to the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations by providing troops, logistic support and financial assistance. They regard it as an urgent task to appeal to the sense of responsibility of all Members of the United Nations and ask them to increase their readiness to support peace-keeping measures. They are for this reason preparing a proposal to that effect for submission to the General Assembly.\n177.\tThe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has provided us with a broad basis on which to shape relations between the Governments and peoples of Eastern and Western Europe. What is important now is to work for the implementation of the Helsinki Final Act in all its parts. The Belgrade follow-up session in 1977 has shown the shortcomings in its implementation, and the Community will call persistently for these to be made good.\n178.\tThe Helsinki Final Act is not important for Europe alone, for detente in Europe and in East-West relations can and should release new political and economic energy to master the great challenge of our times, the elimination of hunger and want from the third world. The developing countries need the support of the Western and of the Eastern industrialized countries. There is nothing they need less than a transfer of the East-West confrontation to their regions.\n179.\tThis year's tenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly, which was devoted to disarmament was an expression of the awareness that all nations of the world have a vital interest in the success of the efforts to achieve arms limitation and disarmament. The members of the Community participated in that session with joint statements and contributions and attach great importance to its results. That session has strengthened by means of institutional reforms world-wide co-operation in pursuit of disarmament, and the Declaration and Programme of Action included in the Final Document of the session [resolution S-10/2] have established a broad framework for that co-operation. The task now is to develop further what has been achieved so far and use it to establish concrete arrangements. The Community will be playing an active role in these efforts. I shall be setting out the position of my own country in detail later on.\n180.\tI should now like to turn to economic issues.\n181.\tIn the world of today growth and development have come to be a joint objective and a joint responsibility of all States. We are confronted with the following challenge: to build up an order of co-operation for the purpose of joint management in global economic interdependence, an order towards the establishment of which all States and all groups of States will make a contribution of their own so as to be able to achieve the dual aim of sustained non-inflationary growth in the industrialized countries and an accelerated and proportionately higher rate of growth in the developing countries.\n182.\tThe establishment of such an order specifically requires the reshaping of North-South relations. In line with the present division of labour, the developing countries are supplying mainly raw materials, and the industrialized countries, above all, finished products. But what we need is an order designed to replace this traditional pattern of exchange by increasingly balanced co-operation and a greater degree of equality in this co-operation, and to provide the countries of the third world with more favourable external conditions for their development.\n183.\tIn concluding the Lome Convention the European Community and the States of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group have in a regionally oriented approach undertaken to remould their relations with these objectives in mind. The Convention has already proved its value in practice, and the contracting parties intend to carry it forward in a new, further improved agreement.\n184.\tWithin the framework of the North-South dialogue the Community is, furthermore, willing to help on a global scale to accelerate development and to establish a balanced pattern of North-South co-operation. It reaffirmed its willingness to work towards the achievement of these goals at the meeting of the European Council held in Bremen from 6 to 7 July 1978.\n185.\tThe European Community is committed to free world trade and is ready to accept the structural changes resulting from open markets and to master the problems they create. It will help to ensure that the negotiations within GATT are brought to a successful conclusion by the end of this year. The purpose of these negotiations is unmistakably to pave the way for further liberalization and once more to create a climate of long-term security for international trade. The negotiations are, furthermore, intended to create favourable conditions, in particular, for an expansion of trade between industrialized and developing countries. The Community intends to keep its markets open and to continue widening access within those markets to products, including finished products, from the developing countries.\n186.\tWe are determined to fight protectionism, which is a manifestation of short-sighted self-interest and is particularly detrimental to the third world. The import planning of the Communist industrial countries is also a form of protectionism, which explains why these countries account for only 4 per cent of the third world's exports.\n187.\tWithin the framework of UNCTAD the Community is helping to achieve constructive results as regards a common fund and individual commodity agreements.\n188.\tOn the question of investment in the field of commodities, new forms of co-operation between industrialized and developing countries must be developed. We must prevent any further shift of the exploration and development of commodities to the industrial countries, something which is happening even though in many cases the developing countries have lower-cost deposits at their disposal.\n189.\tWithin the framework of its comprehensive development strategy, the Community and its member countries will increase the volume of their assistance and improve its quality. The poorest developing countries especially must receive an increasing share of official aid. We also seek to meet the needs of middle-income developing countries. This is why we must soon arrive at satisfactory decisions on replenishing the resources of the World Bank, of IDA, and of the regional banks and funds.\n190.\tIt is due largely to the efforts of the member countries of the Community that the ministerial meeting of UNCTAD  was in a position to take a decision on the question of indebtedness [see A/33/15, part two, annex I, resolution 165(S-IX)]. The Community is promoting the transfer of private capital, which is an indispensable means of maintaining an adequate supply of investment capital for the developing countries and is encouraging the developing countries' access to its own capital markets.\n191.\tIn order to ensure that direct investments contribute fully to the development process, we must at long last evolve reliable guidelines for this field of activity. These guidelines must be designed to meet the host countries' requirement of full control over their economies and the investors' requirement of legal security.\n192.\tIn the field of energy the international community is confronted with the challenge of smoothly leading the world out of the era of oil into an era of new and renewable energy sources. This challenge can only met on the basis of world-wide co-operation. Hence the community welcomes the resolution adopted at the sixty fifth session of the Economic and Social Council recommending that a conference on new and renewable energy sources be convened.\n193.\tSimultaneously with the objective of establishing a more equitable international economic order, nations should pursue the objective of translating an equitable order into reality at home is well. It must be the primary aim of every development policy to satisfy the basic needs of all human beings. The poorest, too must be given the ability and the opportunity to do productive work\n194.\tThe Community considers the acceleration of that development process and the continuous reduction in the gap between rich and poor countries to be the central task of international politics in the last quarter of this century. We will fully contribute to the solution of these problems and we hope that the Communist industrialized countries, too, will begin to provide assistance on a scale commensurate with their economic potential and will open their markets to the manufactures of the developing countries.\n195.\tThe Community offered constructive co-operation at the last session of the Committee established under General Assembly Resolution M?4. or the Committee of the Whole and regrets that the Committee was not vet able to fulfil satisfactorily the tasks assigned to it, but hopes that it will soon be able to continue its work in a constructive manner.\n196.\tIn the view of the Community it is. furthermore. important that we take a decision at tins session of the General Assembly on how to prepare the development strategy for the 1980s. The nations of the third world cannot wait any longer\n197.\tIn December the United Nations will be celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We are conscious that we arc still far from translating that Declaration into reality all over the world. Millions of people are hungry in main parts of the world; millions arc oppressed on account of their race, sex or creed. Tens of thousands of political prisoners languish in camps and prisons. Others are deprived of their citizenship and exiled. And among those persecuted are main whose only \\\"crime\\\" was that they invoked their human rights. This is the reality in the year 1978.\n198.\tNone the less, we must not lose sight of the long-term trend of fusion. Since the proclamation of human rights, people all over the world have increasingly come to demand the realization of their rights, and today human rights are enshrined in the constitutions of most States. But in many countries there is a sharp contrast between constitution and daily practice.\nThrough the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants cm Human Rights, and a number of other obligations, including the Final Act of Helsinki, the rights of man have also become an international concern. Today they are one of the major issues of world politics.\n200.\tHuman rights comprise civil and political as well as economic, social and cultural rights. Freedom from want is no less a human right than freedom from fear, and vice versa. The United Nations has created a number of institutions and procedures to protect human rights. The Community urges that they should be used more effectively, that they should be developed and unproved. It urges also that those countries which have ratified the International Covenants on Human Rights adopted by the United Nations (resolution 2200 A) should indeed implement the provisions of those Covenants. Signature without corresponding action is worth little, The will to implement a treaty must be recognizable to the world public and to the citizens of the country concerned.\n201.\tI should like now to add some remarks on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n202.\tliver since it came into being, the Federal Republic of Germany has pursued a foreign policy for peace. All democratic parties in our country champion the cause of peace. We have a comprehensive understanding of peace: as a guarantee of peaceful, stable co-operation and of the common responsibility of all States, without which the problems facing mankind today cannot be resolved.\n203.\tThe Federal Government's policy is embedded in the nine-member European Community and the alliance with the democracies of North America. Democracy, freedom and human rights are the unmistakable characteristics of this partnership. The close link between free Europe and the United States and Canada is the indispensable prerequisite for our security. This is a factor of world stability, and it is the hope of all who put their faith in freedom and not in oppression and predominance. This transatlantic partnership is more than a community thinking solely in terms of its own security interests. It is based on the great common aims; freedom, independence, the right of self- determination and human rights, not only for ourselves but for all individuals and all nations. That is why this partnership is irreplaceable - no less so than are our values. Upon these foundations we are helping to build bridges of co-operation across the ideological gulf between East and West. We want also to play our part in steadily reducing the disparity in levels of development between North and South.\n204.\tEuropean union and Atlantic partnership are indispensable prerequisites also of our realistic policy of detente and a reconciliation of interests with the countries of Eastern Europe, a policy which we pursue together with our Western partners. The Federal Republic of Germany, by means of the Treaties of Moscow, Warsaw and Prague,  has helped to further the process of detente in Europe and in East-West relations and since the conclusion of those treaties has always been ready to assist in seeking further progress. The Federal Government will continue that policy, which of course is a long-term policy. The policy of detente must take account of the indivisibility of peace all over the world.\n205.\tThe development of the relationship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union is of special significance for continuing detente in Europe. During the state visit which the Soviet Head of State paid to the Federal Republic of Germany last May, both sides reiterated their determination to raise the quality and level of their relations in all fields. By means of a joint declaration and an economic agreement they have again emphasized the long-term character of their relations.\n206.\tThe Federal Government also-indeed particularly- includes the other German State in its policy of detente. No nation has a greater interest in detente than the German nation, for the line dividing East and West runs right through our nation. We aim, in accordance with the Basic Treaty,  to develop co-operation with the German Democratic Republic and to widen the contractual framework of that co-operation. We do so also aware of our responsibility for peace and for people throughout Europe. We wish at the same time to make detente something tangible in the everyday life of the people and, above all, to increase the possibilities for Germans on both sides of the border to come together.\n207.\tOn signing the Treaty of Moscow and the Basic Treaty, the Federal Government emphasized that it remained the aim of its policy to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation would recover its unity in free self-determination. Here, too, we are on the side of progress. No one can halt the course of history. It is moving in the direction of unity, not separation; in the direction of progress, not delimitation. Finally, detente must stand the test especially in the very city that lies at the heart of Europe and at the heart of Germany-Berlin'.\n208.\tThe Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin  has improved the situation of Berlin considerably. I shall not conceal that there are still difficulties, which both sides must help to remove once and for all-all sides must help to remove them. What matters to us is that West Berlin should be able to prosper and develop, and we shall do everything in our power to ensure that it can do so. We do not want to change the existing situation unilaterally. We are maintaining and developing the ties between Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany within the framework prescribed by the Quadripartite Agreement and we shall take care that West Berlin is fully incorporated in international cooperation. The strict observance and full application of the Quadripartite Agreement is a major prerequisite for lasting detente in the centre of Europe. Berlin is a symbol and a touchstone of the readiness for detente and co-operation between East and West.\n209.\tIn order to safeguard peace under the conditions of East-West relations there must be a balance of military power. To ensure and maintain that balance is the goal of the security policy which the Federal Republic of Germany pursues, together with its partners in the Alliance. It is our desire to secure that balance, not through an increased build-up of arms but through arms limitation and disarmament. What we want is a stable balance at a lower level,\n210.\tThe Federal Government hopes for an early and successful conclusion of the second series of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. In a system of military balance between the alliances, the Soviet nuclear medium-range missiles should not be left out of consideration. Soviet superiority in this field is a source of concern to us. In the interests of true stability it is necessary that this existing imbalance should be reduced, including also the so-called grey area.\n211.\tThe aim pursued by the Federal Republic of Germany, together with its allies, in the Vienna talks on mutual and balanced force reduction is to establish approximate parity in Central Europe, in the form of a common collective over-all ceiling for ground forces and a reduction of tank disparity. An important result of the visit to Bonn of the Soviet Head of State was that in the joint declaration issued with Chancellor Schmidt the principle of parity was expressly recognized for the first time in an East-West statement. The joint declaration says:\n\\\"Both sides deem it important that no one should seek military superiority. They proceed on the assumption that approximate equality and parity suffice to safeguard defence.\\\"\n212.\tThis principle must now be translated into reality. In order to achieve, by means of reductions, true parity between East and West in the heart of Europe, the two sides must first agree on the data basis. The discussion on data is therefore now the main topic of the Vienna negotiations and will be continued.\n213.\tDisclosure of military budgets and confidence- building measures such as the exchange of observers during manoeuvres are therefore important preliminary steps towards verified arms limitation and disarmament.\n214.\tThe Federal Republic of Germany therefore supports all measures calculated to make the balance of military power more transparent and in this way to build up more confidence. It has played a part in the preparatory work done by the Secretary-General to ensure disclosure and comparability of military budgets. The limitation and reduction of nuclear weapons and the non-proliferation of these weapons are of world-wide importance.\n2)5. We appeal once again to all countries that have not yet done so to accede at long last to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n216.\tAlong with the efforts to promote nuclear arms limitation and non-proliferation, the efforts to limit and reduce conventional forces must also be stepped up. The tenth special session of the General Assembly, on disarmament, rightly emphasized this requirement.\n217.\tThe greatly increased volume of weapons transferred has become a problem of the first order. This transfer must be restricted by supplying and recipient countries jointly. The Federal Republic of Germany does not supply any weapons to areas of tension. Moreover, only in exceptional cases does it allow arms to be supplied to countries outside the alliance. The proportion of our arms exports to the third world is 0.2 per cent of our over-all exports.\n218.\tWe consider it intolerable that the world spends in the region of $400 billion every year for military purposes. This is a threat to peace; in a world in which there is much poverty and hunger, this is a challenge to reason and to our moral conscience. It is time that this money was released and earmarked for the economic and social development of all nations, thus also serving to increase the security of every nation.\n219.\tInternational terrorism has become an acute problem of increasingly threatening proportions. It can be stopped only if all countries co-operate in a spirit of solidarity.\n220.\tAs long ago as the thirty-first regular session of the General Assembly the Federal Government proposed that an international convention be concluded on measures to prevent the taking of hostages.10 The Committee drafting such a convention has undoubtedly made progress, and I would ask the General Assembly to extend its mandate in accordance with its recommendation.\n221.\tThe countries participating in the Bonn Economic Summit Conference declared their willingness to intensify their joint efforts in the fight against aircraft hijacking in particular,  In cases where a country refuses to extradite aircraft hijackers or to take court action against them, air traffic with that country is to be discontinued. This is an important step forward and other Governments are called upon to join us in this action.\n222.\tI spoke earlier about the task of jointly managing world economic interdependence. The Federal Republic of Germany is conscious of the responsibility that falls on it as the world's second largest trading country in carrying out this task,\n223.\tAt the Bonn Economic Summit Conference in July we promised that, in order to strengthen our growth we would introduce additional measures to stimulate demand costing about 1 per cent of the gross national product. That promise has been kept.\n224.\tIn the months, indeed years, previous to that we had, moreover, already helped considerably to promote economic activity and growth in the countries with which we trade. In the first half of 1978 our imports increased in real terms by 8 per cent. They increased much faster than our exports and were considerably higher than those of nearly all other major industrialized countries.\n225.\tWith an inflation rate of 2.4 per cent in August 1978, the Federal Republic of Germany is close to price stability. It exports growth and stability, and 1 thank you, Mr. President, for yourself having explicitly expressed appreciation of this.\n226.\tMy country is also making its full contribution in promoting the development of the third world.\n227.\t\\\"We are firmly in favour of ensuring a steady increase in exports of manufactures from the third world. Indeed, we see in this increase and in the corresponding opening up of markets in the industrialized countries a central element of the evolution of a balanced world economic order. In 1977 our imports of manufactures from the non-oil- exporting, non-European developing countries were up by 10 per cent. That means that they have increased at four times the rate of our national product. This amazing rate of growth impressively demonstrates the openness of the German market. The non-European developing countries, excluding the oil-producing countries, ran up a trade- balance surplus in relation to the Federal Republic of Germany of 2.7 billion marks.\n228.\tThe Federal Government has made a special effort this year and boosted its development assistance budget by more than 20 per cent. It also plans considerable increases for the years ahead, so that it will rise at a rate significantly higher than that of the over-all budget.\n229.\tIn addition, we have further improved the conditions on which aid is given. As from 1978 we are giving aid to the least-developed countries entirely in the form of grants. The Federal Government will also convert into grants development assistance loans already afforded to that group of countries, which amounts to cancelling debts of $2 billion or more.\n230.\tThe Federal Government expects the Committee of the Whole at last to deal with the substance of its work. This body is too important for the North-South dialogue to be allowed to continue any longer to deal with procedural questions. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany will do all it can to ensure the success of the Committee's work.\n231.\tOf great importance for the future of international economic growth and development is the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Here we must above all find a balanced solution as regards a regime for sea-bed mining. It must give all States and enterprises access to the resources of the deep sea and bring with it the political and economic security needed for the heavy long-term investment in sea-bed mining.\n232.\tThe focal point of all efforts to lead the world, which is in a phase of transition, to an order of equality and partnership continues to be the United Nations. The Federal Republic of Germany reaffirms its will to support and strengthen the United Nations.\n233.\tThe United Nations is more than a forum for the formation of international public opinion. It is called upon to act. It must become more capable of action. This applies above all to the important task of safeguarding peace. The Federal Republic of Germany feels that all Members of the United Nations should become more acutely aware of their responsibility for peace-keeping measures. No one should remain aloof where this central function of the United Nations is concerned.\n234.\tFurthermore, it is necessary to improve the instruments available to the United Nations for preserving the peace; for example, by providing training facilities for personnel required for peace-keeping operations and keeping the Secretary-General regularly informed of available units or logistic capacities for peace-keeping operations.\n235. In other areas, too, we must strengthen and develop the institutions of the United Nations. This applies also to the task of the United Nations in establishing an independent institution for the protection of human rights. The stronger the United Nations, the stronger each Member State will feel in exercising its right of self-determination and the stronger every individual will feel in exercising his human rights. The United Nations must be the citadel of equality of rights in the face of hegemony and power politics in any form; it must be the champion of the poor against the rich, the weak against the strong. The United Nations will attain this goal only if it keeps itself free from sweeping judgements, propaganda and agitation, if it is a forum in which reason and the desire for justice prevail. We want to help the United Nations achieve its great aims: to preserve peace, to promote economic and social progress and to protect the human rights of all individuals and the right of self-determination of all nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff145.\tMr. President, it is especially gratifying to my country to greet and to congratulate you upon your election as President of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its thirty-third session. Mr. Indalecio Lievano Aguirre, whom I have had the honour to succeed as Minister for Foreign Affairs, is a distinguished Colombian singularly well endowed by his training and character for the conduct of diplomatic affairs. His election to the presidency of the highest international forum is a recognition of his praiseworthy activity in that field. With his election, the people and Government of Colombia feel honoured.\n146.\tMy country has consistently given its support to those international organizations which seek to preserve peace and security and to develop co-operation in all spheres. It may be said that our country emerged into independent life calling for the united efforts of its liberators to protect the recently won independence of our hemisphere. Then, as now, we reaffirmed our sincere conviction that the best guarantee of self-determination of peoples is to be found in strengthening of an international regulatory order so as to defeat the new and refined forms of domination which today subjugate medium-sized and small nations.\n147.\tSince the creation of the United Nations and the Organization of American States, successive Colombian Governments have expressed their unequivocal will to turn all endeavours for peace into a common task and duly to shoulder their share of the responsibilities that each new situation has imposed.\n148.\tThe Government of the new President of the Republic, Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala, notes with concern the attempts that have been made to transfer to other forums than those established for the purpose the consideration of many of the conflicts that threaten security among nations. The desire, particularly in the case of the United Nations, to take control again over situations that have been slipping away from it should become a driving force for all Members of the Organization. In the light of these considerations, Colombia has always sympathetically viewed the ideas put forward in this body and will seek to strengthen the role of the United Nations, either by changing the structure of the Charter or by developing its precepts through specific but parallel instruments. The problems that have come to the fore in our time, and which combine political, economic and social factors, compel us to think that the legal order elaborated in 1945 has been overtaken by events. No regulatory regime, if it purports to be the expression of existing social reality, can remain static or it will lose its effectiveness. Thus, it would be desirable to speed up the\nevolution of a large number of institutions that were created under the aegis of the United Nations and even to attempt to complement that process with elements that would assist in the investigation of particular situations, while making it easier to solve certain conflicts.\n149.\tThe need for the United Nations to become again the indispensable forum for the settlement of situations threatening peace, far from distressing the great Powers, would be the logical consequence of the new dimensions of world solidarity, where all efforts would lead to a more just and more harmonious order.\n150.\tThere would be more promising prospects of solving the Middle East problem, so fraught with anguishing forebodings, if we reverted to the spirit and letter of resolution 242 (1967), adopted by the Security Council on 22 November 1967, which condenses what is still, 10 years -after its adoption, a good point of departure for ensuring peace in the region.\n151.\tSince the creation of the United Nations, Colombia has maintained a balanced and equitable position with respect to the Middle East problem. The elements embodied in the resolution that I have just mentioned imply recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination; the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force; the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the occupied territories; the termination of all states of belligerency; and respect for and recognition of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and its right to live in peace within secure\\and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force. In this context, and as a first step towards the implementation of those elements, my Government has noted as a constructive achievement the Camp David agreements between the Presidents of the United States and Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel. The recent Security Council resolution on Lebanon, resolution 436 (1978) is another important, step forward.\n152.\tNew Security Council decisions and new General Assembly resolutions that might be adopted or formulated this year would be received by international public opinion as the best response to the vigilance we demand of the United Nations in the exercise of all the functions that fall within its institutional framework.\n153.\tSimilarly, the Colombian Government attaches particular importance to all attempts to expedite agreements on disarmament and the limitation of means of mass destruction. There is no doubt that the policy of detente put into effect by the great Powers slowed down the arms race. The sophisticated nature of certain types of missiles and new scientific discoveries to improve them counsel us not only to contribute to detente among the great Powers but to strive to ensure that it extends to other areas of the world which that detente has not yet reached.\n154.\tThe proliferation of weapons not only could result in a nuclear holocaust but affects the development process of\nmany countries by absorbing resources that could well be devoted to infrastructure projects that would help improve the living standards of their peoples. We should note, further, that for the nations of the third world the arms trade, including trade in conventional weapons, represents a heavy technological burden that could well lead to limitations in economic growth targets and in social progress.\n155.\tin his inaugural address President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala emphasized how important it was for Colombia to play an active part in the preparation of the new .international economic order. This implies, first, that we strengthen diplomatic and trade relations with the countries of the third world and that in the various international forums we help to reinforce their positions while creating new ties with nations that are necessarily engaged in the task of overcoming the external factors that condition their progress. Perhaps the first and most important aspect is the technological one, which has become the new dividing line between the very poor and the very rich. The changes that have occurred as a result of the displacement of financial resources in the past decade have shown clearly that the acquisition of technology has become in our time the most costly and dominant element dividing nations, and is the key to the liberation of the developing world. The best programme for the developing world is the transfer of scientific knowledge, the exchange of information, so far as possible, and the conception of the new order not as a mere system of financial mechanisms but rather as a concrete opportunity for the acquisition of science and technological resources.\t\n156.\tThe undertaking of the third world, with which the Colombian Government wishes to identify itself further, is not only to act to protect raw materials and to promote the expansion of trade and new sources of finance but to participate in making the big decisions on monetary policy that so decisively affects the domestic situation in all countries.\n157.\tThe new international economic order should prevent spectacular falls in the prices of primary commodities, on whose stability peace among nations depends to a large degree. The unquestionable relationship between security, both internal and external, ,and the equitable price of primary commodities has been shown .on numerous occasions. A people condemned to live in squalor and poverty cannot prevent the spread of discontent among the population, discontent that can easily explode into a conflict with international repercussions. The parallel between adequate terms of trade and world security is the new dimension in relations between -the industrialized countries and the producers of primary commodities, and the necessary point of departure for the economic claims that the third world so justly makes.\t\n158.\tThe resumption of the North-South dialogue, despite the set-backs it suffered in the last attempts to continue, is another goal in the achievement of which we should unreservedly co-operate, although we would prefer that its base be extended and that it be placed squarely within the framework of the United Nations.\n159.\tColombia co-operated in the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the seventh Session of which ended last September, from the only preparation of the Conference. We would recall the participation of our country in seeking to promote the Maltese proposals when the present President of the republic, Mr. Turbay Ayala, was the head of our mission to the United Nations. That process was later to culminate in the General Assembly's declaration of the sea-bed and the ocean floor as the common heritage of mankind [see resolution 2749 (XXV), para. 1]. Despite the interest of many Governments in speeding up the completion of the Conference, we now hear with alarm the announcement by some Powers of their possible unilateral exploitation of what is regarded as an area reserved for the benefit of all peoples. I wish not only to insist here on the need to protect the moratorium that we achieved on the exploitation of the sea-bed and ocean floor but to warn of the risks of excessive delay in the negotiations within the Conference, which may well thwart our attempts to create a new code of the sea, an instrument that would prevent a new colonization of the seas and oceans.\n160. As Colombia has stated before the United Nations, the international community should delay no longer a legal definition of outer space and of geo-stationary space communications, because the experiments we have seen, and foreseeable developments in the next few years, highlight significant lacunae in the existing agreements for their exploitation and peaceful utilization. Indeed, as you stated, Mr. President, during the thirtieth session of this Assembly in your capacity as Foreign Minister of Colombia, those agreements do not take into account the exploitation of the geo-stationary orbit for profit, or the juridically and physically immutable existence of the segments of that orbit permanently located within the space of the equatorial States, to which you added later:\n\\\"Colombia does not object to free orbital transit or to communications as long as those devices ply the territorial sky in a gravitational flight, from any practical height to infinity. But a clear exception is to be made in the case of devices which are to be fixed on a segment of their Stationary orbit.\n161. The Government of President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala has given full support to this position so as to protect a natural resource which is located over the territory of developing countries, in keeping with the spirit of General Assembly resolution 2692 (XXV), entitled \\\"Permanent sovereignty over natural resources of developing countries and expansion of domestic sources of accumulation for economic development\\\" and with the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States proclaimed by the Assembly in its resolution 3281. \n162. Thanks to the support of a large majority of delegations in the United Nations, the membership of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space was increased [resolution 32/196B] in order to give adequate representation to the space interests of the equatorial countries.\n163. We consider that the staggering progress of space technology makes imperative the progressive development\nof international law in order to take into account the rights of the equatorial countries in their respective segments of the geo-stationary orbit.\n164.\tColombia rejects as inadmissible from every point Of view attempts arbitrarily to modify any international statutes, as long as the United Nations has not produced a precise definition of outer space and of the legal regime of the geo-stationary orbit within the framework of M international agreement.\n165.\tThe protection of human rights is one of the objectives of the United Nations most often repeated in the Charter and in various resolutions of United Nations bodies and specialized agencies. There is, no doubt, a Close link between peace and the protection of human freedom. Disregard for the most elementary guarantees of the rights of the individual unleashes conflicts transcending national boundaries and weakening harmony among States. The philosophy condensed in the United Nations Charter concerning the duty to preserve and protect the fundamental rights of the individual, must be regarded as an obligation on each of the Members of the Organization, and as a concomitant raised to the status of an imperative rule in the law of peoples. Respect for human rights, which are regarded as part of the jus cogens, has become compulsory for all Governments and peoples on earth.\n166.\tThose who drafted the San Francisco Charter and subscribed to it as founding Members, as well as those States which have subsequently joined the Organization, are convinced that, without the obligation to protect life and the dignity and well-being of peoples, the United Nations would lack statues and a very raison d'etre.\n167.\tFor that reason, the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been supplemented by many instruments in order to endow it with the means to make it binding. Among them, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its Optional Protocol represent perhaps the most daring and advanced effort to date. The diversity of circumstances and the imperative need to draw a distinction between procedures for the safeguarding of civil and political rights and those for economic, social and cultural rights have led to the conclusion that in this area we cannot have, one single procedure; rather, we must establish multiple and parallel means of recourse.\n168.\tThe International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, [resolution 2106 A (XX), annex] , as well as the special procedures developed in the specialized agencies, such as UNESCO and the ILO, clearly shows that \\\" the protection of human rights is incumbent upon all United Nations bodies, without distinction.\n169.\tA similar phenomenon occurs in regional bodies, where the procedures evolved, in the case of the European Community, for example, have led to favourable results. Within the Organization of American States we have also noted some progress, especially since the Pact of San Jose, Costa Rica, entered into force.\n170.\tWhen the lives of defenceless people are threatened, so long as there exist countries where fundamental freedoms are systematically violated and from the moment when individual guarantees disappear in any place, giving way to barbarism, the United Nations is required to act urgently through the many channels it has developed for the purpose.\nn\n171.\tThe President of Colombia and Venezuela, Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala and Carlos Andres Perez, on 27 September last, addressed a communication to the President of this Assembly, to denounce the serious violations of human rights that were occurring in the Republic of Nicaragua. The two Presidents stated the following:\n\\\"In denouncing the tragic and dramatic situation of vast segments of the population of Nicaragua, whose essential rights are being violated, we respect the principle of non-intervention, which is by no means incompatible with the task of internationally safeguarding human rights which the United Nations is required to perform.. . [see A/33/275, annex.]\nIn this appeal to the world's conscience they sought to put before the United Nations clear information on the serious events taking place in Nicaragua so that the various institutionalized mechanisms for the true protection of human rights could immediately be put into operation and greater loss of life be prevented.\n172.\tThe Commission on Human Rights, as an organ of the Economic and Social Council, will also provide adequate measures, although that would not exclude the possibility of the United Nations promoting concerted humanitarian action at all other levels; nor does it preclude the participation of regional mechanisms.\n173.\tWith respect to the protection of human rights, there cannot be any principle of exclusion. Therefore, in various similar ways, the Colombian Government will lay stress on this matter in order to mobilize world public opinion to the fullest in support of the victims of the Nicaraguan tragedy.\n174.\tThe work of international bodies in the field of human rights cannot be regarded as an activity which violates the principle of non-intervention, because whatever work they do is carried out in compliance with their treaty obligations.\n175.\tColombia, as it observes the serious problems threatening peace and the security of peoples, and convinced as it is that only a strong Organization can preserve us from the scourge of war, voices its sincerest wishes that the present session of the General Assembly may help to strengthen the institutional power of the United Nations and the effectiveness of its contribution to the protection of life and the dignity of human beings everywhere on earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff200.\tThe presence of Latin America, in the person of the former Foreign Minister of Colombia, Indalecio Lievano, in the presidency of this thirty-third session of the General Assembly is a reason for special pleasure for my delegation. We see in this distinguished public figure of a brotherly and neighbourly nation of Peru an enlightened representative of the values which our region has contributed and continues to contribute to the international community. My delegation would offer to President Lievano and we would ask you, Sir, to convey these wishes to him\u2014our assurances of our loyal and enthusiastic co-operation for the proper discharge of the important business of this major international forum.\n201.\tWe also extend our greetings to Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia and express to him our appreciation of the manner in which he conducted a particularly difficult stage of the work of the General Assembly.\n202.\tThe presidency of Mr. Lievano coincides with a moment of special urgency in the process of reordering international relations, and it is our fervent hope that at this time the United Nations, with the constantly efficient support of its Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, will combine dynamism and efficiency\u2014which should properly be its attributes-in order to make possible an atmosphere of peace and co-operation which will distinguish our joint efforts.\n203.\tOn the three occasions on which I have had the opportunity to address this forum of international consultation, I have described the permanent support given by Peru to the most noble efforts of the world Organization. This support is a natural reflection of the profound peaceful, diplomatic and pluralistic vocation which derives from our history and international position. The real autonomy of our foreign policy is fully expressed in the most pressing circumstances of the contemporary world, and therefore Peru reiterates its commitment to struggle, from a non-aligned political, conceptual and moral position for a world in which the democratization of international relations will pass from being a mere slogan to being an axiom determining diplomatic conduct.\n204.\tThis is the significance of our full identification with the forces of liberation which are struggling to eliminate the stubborn remnants of colonialism, neo-colonialism and racial discrimination. It is also a reason for our efforts to contribute to the rule of order and international justice which my country has been pursuing for the attainment of a new international economic order, together with the establishment of an irreversible process of general and complete disarmament.\n205.\tThese are decisive turning-points for our international future. In their specific and adequate concretisation lies the collective hope of a world which, although it is coming closer to universality in its relations\u2014as the welcome admission of Solomon Islands to our Organization proves\u2014and also closer to a certain level of ideo-political tolerance, has still not found the way suitably to harmonize its inevitable and necessary interdependence.\n206.\tI wish, with some anxiety, to refer to a subject which I find essential in the effort to achieve these aims which, although to some they may seem to be ideals or remote notions, are in fact an indispensable minimum if the present generation is to halt and reverse such destructive trends as those which are now eroding the very survival of our civilizations.\n207.\tTo the danger inherent in the unbridled arms race, the massive squandering of resources, thoughtless pollution, hunger and poverty in the third world and the resurgence of repugnant forms of international and internal violence, the decline of standards, the apathy and premature disillusionment of our youth is added and superimposed the present stage of international dialogue in the economic sphere.\n208.\tFor this reason my delegation shares with many others the frustration at what appears to be the definitive stagnation of the North-South dialogue, due to the de facto paralysis of the so-called Committee of the Whole, or the\nCommittee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, which was set up by this Assembly precisely in order to provide a diplomatic framework capable of overcoming the failure of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation.\n\n209.\tMy country, which is passing through a situation of particular gravity, as I shall explain shortly, finds regrettable the absence within this sphere of international relations of a climate propitious to the efforts of precisely those countries which have risked most in order to set a suitable pace of integrated development. This permanent frustration is experienced in the deterioration of the prices of our exports, in the enormous magnitude of an external indebtedness which, far from facilitating the motive forces of our development, is distorting them even further, and is a transfer of technology and financial resources that is inadequate compared with our real needs. All this produces inevitable disagreements between the monetary organizations and our Governments, when it is a matter of deciding on the best terms for carrying out the adjustments needed because of the chronic balance-of-payments situation.\n210.\tIn Peru we have overcome the stage of what was undoubtedly misunderstanding with these international organs thanks to a new flexibility of criteria, which, although positive, has been long in coming and has been achieved only at great cost to the country, a fact which must be regarded as a specific symptom of the present still inequitable world economic structure. Even if my country were not experiencing these delicate situations, we would with the same determination call for the establishment of a frank and effective dialogue. If the nations cannot cope with the most critical aspects of their proclaimed interdependence by means of civilized formulas for a constructive dialogue, how will it be possible to find a solution to the acute contradictions, inequalities and injustices which are characteristic of such independence and interdependence?\n211.\tThus we make a new, urgent appeal to the developed States to find the political will to overcome the situation. Let us not accumulate new and more critical frustrations in a relationship which is already difficult. That would be of benefit to no one, and we must avoid them in the light of an interdependence which must be healthy and advantageous for all concerned. This Assembly is well aware of the importance of what is at stake, and that is why it has decided to bear its proper responsibility in this crucial aspect of international relations.\n212.\tIn the opinion of my Government, the latest Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, recently held in Belgrade, has confirmed the vigour and relevance of the non-aligned movement as an alternative of enormous potential in the international sphere, but this reaffirmation of its unquestionable strength has not taken place without the emergence of certain problems and pressures which tend to recur sporadically within the non-aligned movement and which are attributable to the zeal for disturbance and division with which the poles of power seek to weaken its critical capacity, its conceptual and political autonomy and its non-aligned essence.\n213.\tWe believe that human rights, on which there has been an intense debate at the international level in recent years, must be understood in their true dimension and their true breadth. Together with civil and political rights, recognition should be given to the urgent need to ensure economic, social and cultural human rights, without which, after all, it is impossible for man to enjoy the minimum conditions of life. Those rights include the right to work, housing, health, education, all of which are indispensable for the complete fulfilment of the human being.\n214.\tIn keeping with this integrated view, my Government has ratified the International Covenants on Human Rights and the concomitant Optional Protocol [see resolution 2200 A (XXI)]. It has also ratified at national level the American Convention on Human Rights, also known as the Pact of San Jos6.  At the same time it continues firmly with its internal efforts at development and its struggle to establish a new international economic order.\n215.\tWe cannot hide our. justified concern in view of the political situation that may be observed at the beginning of this session of the General Assembly in connexion with such delicate matters as Africa and the Middle East. We have seen in respect of southern Africa the important steps taken for the independence of Namibia on the occasion of the ninth special session, which was devoted to this matter, through a number of measures which still await final implementation and which, in the circumstances of which we are all aware, require for that implementation the persistent pressure of this Assembly and the international community as a whole, in particular that of the members of the Security Council, which has assumed this particular responsibility.\n216.\tMy country hopes also that the independence of Zimbabwe will speedily and peacefully be achieved in keeping with the decision to be adopted by its people, with the effective participation of all sectors of the population.\n217.\tPeru, an ancient nation, a racial melting-pot, a country at a crossroad, profoundly rejects all forms of segregationist, discriminatory, racist and other practices which some nations carry out. In keeping with this sentiment, which is profoundly rooted in our national being, my Government has just adopted and incorporated into the legislation the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of. the Crime of Apartheid [resolution 3068 (XXVIII)] and we support and share in the efforts of the international community to eradicate this particularly aberrant form of discrimination and exploitation.\n218.\tPeru, which has been following with understandable interest and concern the problem of the Middle East and the Palestinian question, both of which have caused such grief, will always support the quest for peace with justice, within the spirit and letter of Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) and with respect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n219.\tSimilarly, we believe that the solution to the question of Cyprus must not continue to be delayed, and that the decisions of this Assembly and the Security Council must be implemented promptly.\n220.\tWithin the framework of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held in Geneva earlier this year, progress has been made which reaffirms the ambitious nature of the broad agreement envisaged by the international community to arrive at an agreement that will be satisfactory to all States. This effort deserves full support, which we have shown throughout the years in the forums where my country has spoken of the right of States to exploit the resources in the zones off their coasts. The advanced guard position taken by Peru in 1947 has now been seen to be consolidated and supported by the alignment of a large majority of nations in favour of this principle.\n221.\tOn the other hand we cannot fail to express our profound concern and alarm about the imminent adoption of unilateral legislative measures on the exploitation of the natural resources of the sea-bed beyond national jurisdiction, measures which, would run counter to the principle that that zone and its resources are the common heritage of mankind. Such measures are clearly not in keeping with emerging international law.\n222.\tIt is important to emphasize the new political assessment of the phenomenon of the arms race and the new path that was agreed on for negotiations on disarmament at the last special session of the General Assembly. This initial .step regrettably lacks specific details for immediate action but it includes an operative framework for handling this complex question and for its gradual solution by future decisions. As it has repeated in recent years, Peru is prepared to give its support to the objectives proposed for the forthcoming stages in the handling of this problem.\n223.\tAt the regional level, it is satisfying to note the progress towards the political and juridical improvement of the regime for military denuclearisation of Latin America. The Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco), which incorporates this positive desire, is an example of what the regional political will can achieve in questions, of disarmament.\n224.\tWhile Latin America is in the van in the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone, it has renewed its efforts for the attainment of political agreements on the limitation of conventional weapons at the regional level. The pronouncement subscribed to on 22 June of this year by the Foreign Ministers signing the Declaration of Ayacucho, on the occasion of the last session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States, offers the possibility that all the countries of the region will endorse those purposes, and opens up new ways for the implementation of this initiative taken by Peru.\n225.\tIt is my intention to deal in some detail with certain essential aspects of Peru's present political circumstances, because I believe that it is necessary to place in their proper dimension certain phenomena which have been noted in my country in recent months.\n226.\tThe position of Peru is that of a people in the process of attaining its civic integration, a people determined to attain at the same time and in a parallel manner two fundamental goals which will define its future character in the near future. Peru is attempting to establish definitively democracy as a stable, fruitful and efficient form of government. At the same time it is seeking to extricate its economic and financial system from one of the most profound crises in its history.\n227.\tThree years ago the second phase of the Revolutionary Government emerged as an institutional attempt to resolve certain fundamental problems of the process of transformation which was begun a decade ago. As is well known, this was an attempt to bring about complex and diverse changes in the economic and social structure, with a view to attaining a process of development with a lofty sense of social justice. The conduct of the process was not always perfectly attuned to growing national participation, but it undoubtedly proceeded from a majority sentiment in favour of change. The complex situation that had been inherited obliged the Government to specify the conceptual and nationalist autonomy which is at the heart of the Peruvian process, to narrow the gap between theory and practice and to readjust certain processes and consolidate basic reforms. All of this occurred, and is continuing, in the context of inexorable pressure on the economic and financial structure, brought about by internal factors, a certain lack of precision in the conduct of economic policy and the negative presence of external factors characteristic of the unjust structure of international economic relations, which caused an excess of expenditures over the amount produced and consequent enormous indebtedness.\n228.\tIn the light of this reality, in a statement three years ago the Government stated the need to attain a national consensus on the basis of a responsible historic commitment by the armed forces and the civilian population, on which, to use the words of President Morales Bermudez, \\\"the viability of Peru as a truly democratic society depends\\\".\n229.\tThree years later, in strict fulfilment of the scheme for the democratic transfer of power in our country, in free elections and with exemplary popular participation, there has been elected a Constituent Assembly combining all the trends of political opinion in the country, with the delicate task of drafting, with full autonomy, the fundamental charter of the Republic, which will govern its system of civic life in the immediate future. This is the most important fact of Peru today, not only because it expresses the' hope of finding more stable channels for the future of the Republic but because it confirms that the people and the armed forces are imbued with an explicit democratic vocation, never expressed so overwhelmingly and trenchantly as today.\n230.\tThat vocation and that hope mark a real and profound link between the Government and the majority sectors of the population. They are an expression of that link. The quest for a permanent understanding between the\nGovernment and the Peruvian people now leads to the need to bring about an effective alliance in defence of the process of transfer to democratic forms of government and the necessary stability, threatened as they are by passions and fanaticism from both extremes of the political spectrum, which seek, in the shadow of a very grave economic and social crisis, to impose either a revolution inspired by totalitarianism, with very scanty chances of proving effective, or a return to a regime of privilege protected by systematic repression.\n231.\tIn the past few weeks we have laid the basis for the stabilization of our financial situation. The Government is beginning to confront the second major objective of this phase of historic transition. After certain corrective measures, at the cost of enormous austerity, an agreement has been reached with IMF to put our finances on a sound footing for a period ending in 1980. At the same time, agreement has been reached with our creditors in the international financial community on a programme of restructuring our external debt to alleviate the amounts and deadlines during that same period. These acts, which are now well advanced and represent a realistic and technical scheme, imply an equitable distribution of the inevitable shortages and consequently a policy of financial health, meeting the criterion of social justice. They will make it possible not only to rescue the productive forces in our vast resources, which are now blunted by the grave recession, but to bring about a climate of confidence and stability necessary for a selective and pragmatic revival.\n232.\tIt is therefore clear that it is not just the converging political and economic processes which will decide the cutting of the Gordian knot at this rather burdensome moment in Peru's destiny; much will depend on the awareness that may develop among the urban community of the grave and special nature of these two problems. If the urban population's reply is in accordance with the significance of these matters I have been trying to describe here, a positive outcome will soon emerge. That is why, as President Morales Bermudez has reiterated clearly, if the fundamental task of drafting the new constitution can be completed before the target year, it will be possible to advance the preparations and hold the general elections ahead of schedule, even before 1980. I think this solemn announcement is clear evidence that the outcome depends, in essence, on the predominant national will, which cannot fail to take into account the inescapable requirements of this critical moment in Peru's history.\n233.\tI believe there will prevail shortly in Peru an awareness of the need for shared sacrifice, in keeping with the lucidity and maturity of our ancient and noble people which it has demonstrated so often in the most critical moments of its turbulent yet rich history.\n234.\tThis opens up a new era for our country, which is renewed and optimistic in its creative capacity\u2014a capacity which has been demonstrated over thousands of years\u2014and which is united yet pluralistic in its essence, and open, today as tomorrow, to friendship and links with all nations.\n235.\tOur subcontinent has reached a stage of maturity in which fruitful dialogue and the deliberate and responsible quest for rapprochement have acquired undoubted importance.\n236.\tProof of this, and a reason for distinct satisfaction, is the negotiations which two sister countries, El Salvador and Honduras, have been conducting so suspiciously with, as mediator, a distinguished Peruvian, Mr. Jose Luis Bustamante Rivero, a former President of Peru and former President of the International Court of Justice. May I express here my most fervent desire that those negotiations will be successful and culminate in an instrument that will settle and overcome existing disagreements, as an expression of the desire for peace characteristic of Latin America.\n237.\tAt the same time, I voice my firm hope that in those areas of the region now convulsed by turbulence the rule of peace will be restored under the auspices of freedom, justice and respect for human rights.\n238.\tOur country approaches its problems with a sense of destiny and with open and broad understanding. The signing of the Amazon Pact opens a new chapter and sets a precedent for future similar instruments which could lead to a qualitatively new step forward in an approach to the most delicate international matters from a positive viewpoint of realism and co-operation.\n239.\tAt the same time, my country continues to be receptive to the quest for constructive solutions that would make it possible to remove elements of tension which still persist in other areas, through the proper channels and in accordance with the juridical traditions of my continent.\n240.\tIn keeping with this approach and this tradition, Latin America will continue to contribute within this world framework to the attainment of the great objectives of the Organization, without blurring the, contours of its personality, which has been clearly outlined in the legal instruments in which the faith and hope of our own destiny are enshrined.\n\n\n"

It is a well-deserved honour, reflecting great credit on both you and your country.\n51.\tTo Mr. Kurt Waldheim any delegation extends its sincere appreciation for another year of unremitting effort in executing the demanding responsibilities of his high office of Secretary-General.\n52.\tMy delegation would like also to add its congratulations to those of others to Solomon Islands on its attainment of sovereign independence and admission to this world body.\n53.\tMy delegation wishes to focus its contribution to this debate on a small range of questions - questions it considers to be of particular importance, indeed of urgent concern, to the United Nations and to the world at large and in need of early attention, decision and action. \n54.\tAs I am from Africa, I would turn first to that continent; Like others, it still has many problems, but those that command our gravest concern relate to Zimbabwe and Namibia, where minority regimes fly in the face of human rights and history and try to preserve their privileged and unjustifiable position although they now seek to enlist the support of other minority groupings. To my country, progressive and socialist, the situations prevailing in 5ambtbwe and Namibia are anathema.\n55.\tThe problem of Zimbabwe continues to exercise the minds of all right-thinking people. The illegal Smith administration endured for well over 12 years before it gave way to an equally unrepresentative regime following the so-called internal settlement of 3 March this year. We have seen how sterile this latter regime has been in the past six months, how virtually nothing has been achieved, and how either unwilling or unable it is to dismantle the structure of white minority rule. There may have been a few cosmetic measures, but the so-called internal settlement has, in fact, solved nothing.\n56.\tIt is regrettable that from month to month hundreds of people are killed and thousands suffer deprivation of one kind or another, while the millions who make up the Zimbabwean nation are not permitted the fundamental right of running their own country.\n57.\tIt is unfortunate but, it now seems, unavoidable that the Patriotic Front will have to prosecute the armed struggle even more vigorously so that the people of Zimbabwe may be liberated and take their rightful place in the comity of independent nations. All persons of goodwill had hoped for an early end to the fighting in Zimbabwe, but that hope now appears to have been vain. Since the endeavours of the United Nations as a whole and of individual Member States which have been concerned to settle this problem have been unsuccessful, one can only pray that there will be an early and fundamental change of heart on the part of those now in power in Zimbabwe so that the aspirations and rights of all Zimbabweans may be realized.\n58.\tIf the Secretary-General does observe any glimmer of promise in this direction, I trust that he will, even at this late hour, renew his earlier efforts to resolve this tortuous problem. Further, I appeal to those Governments that are really in a position to exert influence, by one means or another, on the present regime to do so, so that the errors of its ways may be corrected in the quickest way possible, even at this late hour, and peace and justice for all may be. achieved in Zimbabwe.\n59.\tNamibia is another large, dark cloud in the African sky. The outlook appeared to be distinctly brighter following the ninth special session, which the Assembly held on Namibia in Aril and May this year and, indeed, until just a few days ago, when the South African Government decided to press ahead unilaterally and in defiance of the United Nations with its own programme for the country. It is difficult to see what South Africa hopes to gain from this step. Certainly, it will reap the odium of the international community. It appears to want to create a non-representative, puppet regime, which, inevitably will become another international leper alongside its bantustans. This South African action can only be denounced because it denies die people of Namibia' their right to true Self-determination and independence and will only prolong the period of misery that Namibia has suffered.\n60.\tThe resolution adopted at the special session of this Assembly [resolution S-9/2] should now be implemented,\nControl over Namibia should be handed over to the South West Africa People's Organization SWAPO; South African forces should withdraw from the whole of Namibia forthwith; and, failing compliance by South Africa, economic sanctions should be applied against that country.\n61.\tI now turn to another question, which in part relates to Africa. As we all know, this Assembly, in resolution 2832 (XXVI) of 16 December 1971, declared the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. That was a positive step in the right direction and in line with action long advocated by the non-aligned countries. And that declaration was followed by the establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean charged with studying the implications of the Declaration.\n62.\tThe Committee has stuck admirably to its difficult task over the years. As Seychelles is one of the countries most directly affected, my delegation is concerned that some of the other States that can only claim a less immediate interest should not have co-operated as fully and as promptly as they might have with the Committee in its endeavour to give real and full effect to the 1971 Declaration.\n63.\tThere is now an urgent need to convene the long-awaited conference on the Indian Ocean, but we have not yet had the meeting of the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean, a prerequisite for that conference, as decided at the thirty-second session of the Assembly [resolution 32/86]. My delegation urges that that preliminary meeting be convened at the earliest possible time. Action is required before the Indian Ocean question becomes even knottier and more difficult to unravel. How long can the States of the Indian Ocean, which are the potential sufferers in a situation not of their own making, tolerate the build-up of military forces by the super-Powers when those States could become the victims of a holocaust brought about by that super-Power rivalry? As Seychelles has made quite clear before, it recognizes that States of the Indian Ocean have a legitimate right to guard and provide for their own interests, but the super-Powers should remove their military presence from the Indian Ocean, and whatever steps are necessary to achieve this with the minimum of delay should now be taken, in conformity with resolutions adopted here.\n64.\tThe States of the Indian Ocean heard and read that the super-Powers are discussing the question of their military presence in the Indian Ocean. We are neither invited to participate nor informed of the outcome of those discussions. Yet, we are the ones whose territory, seas and air space are involved. Where is the consideration and respect for the rights and interests of all nations, big or small?\n65.\tThere is an urgent need to act to make the Indian Ocean zone of peace a reality and not let it remain merely an admirable concept to which to pay lip service.\nC6, I now wish to advert to some of the issues in the campaign for the New International Economic Order. Economic issues may well be as far-reaching as political ones. But, first, I shall make a point about the New International Economic Order in general. It is a simple\npoint, but one that our friends in the developed countries seem to find hard to grasp despite the adoption of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order as long ago as May 1974. This is simply that the New International Economic Order means just that: a new and fundamentally different approach to economic relations between the rich and the poor countries. It does not mean that we are trying to negotiate one or two simple reforms that would leave the basic relationships unchanged. It means a commitment to altering a system that for too long has kept the developing nations in a situation of dependency and poverty.\n67.\tWith this simple thought in mind, let me turn to a few issues of major importance, and let us first consider progress on the UNCTAD Integrated Programme for Commodities and its common fund. This is. an issue that we in Seychelles can examine from an unbiased viewpoint as we are not a major exporter of primary commodities. In 1976, at the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi, agreement was reached and a firm commitment was made to negotiate agreements or arrangements on 18 primary commodities and to establish a common fund to finance those agreements. We, the developing nations, believed this to be a major step forward and a decision that would bring benefit, not only to developing countries, but also to developed countries, in the form of greater stability in the world's markets.\n68.\tWhat has happened since then? Next to nothing has happened, and the developing nations are faced with increasing frustration at the intransigence of the developed countries when it comes to the negotiation of actual arrangements. Why is this so? My delegation believes that it is simply a case of misguided policy on the part of the developed countries to preserve what they believe to be their economic self-interest. Let us look at some of the issues and examine the arguments we continually hear from some of the developed countries.\n69.\tFirst, we are told that the market system is the best method of fixing prices, so that any commodity agreement we reach must fit into that system and not seek to change it. And yet, what actually happens to the prices of goods? At times of low demand, the prices for primary commodities fall dramatically, often by half or more. Consider the plight of our brothers in Zambia and Zaire and how they are affected by the ups and downs of the price of copper.\n70.\tBut what happens to the prices of manufactured goods and of technology? These prices continue to rise the same as ever and are completely unaffected by the fall in the prices of raw materials. But in times of high demand, when prices of primary commodities rise, what happens? The prices of manufactures rise once more, and fully reflect any changes in raw material prices.\n71.\tHow can this be so? The answer is that there is one rule for developing countries and another for developed countries, and I do not need to tell the Assembly who is the loser. If the free market is so efficient, tell me why the European Economic Community has developed common agricultural policy, keeping prices of food-stuffs high, but stable, and maintaining self-sufficiency behind a high wall of tariffs and quotas that keep out the cheaper produce of other countries.\n72.\tAnd then the developed countries tell us that these issues are very difficult and complicated, and need in-depth study. This is simply playing for time and stalling and just telling us that they have no real political will and no real commitment to change a system that for too long has acted solely to the benefit of developed countries. These are not difficult issues; they are issues that can readily be resolved if both sides determine that that is what they want to do.\n73.\tBut the simplest issues can be made complicated when one side merely wishes to prolong the discussion in order to avoid making a real commitment. So I appeal to all the developed countries here today to stop the time-wasting. We have waited too long. Let us see concrete results before we go to the fifth session of UNCTAD next year. It is really not so difficult once one makes up one's mind.\n74.\tLet me turn now to another area of major importance, and of particular relevance to a small country such as mine, one that is geographically remote and has recently emerged into independence. This is the issue of aid and development assistance. There are three areas of particular concern to me: volume, terms, and conditions. Performance on volume by the aid donors we know about all too well. How many countries are anywhere near the 0.7 per cent target? They can be counted on the fingers of one hand\u2014excluding the thumb. And some of those countries, albeit with a more enlightened attitude to development assistance, are relatively small compared with the major developed countries.\n75.\tBut look at the performance of the biggest countries. One will find that the biggest and richest countries have made the .least progress, and they still spend far more resources on arms and defence than they do on helping the poor nations. It is time this stopped. It is my delegation's belief that development assistance has a major role to play in closing the gap between rich and poor countries, and that the closing of this gap will make a far greater contribution to world peace, security and stability than any amount of expenditure on arms.\n76.\tThere has been some improvement in the terms of aid. We- are gratified to see that most donors now give grants instead of loans to the poorest countries, and that some countries have realized that the logical conclusion of this is that previous loans to these same countries should now be converted to grants. But what about those countries, such as my own, that do not quite fall into this category - countries, for which the granting of development assistance is. essential if they are to make real progress, but which at the same time, if they have to accept loans, face major debt-servicing problems?\n77.\tTo give, grants instead of loans for all development assistance would not cause hardship to the aid donors, but would help to eradicate hardship for the recipients. This is a simple and painless reform that would bring major benefits.\n78.\tBut even for those countries that now receive grants there is a further problem. They have to buy goods and services, from, whatever donor happens to be assisting them in a particular project and they are not permitted to buy\nfrom the lowest bidder Why not? What are the donors afraid of? I will grant that if one donor unties his aid unilaterally it may reduce his exports by a tiny fraction over all. But if all donors were to untie their aid multilaterally, who would lose? I say that nobody would lose, but that the developing countries would gain, through a major improvement in the quality of aid.\n79.\tIn some areas, progress has been made on the terms of aid. We now receive considerable assistance from multilateral aid institutions on near-grant terms and virtually untied with regard to procurement. Are those institutions entirely satisfactory? In my delegation's opinion they are not, for both the bilateral donors and the multilateral agencies continue to impose conditions on their development assistance and to interfere excessively with our internal policies. We understand, of course, that donors have a public to answer to for their expenditure, but how far need this go? Essentially, it comes down to this: they do not trust us and they seem to believe that we are incompetent.\n80.\tDevelopment assistance ought to be financial aid to developing countries to help them to implement their own development plans and strategies in the way they believe is right for them. Do the aid donors really believe that anyone can know a country better than the people who live and work there? Yet the message seems continually to be that the developed countries know better than we do. We want to develop our countries in our own way, according to our own beliefs, and in a fashion suited to our own particular circumstances. We ask for assistance in achieving this aim, not for interference with it.\n81.\tI have spoken of two areas where there is little progress so far in implementing the New International Economic Order. Let me finally turn to one aspect of the New International Economic Order that we in Seychelles believe to be of the utmost importance and where progress has been made. I speak of technical co-operation among developing countries. At the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among developing Countries in Buenos Aires in September this year, a Plan of Action was adopted that could oversee the implementation of this most vital development in world economic relations. Technical co-operation among developing countries can make a truly significant contribution to the economic development of the poor nations and it will strengthen the individual and collective self-reliance of developing countries. It shows that we in developing countries are ready to help ourselves and each other, and are not simply sitting back expecting presents. We are all ready to work to bring about a better future for our peoples, and for all our brothers and sisters in other countries.\t\n82.\tBut let it be clear what we are talking about. It is not the case that we have simply invented the phrase \\\"technical co-operation among developing countries\\\" as a meaningless slogan nor that it is a flash of inspiration on the part of some economics professor about how to improve things. No, technical cooperation among developing countries has been going on for quite some time now. For instance, in Seychelles we count nearly half of our recent aid commitments as technical co-operation among developing countries. And if we look at the way in which we have spent our\nallocation from UNDP we see that 55 per cent has been spent on projects involving technical co-operation among developing countries. We have received experts from other developing countries; we have sent young men and women to be trained in other African countries; and we have been to other developing countries to study some of their industries and institutions. I know that every other country has similar experience.\n83.\tNo, the point about technical co-operation among developing countries is that we have all tried it and we all know that it works. The significance of the Buenos Aires Conference and of its Plan of Action is that they attempt to establish the means of increasing this co-operation, and of ensuring that whenever a developing country needs assistance of some sort it will be available from the most appropriate source, whether this be a developed or a developing country.\n84.\tTherefore there are two major points my delegation wants to make here today about technical co-operation among developing countries. First, if it is to succeed, then there has to be a central co-ordinating agency where requests, resources and available expertise can all be matched together. To achieve this, we believe that it is essential that the special unit within UNDP for technical co-operation among developing countries be strengthened, and that adequate resources be made available to the United Nations system as a whole for the implementation of this policy.\n85.\tSecondly , this policy of technical co-operation among developing countries is not a rejection of the developed countries, nor is it in any way a substitute for other forms of assistance. Technical co-operation among developing countries is complementary to other forms of assistance, and developed countries have a significant role to play in its implementation. We look to the developed countries to co-operate with us in this strategy, and we express the hope that they will make sufficient resources available to ensure its success.\n86.\tThis brings me to the common strand in the three subjects I have been discussing in the context of the New International Economic Order.\n87.\tWe in the developing countries are ready to work hard to develop our countries and to improve the lot of our peoples, but we stand in a position of disadvantage. We find the economic system biased against us; we have scant economic power; and we are poor in financial resources. We are ready to help ourselves and each other to develop, and all we ask is that the developed countries assist us in doing so: to assist us by paying fair prices for our products, by accepting our products in their markets when they are cheaper than their own products, by not burdening us with excessive debt service problems, by letting us determine our own national policies, and finally by co-operating with us in helping developing countries to share their common experience and expertise for the benefit of all.\n88.\tIt is evident that the application of present criteria to small island developing countries when determining aid produces unreal and distorted results. Such States should be recognized as being in a special category because of their particular vulnerability, whether it be due to great dependence on one resource or industry, their isolation or their\nneed to set up minimum infrastructures regardless of the tiny domestic markets. We must not let inappropriate formulas stand in the way of solving problems which can be identified and put right in small island developing economies. It is encouraging to note that there is a gradual realization of this, and with other small island States we hope to work towards a recognition of the need for a more balanced approach enabling such countries to attain a degree of self-sufficiency, stability and relative prosperity.\n89.\tIf we can see real progress in these areas we can look forward to a better, fairer, more secure future, not just for the developing countries but for all mankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff71.\tMr. President, on behalf of the Government of Finland, I have the honour to extend to you our warmest congratulations and best wishes for success in your high office. Cordial relations between our two countries make our sentiments towards you, Sir, exceptionally warm.\n72.\tI also have the pleasure of extending a welcome to Solomon Islands, as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of the United Nations. The admission of Solomon Islands marks a further step towards the goal of universality to which the United Nations is committed through its Charter.\n73.\tThe United Nations has continued to be ever more involved in a number of important developments during the past year. Many of those developments reflect the key political, economic and social issues of our times. The tasks and challenges that the United Nations is expected to deal with increase continuously. That puts a great strain on its resources. We should see to it that the United Nations is adequately equipped to discharge its duties. The unique position and possibilities of the World Organization are markedly manifest in its role as a major peace-making and peace-keeping force. Success in those endeavours strengthens the profile of the United Nations as a centre for harmonizing the action of nations for the maintenance of international peace and security, as provided for in the Charter.\n74.\tIn the assessment of my Government, the political situation in Europe has remained balanced and stable. The first review session in Belgrade of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which concluded its work last March, gave emphasis to the significance of that Conference as a continuous process in promoting detente in Europe. It is true that many Governments had higher expectations with regard to the results of the Belgrade session than were ultimately achieved in the concluding document.  So had my Government. More important, however: the participating Governments renewed their commitment to implement fully all the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act.  The process will continue; other meetings will follow. The Belgrade session was\u2014and should be seen as\u2014a step forward, not an end in itself.\n75.\tDisarmament is an imperative for detente. That is true in Europe as well as in the whole world. Although the atmosphere of lessening tensions and increasing cooperation in Europe is yet to be translated into tangible results in the military field, the talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe continue. Recently some promising signs have emerged from those talks. My Government hopes that they will lead to an early agreement. On the global level, the tenth special session of the General Assembly, which was devoted to disarmament, made a positive contribution. My Government was pleased that the Final Document of the special session [resolution S-10/2] was adopted by consensus. That consensus highlighted one of the central purposes of the United Nations: the search for security through disarmament.\n76.\tThe Final Document of the special session deals with the entire range of disarmament issues in both procedural and substantive terms. With regard to many issues, my Government would have preferred to sec the Final Document spell out more explicit provisions and obligations. That is particularly true of the issue of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the question of nuclear- weapon-tree zones, as well as other means of strengthening the security of States that do not possess nuclear weapons.\n77.\tIn that context, the Finnish Government has taken note with particular interest of the recent proposal by the Soviet Government concerning the conclusion of an international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States /A/33J241). As we have emphasized on several occasions, we would find it just and reasonable that those States which have committed themselves to a nuclear-weapon-free status should also receive assurances that nuclear weapons would not be used against their territories in any circumstances. We are encouraged by the declarations made on this subject by the various nuclear-weapon States and we hope that the Soviet initiative will lead to arrangements for the provision of security guarantees by all nuclear-weapon Powers.\n7S, My Government hopes that the consensus reached at the tenth special session will be reflected in the forthcoming consideration of the disarmament items on the agenda of this session.\n79.\tThe most tangible outcome of the special session was the decision on disarmament machinery. My Government has consistently held the view that a relatively independent negotiating body with a central position and of limited size is the crucial dement in the multilateral disarmament machinery. We are convinced that the new Committee on Disarmament will be able to discharge its duties effectively.\n80.\tWe hope for early results from the negotiations for an agreement at the second series of the Strategic Arms limitation Talks and a comprehensive test-ban treaty, as indeed is called for in the Final Document of the special session. An agreement and a comprehensive test-ban would, more than any thing else, have a positive impact on disarmament and oil relations between the Powers concerned. Thus they would, we believe, strengthen detente to the benefit of all.\n81.\tOver the past few years, developments in military technology have increased the importance of the regional approach to arms control and disarmament. Most alarmingly, nuclear-weapons technology has been developed with notions of limited nuclear-war in mind. Stressing the gravity of those trends, the President of Finland recently developed further the idea he had first put forward in 1963 concerning the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in northern Europe. He proposed a Nordic arms control arrangement which would aim at isolating the Nordic countries as completely as possible from the effects of nuclear strategy in general and new nuclear-weapons technology in particular.\n82.\tin Africa, the need for political change is more pressing than it is anywhere else. The repression of the vast majority of the population in southern Africa by the white minorities continues to challenge the credibility of the United Nations. The United Nations and its Members are committed to the eradication of the policy of apartheid and to the search for peaceful, just solutions. Apartheid inevitably leads to violence. It is ultimately a self-defeating policy, because it will be resisted as long as it is practised.\n83.\tThe Nordic Foreign Ministers have agreed on an action programme of certain economic and other measures against South Africa. At their recent meeting in Stockholm they stressed that international pressure on South Africa must be increased and they decided to consider further Nordic proposals to that effect. The most effective parts of such an action programme would, of course, be binding measures taken by the Security Council.\n84.\tFor the last 15 months the international community has mounted an intensive diplomatic effort designed to bring Namibia to independence by peaceful means. My Government, as well as the Governments of tire other Nordic countries, has throughout given its support to those efforts. It has also declared itself prepared to assist the United Nations in the implementation of the plan within the framework of Security Council resolution 385 (1976), which emerged from the talks.\n85.\tIt would be tragic indeed if the Government of South Africa at this last moment closed the avenues to a peaceful settlement. It would then remain for the international community to use every means at its disposal to see to it that Namibia became independent within the terms laid down by the United Nations. Dare we still hope that the South African Government will after all be able to see what is in its own interest?\n86.\tIn Zimbabwe, the goal of independence under genuine majority rule has not been attained. The search for justice and peace must continue. A solution that excludes any party concerned would fall short of this goal. Meanwhile, all States Members of the United Nations must strictly implement tire sanctions against the Salisbury regime as adopted by the Security Council.\n87.\tIn some other parts of Africa, the international community has witnessed events that have led to violence and bloodshed, despite laudable efforts by the OAU to bring about peaceful settlements.\n88.\tWith regard to the situation in the Middle East, I should like to reiterate that Finland supports a peaceful and comprehensive solution, based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), a solution which furthermore must make provision for the legitimate rights of the Palestinians, including their right to national self-determination. In our opinion, many avenues may lead to peace, and in this spirit we have noted with interest the results of the recent summit meetings of the leaders of Egypt, Israel and the United States at Camp David. A final evaluation of these results will, of course, depend on their contribution towards a comprehensive solution acceptable to all parties.\n89.\tThe crisis situations in the Middle East and southern Africa, as well as in many other problem areas, are not only problems of nations and States and of their security and their sovereignty; in the final analysis they are all problems of the rights of human beings. These are special cases, but they suffice to show that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as expressed in the Charter and in other basic instruments, is indeed at the core of international relations today. By solving international problems we can stop the most flagrant violations of human rights.\n90.\tIn a broader perspective, concern about and respect for human rights-civil and political as well as economic, social and cultural-must be taken into account whenever programmes and guidelines for future action are adopted within the United Nations system. At the same time, the standard-setting work and other obligations of the United Nations, as well as the effective implementation of international instruments, must be backed up by an efficient international human rights machinery. It would be a fitting tribute to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, on the occasion of its thirtieth anniversary in December this year, if the General Assembly could make progress in the matter of restructuring the human rights machinery of the United Nations.\n91.\tWhen I spoke from this rostrum a year ago,  one phase of the North-South dialogue, the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation, had just ended. Today the international economic situation is very similar. Over the past year the international community has not been very successful in finding ways and means to cope with the most burning economic and social problems. It has thus failed to make significant progress towards the New International Economic Order.\n92.\tYet past experience has served to create a broad international consensus about the goals for the future. The central importance of economic co-operation for the whole fabric of international relations is now widely acknowledged. The creation of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, or the Committee of the Whole, was considered a recognition of the need to bring together all elements of international economic co-operation for comprehensive consideration. The early experience of that Committee should be a reason for a serious examination of the decision-making capacity of the international community.\n93.\tIn a longer term perspective, there has been no lack of attempts to resolve problems of economic co-operation. High-level meetings of various groups of nations have been held frequently. One conclusion emerging from this process is that the responsibility for the management of the global economy is shared by each nation. The degree of interdependence between economic policies of nations is such that no lasting solution can be found without giving due attention to the policy objectives of all countries and without taking the interrelationships of these objectives fully into account. The fact that the Committee has not been successful so far should not detract from the validity of this basic conclusion.\n94.\tThe economic and social situation of the world today contains clear and strong warning signals for us all. The severe recession in the world economy, the growing gap between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\", the seeming inability of international institutions to cope with the fundamental problems at hand, are reasons for alarm. The United Nations has already laid the foundation of the New International Economic Order in its decisions of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly [resolutions 3201 (S-VI), 3202 (S-VI) and 3362 (S-VII)]. Recognition of our common fate on this planet should now guide us in our work to build on that foundation.\n95.\tThere are a number of developments which, in the view of my Government, could serve as a basis for our attempts to put an end to the uncertainty which has prevailed in the past years in international economic and social relations.\n96.\tFirst, some of the disturbing developments of the last years\u2014such as unsatisfactory growth rates, high rates of inflation and unemployment\u2014have plagued almost all countries. This is likely to promote a broader consensus on the policy objectives and a unity of purpose in finding remedies for the present situation.\n97.\tSecondly, interdependence has now been generally recognized as the basis of international economic and social relations. This has proved the inadequacy of the old structures and justified the call for the New International Economic Order.\n98.\tThirdly, it is important that the will of the international community to continue negotiations, despite temporary setbacks, has prevailed. This will is based on a full recognition of the need for continued effective and systematic consultations at every level and on a need to review the North-South process in a comprehensive manner.\n99.\tThis session of the General Assembly must also set its sights on the fifth session of UNCTAD, which should be seen as an event of major importance to international economic relations. The fifth session, to be held in May 1979, will take place at a time when the North-South dialogue will have reached a stage of concrete negotiations on major issues. UNCTAD has spearheaded this dialogue with its own series of negotiations in many crucial areas of international economic co-operation. The session will also take place on the threshold of the new third development decade. When it meets in Manila in 1979, UNCTAD at its fifth session must thus not only respond to developments in the current negotiations, but must also set the course for years to come.\n100.\tI should like to refer to one problem area in the process of reshaping the world economy which in the long run will require more attention than it sometimes receives today; the protection of the environment. We must remember that future generations will have to cope with the consequences of our action or inaction today. Full recognition of global interdependence implies that the New International Economic Order will also have to be ecologically sound and based on a proper assessment of global and regional ecological factors; otherwise it will not be durable. The importance of these factors in the long term in many cases implies a reordering of priorities, as well as added emphasis on the distribution of world resources.\n101.\tIn this respect, it is the particular duty of the industrialized countries, which continue to make the greatest impact on the human environment, to adopt such policies of change as will meet the requirements of both global strategies for development and concern for the environment. Finland is ready to go further in this direction in collaboration with other States.\n102.\tI have spoken about interdependence with reference to relations between nations in solving the problems of the world economy. We must also remind ourselves, however, that there is clear interdependence among the great political, economic and social problems of our time. Decisive progress in development towards the New International Economic Order will require that resources be freed from the arms race and that the energy and ingenuity of mankind can be diverted from political disputes to constructive work. The links between international detente, disarmament and development are increasingly evident.\n"

It is its turn to have the presidency of the General Assembly and you, Sir, a Colombian personality of singular merit, were unanimously elected.

But it could hardly be otherwise.\n38.\tFollowing the tradition established so many years ago, the delegation of El Salvador wishes to state as briefly as possible its Government's position on the major general problems within the competence of this world Organization and on some of the specific questions that are on this year's agenda for the Assembly, on the solution of which depends the well-being of mankind in the years to come.\n39.\tAmong the general items are two that are in a way interdependent and, undoubtedly, vital: disarmament and development. They are interdependent because the enormous investments in the production, improvement and acquisition of the means of mass destruction through an inevitable reaction prevent the co-operation that is indispensable for development, so that at present the latter is not being attended to as it should be. They are vital because, while the effort to acquire arms can lead to death and destruction, on the other hand the integral development of peoples in an atmosphere of peace can only lead to survival and well-being.\n40.\tFor the first\ttime the States Members of the United Nations have wet at a special session of the General Assembly exclusively to consider the difficult and complicated questions related to the item on disarmament. We then observed the growing concern and disquiet of peoples and Governments at the increasingly alarming arms race, in particular that of the nuclear Powers and others which also have considerable military forces. That observation made evident the need to put an end to this unbridled race, to eliminate nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and reduce to a minimum the possibilities of new wars through an adequate reduction of conventional weapons.\n41.\tAs was stated quite clearly by the delegation of El Salvador at that tenth special session,  the Government of El Salvador considers that, given the present world situation, general and complete disarmament is necessary and urgent and that it should be simultaneous and effectively continued in the field of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and bacteriological weapons. We consider that, as regards conventional armaments, disarmament should also be general, simultaneous and duly controlled, but it cannot be thought or admitted that it should be complete, because that is not necessary, desirable or feasible. As regards conventional or other current weapons, disarmament should be carried out progressively and under proper international control to a point that is in each case compatible with the needs of the State, duly taking into account external and internal security\u2014that is, the needs of its own defence as an independent and sovereign entity and its obligation to maintain public order and to protect its institutions and inhabitants.\n42.\tThe wave of international terrorism, which goes unchecked throughout the world in our times, makes it absolutely necessary for authorities to have available the means essential to confront and fight that terrible and repugnant scourge of mankind. As a means of struggle or for any other purpose terrorism must always be condemned because it indiscriminately places in jeopardy the lives and property of innocent victims. It must be condemned even in the struggles legitimately undertaken in some parts of the world by peoples subjected to the colonial yoke or to other forms of oppression. My country will support every initiative and every effort of the United Nations made with a view to punishing and in due course eliminating terrorism in its diverse manifestations.\n43.\tWhile the results of the special session devoted to disarmament were neither substantial nor spectacular\u2014and, naturally, that was not to be expected-it is just to recognize as a positive step forward the approval by consensus of a Declaration and a Programme of Action [resolution S-10/2, sects. II and III], and, above all, the establishment of a Disarmament Commission as a deliberative body reporting to the General Assembly and the revitalization of the negotiating body, the Committee on Disarmament, by the participation of States that had previously remained aloof from it, thus overcoming one of the most notorious shortcomings of the previous system\n44.\tIt is the hope of the Government of my country that in the new stage of United Nations efforts towards disarmament positive and concrete results will be achieved, such as the conclusion of one or more agreements on the prohibition of nuclear tests and the elimination of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction.\n45.\tThe present international situation requires continued efforts to consolidate detente, which has been affected by new confrontations and the emergence of new hotbeds of tension. That being so, United Nations activity should be increased to seek solutions by way of negotiation and mutual understanding. My Government wishes once again to reaffirm its desire for peace, its respect for the purposes and principles enshrined in the San Francisco Charter, and its full support for United Nations efforts to maintain and strengthen peace.\n46.\tIt is a sad fact that we live in a world in which the various forms of aggression have found new means of expression and hegemonistic claims seem not to have been discarded. The maintenance of peace largely depends upon the ability of human beings to learn to live together rather than merely to coexist, respecting the ideas and rights of others and avoiding delicate situations that might create friction and lead to conflict. Detente is creating an atmosphere appropriate for that kind of conduct, and we must never cease in our endeavour to maintain it, because the survival of mankind ultimately depends upon its decision to live in peace.\n47.\tIn the meantime, if the larger Powers and even the medium-sized and small countries, convinced of the advantages of not continuing to invest vast amounts of money in arms, would cease doing so, then obviously we could attain the ideal talked of so much at the Assembly's session on disarmament, namely by devoting a considerable part of the resources thus saved to promoting the development of each State and, in particular, to helping effectively in the accelerated and integral development of the countries that most need it.\n48.\tSpeaking of development and co-operation for development from the industrialized countries, we are bound to refer to the need to pursue the North-South dialogue without interruption. We regret the suspension of the work of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, and we trust that, since it is aware of the importance of that body and the need to maintain and strengthen it, the General Assembly will not only confirm its mandate but give clear and definite guidelines for effective action by it.\n49.\tAs the Secretary-General rightly affirms in his annual report on the work of the Organization for the past year:\n\\\"Most developing countries continue to suffer from the adverse effects of fluctuations in commodity prices, aggravated by uncertainty resulting from continuing exchange rate instability. The failure of developed countries to achieve sustained economic recovery has resulted in reduced demand for many raw materials exports of developing countries while the inadequate level of financial transfers and the continuing inflation in prices of the manufactured exports from developed countries have put intense pressure on the balance-of-payments position of a large number of developing countries....\n\\\"... These problems [and others] call for more basic changes of a structural and institutional character. Such changes will need to be considered, negotiated and promoted on the basis of the essential objectives of a new international economic order.\\\" [See A/33/1, sect. IX].\n50.\tIt is increasingly necessary for harmony and understanding between the developed and developing countries to arrive at co-operation agreements that will lessen the enormous economic disadvantages from which the third- world countries suffer, which contribute to maintaining an atmosphere of discontent and tension not propitious for United Nations efforts and which are in no way in accord with the purposes and principles laid down in its constitutional Charter.\n51.\tInterdependence is an obvious characteristic of international relations in our contemporary world. International, interregional and national co-operation is absolutely essential. Well-being should not and cannot be confined within closed circles, but must be extended to all, everywhere. We know well that without well-being there will be no peace. \\\"Well-being for all\\\" is the motto of the present Government of El Salvador.\n52.\tIt is of course imperative to undertake and intensify economic and social development efforts within the resources and possibilities of each nation, but goodwill and effective co-operation on the part of the developed countries are indispensable. Obviously more action is expected from countries which are able to co-operate. The present state of affairs is not only a problem in itself in the economic sphere, but also a barrier to the improvement of international political relations.\n53.\tClearly, we also need reciprocal co-operation among developing countries. In this context, my Government recalls with pleasure the holding of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held in Buenos Aires last August and September, the results of which were most positive.\n54.\tClosely linked with development and North-South relations are some aspects of the law of the sea, which is now being codified. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea dosed its seventh session a few weeks ago in this Assembly hall without having achieved the purpose of revising the informal composite negotiating text;  far less could it formalize the draft convention, the signature of which is scheduled to take place in Caracas. That work was postponed to later negotiating stages.\n55.\tBut that should cause no discouragement. This is an effort of far-reaching consequences, namely, to sign and\nimplement a treaty of universal scope that will cover the many aspects of the regime of the seas, an instrument that will have very important consequences legally, economically and politically and at all levels: national, regional and international.\n56.\tIt is therefore not surprising that the negotiating process regarding the law of the sea is so lengthy, laborious and difficult. It has been going on for more than 10 years if we take into account the work that preceded the New York meeting of 1973, and no doubt one or two more years will be required before it can be completed.\n57.\tSubstantial advances have been made on very important points, but there has been a deadlock on some critical issues. In Geneva and New York considerable efforts were made to find formulas on those issues that would be acceptable by consensus.\n58.\tNevertheless, without having reached a consensus, progress has been made on some issues, among them the settlement of disputes on the exercise of rights and discharge of duties by the coastal State in the exclusive economic zone, in respect of which my country is happy that it was able to suggest the mandatory conciliation formula,  which is the method being used to arrive at a consensus.\n59.\tThe positions of some countries on fundamental matters remain rigid and inflexible, in particular regarding the exploration and exploitation of the mineral resources in the international zone of the sea-bed. In this connexion, I must mention the firm opposition of my country to unilateral legislative measures which would regulate exploitation of the sea-bed before the Conference concludes its work, thus disregarding the resolution of this Assembly which established a moratorium on such activities [resolution 2574 D (XXIV)] and declared that the resources contained in that zone constitute the common heritage of mankind [see resolution 2749 (XXV), para. 1J. It is obvious that these unilateral measures run counter to the purposes of the Conference. If it is desired that the Conference be successful such measures should be avoided.\n60.\tWe trust that in its next stages the Conference will be able to surmount the obstacles that remain and will arrive at a convention on the law of the sea. The failure of that effort would not only seriously affect the prestige of the United Nations but would also leave a deplorable situation of disarray and disorder in a matter of such substance and importance to the consolidation of a regime of harmony and co-operation in the world.\n61.\tWe shall be celebrating shortly the thirtieth anniversary of the proclamation by the United Nations in Paris of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This world Organization and regional organizations claim to strive for the promotion and protection of fundamental freedoms as a principle essential to the dignity of men and women.\n62.\tRecently, in the general debate at the eighth regular session of the General Assembly of the OAS, I expressed some views that I believe it appropriate to repeat at this time. Respect for human rights, which El Salvador reaffirms as a rule and as practical inspiration for our national development, is something to be achieved from day to day, in the struggle against poverty and ignorance, against violence and dogmatism. The achievement of that respect, being arduous and gradual, shapes our destiny as a free nation where all can think, act and feel with no limitation other than that imposed by respect for the rights and well-being of their fellow citizens. Therefore we must all realize the meaning of this struggle for hum in rights. This realization will develop in us a spirit of solidarity which will remove us from vain paternalistic attitudes and the fruitless desire simply to point an accusing finger. As I pointed out in my speech, a person must be protected both from illegal actions by public authorities and from the equally illegal actions of those groups which for political or simply criminal purposes violate without compassion the very legal principles which, together with the system of protection and human rights, are supposed to be safeguarded. Such are the actions of terrorism, which, according to recent evidence, has international implications. International action by States- is thus required to counteract the wave of terrorism. These are two aspects of the same problem, two lines converging upon one objective: the preservation of the dignity of the human person. That is the philosophy that inspires and sustains the firm position of my Government regarding observance of and respect for human rights.\n63.\tEl Salvador sympathizes with the efforts of those populations which are arduously struggling to break the chains that still exist, the heritage of former colonial regimes, despite the praiseworthy and constant efforts made by the Organization throughout its existence. We condemn all forms of discrimination and we hope that in the not-far-distant future all men and all peoples will enjoy complete freedom in a world of harmony and mutual respect.\n64.\tIn a generous Central-American spirit, supporting any constructive suggestions for promotion of peace throughout the world, I wish particularly to record that the Government of my country with the utmost fellow feeling concurs in the statement made in this world forum by the President of Costa Rica, Mr. Rodrigo Carazo Odiof, in which he formulated his proposal for the creation of a university for peace, offering his country as its home. My Government warmly supports that initiative.\n65.\tTo proceed now to some of the more specific problems with which the United Nations is dealing, I should like to refer first to some related to Latin America, of which my country forms part.\n66.\tFirst I should like to refer to the question of the territory of Belize. Whether this is or is not a colonial question as such, the truth is that a long-standing dispute exists regarding that territory between the Republic of Guatemala and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. My delegation listened with genuine interest to the statement on the problem made some days ago by the Foreign Minister of Guatemala [19th meeting], and we have noted with genuine pleasure his categorical statement that the Government of Guatemala is prepared to continue negotiations to find an equitable, honourable, peaceful and negotiated solution that would not. undermine the rights of Guatemala and would take into account the vital interest of the population of Belize.,\n67.\tA similar dispute exists between the Republic of Argentina and the United Kingdom regarding the Malvinas Islands, which are also occupied by that European country. We are pleased to note the statement by the Foreign Minister of Argentina filth meeting] to the effect that his Government and the United Kingdom Government have started negotiations which make it possible to envisage some areas of agreement.\n68.\tBecause of the close ties we have with those two countries in our hemisphere and also in particular with the neighbouring sister Republic of Guatemala, we wish to express the most sincere hope that there will be a satisfactory negotiated settlement of both questions.\n69.\tI do not believe it is pertinent to speak of the situation in Nicaragua here, since this matter is being studied by one of the political organs of the OAS-the Meeting of Consultation of Ministers for Foreign Affairs-whose decisions are communicated to the Security Council of the United Nations under a provision of the Charter of this Organization.\n70.\tFor like reasons I might have refrained from speaking about differences between my country and the Republic of Honduras, but, since the Foreign Minister of Honduras, Colonel Roberto Palma Galvez, in his speech on 3 October [19th meeting] referred to the present status of the negotiations for the ending of our differences, I in turn wish to state here that the peaceful process of negotiation has already brought us some important agreements and that the Government of El Salvador, prompted by a genuinely conciliatory and peaceful spirit, hopes and trusts that we shall soon come to an understanding, because of the goodwill of the two parties and the wise counsel of the eminent Peruvian lawyer and statesman, Jose Luis Bustamente y Rivero, former President of his country and former President of the International Court of Justice, to whom we have entrusted the mission of mediator and who is nobly assisting us with the wealth of his knowledge and experience and who encourages us with the prestige of his illustrious personality.\n71.\tSpeaking of recent positive actions in the sphere of inter-American politics, I wish to express the satisfaction of the people and Government of El Salvador at the success achieved regarding the status of the Panama Canal and the resumption of relations between Panama and Guatemala.\n72.\tThis is a propitious tune for me to congratulate the Governments of Panama and the United States on the signing and ratification of the two new treaties on the Panama Canal. The ceremony held on 6 September 1977 in the Chamber of the Americas of the OAS in Washington, which was attended by, among others, the President of my country, will go down in history as a happy event in which two friendly peoples honourably resolved their differences, thus eliminating a source of ill-feeling and tension in this continent.\n73.\tAs is well known, for reasons which it would be inappropriate to mention here, diplomatic relations between the Governments of two Latin-American countries, traditionally linked by ties of friendship, history, geography and language, were broken off for little more than a year. I am referring to Guatemala and Panama. The Government of El Salvador, equally linked to those two countries on the Central-American isthmus, had hoped that in a short time an understanding between the two Governments would be reached. That is why the President of El Salvador, General Carlos Humberto Romero, decided to invite the representatives of both Governments to a meeting so as to put an end to the existing differences. The invitation was accepted, and the Foreign Ministers of Guatemala and Panama, Mr. Rafael Castillo-Valdes and Mr Nicolds Gonzalez Revilla, respectively, met in the Foreign Office building of El Salvador on 28 August last and agreed to resume diplomatic and consular relations between the two countries. This decision was immediately made known to the public by a joint declaration which was designated by both Foreign Ministers as the Declaration of San Salvador.\n74.\tDespite the efforts made over many years, the Middle East situation continues to be the main threat to world peace. We recognize the importance of the negotiations among some of the parties concerned, but we believe that, until all the parties concerned can be brought together at a negotiating table, the desired solutions on the various and complex aspects of the problem will not be reached. A just and lasting peace in the Middle East will have to emerge from a negotiated solution that takes into account the rights and interests of all parties, including those of the Palestinian people and those of Israel as a sovereign State, the general recognition of which should not be postponed any longer.\n75.\tFortunately the Camp David meetings between President El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Begin of Israel, held on the initiative of President Carter of the United States of America and with his active participation, concluded with the signing of agreements that open the way to a prompt and final solution of the over-all problem, if not only Egypt and Israel but also the other parties whose interests are at stake reach agreement.\n76.\tThe Middle East crisis has again been aggravated by events in Lebanon, a country which has borne and continues to bear incredible suffering and which legitimately strives to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity. This Organization is called upon to contribute to the attainment of that purpose, and accordingly the Security Council established UNIFIL whose mandate has been extended for four months bearing in mind the deadlines set at Camp David.\n77.\tThe recent special session devoted to the question of Namibia concluded successfully with the approval of a Programme of Action and a Declaration  affirming the direct responsibility of the United Nations for that Territory and setting specific conditions and measures for its independence and for the maintenance of its territorial integrity.\n78.\tI wish to emphasize the merits of the proposal of the five Western members of the Security Council-Canada, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States-for the solution of the Namibian problem.\n79.\tWe felt optimistic on noting that agreement had been reached and that this took shape in Security Council resolution 431 (1978), under which the necessary steps were to be taken to implement in practice the proposal of the five Western Powers in accordance with the plan formulated by the Secretary-General and with Security Council resolution 385 (1976). Recently, however, serious obstacles to the implementation of the agreed plan have arisen which might further delay Namibian independence, and this is to be deeply regretted.\n80.\tIt is equally unfortunate that, despite the constant and prolonged efforts of this Organization, there has been no solution of the problem of Cyprus. This is an explosive situation which, like the situations in the Horn of Africa and southern Africa, constitutes a serious danger to peace.\n81.\tWe often expect of international organizations much more than they can reasonably do, because they are associations of sovereign States whose consent is necessary in most cases if major decisions are to be adopted. And at times, too, we attribute to international bureaucracies defects or errors for which they are not responsible.\n82.\tThus, the negotiating processes on disarmament and on the law of the sea, to mention only two examples, are agonizingly slow and laborious and seem never-ending. It is no easy task to reconcile interests, opinions and tendencies that are so dissimilar on such grave and complex subjects. This does not mean that we must abandon our efforts. On the contrary, we must redouble them in order to find the solutions that are most suitable and respond best to the aspirations and interests of the international community.\n83.\tAs regards the contribution of the Secretariat, my Government wishes to reiterate once again its gratitude and admiration for the consistent and efficient manner in which the Secretary-General and those who work under his skilful guidance perform their functions for the benefit of the Organization and all its Members.\n84.\tI should like to conclude my statement by saying that I happened to be in Rome when His Holiness John Paul I died suddenly. It was my painful task and my privilege, as the representative of a predominantly Catholic people, to be present at the funeral of that beloved pastor of souls whose pontificate, which seemed so promising, was unfortunately so ephemeral.\n85.\tWe still hear the words spoken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy on 27 September [11th meeting], when nobody-thought that the newly-elected High Pontiff, the Pope of smiles and meekness, was about to die. The Foreign Minister of Italy mentioned then that His Holiness had defined as a service of the Holy See its participation in the search for better solutions to the major international\nproblems, including detente, disarmament, peace, humanitarian assistance and development. To perform this service, the Foreign Minister added, the Pope appealed for the co-operation of all so as to put an end, within nations, to the blind violence that merely destroys and sows ruin and grief and, in international life to bring about understanding among men and the pooling of efforts aimed at progress, at overcoming hunger and ignorance, and at promoting the advancement of peoples less endowed with wealth.\n\n86.\tMay the most noble purposes of the Holy Father, who already rests in peace, be a constant source of inspiration for the United Nations in its desire to bequeath a better world to future generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "May I first of all extend to you, Mr. President, my sincerest congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. At a time when African and third-world values can and should influence and contribute more effectively to contemporary world leadership and international affairs, we are confident in the knowledge that your long and brilliant record and experience in international affairs and deep knowledge of the United Nations system, is well as the quality of your collaborators in the General Committee and in the Secretariat, inspire confidence that this session will usher in a dynamic and rational step into a new era of international co-operation.\n3.\tNearly five years ago I had the opportunity to address this Assembly at its sixth special session  when, for the first time, the whole world, both industrialized and developing countries, rich and poor nations, big and small Powers, suddenly discovered their collective interdependence in the face of a universal economic threat that was triggered primarily by an unprecedented increase in the prices of indispensable international trade commodities. The gravity of that situation was accentuated by the total unpreparedness of the international community, which, in the preceding decade, had failed to recognize the urgency of changing the existing economic order in a manner that was fair, just and equitable to the majority of humanity.\n\n4.\tParadoxically, the great progress made in international politics in the same period, which significantly coincided with the first 10 years of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], was not matched in the sphere of economic relations between nations. On the one hand, Africa had emerged from colonial domination and was approaching total liberation at a pace that could be neither slowed down nor halted; and, on the other hand, international relations, hitherto characterized by super-Power politics and conflicts operating within a dangerous framework of bipolar interest blocs, was evolving into a system of general horizontal co-operation in the developed world, of the Northern Hemisphere.\n5.\tToday as I speak to you the wind of political change in Africa is losing its historic momentum of the 1960s as decolonization approaches its final phase, while the economic storm that has been shaking the world since 1973 has not shown any sign of abating. Indeed, it is this worsening economic crisis, rooted in the unsatisfied basic needs of the vast majority of mankind, that constitutes the greatest threat to world peace today -- that seemingly elusive yet noble objective which inspired the creation of the United Nations. In 1945 the world emerged from a war whose devastation has never been equalled in the history of conflicts between nations. The horror of the nations and States is thus reflected in the objectives and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which are primarily \u201cto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\u201d. A major achievement by the draughtsmen of the Charter is the endowment of succeeding generations of mankind with an instrument which, if properly used and its tenets respected by all States, will guarantee the three objectives of the maintenance of peace, the respecting of human rights, and the promotion of socio-economic progress for peoples all over the world.\n6.\tI have made those preliminary remarks simply to demonstrate that man has the vision and the capacity to resolve the world\u2019s problems if he has the necessary political will to do so, and that the prescription for the solution of contemporary global problems-especially those relating to hunger, malnutrition and disease, human rights and racial discrimination-was appropriately entrenched in the United Nations Charter.\n7: On this occasion I should like to focus attention on the area of economic justice in the hope that this Session will mark a major turning-point in the quest for the attainment of this noble objective.\n8.\tThere is no doubt whatsoever that in the past two decades some progress has been made in the area of economic development. Yet it is also true that, in spite of these achievements, the disparities between the living\nstandards of people in developed and in developing countries are continuing to widen, and today many millions of people the world over are permanently trapped in a situation of absolute poverty. There is thus a clear case for concerted action to be taken by the international community at large, in collaboration with the Governments of the countries concerned, to improve the living conditions of the poorest peoples of the world and to meet their basic needs. That is the challenge facing all of us today.\n9.\tThe introduction of the basic-needs concept as a new approach to development, particularly in developing countries, is an initial promise that the challenge is being responded to. But that concept of basic needs must be related to the specific and dynamic circumstances of each individual country and region. Therefore, as the current Chairman of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel [CILSS], I should like to take this opportunity to acquaint this Assembly with the grave situation in that region of West Africa resulting from consecutive years of drought. In the Sahel, with its fragile ecology, the problems of under-development have been exacerbated by the spectre of nearly a decade of persistent drought.\n10.\tThe recent droughts in the Sahel have resulted in the loss of several thousands of human lives, a severe decimation of the livestock population in the area and a significant drop in the level of production of food crops. The destruction of the already fragile ecosystem has also been further accelerated and the relentless advance of the desert set in train. At the height of the Sahelian drought in 1972 and 1973 the desert had advanced by scores of kilometres in some areas. Agricultural production in most of the Sahelian countries during the past decade has either declined or stagnated. In recent years all these countries have faced tremendous hardships, and without the assistance of the international community many more lives of human beings and of livestock would have been lost. In addition, like most of the developing countries of the third world, our States suffered greater penalties from inflation than the more developed parts of the world. We have had to pay for greater increases in the cost of imported materials, particularly manufactured goods, agricultural inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, and cereal grains.\n11.\tWhile large-scale food aid and the importation of food grains, especially in years of drought, have ensured the region\u2019s survival, the objective of regional food self-sufficiency in the Sahel is a political, economic and social option for its peoples. It is a political choice because it is recognized that during any global food crisis it will be the poor nations, and the poorest ones in these countries, that will suffer most. It is an economic choice because in reality the Sahel is a cereal-producing region par excellence and has the land and water resources to produce cereal grains not only for itself but also for other regions of the world and thereby to be in a position to contribute its quota to the resolution of the world food crisis. Finally, it is a social choice because it is based on the fact that agriculture will for a long time to come continue to be the basis of our economies and the main employer of our peoples. Above all else, if we give food self-sufficiency such prominence, it is because people are still hungry and malnourished in the Sahel\n\n12.\tThe objective of regional food self-sufficiency in the Sahel cannot be achieved, however, as long as we continue to depend on occasional seasonal rainfall that is both too erratic and insufficient to meet the crop production needs in the region. The solution of this problem demands not only a marked improvement in rain-fed agriculture in the area but also a significant and rapid expansion of irrigated agriculture through the harnessing and use of the vast water resources of the region, including its enormous reserves of underground water. The scope of the Sahel\u2019s water potential can best be appreciated if we recall that the River Niger discharges 32 billion cubic metres of water per year at Niamey, the Senegal River discharges 24 billion cubic metres at Bakel, Lake Chad receives 43 billion cubic metres from its main tributaries, the Logone and the Shari, and the Gambia River discharges 9 billion cubic metres of water a year into the Atlantic Ocean. At the same time the Sahel\u2019s irrigable land potential has been put at more than 2.3 million hectares.\n13.\tIt is therefore in the light of these circumstances and considering the magnitude of the task that the Sahelian countries came together in September 1973 to form CILSS to tackle collectively the immediate effects of endemic drought and to work out a medium- and long-term strategy and programme for the rehabilitation and development of the Sahel region.\n14.\tI am happy to say here that the United Nations, through FAO and the United Nations Sahelian Office played a vital role in that initiative. In view of the level and scope of the assistance required to undertake the planning of those programmes, in the first instance, as well as the amount of investment funds required for their realization, it was necessary that the international community be involved in those activities. Thus, two years after CILSS was created the proposal for the creation of the Club des amis du Sahel-the Club du Sahel as it is now known- which is a flexible and informal body to examine what co-operative action might be taken for the long-term development of the Sahel, was mooted by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and other international organizations, and in March 1976, at a meeting of the CILSS Heads of State and Government in Dakar, that proposal was accepted and the Club held its first meeting there.\n15.\tThe immediate task undertaken by the Club in collaboration with CILSS was the working out of a long-term development strategy and action programmes, which were accepted by the CILSS Council of Ministers and later adopted at the second meeting of the Club du Sahel held in Ottawa in May last year. That strategy covers the period 1978-2000 and its principal objective is the achievement of food self-sufficiency in the region as a whole, however difficult the climatic conditions may be, and, subsequently, self-sustaining economic and social development of the region. Within the framework of that strategy a development programme, which has been called the first- generation programme, has been outlined for the five-year period 1978-1982 and is estimated to cost around $3 billion.\n16.\tThat programme essentially seeks to develop the water resources, restore the equilibrium of the ecosystem through\u2003\nreafforestation, and improve fisheries and livestock and agricultural productivity, as well as to protect crops, develop transportation and strengthen the training and research facilities and programmes in the region.\n17.\tThe rains in the Sahel region this year have been generally good in comparison to what they had been in the past few years, and we are hopeful that crop output may be much improved over that of last year. But there is no assurance that next year\u2019s rainy season will be equally good. We therefore see the development of the entire water resources in the Sahel region as the solution in the matter of increased food and cash-crop production in our Sahelian countries. It is for that reason that much emphasis has been placed on the development of the major river and lake basins as well as the underground water reserves in the area. Many river basin authorities have already been formed, such as the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the Organization for the Development of the Senegal River and the Organization for the Development of the Gambia River Basin to plan for their integrated and rational development.\n18.\tAs far as the development of the Gambia river basin is concerned, the programme that has been conceived entails the construction of an anti-salt barrage in the estuary basin for the control of salinity intrusion further into the river, and a vehicular crossing of regional importance. This structure will at the same time make it possible for 24,000 hectares of suitable irrigable land in the Gambia to be reclaimed and utilized for crop production. It will also provide a means of controlling flooding in the river flats in the eastern sector of the country during the flood period. For the Gambia, this is a priority project and it is hoped to commence construction in 1979. Secondly, the programme will involve the construction of two other dams in the continental basin for the provision of water for irrigation and the generation of hydroelectric power for industrial and domestic use on a regional basis.\n19.\tThe execution of such projects is vital for the future of the Sahel and I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General of the United Nations and all friendly Governments and organizations that are closely involved in the implementation of the CILSS development programme for their assistance. Furthermore, we in the Sahel value the very positive approach of the United Nations in providing the effective mechanism of the United Nations Sahelian Office as the focal point and co-ordinating body for the support of the activities of the United Nations system in the medium-term and long-term recovery, and development of the Sahel. There is also FAO, which is one of the most active champions of the Sahelian cause.\n20.\tThe creation of the Club du Sahel marks a new era and pattern in the relations between the developed and third- world countries conducted in a spirit of partnership for development in an emerging world economic order. For this dynamic action we wish to record our sincere thanks to the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development which led the initiative for the creation of the Club.\n21.\tThe goodwill of the international community towards the Sahel has now been amply demonstrated. Indeed, earlier this year, in my capacity as current Chairman of the\n\nConference of Heads of State and Government of CILSS, I commenced a sensitization tour of friendly donor countries and institutions which took me in the first instance to the United States of America, France and Italy with a view also to mobilizing the necessary financial material support for the Sahel\u2019s development programme. We have been greatly encouraged by the response we have received so far, but of course a lot more is needed.\n22.\tI should therefore wish to use this occasion to appeal to the international community to intensify and increase its support for the Sahel\u2019s development programme. Although financial aid has increased, the level is in no way adequate to meet the investment needs for the realization of the CILSS programme. Additionally, aid will have to be granted on the most favourable terms and the aid procedures and project selection and appraisal criteria will also have to be adjusted and modified to take account of the peculiar circumstances of the Sahel. For instance, the concept of absorptive capacity must be adjusted so as to ensure that the poorer countries do not lose out in the allocation and distribution of aid. Again, donor countries will have to be involved in the funding of some infrastructure projects. Most parts of the Sahel lack infrastructure and without adequate infrastructure meaningful development cannot be achieved. Likewise, aid funds may of necessity have to cover some of the local-cost element of projects as well as certain other operating expenses.\n23.\tWhile the disastrous Sahelian drought encouraged regional and interregional co-operation and solidarity, the world economic situation is still a challenge to our individual States, to our regional organizations and to this world body. International trade is at present characterized by conflicting economic chauvinisms and by a clear division between the small number of affluent industrialized countries, on the one hand, and the numerous poor countries of the developing world, on the other. In market conditions which are inequitable and unfavourable to the exporters of primary commodities and in which rich and advanced countries virtually monopolize the price determination process, the vast majority of mankind is condemned to a poverty trap from which escape is possible only through concerted international effort. This situation is aggravated by the fact that in international exchange export earnings from raw materials are determined by the buyers\u2019 market, while the sale of industrial and manufactured goods is exclusively dictated by the suppliers\u2019 market conditions. Thus the same countries, as sellers and buyers, determine the respective value of what they need from us and what they offer to us.\n24.\tThis inequitable trade practice and economic system, which reflect neither the principles of free enterprise nor those of centrally controlled markets, have been the root-cause of the continuing deterioration of the terms of trade of the third world and the ever widening gap between rich and poor nations. These forces, made more complex by the energy crisis since 1973, by inflation, monetary instability and natural calamities such as floods and drought, represent severe obstacles that hamper the achievement of even the minimal development objectives of our countries. Not only did we have to pay higher prices for oil; we also had to pay higher prices for manufactured imports from the developed countries, prices which have themselves\u2003\nbeen forced up by energy and other costs. For us in the developing countries there has been a 500 per cent increase in the price of imported oil, representing an additional cost of $8,5 billion, since 1973. As a result, the terms of trade of the most severely affected developing countries declined by no less than 15 per cent in the few years following 1973 and this percentage has since increased. Consequently, these unfortunate countries are surviving only by increasing their indebtedness into the 1980s and this, according to present projections, could mark a recurrence of the 1973 hardships. Oil supplies would be insufficient to sustain economic growth, prices would tend to rise and those countries without adequate financial resources would encounter greater difficulties in satisfying their oil needs, a fact which in itself would risk creating international tension. Such a terrifying forecast imposes on us the need to look for cheaper alternative or complementary energy sources to mitigate the effects of another energy crisis.\n25.\tIt is against this background that we invite all States and men of goodwill and foresight to join in a co-operative effort to change the present economic order. The new international economic system we advocate must be based on equity, justice and solidarity and on respect for the sovereign equality of all States and peoples. The structural changes that we demand are a means to an end which will guarantee a fairer distribution of production, surpluses and economic rewards. For the first time in the history of man some countries and regions are today producing practically enough for their peoples and it is only normal that the poorer nations, which constitute the majority of mankind, should want to dc likewise. But this situation can only materialize if international trade evolves in such a manner that the reward for production in the developing countries is equal, at least in real terms, to incomes for the same output in the industrialized countries.\n26.\tThe new relationship will also mean that, in addition to obtaining fair prices, the developing countries will take a greater share in the manufacturing and processing of goods for export It is the moral responsibility of all industrialized nations to remove all trade and other barriers that tend to create disincentives for developing countries to develop their industrial capacity. Access to the markets of the advanced countries must be guaranteed in respect of our exportable raw materials and processed goods at fair and remunerative prices. These are the only conditions that are conducive to global prosperity and that will enhance the capacity of the third-world countries to accumulate earnings to meet their consumption demand. Thus the long-run fortunes of the rich nations also depend on the economic performance of the poor countries and we need trade as the most effective avenue to sustained development.\n27.\tWe do, naturally, also need aid, but such assistance must be on the most concessionary terms if it is to have any beneficial effect on the receiving countries. Such aid must not have as a major objective to provide employment in the donor countries, as has been the practice for many years. Furthermore, the tendency to provide emergency or special assistance at the expense of normal aid has negative effects on the growth rate of the recipient countries. We believe that, whenever the need for emergency or special aid arises, it must complement, and not replace, planned aid and that the ultimate objective of giving aid is in fact to eliminate the need for aid itself.\n\n28.\tAt-this juncture, let me hasten to observe that the efforts deployed by the international community in the past few years have been encouraging. The North-South dialogue, the Common Fund discussions, the Stabex arrangements of the European Economic Community and the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group and the creation of the International Fund for Agricultural Development represent a new attitude and a new beginning which augur well for the future. We are further encouraged by the fact that this vertical dialogue coincides with a dynamic horizontal linkage of co-operation among developing countries. In this regard, I pay a tribute to the role of Arab solidarity, especially with African countries, a solidarity which has now been institutionalized through the OAU on the one hand, and the League of Arab States and related institutions on the other.\n29.\tIn this dynamic process it is incumbent upon the developing countries, especially those in Africa, to create the appropriate regional and interregional institutions as a vital facet of the emerging order. In other words, Africa must establish its own regional order so as to maximize its benefits from any world-wide adjustment. We must accordingly pool our resources in order to achieve economies of scale and thereby enhance our competitive and bargaining power vis-a-vis the industrialized countries. The Gambia is therefore totally committed to the Economic Community of West African States and similar regional organizations to which we belong\n30.\tBut the desired change in the existing economic system cannot be achieved without access to technology and the relocation and transfer of manufacturing industries to developing countries. The call for the transfer of technology must, in our view, be seen against the socioeconomic background of our countries. What we are really talking about is the \u201cadaptation of technology\u201d or the transfer of \u201cappropriate technology\u201d. Quite often imported technology from advanced countries is both expensive and labour saving-and is not always relevant to the needs and resources of its intended beneficiaries. What we need in the developing countries are production methods that can meet local needs and utilize indigenous raw materials and labour. Appropriate technology must allow the maintenance of a people\u2019s cultural identity and must so infuse scientific and technological principles into traditional techniques as to bring about their evolution and not their extinction.\n31.\tTo transfer and adapt appropriate technology to the needs of our predominantly rural societies, international agencies and friendly Governments should support research efforts by and with Africans inside Africa. Such a reorientation will contribute to economic independence. The failure of development efforts in the last few decades and the inability to bridge the gap between rich and poor and make essential services effectively accessible to the rural poor are related to the defects and deficiencies of technology and the manner and terms of transfer of that technology from the advanced to the third-world countries. This technological gap is clearly demonstrated by the fact that in the advanced countries the 8 per cent of the population engaged in agriculture produces enough to feed their people and to leave a surplus for export Yet the developing\n2\tStabilization of export earnings.\ncountries, with 90 per cent of the people engaged in agriculture, are still not self-sufficient in food. The problem is evidently technological. These issues, discussed at the recent Freetown conference on appropriate technology, have been more exhaustively dealt with in the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held in Buenos Aires this month, and will be examined by the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development, to be held in Vienna next year.\n32.\tIn my view, concrete results would be achieved if there were a massive and concerted transfer of technological know-how, first of all in the area of agriculture and food production. Food self-sufficiency would then be the basis of development, as indeed was the case in the developed countries, where improved agricultural methods and practices predated the development of industrialization.\n33.\tI cannot end these remarks on international economic and technical co-operation without briefly touching on disarmament, which was exhaustively debated at the tenth special session earlier this year. I need simply say that, without mentioning the objective of peace through disarmament, it must be evident that the huge armament budgets of rich nations are largely achieved at the expense of the developing world. An equally serious factor that accentuates this problem is the arms race among poor countries, which feel compelled by local or regional circumstances to divert scarce resources from social development to armaments.\n34.\tEverything I have said so far could have been presented under a general treatise on human rights, since economic development is an indispensable means for the full realization of human rights in the modern world. When the founding fathers of the United Nations drew up the Charter in 1945, they reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person, thus reflecting the indissoluble link between respect for human rights and human survival implied in the first preambular paragraph of the Charter.\n35.\tIn our unequivocal position on human rights we in the Gambia are greatly inspired by the ethical codes adopted by the United Nations. The Gambia, like the majority of the present Members of our Organization, was under foreign rule for many centuries. Throughout that dark period of our history, colonialism deprived our people of the most basic of human rights, such as the right to choose their own leaders and own their system of government and the right to develop their indigenous culture. Then came the gallant struggle for independence and finally independence itself. With the attainment of self-determination and independence it would indeed be ironic if the freedom gained from the defeat of colonialism should again be denied to our peoples by our own leaders. After centuries of a deliberate policy of dehumanization, subjugation and oppression, the minimum our peoples expect and must have is the full enjoyment of their political, economic, social and cultural rights, for which they so gallantly fought during the liberation struggle; they deserve no less. It should be the duty of all of us to strive assiduously to ensure that everywhere in the world today people enjoy to the full their civil and political rights.\n\n23\n36.\tI should, however, underline that our position regarding human rights is not confined to the narrow sense of civil and political rights so frequently prescribed for the developing countries. For us in the Gambia human rights are composite, indivisible and universal, and include also social and economic rights such as the right to a decent diet, decent shelter, and access to health and education facilities.\n37.\tHuman rights transcend national boundaries and are relevant to the economic relations between advanced countries and the third world. Indeed the demand for a change in the present anachronistic economic order is synonymous with the assertion of the economic rights of the poor nations of the world against the monopolies of the affluent societies of the advanced countries. One might even say that the whole exercise in promoting international economic co-operation and development, whether in the framework of the North-South dialogue or in the United Nations system, or even at regional or bilateral levels, is merely an exercise in pursuit of comprehensive human rights aimed at uplifting the social condition of man.\n38.\tMy Government and people believe also that human rights cannot have a mere rhetorical value. They must not only be enunciated. Above all they should be practised in every country, especially as we are living in a time when human rights have been so eloquently enunciated in numerous national and international documents subscribed to by many nations. These enunciations are themselves no small accomplishments. It is sad to say, however, that while they seem to be concerned with setting standards, the noble ideals of these texts, declarations and conventions bear an obscure relation to actual national or international realities. We believe strongly that ethical codes have little value if unmatched by ethical conduct.\n39.\tThe United Nations forum is an appropriate milieu to discuss human rights. For not only is our Organization the cross-roads where all systems, cultures, values and ideologies meet; it is also the assembly that has played the leading role in the promotion and defence of the rights and dignity of man. Indeed, the United Nations .has made clear pronouncements in many fundamental texts such as the Charter itself, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of 1948; the international Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, of 1966; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, of 1966; and the Declaration on Permanent Sovereignty over National \u2022 Resources, of 1962. These instruments together recognize that freedom from want and fear can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights; so that the individual can achieve the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable to the full development of his personality; and so that the rights of peoples and nations over their natural resources can be exercised in their own interest.\n40.\tWe can say, therefore, that the history of the United Nations, including its position on decolonization, apartheid and racial discrimination, its stand on disarmament and its objective of world peace, is itself the history of the quest for human rights. If through this historical process we succeed in achieving universal respect for human rights as a basic need, we shall be blessed with peace.\n41.\tPeace is the fundamental objective of the Charter and we firmly believe that, as the founding fathers recognized at San Francisco in 1945, world peace is threatened by the areas of tension in the third world, which has now become the preferred theatre for super-Power struggles and rivalries. In Africa we have witnessed in the last year or so a spate of foreign military intervention and adventurism reminiscent of the nineteenth century imperialist expansion into our continent. Let me reiterate the position of my Government and people which I expressed unequivocally during my recent visit to the United States as the CILSS envoy and at the recent summit of the OAU in Khartoum.3\n42.\tWe are categorically opposed to all forms of military intervention, whatever their origin and motivation. After centuries of struggle for freedom and against foreign domination, resulting in an almost total liberation of the continent and the demise of imperialism in its classical form, Africa cannot accept any foreign military intervention, even in its present guise. The independence and territorial integrity of Africa must be respected, and it must be accepted that the defence of Africa must be by Africans and for Africa. And, as agreed in Khartoum, any interventionist force in Africa that is not the creation of the OAU will enjoy no legitimacy in Africa.\n43.\tAfrica does not need at this time of its development military intervention or the kind of aid which would escalate internecine conflicts and accelerate self-destruction. What Africa needs urgently is foreign economic intervention along lines conceived by Africans and for the primary benefit of our peoples. There is an urgent need in Africa for a new Marshall Plan that will lift us from a state of poverty and the under-utilization of the vast resources of the continent to the modern age of technological progress. I sincerely believe that it is only through economic and social progress that democracy and stability can be established and enjoyed in the general interest of peace.\n44.\tOur commitment to peace also dictates our total attachment to the policy of non-alignment. History in its inexorable logic has witnessed the emergence of this doctrine to which we as Gambians and as Africans collectively subscribe. Our concept of non-alignment is positive; it is far from being a state of indifference or neutrality. What we mean by positive non-alignment is that whatever positions we take or views we hold on any international issues result from our own sovereign judgement in the interest solely of peace and progress. The policy of non-alignment is above all not a balancing posture; rather, it is through the collective positions of the individual countries, especially the non-aligned movement, that it represents an independent force in its own right, whose weight in this gathering cannot be ignored.\n45.\tWhile we enunciate here the principles of human rights, chart out development paths and elaborate prescriptions for global peace, everything that negates these noble aims and laudable strategies still persists in southern Africa.\n46.\tIn Zimbabwe, it is now clear that Smith\u2019s internal settlement is not achieving its intended effects. Instead it\n3\tFifteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held at Khartoum from 18 to 22 July 1978.\n\nhas led to the loss of more lives, the destruction of more property and the generation of more racial animosity. Our basic objections to the Salisbury Agreement  are its attempt to exclude the Patriotic Front, the heavy disproportion of power and special privileges for the white minority, and the unduly lengthy period it prescribes before a genuine transfer of power to the majority is effected. In these circumstances I am convinced there is an urgent necessity for fresh initiatives to be taken to break the apparent stalemate with a view to giving a new momentum to the process of change made possible within the framework of the Anglo-American proposals.  In this regard a conference of the leaders of all the groupings of Zimbabwe should be convened to prepare the way for genuine independence and a peaceful transfer of power to the majority.\n47.\tOn the question of Namibia our position remains consistently that a peaceful and genuine independence, internationally recognized, should follow free elections based on universal adult suffrage under the effective supervision of the United Nations. In this connection we are confident that the United Nations presence, which has already become a reality in Namibia, will accelerate and guarantee the independence of what used to be known as South West Africa. But the independence of Namibia will be incomplete as long as an inch of its territory remains under foreign domination. For this reason we totally reject South Africa\u2019s claim to Walvis Bay, as Namibia can remain independent only if its territorial integrity remains inviolable. In our view no amount of international guarantee can ensure the inviolability of Namibia\u2019s territorial integrity as long as South Africa continues to exercise sovereignty over Walvis Bay. This part of Namibia is a colonial situation, and it must be decolonized together with the rest of Namibia.\n48.\tUntil a few days ago our hopes were high that at long last South Africa would bow to international public opinion and to reality by accepting the implementation of the proposals on Namibia of the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim.  But once again these hopes have been dashed to the ground by a defiant South Africa. It is therefore the duty of this Assembly, of the Security Council and of the five Western members of the Council to maintain firm pressure on South Africa to heed international public opinion and allow Namibia to move to genuine independence on the basis of the Secretary- General\u2019s proposals.\n49 South Africa itself now remains the last bastion against the upsurge of freedom and independence moving irresistibly across, the continent down to the Cape of Good Hope. The South African regime is the only known administration today that has institutionalized racial discrimination, and with an arrogance that defies our Organization and, indeed, world, opinion. We are opposed to the Pretoria Government because of our rejection of its apartheid policy, which seeks to give legitimacy and\nrespectability to a social system in which a man is judged not by his intrinsic worth but by the colour of his skin. As Africans we cannot be indifferent to a foreign system imposed on our continent against the will of its indigenous people, for racism and colour prejudice, by-products of colonialism and imperialism, are alien to African values. Unfortunately, South Africa continues to survive because of the support of its friends, which provide it with massive investment and military aid and technology. Those countries concerned are thus guaranteeing the economic viability and stability of the Republic and contributing effectively to the perpetuation of the inhuman policy of apartheid.\n50.\tIn the absence of a peaceful change in South Africa we will continue to support individually and collectively the heroic struggle of the freedom fighters of southern Africa until the emergence of a free and independent Azania. We call upon all the nations of the world and all men of goodwill to rally round the African cause so that democracy can prevail in South Africa and in the continent of Africa as a whole.\n51.\tLet me hasten to add that our policy towards South Africa is not discriminatory towards any particular racial group in that country. What we want to see is a free and prosperous South Africa in which all its peoples can live and work in harmony on the basis of equality and mutual respect, a South Africa which can pool its mineral and human resources in the supreme interest of all its peoples and of Africa. Once South Africa sets its house in order it will cease to be the pariah of the international community. It will become fully accepted in all the international forums, including the OAU, of which it could be an important and influential member. This is the challenge to the new leadership which will no doubt soon emerge in South Africa, to their friends and to humanity in general.\n52.\tWhile on the subject of South Africa, let me take this opportunity to thank the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid for adopting a resolution on South African martyrs and for convening a special meeting on the anniversary of the death of Steven Biko. This, coming so soon after the decision of the OAU Assembly in Khartoum to commemorate 12 September as South Africa Martyrs Day, is most gratifying. I commend these actions to the General Assembly as a mark of solidarity with the struggle in South Africa.\n53.\tOur aim in Africa is that the continent should be free from conflicts of all kinds. We therefore wish to see the restoration of peaceful good neighbourliness in the Horn of Africa and the return of normality in Western Sahara. We are very much encouraged by the readiness for dialogue and compromise shown by all the parties directly concerned in these conflicts in the true African tradition. We appeal to outside interests as well as to all the friends of Africa to support Africa\u2019s search for a peaceful settlement of these intra-African problems.\n54 The greatest threat to world peace in modern times has been the Palestinian and Middle East question. The history of this problem and its causes and consequences are so familiar, complex though they are, to everyone here that I need not be repetitive. Our position is based on historical, legal and moral considerations. We cannot accept that the Jews of Israel need a national homeland more than do the\n\nPalestinian Arabs, nor can we accept that Arab territory, including a part of Africa, can be acquired by Israel by force and retained. We therefore once again call upon Israel to withdraw from all Arab land occupied by force and to respect the rights of the Palestinian people to a homeland in the birthplace of their ancestors.\n55.\tIsrael, together with its neighbours, needs peace, and the bold initiative taken last year by President Anwar El-Sadat of Egypt had generated hopes that a break-through was in sight. These peace efforts have been given a new impetus by the courageous, imaginative and timely initiative of President Carter of the United States, which culminated in the agreements concluded at Camp David,  which we hope will be a strong enough foundation for a final and definitive settlement in this long drawn-out conflict in the Middle East.\n56.\tI have spoken at length on economic co-operation, human rights and peace as the central theme of my statement. Their attainment cannot, however, be complete without some attendant adjustment within the United Nations system itself. The United Nations has had some major successes. It has served the common interest in its peace-keeping activities and in its pioneer work in economic and social development. It has served humanity in the areas of health, communications and education, to name a few. Yet the United Nations, like other institutions, has failed frequently to fulfil the expectations of its founders and the objectives of its Charter. The need for the reform of the United Nations dates back to the 1960s as the changing circumstances, especially in the third world, necessitate changes in structure, procedures and priorities. Apart from the areas of peace and security, there is an urgent need to effect reform in other areas, such as the decision-making process.\n57.\tRegarding decision-making, it is to be recalled that at the United Nations Conference on International Organization, held in San Francisco in 1945, the authors of the Charter based the voting procedure which was to apply on the principle of sovereign equality, in accordance with Article 2. Yet, in reality, this principle is so contradicted that it has been said that the main body of the Charter and its empirical functioning is based on the sovereign inequality of its Members. This is demonstrated by the established predominance of the five permanent members of the Security Council, whose power of veto negates the principle of \u201cone man, one vote\\\" -- or, if you like, \u201cone country, one vote\u201d. This situation calls for urgent review. If the power of veto cannot be revoked, then consideration should be given to entrusting it to a collectivity of nations representing important politico-economic or geographic regions, such as, in the case of Africa, the OAU.\n58.\tIn the economic and social sphere there are promising signs of reform. At its thirty-second session the General Assembly endorsed wide-ranging recommendations on the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations [resolution 32/197J. The United Nations, through UNDP, is playing a greater role in project appraisal, execution, monitoring and evaluation, but in certain cases\nfollow-up action to take care of certain recurrent costs in the least developed countries especially should be considered, and long-term pledges should be envisaged as a factor for rational planning and stability in development.\n59.\tIn the field of the recruitment and deployment of United Nations personnel, we urge that due account be taken of the present composition of the Organization, which is so different from what it was in 1945. In this regard it is gratifying to note the recent appointment of a Director General for Development and International Economic Co-operation which we hope is part of the process of the change for which we are now calling.\n60.\tAs the Gambia will be taking its seat for the first time in the Governing Council of UNDP, we hereby pledge our will to contribute effectively to the general programme of work of the Council and to the achievement of the declared objective of the majority of member States-that is to say, the reform of the system.\n61.\tAt this juncture 1 should like to express my gratitude and appreciation to the Secretary-General and, through him, to UNDP, the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Co-ordinator and to the United States Government for their timely assistance to the Gambia following a serious emergency caused by a major break-down in our electrical power supply system. The swiftness of the action and the effects it has had in mitigating the gravity of the situation demonstrate the capacity of the United Nations system to intervene promptly and effectively in urgent and specific problem areas.\n62.\tWe are witnessing a unique period of history as we approach the end of the twentieth century. Man has made giant technological advances but very little progress in solving the basic social problems of the world. Hunger and disease,, illiteracy and under-development have not by any means been conquered, and man is still fighting for his basic freedoms. Yet I am confident that man has the capacity to overcome his individual and collective difficulties. We need only the political will to implement the principles of the Charter of the United Nations for the attainment of the noble aims so eloquently expressed in San Francisco in 1945. In this way we would save succeeding generations from war and attain world peace through universal respect for human rights and the achievement of global social and economic progress.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n163.\tI should like first of all to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly for its thirty-third session. My delegation looks forward to working under the presidency of the Foreign Minister of Colombia, a fellow charter Member of the United Nations from the Western hemisphere with which Canada has the friendliest of relations. The Canadian delegation pledges to you, Sir, its fullest support in fulfilling your heavy responsibilities during the next three months.\n164.\tI should also like to congratulate Deputy Foreign Minister Mojsov of Yugoslavia on the efficient and decisive way in which he presided over not only the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly but also three special -sessions, including the very important special session co disarmament.\n165.\tThis year we welcome our new Member, Solomon Islands, whose application Canada was pleased to recommend in the Security Council and to join in sponsoring as a member of the Commonwealth. With the admission of the Solomon Islands the United Nations has attained the bench-mark figure of ISO Member nations and has approached even closer to the goal of universality of membership.\n166.\tIn my statement a year ago13 I was critical of some of the procedures of our Assembly, and 1 still believe that we need to act and to speak so that our people can understand what it is we are doing here and have confidence in our decisions. I do not mean to imply that we ought to agree on everything or even try to settle everything; on the contrary, I think that we should be careful to arrange our agenda so that we concentrate on the major purposes of the United Nations, not on the headlines of the moment.\n167.\t1 am glad to note that the Secretary-General has echoed some of these sentiments in his annual report on the work of the Organization. But he also emphasizes that the pursuit of global objectives ought to take precedence over \\\"nationalistic aims\\\". Let there be no doubt that Canada, too, regards the United Nations as a vital and essential world forum which serves important global purposes.\n168.\tThere are two international issues that have defied solution for more than three decades but which now have reached a crucial turning-point. Peace in the Middle East is closer. An internationally acceptable settlement in Namibia could still be within our grasp. But to make the most cherished hopes of millions come true will require wisdom, patience, fortitude and restraint in the weeks and months ahead.14\n169.\tEighteen months ago I joined my colleagues of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Federal Republic of Germany in a concerted effort to bring about an internationally acceptable settlement in Namibia. Since that day a great deal of progress has been made. Painstaking negotiations and the personal participation of Foreign Ministers at key junctures in the negotiating process have demonstrated what- can be achieved when political will and the determination to succeed are brought together and brought to bear upon seemingly intractable problems. After a year of detailed talks, and in an intensive exploration of all the issues, the five Western members of die Security Council were able to draw up a compromise proposal [Sf12636] which I was privileged to introduce on 25 April to the Assembly's special session. At that same time I was able to announce South Africa's acceptance of the plan.\n170.\tIn July, SWAPO also accepted the Western plan and we were thus able, with the full co-operation of the parties and the active support of the African front-line States, to take, in the Security Council, the first step towards the full implementation of our proposals. It was, therefore, with considerable optimism and satisfaction that we followed the progress of the special survey mission which the Secretary-General dispatched to Namibia, under the leadership of his Special Representative, Mr. Martti Antisaari.\n171.\tWhen, on the basis of the findings of that mission, the Secretary-General published his report and his recommendations as to how best he could discharge the mandate given to him by the Security Council, we had every reason to believe that the United Nations finally had in its hands the instrument capable of putting an end to 30 years of controversy and of bringing Namibia to independence in an internationally acceptable manner. It was therefore with shock and dismay that we heard last week of the South African Government's decision to proceed unilaterally with elections in that Territory.\n172.\tNeither of the reasons invoked by the South African Government is valid. First, I wish to declare most categorically that the Secretary-General's report is fully in line with the original Western proposal. That report is a professional assessment of the human and financial means required to perform the tasks which our proposals call for.\n173.\tSecondly, apart from a few extreme elements, all of those who have a claim to represent sectors of the Namibian population have clearly expressed their preference for and acceptance of United Nations involvement in the independence process. The churches have done so, the Namibia National Front has done so and, as recently as 15 September, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance has done so. We simply cannot accept that there is now a need for some form of further consultation.\n174.\tWe are once more facing a grave situation. Our Organization is now in a position to undertake the task of bringing to independence, through peaceful means, a new nation.\n175.\tWe must urge those who wish to stand in the way of such a noble enterprise to reconsider their decision. The South African Government must realize that its defiance of the will of the international community, particularly when that Government has been so closely involved in a long negotiating process, cannot be tolerated. The new Government of South Africa, which we understand will be formed by the end of this month, would be very seriously mistaken if it assumed that its actions in respect of Namibia would have no serious consequences. To those leaders inside Namibia who are being led to believe that they can solve their problems through some sham electoral procedure, I can only say:\n\\\"Think of the future of your country. The road you are taking can only lead to a dead end. Make no mistake: a so-called government chosen through the so-called elections currently envisaged by the Administrator-General will never be recognized internationally. Instead of enjoying the benefits of free and close association with the rest of the world, you will only beget more bloodshed and bring about in the long run the destruction of what you hold dear.\\\"\nIt is not too late and I sincerely hope that all concerned will reconsider their course of action.\n176.\tThe danger signals are clear. On 4 November 1977, in its resolution 418(1977), the Security Council imposed a mandatory arms embargo on South Africa, the first time the provisions of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter\nhad been invoked against a Member State. This step confirmed a policy voluntarily observed by Canada since 1963. The invocation of Chapter VII of the Charter has rightly been regarded as a grave decision, taken only after the most serious consideration and a careful weighing of the implications. This decision, therefore, reflects our belief that the perpetuation of the apartheid system will result in a continuing deterioration of peace and stability in southern Africa.\n177.\tCanada has also expressed its support for a call to Governments to review their economic relations with South Africa. Although this element was not incorporated in the Security Council resolution, the Canadian Government nevertheless decided to take certain steps. On 19 December 1977, for example, I announced that Canada was phasing out Government involvement in commercial relations with South Africa and would issue a code of conduct to govern the behaviour of Canadian companies with operations in South Africa. The Canadian Government will continue to keep its present genera] relations with South Africa under review.\n178.\tMy Government is much concerned, too, by the situation in Zimbabwe. We had hoped that the Anglo-American proposals and subsequent action by the Security Council would lead to general agreement. The attempt to follow a different path has had no success, and the country now faces increasing bloodshed and uncertainty. A continuation of the war would also haw the -gravest consequences for the stability of the region as a whole.\n179.\tClearly, an early meeting of all parties to the conflict is essential if there is to be any hope of securing peaceful settlement on the basis of the generally accepted Anglo-American plan. Canada continues to hope that the plan may still be successful, and would be willing, in such circumstances, to offer appropriate assistance.\n180.\tAll of us must be heartened by the remarkable progress achieved over the past year towards a just solution of the Middle East conflict. President El-Sadat's historic visit to Jerusalem less than a year ago and the warm reception given to him by Prime Minister Begin and the Israeli people have had a dramatic sequel in the agreements at Camp David. The Government of Canada has sent its congratulations to President Carter, President El-Sadat and Prime Minister Begin on this act of statesmanship. The prospect of a real and durable peace is now much closer, although serious issues remain to be resolved.\n181.\tCanada supported and encouraged the negotiating process begun in Jerusalem. We welcomed the bold initiative of President Carter in again bringing the Heads of Government of Israel and Egypt together at Camp David and we endorse the agreements reached there. They are a milestone on the long road to peace, a road which Canadian soldiers have watched over for more than 20 years. We hope that after due consideration the nations concerned will find that the framework established at Camp David constitutes a sound basis for moving towards a general peace settlement.\n182.\tThe process of direct negotiation on the difficult and sensitive issues at the heart of the problem must continue. All parties face agonizing and hard decisions. But my\nGovernment is confident that the will exists to take the next steps. Meanwhile, the deliberations of this Assembly should serve to bolster confidence between the parties and to facilitate their negotiations. Surely we must try to avoid recriminations and polemics now that serious negotiations are under way. I am well aware that deep differences of view exist, nor do I question the sincerity of such views. My plea is that we make an effort to moderate passions, to encourage constructive action in the area and to strengthen the prestige and competence of the United Nations in the search for solutions.\n183.\tFor all concerned these are days of both accomplishment and opportunity which require patience and fortitude. We do not know what the ultimate shape of a peace settlement might be. It might make provision for international involvement to assist in the implementation of its terms. Canada would consider very seriously a request to make an appropriate contribution to such an enterprise Canada also hopes that other aspects of the problem will be addressed in the context of resolutions adopted by the Security Council. It may very well be that generous financial contributions from the international community will be required; here, too, Canada will certainly be prepared to assist within the limits of its capacity.\n184.\tA third question demanding immediate attention and action is the lack of progress we have made in the United Nations in the protection of human rights throughout the world. A tragic example of this is the situation in Democratic Kampuchea. On 8 September my Government brought to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights a detailed public report which was based on a series of voluntary statements made to Canadian representatives by individual Kampuchean refugees,15 a great many of whom had left Democratic Kampuchea recently. The testimony of the refugees clearly supports allegations from a variety of other sources that the Government of Democratic Kampuchea has systematically violated the fundamental human rights of its citizens and that the repression and the killing are continuing. This situation cries out for the kind of effective action that this Organization should be able to provide.\n185.\tThe Canadian Government considers that an immediate investigation of the human rights situation in Democratic Kampuchea should take place. I urge members of this Assembly to support our recommendation to the Commission on Human Rights to take such action. 1 also ask members of the Assembly to consider their obligations to the increasing numbers of refugees from Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea that are now under the care of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n186.\tTo date, Canada has accepted 7,000 refugees from that area, including those from former Cambodia. In doing so we have accepted the full costs of their resettlement in our country. These costs are in excess of $3.7 million, which Canada regards as an important if indirect contribution to the valuable work of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In the light of the tragic situation in Democratic Kampuchea I wish to take this occasion to announce that Canada will increase from 50 to 70 the number of refugee families from Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea we will accept each month. I expect that over the next 12 months more than 1,000 additional refugees will find a new home in Canada. Furthermore, Canada will contribute an additional $500,000 to the High Commissioner for his valuable relief and assistance work in South-East Asia.\n187.\tThe case of Kampuchea is not unique in demonstrating that in the field of human rights the official record of the United Nations creates an illusion of much greater progress than we have managed to make. There is no dearth of promising language on the international statute book. Unfortunately, the gap between promise and performance has not narrowed much. Reports of gross and persistent inhumanity continue to claim the attention of the world community. Governments continue to renege on commitments they have freely assumed in international instruments.\n188.\tIn short, we are still a long way from an international consensus on human rights. Historians will wonder why it should have been so. They will be hard put to explain how we could be very near a consensus on how to preserve the quality of our seas and yet unable to conduct so much as a civil dialogue on how to preserve the dignity of the human person. They will be hard put to explain how we have begun to redistribute resources internationally to sustain human beings in their material needs but could not ensure that men and women would be free to exercise their most elementary human rights.\n189.\tHuman rights are a problem of international dimensions. Their recognition and promotion, as the Secretary-General reminds us, is a legitimate concern of the world community. The new prominence that human rights has acquired is part of the natural evolution of an international system. Like so many other concerns, the concern about human rights can no longer be contained behind national boundaries. It is not a matter of laying down to Governments how they should fashion their political or economic systems. It is simply a matter of making certain that Governments observe the fundamental decencies of civilized life to which they have all pledged allegiance.\n190.\tThe issue of human rights will not go away. We have a clear choice. We can decide that the United Nations must face the issue squarely, or we will be forced to go elsewhere to seek a tolerable international consensus. In the view of the Canadian Government the choice is clear. We believe that the United Nations is ideally equipped to evaluate objectively, dispassionately and impartially allegations of human rights violations. The better it is seen to function the more confidence this Organization will command and the less individual Governments will feel bound to call for actions against others for gross and persistent violations of human rights.\n191.\tWe believe that the United Nations can improve its investigation of allegations of human rights violations. We welcome, therefore, as a significant precedent the decision of the Government of Chile to receive an investigative group. My Government also considers that the capacity of the Office of the Secretary-General to investigate and to intercede when necessary, as well as its authority to do so,\nshould be augmented. Canada further proposes that the officers of the Commission on Human Rights be empowered to meet between sessions to consider apparent serious violations of human rights and when necessary to make its views known to Governments.\n192.\tHuman rights can be violated in many ways, but surely one of the most despicable is international terrorism. Innocent lives are placed in jeopardy while the culprits often go unpunished or even undetected. Terrorism holds our security and our society to ransom and threatens Governments in all parts of the world. There must be no confusion between ends and means. Terrorism is beyond the bounds of legitimate dissent. It degrades every cause it claims to serve. The international community, which is pledged to eliminate war as an instrument of policy, can hardly accept terrorism as a tolerable aspect of international life.\n193.\tResolution 32/8, adopted by consensus at the last session of the General Assembly, deals with a specific aspect of terrorism\u2014hijacking. That resolution calls on Governments to take joint and separate action to ensure the safety of civil aviation, and it .vas strongly endorsed by the Canadian delegation. We have continued to stress the need for further international action to combat terrorism in all its manifestations. Prime Minister Trudeau's initiative in developing and presenting a declaration on hijacking at the Bonn Economic Summit Conference in July clearly underlined Canada's commitment to take action to deal with this problem. The declaration commits the seven Governments to suspending air links with countries which do not extradite or prosecute hijackers who come within their jurisdictions. Participants at the Bonn meeting urged other Governments to associate themselves with that commitment. Many Governments have indicated that they are prepared to do so. Today we urge all other members of the international community to follow this course as well.\n194.\tAs Canada nears the end of its latest term on the Security Council I inevitably have mixed feelings. We have welcomed the opportunity to play a direct part in contributing towards the resolution of the issues of peace and war brought to the Council. We have participated, I believe effectively, in some very important decisions. But we have also felt some frustrations, which I suppose are shared by most non-permanent members. Periods of service on the Council are too infrequent to build an extensive background of experience or to have much impact on the way the Council meets the responsibilities set out for it in the Charter. We have been impressed by the progress the Council has made since our last term 10 years ago. There has been the adoption of quietly effective negotiating techniques which have encouraged a sense of co-operation and collegial spirit in its work. We think that for the most part the Council has done a good job in dealing with the matters before it.\n195.\tBut we have not changed our view that the Council is too passive. All too frequently it turns a blind eye to situations which clearly constitute a threat to international peace and security. It continues to ignore its responsibility under the Charter to try to head off such threats before they arrive. In my statement before this Assembly a year ago I expressed the belief that informal and private\nexchanges between political leaders represented on the Council would help it to fulfil its responsibilities. In all candour I must report that we found that some of our colleagues were opposed to this approach. However, I continue to be convinced of the value of the concept of periodic meetings of the Council at the ministerial level. Such meetings could give the Council the high-level political direction that is essential if it is to take the initiative in preserving peace when conflict is anticipated, as well as restoring it when conflict has occurred. I know that I am not alone in expressing these views, and I urge those members of the Council, present and future, who share them not to give up their efforts to have the Council fulfil its role as envisioned in the Charter.\n196.\tI also think it is time to consider again the size of the Council. In 1965, when the membership was increased from 11 to 15, there were 118 Members of the United Nations. Now there are 150. Many States which would contribute well to the work of the Council must wait a generation before they can hope to serve.\n197.\tAlthough no longer a member of the Council after the end of this year, Canada will follow with deep interest the Council's deliberations. We will be prepared to contribute in any feasible way to strengthen the Organization's peace-keeping capacity, and to help galvanize its will-power in the spirit of friendly relations, co-operation and harmony called for by the United Nations Charter.\n198.\tLooking back over the past year I take satisfaction from the tenth special session on disarmament. The disarmament session adopted by consensus; a programme of action that clearly identified the most urgent negotiating tasks, including vigorous pursuit of measures to curb the nuclear-arms race, the conclusion of a nuclear test-ban treaty, and the negotiation of an effective agreement on chemical weapons. Proposals made by my Prime Minister, and by other leaders, are under active discussion in many capitals. The session's Final Document is the most authoritative statement of views, aspirations and objectives ever produced on the subject of arms limitation and reduction. It is our compass and our incentive for the work ahead. We must respond with determination to meet the challenge posed by the programme of action.\n199.\tThe special session on disarmament was a useful reminder, too, of the value of reaching oar conclusions by consensus when important issues are at stake. Improvements in our procedures need to be made if we are to find time for these issues and to discuss them seriously. A number of useful proposals to this end have been made which Canada endorses.\n200.\tWhile disarmament may be the ultimate answer to international security, peace-keeping and peace-making are also essential to contain threats to peace. Over the years, Canada has joined many other countries in supporting United Nations peace-keeping missions. We have supplied military or other personnel for every United Nations peace-keeping force which has taken the field, including UNIFIL established last March.\n201.\tThe Council acted promptly and wisely in deciding to insert a United Nations force into the troubled situation\nwhich has prevailed in Southern Lebanon. The organization and subsequent conduct of UNIFIL is a tribute not only to the skilful diplomacy of the Secretary-General and his staff but also to the readiness of Member States from most regions of the world to help with United Nations peacekeeping. We cannot overlook, however, that UNIFIL has encountered problems in fulfilling all the terms of its mandate, and that the Lebanese Government has not yet been able fully to restore its sovereignty.\n202.\tThe future success of UNIFIL will depend on the forbearance and goodwill of all the parties involved, and also, indeed, on the extent to which current and potential contributors to UNIFIL can plan their participation.\n203.\tStates which contribute contingents to peace-keeping forces are bound to be influenced by their perceptions of the kind of co-operation these troops receive from the parties. They will be influenced, too, by the kind of support which these operations receive from the rest of the membership, especially the permanent members of the Security Council. I note with regret that two permanent members have said they will not help pay for UNIFIL.\n204.\tMy country is unusually sensitive to the need for the United Nations to improve its advance planning arrangements for peace-keeping. It was only with considerable dislocation of our own requirements that we were able to supply specialized personnel for UNIFIL, and then only for six months. 1 urge all Member States to consider again the earmarking of personnel, services and equipment for this land of contingency. If the Secretary-General is to carry out the-instructions given to him by the Security Council, which are usually based on the principle of equitable geographical distribution, he must have the widest possible freedom to select the resources required. The lack of readily available communications and logistics personnel is particularly regrettable. It is more than time that the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations made firm recommendations on these questions.\n205.\tEarlier this year I had occasion to assess the situation in Cyprus at first hand. My visit confirmed my view that the parties to the conflict ought to be able to settle their differences by negotiation.\n206.\tCanada once again has a direct interest in a solution of the Cyprus problem. Canadian contingents have been in Cyprus, as part of the United Nations force, for 14 years. Some of our soldiers are now doing their fourth tour of duty on the island. Many Canadians are beginning to feel that the continued presence of the force, instead of paving the way for a solution, may be a factor in impeding it.\n207.\tThe island of Cyprus, an independent and sovereign State and a sovereign member of the international community, has known a troubled history- I believe that it would serve no useful purpose to attempt to identify those responsible for the events of the past. The international community expects, however, that the Cypriot people will use the resources and dynamism which it shares with its Mediterranean neighbours as well as- the goodwill which exists to prepare a new national programme which will contain guarantees acceptable to all the parties concerned. The legacy of the past will not facilitate matters and, in my\nopinion, the- enterprise will even be an impossible one if sustained negotiations are not instituted between the two communities. Without a permanent dialogue, the accommodations which are hinted at from time' to time will remain without any effect. The Secretary-General has offered has good offices to the parties and I would urge them to take full and prompt advantage of them.\n208.\tI have been discussing important issues of peace and security. We also expect this Assembly to address and influence those economic and social questions which are so vital to the welfare of our peoples. Peace and security will remain distant goals unless the basic economic and social needs of mankind receive adequate attention.\n209.\tAs each of our Governments tried to deal with economic and social issues in the context of our national interests, we become increasingly aware of the wide-ranging effects of our actions, improvements in our economic and social conditions can be found only in policies which fully recognize this interdependence among States and among issues. None can be dealt with effectively in isolation. That is why it is so important for us to discuss these issues effectively in this body.\n210.\tThe industrialized countries account for a major share of international economic activity and their policies therefore have a particular impact upon the health of the world economy. We know that the recent performance of our industrial economies have not been good enough. The leaders of seven major industrialized countries met just over two months ago and agree d on measures which they would take, individually and collectively, to improve this performance. My own Government has since announced a aeries of measures designed to strengthen the growth of the Canadian economy. These efforts to improve our national economic performance are not inward-looking. On the contrary, my Government remains convinced that a truly open world trading system provides the best framework for sustained economic growth for all of us. It also remains convinced that the problems of the industrialized world can best be solved by means which benefit all countries, developed and developing alike.\n211.\tThere is no quick or. easy solution to current domestic or international economic difficulties, particularly those of the world's poorest countries, but some of the imperatives are clear. We must improve economic growth to enhance the international economy's ability to meet the aspirations of developing countries for a more just economic order. We must resist pressures for self-defeating protectionism. We must bend every effort to achieve the successful conclusion of the multilateral trade negotiations, including satisfactory benefits for developing countries as well as for the world's principal traders.\n212.\tFrank and open exchanges on vital problems affecting the world economy must take place here. But if the General Assembly is to play its proper role in the process of working out equitable solutions to these problems, we need to clarify the mandate of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 and to make that Committee work. We must give the Committee a mandate\nwhich clearly defines its role as an instrument of the General Assembly. If we ask it to perform tasks which are the proper responsibility of other international bodies, we will do harm to a potentially valuable instrument.\n213.\tAs I said earlier, the dialogue on economic issues continues on many fronts. Some progress is apparent. Prospects for a new food aid convention have improved. Canada will participate actively and constructively in the resumed negotiations on 3 common fund for commodities and we are confident progress can be made there as well. The calendar for 1979 is very challenging: the fifth session of UNCTAD in Manila, the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development in Vienna, the development of a new international development strategy for the 1980s and beyond. Canada has a deep interest in each of these events. This General Assembly session should contribute to their preparation as well as to the preparation of such events as the proposed world conference on renewable sources of energy. I invite delegations to help keep us on the path of consensus in this process. Progress on all of these issues is at times frustratingly slow, but we must persist in our efforts until we succeed.\n214.\tOver the past year the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has made important progress towards the adoption of a comprehensive treaty for the oceans. I am particularly encouraged by the improvements in the informal composite negotiating text on the prevention and control of vessel source pollution. The new text does not yet fully meet my Government's objectives in this field. Nevertheless, it reflects an increasing awareness by the international community of the need for a more balanced sharing of coastal and flag-State rights and duties. The tragic and devastating oil spill off the French coast earlier this year graphically demonstrated the obsolescence of the traditional rule of flag-State sovereignty.\n215.\tMost of the major elements of a global oceans treaty are now virtually agreed. What remain are the most difficult hard-core issues relating primarily to an international system for the mining of the deep sea-bed and the translation of the common heritage concept into an equitable system for extracting the minerals of the deep ocean bed. Our goal is unprecedented in international institutions\u2014the establishment of an international organization with both regulatory responsibilities and a role in the actual exploitation of natural resources. The implications of the new economic order are profound and far-reaching. Thus, no matter how exacting or frustrating the negotiations may still be, we cannot afford to let the Conference fail, particularly now that it has accomplished so much and home port is within sight.\n216.\tCanada agrees, however, that the Conference must be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible. While an arbitrary deadline could impede rather than expedite the work of the Conference, we believe that the negotiations should end during the course of 1979. This would lead, we hope, to the adoption of a draft treaty in the early part of 1980. Canada will give its full support to the attainment of this objective.\n\n111. In conclusion, I think it vital that we remember during the course of this session why we come here every year. Despite its flaws and failures, the United Nations binds us to certain basic principles which are as valid now as they were in 1945. This Organization has stood for a third of a century as witness to the ideal of the common accountability of every nation for enlarging the security, prosperity and dignity of all mankind.\n218.\tThe challenge is to ensure that the United Nations system responds to the complex and changing environment in which we live. Our basic principles must not be encrusted with bureaucratic procedure. The momentum of this institution must be towards the issues of the day, not away from them.\nI am confident we will meet this challenge.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff74.\tIt gives me great pleasure, Mr. President, to express to you on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom o. Morocco and on my own behalf sincere congratulations on the great trust placed in you by our great international family represented in this hall in unanimously electing you to the presidency of this thirty-third session of the General Assembly in appreciation of your unique political acumen. The Assembly conferred on your country, our friend, Colombia, the honour of the presidency, as an acknowledgement of its abilities and as a tribute to the leading role it plays within the Latin American group of States and at the world level as an active member of the vanguard of the third world.\n75.\tThe weight of the responsibility vested in you, Mr. President, is exemplified by the gravity of the situation in the world today, which is fraught with momentous consequences-more than at any time in the past-concerning peace or war in various parts of the civilized world, coexistence or destructive confrontation between blocs, and the achievement of economic justice or the continuation of unjust encroachments at the international level on the rights of the poor peoples of the world.\n76.\tIn spite of the clouds on the international political horizon, the international community puts its hopes in your wisdom and experience, your profound knowledge of international problems and your skilful guidance of our work, so that we may overcome the intricate problems and conclude the work of our current session with results that will dispel the dark clouds on the horizon and open up new prospects of hope, peace, justice and well-being for all mankind.\n77.\tI must not omit to express also on this occasion to your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, Deputy Federal Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Yugoslavia, our recognition and appreciation of his wise guidance of the work of our last regular session and the three special sessions held this year.\n78.\tAllow me also to pay a tribute and to bid a warm welcome to Solomon Islands, which has just joined the United Nations. We hope that that country will contribute, with us, to the creation of a better world of peace, security and prosperity.\n79.\tI should like also to express our thanks to the Secretary-General for his valuable efforts at the head of our Organization. I am thinking in particular of the many initiatives which he has taken in the past year in the service of peace, justice and the promotion of the principles of the Charter.\n80'. Since our last session the world has remained in the throes of political, social and economic interactions with various negative and positive effects. Unfortunately, those interactions have failed to satisfy the aspirations of mankind or even its minimum expectations that the international community would come closer to the security and peace which generations have sought unceasingly since the dawn of history.\n81. Since the beginning of this century, and particularly in recent years, man has reached the zenith of brilliant scientific triumphs, which have extended his reach and his vision beyond his planet to the far corners of the universe, given him insight into many mysteries and carried him further along the path of progress and civilization.\n82.\tHowever, unfortunately, twentieth-century man has been unable to achieve any victory or progress in the field of international relations and has been unable to change the nature of relations between the States and nations or to enhance those relations at the level of international justice. The characteristics which marked relations between primitive nations and peoples based on the logic of might and the exploitation of man by man still prevail. Wars are still regarded as an acceptable means of resolving international conflicts, and aggression and the logic of coercion and oppression are still political instruments which are brought to bear on nations to make them follow a specific political or ideological line. Proclivities to hegemony and political blackmail still remain as disgraceful blemishes on the face of human civilization and diminish the value of what progress it has made.\n83.\tWhat is perhaps worst is the fact that man is employing his scientific achievements to bring all mankind to the brink of the abyss of collective annihilation and to place within the reach of some the means of destroying the world through the invention of the most lethal, the most crushing and the most destructive instruments of war, unchecked by his civilized conscience and undeterred by any ideals of progress for science.\n84.\tIt is indeed regrettable that our hope for the attainment of a genuine era of international harmony and detente is being dashed by misgivings about the return of certain manifestations of the cold war in East-West relations.\n85.\tSimilarly, it is regrettable that the achievement of genuine world disarmament is still not practicable and that we are still as far from it as we were at the beginning of the negotiations on disarmament 16 years ago, despite all the efforts expended to that end and despite the tenth special session convened some months ago at the highest international level.\n86.\tThe African continent, to which Morocco has the honour to belong, is, by reason of the very nature of its recent political history and its subjection until recent decades to the forces of colonial exploitation, a living example of the tumultuous political interactions taking place in our present-day world, for the forces of hegemony, domination and exploitation are still assailing it, and this young continent has not yet been able to enjoy the benefits of its independence and liberation from the bonds of colonialism.\n87.\tWhile the great Powers have reached agreement among themselves-or made a show of such mutual agreement\u2014to follow what is called the policy of detente, the ideological and political struggle of which the African continent is the theatre are no more than a species of cold war between the two major camps, with all the bitter political conflicts, the collapse of the security of interests, the heated flare-ups and the wars by proxy that that war entails.\n88.\tDuring the past year Africa has witnessed what no other continent has witnessed with regard to foreign intervention, because a certain element, in an endeavour to establish a foothold for itself on African territory and seeking to expand its sphere of influence and broaden its authority, has set about inundating some regions of the continent with massive supplies of the latest instrument of ruin, destruction and annihilation and to this end has brought in tens of thousands of foreign troops from overseas and endeavoured to use them and exploit them to destabilize the legitimate regimes which do not act in accordance with its wishes in certain parts of the continent.\n89.\tThis foreign intervention is being perpetrated in the name of certain ideologies or slogans; but the first task in Africa is to liberate Pretoria and Salisbury from the despotic racist cliques, which do not acknowledge the humanity of Africans, refuse to recognize their status as human beings and trample their dignity under foot.\n90.\tThe true liberation of Africa must inevitably come in Pretoria, Salisbury and Namibia before anywhere else in Africa.\n91.\tWhat Africa needs most today, after the succession of the long, oppressive eras of exploitation, colonial pillage and alien subjugation it has suffered, is to be left to tend its wounds, to build its homelands and to develop its independence, not to become a seat of war, cold or hot, and not to have its territory transformed into a set of strategic points fought over by the great Powers.\n92.\tThe time has come for the international community to proclaim that Africa belongs to the Africans and to demand that all parties, of whatever colour or creed, desist from imposing their tutelage on it on >the pretext of any slogan or in any guise. All must recognize that Africa itself, with its rich human resources, is capable of confronting and resolving the problems of Africa within a genuine African framework.\n93.\tMorocco, placing its faith in its character as an African country and loyal to the historical role it has played in the African arena, especially since the dawning of its independence, and seeking the higher interest of the continent and the people of Africa, calls upon the peoples of the United Nations to strive for the achievement of the following goals: first, the exclusion of the African continent from the scope of the escalations of the cold war between the East and West, to spare it the evil effects of the struggle between the great Powers and their world rivalry for the gaining of strategic, political and economic advantages; .secondly, the prohibition of outside intervention, from whatever source and from whatever motives, in African affairs and African disputes, as called for by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU at its fifteenth ordinary session held in Khartoum last July; thirdly, the immediate withdrawal of all non-African forces from the African continent; fourthly, encouragement of the solution of-all African problems by purely African means; fifthly, the promotion and development of means of economic and technical co-operation between African States; and sixthly, assistance to Africa in eliminating and liquidating the racist regimes in Rhodesia, South Africa and Namibia through positive aid consisting of the provision of all types of assistance to the joint African effort to liberate those countries, including support for the front-line States in strengthening their capacity to resist, oppose and confront the acts of military aggression inflicted upon them, and through indirect aid consisting of the strict observance of the application of economic sanctions against the Pretoria and Salisbury regimes and the tightening of the military blockade decided upon by the United Nations.\n94.\tThere is no doubt that the world has now become aware of the despotic, inhumane and racist character of the regimes in Zimbabwe and South Africa through the negotiations which took place between the leaders of those two regimes and the parties concerned with solving the problems of Namibia and Zimbabwe, inasmuch as futile dialogue and blind bigotry gave the rulers of Pretoria and Salisbury another opportunity to convince those Western States that needed convincing of the disdain of those rulers for fundamental human values and of their persistence in violating the rights of Africans.\n95.\tIn Namibia itself, the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) demonstrated after a bitter struggle its political maturity and its appreciation of the historic national responsibility which it bears when it decided to accept, on behalf of the people of Namibia, the democratic process proposed by the five Western States in the Security Council as a basis for the settlement of the Namibian question,  thereby enabling the international community, as represented by the Security Council, to arrive at the desired solution.\n96.\tHowever, the racist regime in South Africa disavowed, as is its wont, the promises which it had made regarding its agreement to that process and exploited this interval to strengthen its military position in the region and to take measures to ensure that it would be able to misrepresent the will of the Namibian people.\n97r The Kingdom of Morocco believes that no progress can be made towards the solution of the Namibian problem except on the basis of respect for the territorial integrity of Namibia, which is incomplete unless Walvis Bay is regarded as an inseparable part of Namibian territory, in accordance with Security Council resolution 431 (1978) on this subject, and except on the basis of agreement with the legitimate representatives of the Namibian people, namely, the leaders of SWAPO, all that to take place under actual United Nations supervision.\n98.\tIn addition, Morocco declares its support for Security Council resolution 432 (1978), which indicated a starting- point for the democratic process which could, given goodwill on the part of the leaders in Pretoria, put an end to the state of tension in the region by according the people of Namibia their inalienable right to freedom, independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within the framework of a united Namibian State.\n99.\tThe Kingdom of Morocco will, as it has in the past, stand by the struggle of the Namibian people until they achieve their final victory. Morocco has always demonstrated its readiness to participate in the efforts expended at the African and the international levels to -create appropriate circumstances to increase opportunities for peace and for ending states of tension, and today it declares once again its full readiness for effective practical participation in such efforts as the United Nations may undertake within the framework of the liberation process in Namibia, prompted in that by the spirit of African solidarity and its awareness of its international responsibility.\n100.\tMorocco assured the Secretary-General of our Organization a few days ago that His Majesty King Hassan II of Morocco is prepared to provide such troops as the United Nations may request to rally to the flag of the international Organization in order to perform their African and international duty to put an end to the racist-colonial presence in Namibia and to enable the sister people of that country to have self-determination and exercise its right to independence and sovereignty.\n101.\tIn Zimbabwe the obduracy and efforts at deception of Ian Smith's regime have gone to the extreme in an attempt to avoid that country's entry into the era of majority rule. We believe that the Zimbabwe crisis cannot be resolved without the active participation of the Patriotic Front, which we hope will keep its ranks united in order to extirpate the seat of racism from its country, eradicate discrimination on grounds of colour, raise the voice of the African majority and affirm its established right to independence and sovereignty under a just and democratic regime.\n102.\tMorocco calls upon the States of the world to come to the assistance of militant Zimbabwe and to support the front-line States in southern Africa and help them to resist the aggression directed against them by Ian Smith's regime, and to stand fast against the campaigns of terrorization and intimidation.\n103.\tThe past year has been marked also by the convening of a meeting unique in the history of the United Nations, the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. That gathering took place in response to the request of the group of non-aligned States, which had expressed their collective international desire for a halt to the terrible arms race and for an endeavour to achieve general and complete disarmament throughout the world.\n104.\tThe mere fact of the convening of that special session and then the determination of die role and responsibility of the United Nations in the field of disarmament constituted definite progress towards the achievement of disarmament, although we were, and still\u2014alas-are, very far from attaining that lofty goal which we must reach if we wish to save mankind from the evils of nuclear suicide and collective annihilation.\n105.\tThe session was at all events able to establish the basis and the machinery which will enable the international community, provided that it makes good use of them, to make a fresh start in the search for a solution to the problems of disarmament.\n106.\tWe welcomed the adoption of that wise resolution which states the necessity of establishing a deliberative body open to all Member States, giving them an opportunity to make their voice heard on the problems of disarmament [see resolution S-10/2, chap. IV, para. 118]. Without question, the establishment of close ties between the deliberative body and the negotiating body will strengthen the position and enhance the effectiveness of the latter.\n107.\tMorocco, which the international community honoured in 1969 by appointing it a member of the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, is pleased to see that the special session agreed on certain reforms in the procedures of the negotiating body which Morocco, together with certain other States, had already proposed at that Conference. We hope that those reforms will lead to the participation of all the nuclear States in the work of the negotiating body, for all are aware of the grave responsibility of the nuclear States, particularly the United States of America and the Soviet Union, in this regard.\n108.\tWe also were pleased that the special session reaffirmed the priority which must be accorded to the subject of nuclear disarmament, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the right of those States which by their accession to the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, have of their own free will renounced the acquisition of nuclear weapons to obtain firm guarantees of security and to avail themselves fully of the peaceful use of nuclear power. Nor did the special session neglect the subject of the problems relating to conventional disarmament and its repercussions on the peace and security of States. The special session emphasized, further, the close link between disarmament and the problems of development.\n109.\tMorocco, as a member of the Committee on Disarmament concerned with negotiation, will spare no effort in the endeavour to implement the recommendations of the special session. It appeals to the States of the world, and in particular those possessing nuclear weapons, to co-operate in this laudable endeavour in order that those recommendations may be translated into genuine action which will prepare the way for the world conference on disarmament and the forthcoming special session devoted to disarmament, with a view to achieving positive results that will turn into reality mankind's aspirations to life in a world in which peace and security prevail.\n110.\tWith regard to Morocco's position on the subject of control over the proliferation of nuclear weapons, I wish to recall that, when the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco decided to undertake the necessary studies for the construction of a nuclear centre designed to meet the country's increasing needs for electric power, and since the considerable phosphate reserves in Morocco make it possible to produce uranium, His Majesty the King proposed to the United Nations that a special committee be established to ascertain that uranium was not enriched and processed for use for military purposes, thereby proclaiming Morocco's voluntary resolve to respect the right of annual or biannual control.\n111.\tWith regard to the question of disarmament and the halting of the arms race in the Maghreb region, Morocco was among the first to be concerned with this goal and to endeavour to place it within a binding contractual framework in order that this region may devoid itself to constructive work in the field of economic development and social well-being.\n112.\tThis position of Morocco is of long standing. It was not conceived on the spur of the moment or dictated by currant circumstances. As early as 28 February 1967 His Majesty King Hassan II sent a letter to the Secretary- General of the United Nations proposing the establishment of a committee, under United Nations supervision, to deal with two important matters:\n\\\"Firstly, to ensure that both Morocco and Algeria renounce any increase in their armed forces, in order to avert the hazards of an arms race in North Africa;\n\\\"Secondly, to undertake, on the spot and by appropriate means, supervision of the quantity and quality of weapons acquired by Morocco and Algeria and to specify the amount necessary for the preservation of security in both countries.\\\"\n113.\tNevertheless, tension in the region of north-west Africa has again become exacerbated recently, since both Morocco and Mauritania regained, more than two years ago, their Saharan provinces. On 14 November 1975, an agreement was signed at Madrid between Morocco and Mauritania on the one hand and Spain on the other, whereby full sovereignty in the region which was known as Western Sahara was restored to Morocco and Mauritania. That agreement put an end to all Spain's responsibility in the area and Morocco achieved its full territorial integrity with regard to its Saharan region with the completion of the implementation of the provisions of this agreement. Thus the colonial presence was removed from that usurped portion of Moroccan territory.\n114.\tIt should be recalled here that this agreement was signed on the basis of urgent \\\"recommendations by the Security Council and endorsed by the General Assembly less than a month after its signing, which demonstrates its close links with the views on law and legality held by our Organization.\n115.\tThereafter, the political situation in the Maghreb region witnessed a new development,, marked by tension arising from aggression plotted against Morocco and Mauritania and armed, financed and directed by a neighbouring State for the purpose of encroaching on Morocco's territorial integrity.\n116.\tMorocco, in rejecting the logic of hegemony and the tendency of expansion at the expense of its territorial integrity, wonders, with others, what right a country has to guarantee what it calls respect for principles -while at the same time interfering in the internal affairs of other States and organizing flagrant aggression in violation of all international principles and conventions, which condemn aggression and violation of the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States.\n117.\tAffirming forcefully that the recovery of its territorial integrity is an irreversible process which cannot be negotiated or made the subject of dialogue, Morocco declares that now as in the past it keeps an open mind on the subject of any fruitful co-operation on the question of the Maghreb.\n118.\tRecently, in an address on 20 August, His Majesty King Hassan II stated:\n\\\"Morocco is a peaceful nation which wants only peace, and it strives, in complete co-ordination and consultation with its sister State Mauritania, to keep the peace with those who act peaceably towards it and to fight against those who fight against it. Let none venture to raise a hand against it. Any solution to the problem of tension in the region must take into account two fundamental points:\n\\\"Firstly, this solution must not encroach on a single inch of Moroccan territory;\n\\\"Secondly, this solution must not create alien boundaries between Morocco and Mauritania.\\\"\n119.\tMorocco has more than once shown its goodwill and positive readiness to alleviate the causes of tension in the area. Within the framework of respect for its sovereignty and territorial integrity, Morocco sincerely co-operated with the African endeavour being made by our regional organization to that end. It will be recalled that the United Nations Charter gives priority to regional organizations, such as the OAU, in the search for solutions and the reduction of tensions in the area under consideration.\n120.\tThe recent Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, held in Khartoum last July decided to establish a \\\"committee of wise men\\\" composed of certain African Heads of State to study the subject of tension in the Maghreb region, inasmuch as the primary responsibility for putting an end to that state of tension lies with Africa.\n121.\tMorocco was the first State to declare officially its acceptance of the first steps initiated to that end by President Gaafar Mohamed Nimeiri, Acting Chairman of the OAU Assembly.\n122.\tThe joint communiqu\u00e9 published on 18 September by Morocco and Mauritania at the conclusion of the visit of the Head of State of Mauritania to Morocco specified the position of our two countries. That communiqu\u00e9 says, inter alia:\n\\\"The two parties welcome their excellent co-operation and the effectiveness of the agreements concluded between the two countries.\n\\\"Aware of the permanence of the relations between the two countries, the two Heads of State affirm their resolve to strive to remove tension and to restore peace and tranquillity to the Maghreb region on the basis of mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both countries.\n\\\"The two Heads of State have expressed their hope that within a short period of time the 'Committee of Wise Men' will be established, as was decided at the recent summit of the Organization of African Unity, and we wish success to their mission.\\\"\n123.\tThis clearly demonstrates the urgent desire of Morocco and Mauritania to see the cause of tension removed from the Maghreb region and to see peace prevail there, with the preservation of their sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n124.\tIn order to achieve that, Morocco now places full confidence in our OAU, which is directing its attention to a careful study of ways and means of finding a solution that will put an end to the causes of tension in the region.\n125.\tThe recent session of the Assembly held at Khartoum made a solemn appeal to all States in the area to refrain from any action likely to hamper the search for a fair and peaceful solution to that problem.\n126.\tIn this connexion, we cannot but condemn the blatant violation of the letter and spirit of that appeal by Algeria which, in the course of one month, launched two attacks on Moroccan territory carried out by units of the Algerian regular army.  The first took place on 27 August 1978 and was directed against a point in the heart of Moroccan territory in the Tata region. Morocco sent a note to the Algerian authorities protesting that act, which constitutes a breach of the principle of the inviolability of its national sovereignty and its territorial integrity. The second took place only four days ago, on 30 September 1978, and was directed against the village of Hassi Tilemsi in Tantan province. His Majesty King Hassan II subsequently sent a letter of protest to the President of Algeria condemning that blatant act of aggression, which is likely to increase the causes of tension in the region and hamper the search for a peaceful solution to this problem.\n127.\tMorocco's membership in the Arab family automatically makes it a deeply involved party in an issue which has been with the United Nations since its early days. By this I mean the question of Palestine. That issue still constitutes a model of international bigotry and injustice, and has involved the uprooting and expulsion of an entire people from their territory, followed by attempts to liquidate their political and physical existence.\n128.\tThe Israeli policy of expansion thereafter increased the dimensions of that problem and multiplied its dangers when in 1967 Israel occupied the rest of the territory of Palestine and the territories of two other Arab States, thus exacerbating the explosive situation in the Middle East.\n129.\tThe Kingdom of Morocco, which condemns the logic of aggression, injustice and coercion, has maintained a clear and unequivocal position on the question of Palestine and the Middle East. This is a fundamental position based on the unanimous Arab resolutions of the historic seventh Conference of Arab Heads of State or Government, held at Rabat in 1974. Morocco regards itself as a guardian and custodian of those resolutions, which affirm that the bases for a solution of the Middle East question rest on essential conditions without which the achievement of peace there is not possible, the first of these being Israel's complete withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied in 1967, including the Holy City of Jerusalem.\n130.\tMorocco believes that the Palestinian problem lies at the very heart of the Middle East crisis, and that no acceptable solution can be reached there until that problem is resolved by according the Palestinian people-represented 384\nby the Palestine Liberation Organization, which is its sole legitimate representative\u2014its established right to self- determination and its inalienable right to establish its Palestinian State on Palestinian soil.\n131.\tIn addition, Morocco stresses that the solution to these problems-as stipulated in the resolutions of the Rabat Conference-must be a general and comprehensive solution in order to guarantee that it will lead to the establishment of a general and comprehensive peace in all parts of the region and will remove all hotbeds of tension from the Middle East.\n132.\tAs for the sister State of Lebanon, which was the flower of the Arab countries and a centre for fraternization and coexistence between sects and creeds, and which has been linked with Morocco by human and cultural ties since the dawn of history, it is now-following the blatant Israeli aggression to which it has been exposed and the occupation of parts of its territory-become, more than at any time in the past, a target for intervention in its internal affairs and the violation of its sovereignty. Morocco calls upon the peoples of the world, which have expressed more than once their solidarity with the Lebanese people, to continue their endeavours to preserve the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon so that it might treat its injuries, dress its wounds and regain the human and cultural role which has distinguished its history.\n133.\tMorocco's strategic geographical position at the cross-roads of continents, civilizations and the waters of the ocean and the sea has made it a distinctive centre in the international arena. Because of this, throughout its long history Morocco, as a Mediterranean State, has been instrumental in affecting political circumstances around the Mediterranean, the cradle of most of the world's civilizations, and has, in its turn, been influenced by the events taking place in the Mediterranean.\n134.\tThis situation remains in the give-and-take stage, in a state of influencing and of being influenced, as it has been in die past. Thus Morocco has become a party directly or indirectly involved and has been forced to remain on the alert for any occurrences.\n135.\tIn addition to the chronic crisis that has prevailed on our eastern coast for more than 30 years, namely the Middle East crisis which I have mentioned earlier, the Cypriot problem is still a major source of tension in the Mediterranean. The Kingdom of Morocco hopes in this connexion that the Turkish and Greek communities in Cyprus will be able to devise a just and lasting solution to this problem through negotiations which will take into account the higher interests and legitimate rights of those two communities within an independent non-aligned State.\n136.\tWe wish to express once again the hope that the agreements reached at-the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will succeed in removing from the Mediterranean the rivalry between the two super-Powers, so that that sea will become an area of peace and co-operation among coastal States.\n137.\tIn the economic field, the setting of the sun on the age of colonialism denotes the world's entry into anew era of international relations. It is thus incumbent on the international community to establish a new international economic order based on new principles and inspired by new concepts.\n138.\tThe actual economic relations between the countries of the South and those of the North has never been viewed as a whole. On the contrary, bilateral relations come about as a result of the pressure of economic situations which have grown up throughout the world. That means that relations as a whole are determined by the historical weight of colonialism. Throughout the world there are relationships based on or revolving around the capitals of former colonial States, or around certain new centres noted for their economic strength.\n139.\tI do not think that there is any need to demonstrate the futility of this unjust system. It is an obstacle to the development of the poorest countries. All the difficulties of the developing countries, such as chronic deficits in the balance of payments, inflation and debt problems and technological backwardness are but the direct result of a system rendered obsolete by time.\n140.\tThe replacement of this system and the transition from it to another stage requires of us not only a new way of looking at those relations, but also, first and foremost, a new and honest awareness on the part of the industrialized countries.\n141.\tThe sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly made it quite clear what tasks must be undertaken and what goals must be achieved for the establishment of a new international . economic order. Unfortunately, achievements to date in this area give us no grounds for gratification. The terms of trade have continued to deteriorate. Developing countries have not escaped the detrimental consequences of the inflation which has beset the industrialized countries and, with one or two exceptions, those industrialized countries have not responded to the decision of the General Assembly that they should devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to development assistance. This proves that the industrialized countries have not yet realized the true meaning of the concept of international interdependence.\n142.\tIt is henceforth no longer possible for us to continue in a situation where relations between industrialized countries and developing countries are governed by the law of the exploitation of the weak by the strong, a law based on egotistical and short-sighted considerations.\n143.\tWhen the General Assembly, at the thirty-second session, decided to set up the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, or the Committee of the Whole; and assigned to it's specific task in anticipation of the convening of the 1980 special session, we hoped that a frank and fruitful dialogue between the States of North and South would immediately be initiated. But the dilatoriness and the reluctance of the industrialized countries has disappointed our hopes and brought us back to the bitter reality. This reality is that the political will which must exist on the part of the industrialized countries and which is an essential prerequisite for the establishment of a new international economic order has not yet emerged. That is why all the appeals which we have made for the initiation of a dialogue designed to serve the interests of all have fallen on deaf ears.\n144.\tWe are beset by apprehensions lest the appointed time for the 1980 special session should come without our having made any progress towards the establishment of the new international economic order. This makes it imperative for us to realize here and now the grave dangers which bode ill for mankind if we fail to implement the measures called for at the sixth and seventh special sessions. Economic issues must be accorded pre-eminence if we wish to advance towards the attainment of an era of justice, equity and peace for mankind.\n145.\tIn view of the special geographical location of our country, lying as it does on the coasts of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean, it is natural for us to accord special attention to the development and to the future of the law of the sea.\n146.\tThe codification of the new law of the sea is one of the most important tasks and responsibilities with which the United Nations has been entrusted. Negotiations on the new law for the seas and oceans began eight years ago when at its twenty-fifth session the General Assembly stressed the necessity of establishing that body of law and laid down the fundamental principles on which it should be based [resolution 2749 (XXV)]. Within the framework of those fundamental principles, which have long since attained the force of universal customary norms, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has held seven successive sessions. Needless to say, the hopes and expectations which the international community has placed in this diplomatic endeavour do not admit of any hesitancy or procrastination, nor do they admit of any precipitate individual action that might frustrate the efforts expended to arrive at the comprehensive agreement sought.\n147.\tThere is no longer any cause for precipitate action, for diplomatic negotiations gained fresh momentum at the last session of the Conference, held in Geneva in the spring of 1978, and, moreover, world requirements of the sea-bed minerals intended for exploitation can currently be met by the output of minerals available on land, especially since the recent discovery of a considerable reserve of them in North America.\n148.\tAt all events, at this critical juncture, we can only reiterate our conviction that the application of the concept of the common heritage of mankind to the international zones of the sea-bed may be regarded as one of the most outstanding and noble steps taken by the General Assembly since the founding of the United Nations in its fulfilment of the purposes of the Charter.\n149.\tIt would be unwise for any State to underestimate the role of full adherence to this lofty principle in safeguarding the stability of the new .law of the sea. Naturally, this stability can be established only on sound bases of complementarity, co-operation and justice, in the interest of the international community as a whole.\n150.\tHuman happiness, respect for man's humanity and the safeguarding of human rights has been the clear goal of all civilizations and legislative systems since time immemorial. This goal is still the focus of the aspirations of mankind, however much systems and beliefs may vary. It is axiomatic, in order to achieve this goal, that man's essential basic needs must be met, that he must be freed from the shackles of poverty, want, ignorance and disease and that he must be liberated from the bondage of fear, oppression and coercion.\n151.\tIt is perhaps a good augury that in a few weeks we shall be celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights-these rights for the respect and reverence of which Morocco is distinguished in the world community and without which human dignity, happiness and freedom of expression and association cannot be fully attained.\n152.\tThe first prerequisite for human happiness is the guaranteeing of all man's economic and financial needs within a broad framework of political freedom, whereby he lives far from want and fear and vistas open up before him for creativity and originality and for the advancement of human civilization.\n153.\tThis requires us to set to work seriously\u2014and immediately\u2014to effect the national and international economic and political changes in our world that will ensure the achievement of this goal. So let us make the initial work easier. Let us all choose\u2014of our own free will\u2014the path of co-operation and fruitful dialogue. Let us cast aside ephemeral egotistical interests and regard our participation in this valuable human endeavour with comprehensive and far-sighted vision, so that mankind can live on this small planet in peace, security, justice, happiness and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff184.\tMay I first of all, on behalf of the Haitian delegation, most warmly congratulate Mr. Lievano of Colombia on his election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. His presence here to guide these important deliberations is both a guarantee of their success and an eloquent testimony to the esteem which he enjoys at world level. His colleagues in Latin America are proud of the tribute thus paid to the entire region. The Government and people of Haiti, who were privileged to welcome Mr. Lievano to Port-au-Prince on the occasion of the signing of an agreement delimiting the maritime borders between our two countries, are fully confident of the auspicious guidance which he will give- to our debate.\n185.. I should like also to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Lievano's eminent predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia, for the remarkable way in which he guided the work of the thirty-second session.\n186.\tTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, we should like to extend our compliments and our feelings of gratitude and deep appreciation for his enlightening report on the work of the Organization [AI33/1], in which he stressed the problems which had been of concern to the Organization during the past year. Those problems are both numerous and highly complex. Some of them are extremely serious and call for prompt solution if world peace, already harshly put to the test, is not to be irreversibly jeopardized; hence the need to redouble efforts in order to eliminate the hotbeds of tension which endanger the very survival of mankind. In order to achieve that aim, all the members of the community of nations, aware of their common destiny, should resolutely commit themselves to seeking, in the light of the goals and objectives of the Charter, the means to achieve the establishment of a world governed not by relations of power but rather by the ideals of justice, brotherhood and universal solidarity. That task would be relatively easy to achieve provided there is willingness to use the United Nations machinery and agree to live on the basis of its laws.\n187.\tUnfortunately, the international situation at the present time reveals a reality which does not give rise to optimism. In fact, some regions of the world are still subjected to colonial domination and other forms of oppression while others experience only a precarious peace, often interrupted by outbreaks of violence. While considerable sums are devoted to the arms race, which threatens the very existence of our planet, millions of human beings, forming that great army of those \\\"forgotten by God\\\", languishing in the most abject poverty. Meanwhile, the gap between rich and poor countries becomes wider, despite various international attempts to improve the situation.\n188.\tIt is therefore not surprising that bitterness is widespread and bears the seeds of conflict. The incompatibility of the different interests at stake is in evidence whenever antagonists meet. On many occasions the intervention, in extremis, of international organizations, including the United Nations, has been necessary to avert what was often an almost fatal development, while certain sectors, which have already forgotten the lessons of history, compel mankind to survive by its wits, despite the fact that the danger of a world conflagration of catastrophic dimensions remains undiminished. It is in that hardly reassuring context that my delegation wishes to make its contribution to the work of this session.\n189.\tFirst of all, the Republic of Haiti wishes to reiterate its attachment to the ideals which prevailed at the establishment of the United Nations, of which we are one of the founding Members. Haiti reaffirms its total commitment to the principles of equality of all individuals and peoples and their right to self-determination.\n190.\tIn that spirit our delegation warmly welcomes Solomon Islands to our Organization. We are convinced that this new State will make its contribution to the search for solutions which are of concern to it.\n191.\tHowever, while the accession of Solomon Islands to the ranks of independent and sovereign nations has filled us with joy, we strongly deplore the fact that the backward forces of colonialism have not yet made it possible for the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe, Azania, Belize, the Western Sahara and East Timor to take their place among us.\n192.\tIn the case of Namibia, which South Africa has occupied illegally since 1966 in defiance of world public opinion and of the many United Nations resolutions, this Organization has reached an impasse, faced with the refusal of the Pretoria regime to co-operate in implementing the most recent decisions of the Security Council concerning the process which is to lead to independence.\n193.\tBy deciding to implement its own independence plan, South Africa has revealed its sinister design to deny the Namibian people the fruit of many years of sacrifice and heroic struggle. In this connexion we should like to recall the reservations expressed by our delegation during the ninth special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on the- question of Namibia, that the proposal of the five Western countries might not lead to genuine independence, since it allowed for the participation in the electoral process of the South African Administration and army instead of requiring their unconditional withdrawal.\n194.\tToday, the facts tend to vindicate us. It is difficult for us to understand how the Security Council has seen fit to recognize any role for South Africa in Namibia when an earlier decision had relieved it of its responsibilities towards that Territory.\n195.\tIs it not up to SWAPO, recognized by the United Nations itself as \\\"the sole and authentic representative of\nthe Namibian people,\\\" to organize the elections? We would reply to that question in the affirmative, because we feel that if SWAPO has been able to lead the Namibian people in its struggle, it should also be in a position to do so at the time of reconstruction. It is now up to the five Western Powers to take the initiative required to compel South Africa to respect their proposal. We are convinced that, taking into account the close ties between them and the South African regime, they are in a better position than any other party to induce it to submit to the wishes of the international community.\n196.\tWould not a solution have been found to the Namibian problem if the five Powers had followed the course indicated by the majority of Member States when they called for the adoption of the sanctions that the circumstances require? Now that they seem to be short of expedients, it is to be hoped they will be able to shoulder their responsibility.\n197.\tWith respect to Walvis Bay, my Government has often indicated that the independence of Namibia would be but illusory if it were to remain a South African colonial enclave. We thus reaffirm that Walvis Bay is an integral part of Namibia and most forcefully condemn any attempt to annex that territory.\n198.\tThe same applies to Zimbabwe, where the white minority, unable to realize that it has been outdated by a revolutionary context, attempts at all costs to preserve the colonial status quo. In a desperate effort it resorts to all types of strategies to maintain and preserve its social, political and economic privileges. The most recent case is the so-called internal settlement, the most harmful consequence of which has been to break the unity so needed by the people of Zimbabwe to undertake the task of building their common homeland.\n199.\tAware of its own colonial experience, the Republic of Haiti categorically rejects and condemns this so-called internal settlement between Ian Smith and a few disloyal sons of Zimbabwe. Haiti strongly opposes this shameful political compromise aimed at destroying the deepest aspirations of an entire people. In order that a genuine majority Government may be established in that Territory, we recognize and support the Patriotic Front, the legitimate representative of the people of Zimbabwe and the only party qualified to take power on its behalf. We call for the strengthening of economic sanctions, the violations of which we strongly condemn, violations which have been committed by those who support racism, colonialism and apartheid.\n200.\tThere is no doubt that one of the most urgent tasks of our Organization is the elimination of the odious system of apartheid, which is an affront to all mankind.\n201.\tAggressive by its very nature, that system endangers peace and security in the entire southern part of the African continent. It is a continuing threat to all neighbouring African countries, whose territorial integrity is violated at will. That system, because of its imperialist and expansionist designs, has always been and remains the main obstacle to a peaceful solution of the problems both of Namibia and of Zimbabwe.\n202. Because of this situation, the international community must endeavour to achieve the total and immediate elimination of racism, colonialism and apartheid from the African continent, sparing no effort to isolate South Africa and to give its strongest support to the liberation movements.\n203. We hope that humanitarian concerns will triumph over petty national interests and make it possible for the Western States which have been strong defenders of the apartheid regime to make common cause with tire international community in combating the brutal oppression and genocide perpetrated against the black population.\n204. Equally critical is the situation of the peoples of Belize, Western Sahara and East Timor. In those three cases the colonial Power has decided to withdraw, thus opening the way for independence.\n205. However, contrary to general expectations, difficulties arising from colonization itself have led to certain claims which have obstructed the exercise by the peoples of those Territories of their right to self-determination. We unquestionably deplore such a situation, but at the same time express our hope that in their wisdom the countries concerned, with which we maintain friendly relations, will realize that it would be immoral to redress one injustice by creating another. We are all familiar with the ills of colonialism and with how much harm it has caused to the majority of the peoples represented here. Yet, must we not recognise that we cannot in every case revive doubts about all the injustices and all the abuses to which this party and that have fallen Victim during colonial domination? If we were not to realize that, we might run the risk of ourselves becoming like the colonial Power. It is always possible to speak of territorial claims. Yet it should never be lost from sight that in those claimed territories there are people which, like all other people, also have a right to self-determination. Since that right is one and indivisible, it is the responsibility of the United Nations to safeguard its implementation in keeping with the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.\n206. A focal point of our concern is the Middle East conflict, which for 30 years has defied all solution. My delegation feels that the solution should be based on Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973) and on the following principles: the non-acquisition of territories by force; the withdrawal by Israel from Arab territories occupied since 1967; respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of all States in the region, including Israel.\n207. It goes without saying that any solution of this conflict, in order to be just and viable, must take into account the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to a homeland and their right to live as a sovereign and independent people in the well-being and tranquillity of the refound homeland.\n\n208. But, as simple and valid these principles may seem, they have not been implemented because passions continue to be heightened and because dialogue has not replaced confrontation. \n\n209.\tHowever, last month the world was given new hope upon hearing that the difficult negotiations at Camp David had led to an improvement in Israeli-Egyptian relations with a promise of the forthcoming signature of a peace treaty between the two antagonists. We should like at this time to congratulate all those who contributed in any capacity towards making possible these results, which certainly will prove to be a decisive turning-point in the search for peace in that part of the world. We hope that, like Egypt and Israel, the other countries concerned will soon make their contributions to a definitive settlement of the conflict.\n210.\tBut should not this settlement include also the situation in Lebanon, which despite the praiseworthy efforts of the Secretary-General of our Organization, has not been resolved? Lebanon remains ravaged by war, and every day persons are killed in that war. Lebanon, a peaceful country pa- excellence, has been caught in a whirlwind of violence. We must at least acknowledge that Lebanon has been the victim of a state of affairs which it did not create and which neither United Nations resolutions nor the Arab peace force have managed to eliminate, My delegation expresses its solidarity with the people of Lebanon and hopes that in the near future they will find peace again and that their brothers will be reunited. That will not be possible until all foreign forces have withdrawn from the country and until the forces of the United Nations alone are responsible for the maintenance of peace until the situation is normalized.\n211.\tIn the case of Cyprus, we deeply regret that no notable progress has been achieved so far. The Republic of Haiti, always faithful to respect for the principles of independence, sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States, and non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, deplores the continued presence of foreign troops on the territory of the Republic of Cyprus. An end must be put to all foreign interference in the internal affairs of that country so that the two communities may without restrictions begin dialogue that will 5ead to reconciliation and the reconstruction of their homeland.\n212.\tOne of the most important items on this session's agenda is that of disarmament. It is of paramount importance for ah nations, large or small, and for the very survival of our world. That is why almost the entire international community, aware of the danger to mankind of the arms race, has stated that it is in favour of general and complete disarmament, which alone can guarantee the security of all.\n213.\tWhen I spoke from this very rostrum during the tenth special session, on disarmament had the opportunity to demonstrate how the quantitative increase or perfecting of armaments by a State, far from contributing to that State's security, produces the opposite effect. The reason for that is that the State against which one arms to guarantee security reacts accordingly, and this sets off a chain reaction. We thus become prisoners of a dead-end competition to the detriment of meeting the vital needs of mankind, because the arms race absorbs sizeable human as well as material resources that are diverted from the process\nof producing goods and services. What is even more disturbing is that an ever larger number of developing countries have succumbed to this contagion and are participating substantially in it, relegating to second place their plans for economic and social development, plans which could reduce, if not eliminate, the illiteracy, poverty, diseases of all kinds and ignorance from which their populations are suffering,\n214.\tThere is no doubt that the progress of science and technology in the field of the production of new weapons, weapons that are more deadly and more destructive, increases the danger of armed confrontation, which in the nuclear age would prove disastrous,\n215.\tThus it is urgent for us to take all necessary measures at the international level to create conditions conducive to the achievement of the objective to which we a53 aspire, general and complete disarmament. These measures underlie the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)/, which my delegation fully supports.-We remain firmly convinced that without the strengthening of international security the achievement of general and complete disarmament would be illusory\n216.\tWe are celebrating this year the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the historic Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is an opportunity for all to renew our respect for and defence of the basic rights laid down in that Declaration and to co-operate at the regional and international levels to guarantee their promotion.\n217.\tMy delegation has noted with satisfaction from the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization that during the past year there was a marked improvement in the efforts at co-operation between Member States to settle certain problems arising from allegations of violation of human rights. It hopes to see that co-operation increase to the benefit of peace and of the progress of peoples.\n218.\tHaiti, which was born of struggles for human rights, wishes to participate in this co-operation. We wish to make our contribution at the international, regional and national levels, and in fact we do so.\n219.\tAt the international level we endorse the initiative of the non-aligned and other countries \\\"to elaborate and adopt an integral and comprehensive approach to human rights as a matter of great significance for ensuring the dignity of the individual and for peace, security and international co-operation on the basis of equality\\\" [see A133/206, annex I, para. 155].\n220.\tWe also wish to work closely with the bodies of the United Nations whose responsibility it is to promote and to safeguard these rights. It is in that context that we intend to adhere to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Optional Protocol.\n221.\tAt the regional level, we have ratified the American Convention on Human Rights, and last month we received a visit from the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights, which was to report on progress achieved in this field. The Republic of Haiti also supports the establishment\nof an inter-American court of human rights, and in the very near future we shall appoint our candidates for elections to be held for the establishment of that court.\n222.\tAt the national level, a vast and carefully prepared programme of promotion of human rights has been established. This programme includes measures of legal reform aimed at a better distribution of justice within the framework of the normalization of all aspects of our national life.\n223.\tThis is an irreversible process to which His Excellency Mr. Jean-Claude Duvalier has committed his prestige through his statement to the nation of 2 January 1978, in which he said:\n\\\"I shall unceasingly proclaim my unshakeable attachment to the principles of democratization and liberalization, which must be allowed to reach the most distant areas of our country in order to engender a true renaissance.\\\"\n224.\tHowever, my Government, to which the development of the human person is the end-all objective of its political activity, considers that this rebirth will be possible only if economic and social rights receive equal attention. That is why the Haitian Government has sought to work out a genuine economic development programme and economic growth expressed not only in terms of per capita income but also in terms of an improvement in the standard and quality of life of the people. The development we seek involves over-all growth of the human being, intended to affect every Haitian as part of his national heritage. This is a noble task requiring the mobilization of all the material and human resources in our country Unfortunately, its success does not depend on our national contribution alone, and our efforts may well fail unless deep -rooted changes in the international economic order are effected.\n225.\tThese changes should take the form of a clear improvement in the terms of trade, with trade being made less vulnerable to market conditions. In the first place, we are unduly dependent upon the flow of exports, because any reduction in the rate of demand, either in volume or in value, threatens the entire economic balance of the country. When prices tend to decline or to go up for the commodities we export or to decline to a lesser extent for the commodities we import, the percentage of our imports necessarily drops even if we are able to increase our rate of exports. This is because inflation and the deterioration of export income and a constant deficit in our balance of payments lead to a devaluation of our currency and a limitation of the intake of the products we urgently need.\n226.\tThis situation of price instability affects not only our foreign-exchange income but also our customs receipts. Haiti, as a country that produces raw materials, directly feels the harmful effects of economic crises in the economically advanced countries and because of this is unable to finance its development programme at a constant pace and at. the same time to meet all its international obligations.\n227.\tThat is why we are prepared to support any formula likely to resolve the problem of the external indebtedness of countries such as ours. The foreign exchange now\nallocated for the payment of these debts would considerably help towards increasing our rate of imports, towards a better functioning of our public administration and towards the implementation of our development programme,\n228.\tTo all these problems we must add the fact that a considerable part of our meagre foreign exchange must be devoted to meeting our energy needs, a situation which also handicaps our development capacity. Because of this, despite the conscientious efforts of my Government and the will of our people to use our basic resources to improve our situation, we are constantly faced with difficulties engendered by the international order.\n229.\tWe must now see to what extent the industrialized countries will co-operate with the United Nations to tackle these basic problems, the solution of which is in their hands. It is clear that international action should be directed towards the areas which tend to engulf the economies of the developing countries. Otherwise the attempts of these countries to develop their economies to satisfactory levels will continue to churn in the vicious circle of the present order.\n230.\tThus, my delegation considers it indispensable that a more just international economic order be established, an order more in keeping with the relations of interdependence which exist between the developed and the developing countries. The industrialized countries should endeavour to make this a reality, despite the difficult international economic situation. An important step in this process would be the concluding of an, agreement on commodities and on the indebtedness of the developing countries. Moreover, a programme for the transfer of technology would establish a rational basis for true cooperation.\n231. Another area where the industrialized countries should demonstrate a spirit of understanding and cooperation is that of the law of the sea. My Government feels that the time has come for a serious and constructive dialogue which will make it possible for all parties concerned to make the necessary compromises, without which it is impossible for the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to achieve its objectives.\n232.\tWe have just outlined the most urgent problems we shall have to face during this session. These problems are not new. Most of them even inspired the establishment of our Organization.\n233.\tThe fact that we have not yet achieved the desired success and that mankind continues to be frustrated in its valid aspirations for lack of solutions is simply because our approach to these problems has not been the best. My delegation feels that we have not applied all our imagination and all our skill to building a world in keeping with the dreams of the authors of our Charter.\n234.\tWe are convinced that mankind cannot afford a third world war, nor can it afford the confrontations of the 1960s or the uncertainties of the 1970s. The challenge facing us is the eternal question: how can we manage to live in peace? How can we manage to transform this world into\na place of coexistence and genuine co-operation? Is it not time for a new period of reconciliation, a new era, not of psychological or verbal warfare, but one in which mankind as a whole will resolutely tackle the scourges which threaten its very existence? It is self-evident that the United Nations should be the centre for efforts to achieve the realization of that dream and that all nations, large or small, should bring their wisdom, their energy and their devotion to bear in order to bring this about.\t\n235.\tOur destiny is in our own hands. Let us do all in our power to forge it in the best interests of us all, under the dual sign of peace and universal progress. Let us make this thirty-third session the starting-point for this collective task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff1.\tMr. President, I cannot begin my statement without first extending to you the warm congratulations of the Mauritanian delegation on your election at, President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. Familiar as I am with your experience and your human and intellectual qualities, I am convinced that our proceedings will be conducted in the objective and business-like manner necessary for work such as that of the United Nations.\n2.\tI wish also to express to your predecessor, Mr. Mojsov of Yugoslavia, our esteem and our appreciation of the remarkable manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the past session. On this occasion I wish also to pay a tribute to the exceptional qualities of our Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose constant efforts and vision provide invaluable leadership for our Organization.\n3.\tThe United Nations was intended, as our Secretary- General so aptly put it [see A/3311, sect. 11], among other things to be the guarantor of justice and peace most especially for small countries which otherwise would have no recourse in a world dominated exclusively by power politics. In addition, our Organization, for all its shortcomings, has become, in this modern era, when the interdependence of nations must be understood by everyone without any distinction as to race or ideology, a necessity without which the proper conduct of international affairs would be inconceivable.\nFor all these reasons Mauritania, which is a peace-loving country, whose goal has always been to serve the cause of rapprochement and understanding, is deeply devoted to all the principles of the Charter, which we have all signed, and to the objectives that we have all set for ourselves in this Organization. Thus it is that my country has come before this Assembly, through me, to promise loyalty to our Organization in the most solemn manner possible.\nBecause we belong to Africa, a continent where economic injustice and political domination are still very burning problems, our country is in a very good position to assess the importance of those principles, especially the principles which make of peace, freedom and economic development the priority issues of our day.\n6.\tTo this collective effort to attain these priority goals, my Government is determined to make its contribution, a modest one perhaps, but sincere and disinterested none the less.\n7.\tThe success of this common undertaking here in the United Nations clearly depends on the establishment of peace wherever it is in danger. After all, how can one conceive of the full exercise of political freedoms and economic rights without peace, on which any effort to bring about economic development and social, political or cultural advancement depends?\n8.\tIt is only natural, then, that the Mauritanian people, the Military Committee for National Recovery and the Mauritanian Government, each assuming its part of the joint responsibility for seeking peace, should have set \u00a38 their goal the achievement of concord and understanding among peoples, especially the peoples of the western Maghreb subregion, to which we are proud to belong.\n9.\tThat is why Mauritania decided, immediately after 10 July 1978, to embark on dynamic action for peace and involve therein the Organization of African Unity [OAUJ, the League of Arab States and the United Nations.\n10.\tWe want a comprehensive peace, because only the voluntary and sincere commitment of ail the parties to the dispute can bring about a final settlement of this distressing fratricidal conflict\n11.\tIn that part of the world a state of tension has prevailed for nearly three years now, dividing countries and peoples which are brothers and which, because of their history, geography and common destiny, must live together forever in a state of interdependence. These same countries and these same peoples have fought, side by side and hand in hand, during the colonial era but now they are, regrettably, fighting each another, thereby endangering the stability cf the subregion, jeopardizing their own economic development and damaging the cohesiveness of the OAU and the Arab League. Such an abnormal situation, to say the very least, cannot continue without seriously jeopardizing any possibility of finding viable solutions for the problems of the subregion.\n12.\tIf we all really and sincerely want peace and stability in our subregion, then this is no time for recriminations or \nmutual accusations. We in Mauritania want to turn this dark page of our history and commit ourselves resolutely to the search: for peace, which, requires that the protagonists in: this drama clearly understand that they share the same ineluctable destiny.\n\n11. This position of our people, the Military Committee for National Recovery and the Mauritanian Government is based on our firm belief that our country, which enjoys freedom and: sovereignty, should play only a balancing role in the interests of the stability of our subregion.\n14.\tThe: incalculable effort that has been made, the waste of human and material resources our ingenuity, our courage, our fighting spirit must henceforth be directed to producing concord among our peoples, to promoting their development in all areas and to achieving all their aspirations. That is the firm belief of the Mauritanian people and its Government Our people, the Military Committee for National Recovery and our Government believe that in this way we are moving with history and the force of logic. We refuse to consider any possibility for the people of the western Maghreb but their living together as they have for centuries in cultural and social symbiosis and in their profound similarity within an enriching differentiation.\n15.\tIn a word, my country, through me, wishes solemnly to reiterate its desire for peace and invites its partners to join it in devoting, our efforts to the attainment of this goal.\n16.\tThe OAU and the United Nations can, of course, make a positive contribution to this end. The OAU has already appointed a \\\"committee of wise men\\\", an ad hoc Committee. of Heads of State of countries members of the OAU, which, we ace convinced, will fulfil the hopes that it has aroused. The United Nations can also play a useful role by avoiding, anything; which might harden positions, and make the task of the \\\"committee of wise men\\\" any more difficult than it is. Mauritania is determined to co-operate loyally with all parties and will not reject out of hand any responsible proposal which might lead to a settlement of the unfortunate conflict; that is to say, a comprehensive settlement, acceptable to all the parties concerned.\n17.  I have dwelt on the question of the Sahara and the tension, in our subregion precisely because these are problems which directly concern my country. My delegation is net less aware of the gravity of the many important economic and political questions which we shall be tackling in the course of this session: for example, the one of the Middle East, southern Africa and the new international economic order: Mauritania's position has not changed on any of those three questions. It remains what it has always been, a firm position based on real solidarity and a common destiny.\n18. First of all, we are at one with the Palestinian people represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization, a people driven from their homes, deprived of their property, and made refugees living on international charity. We are also at one with the Arab countries neighbouring Palestine which, with the passage of time, have seen their lands contract and their sovereignty diminished as a consequence of Israel's constant aggression and military occupation. In this connection, my Government remains convinced that a just and lasting peace in the area is inconceivable without the complete evacuation of the occupied Arab territories and without the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination. We express solidarity also with the peoples of Azania, Namibia and Zimbabwe which, notwithstanding their sacrifices and the unanimous support of the international community, have not yet freed themselves from the racist colonialism of South Africa and the rebel regime of Ian Smith.\n19.\tThat situation, which is anachronistic to say the least, must come to an end, and in this respect the United Nations\u2014in particular the major Powers\u2014has a responsibility to shoulder and a role to play. My country has followed with interest the efforts of the Western countries members of the Security Council in connexion with Namibia. But the South African regime, by challenging the national unity and territorial integrity of Namibia by its claims to Walvis Bay, has demonstrated its bad faith and its determination to oppose a united and really independent Namibia.\n20.\tFinally, Mauritania shares common interests with all the. developing countries members of the Group of 11. Our common interests are based on a common desire for greater justice and equity in international economic relations. With the creation of the Committee Established Under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, known as the Committee of the Whole, at the last regular session of the Assembly, it seemed that some tangible progress would be possible in the efforts that began with the adoption of the Declaration and Programme of Action on the New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)]. However, we must say that we are disappointed that that Committee is today still, busy with organizing its work and defining its task. Once the General Assembly has redefined its mandate, we hope that the Committee will find itself in a position to start negotiations on the major issues on its agenda.\n21.\tSimilarly, the results of negotiations elsewhere in the United Nations hardly encourage much optimism. The common fund fox commodities has yet to see the light of day and the ministerial session of the Trade and Development Board devoted to the question of indebtedness  has not yet fulfilled the expectations of the developing countries. In contrast to that generally gloomy picture, the fourth session of the World Food Council  represents a positive achievement.\t\n22.\tWe might add to the common problems of the developing, countries the problem of the countries of the Sahelian region, the solution of which requires a major effort by the international community. I am, of course, referring, to the widespread drought that has lasted for the past 10 years in our countries. The General Assembly at its last regular session and, the Economic and Social Council at its summer session showed an understanding of the gravity of this new situation and of its repercussions on the economies of the countries of the Sahelian region as a whole. The texts adopted by the Assembly [resolution 32J 159] and by the Council  speak very eloquently, as indeed do the replies of the donor countries and bodies. In this connexion, the Mauritanian people and Government wish, through me, to express their profound gratitude to all those countries and governmental and private organizations which responded to the appeal which was issued on behalf of the Sahelian region.\n23.\tMauritania, for its part, is determined to bring about a radical and lasting solution to that and all other problems, regardless of their nature, on the basis of a comprehensive inventory, a sound and realistic management of its own resources, and a policy guaranteeing the freedom of foreign investment in all sectors of our national life.\n24.\tThat, then, was the message that I wished to deliver to this Assembly on behalf of the Mauritanian people. It is a message of peace and understanding, those two fundamental objectives in the United Nations Charter, to which my country remains profoundly devoted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n1.\tIt is our privilege to have as our President at this Assembly an eminent personality in the world of Latin American thought and politics, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia, Mr. Indalecio Lievano Aguirre. Ties of long-standing admiration and affection link me to him, as does the maternal surname we share\u2014Aguirre\u2014which evokes, in our common Basque stock, the virtues of steadfastness and industry of a people that has contributed so much to forging the destinies of Spain and the Latin American nations.\n2.\tWhile congratulating you most warmly on your election, Mr. President, I should also like to express our deep respect for your work as a historian, a thinker and a man in public life. As a genuinely liberal spirit you have succeeded in imbuing your entire life's work with that thoughtful depth which is so much a part of the tradition of our cultural and human heritage.\n3.\tThrough you I greet a people that makes of the cult of language a rigorous and living expression of essential national qualities. Through you I pay homage to Colombia, a country that shares close and deep affinities with us, and which has successfully moulded its institutional and political life with respect for democratic principles.\n4.\tI should also like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank the, outgoing President, Mr. Mojsov, for the skilful and unswerving dedication with which he carried out his duties during a period which saw the greatest number of sessions in the history of the Assembly.\n5.\tI could not let this opportunity pass without paying a tribute once again to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the intensive work he is doing; a tireless traveller, a skilful diplomat and a persevering mediator, he is always ready to serve without flagging the cause of peace.\n6.\tWe receive into this Assembly a new Member of the United Nations, Solomon Islands, which I wish to welcome most warmly. I also wish to express, on behalf of my Government, the desire to maintain cordial relations of friendship and collaboration between our two countries.\n7.\tSpain, which is a part of Europe and a neighbour of Africa and has a special bond with the peoples of Latin America through certain common forms of life and culture, is fully aware of the growing interdependence characteristic of the world today and of how its own peculiar identity takes shape within this universal framework; hence, our understanding of and solidarity with the aspirations and expectations of men and peoples of very diverse continents in their thirst for freedom, dignity and justice.\n8.\tWe reaffirmed recently our will to join the European institutions, having become a member of the Council of Europe in November 1977 and having applied for membership in the European Communities with the full support of all the Spanish political forces. In so doing, my Government has made not an economic choice alone, but also, and above all, a political one, with a view to the attainment of a form of community life in freedom and justice. Spain is aware of what its presence can contribute to the Communities in the defence of the values of Christian humanism in the building up of a more complete and balanced Europe and in its dialogue and co-operation with the third world.\n9.\tAfrica, by reason of its geographical proximity and as a result of a political decision, is one of the objectives of Spanish foreign policy to which we had not hitherto given the over-all attention it required. We Spaniards feel particular solidarity with the countries of that continent, which, having emerged from the decolonization process, is now undergoing development and modernization and is seeking to assimilate technology and knowledge, not as a passive import, but rather as the application of means that will permit the defence of their values and the strengthening of their identity. In a world at once manifold and one, like that of today, we consider that the enriching phenomenon of decolonization should be economic and cultural, and not merely political.\n10.\tSpain has clearly defined its Latin American policy as a priority issue in its foreign policy. Our efforts are directed towards the strengthening of a community spirit which will be wholly compatible with our integration into Europe and which we hope will crystallize into institutional schemes pragmatic enough to serve effectively the interests of our peoples and to facilitate the necessary dialogue, on a wider scale, between Europe and America.\n11.\tIn short, we wish to project this historical legacy of the common experience of our past and the immense \npossibilities inherent in the obvious fact of the linguistic and cultural unity of Spanish America into a real phenomenon that will be effective and active in the world today. For this purpose, this common culture and past must be taken as the starting-point for a whole line of action, guided by the goals of steady, undiscriminating solidarity between our peoples and aimed at securing specific kinds of co-operation, at both the bilateral and the multilateral level, that will not only attempt to solve our most pressing socio-economic problems but also safeguard in our area, as a contribution to the design of a new international order, the supreme values of justice, freedom and peace.\n12.\tSpain, which is living through a decisive period in. its history as it consolidates its democracy and awaits the imminent adoption of its Constitution, also desires to exert a firm and realistic influence abroad. Nowadays, no people can avoid the key question, What is, and what should be, its share in seeking to secure peace, in building a more peaceful and just world and in constructing an international order suited to the demands of our historical era?\n13.\tThe starting-point for our action in the world is the reaffirmation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the determined undertaking to spare no effort to advance peace and international security through detente and disarmament, defend human rights, and close the gap between the developing and the industrialized countries.\n14.\tOur Organization has a grave responsibility in this matter. The United Nations cannot be reduced to being a mere forum for the discussion or assertion of principles, or a last resort in times of crisis or danger. Its universality and permanence require that it be a melting-pot in which a new international community can be moulded and in which solutions to present and future problems can be defined collectively and put into practice through co-operation. The United Nations is not just a useful institution for tackling present problems; it should also become a centre for long-term efforts designed to resolve the difficulties of a world that is facing challenges that make us ever more interdependent.\n15.\tThe only ways to tackle this series of problems are those based on political and legal principles accepted by the international community as a whole. The Spanish Government believes that such principles are founded on dialogue and compromise; they exclude so-called solutions imposed by force; they confirm respect for human rights and call for the establishment of a new international economic order drawing its inspiration from equity, sovereign equality, interdependence and common interests, and co-operation. It was to put into practice these principles that our Organization was created. There is no valid alternative to this Organization, which, in a framework of suitable dynamic co-operation with the regional organizations, can and must become an instrument of peaceful change through negotiation, a source of security and an institution at the service of international co-operation.\n16.\tWe are opposed to the use of violence from profound conviction, but we cannot simply indulge in rhetorical lamentations or mere exhortations to reach agreement. Tensions and conflicts have causes which must be identified and overcome by our acting upon them resolutely, and with the political will. We are convinced-and the recent historical experience of my country bears witness to this-that change is always possible by peaceful means, since all causes of tension and conflict can be settled politically.\n17.\tThus, with regard to the Middle East, we are convinced that it is necessary to persevere with the efforts to overcome tension and to eliminate the threat of armed conflict once and for all. After the hopes raised by the visit to Jerusalem of the President of Egypt, Mr. Anwar El-Sadat, we followed with great interest the Camp David talks, which constitute an attempt to advance towards the solution of one of the most difficult issues in the present international situation.\n18.\tWe believe that the only possible course is for the parties involved to try to reach a political agreement that will make possible the establishment of a just, lasting and general peace in the whole of the Middle East, within the framework of the resolutions of the United Nations and taking into account the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people.\n19.\tAs regards this geographical area, my Government looks, with the special interest and affection with which it views everything pertaining to the Arab nation, upon the dramatic situation in Lebanon, whose sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence must be respected within the framework of national conciliation.\n20.\tSpain is pleased by the dynamic role played by the Organization in another grave conflict of the present time, that of Namibia. An international administration and the active presence of the United Nations should make possible the self-determination of the people of Namibia and the maintenance of the integrity of the Territory. We regret the intransigent attitude of the South African Government, which could lead to a deterioration of the situation, with unforeseeable consequences.\n21.\tThis is an ideal opportunity of ensuring, in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the resolutions of the Security Council-the latest one, resolution 435(1978), adopted on 29 September\u2014a swift and peaceful transition towards the independence of a people whose swift liberation we fervently desire.\n22.\tThe same means of peaceful transition should prevail in Rhodesia, where we consider it essential to put an end to a conflict that is endangering the peace and stability of the African continent. It is urgently necessary to ensure the independence of Zimbabwe on the basis of a majority Government, with the agreement of all the parties involved and in accordance with the indisputable democratic principle of \\\"one man, one vote\\\". \n23.\tThe Spanish Government is firmly opposed to any kind of racial discrimination wherever it may be found. Therefore we condemn and reject apartheid and the policy of territorial segregation, which, far from being a way of solving problems, is merely a stratagem for maintaining the unjust discrimination which apartheid involves, and which implies complete contempt for the indisputable postulate of absolute equality among men.\n24.\tThere will be no end to this \\\"crime against the conscience and dignity of mankind\\\", as the General Assembly and the Security Council have described it, so long as South Africa imposes measures which exclude the majority of the population from the political life of the country. Such discriminatory policies progressively reduce the chances of achieving reconciliation and peaceful change, and justify the indignation and condemnation of the international community as a whole.\n25.\tWhile speaking of Africa, I should like to make a few comments on the question of Western Sahara, where a peaceful negotiated solution is also urgently needed.\n26.\tSpain, which is alien to any kind of axis, genuine or fictitious, real or imaginary, and wishes only to maintain close and cordial relations with all the peoples of the region, to which it is linked by so many cultural, historical and human ties, is watching the course of events with keen anxiety. That is why it has been advocating the establishment of a climate of conciliation and concord which will make it possible to deal with objectivity and realism and in a constructive spirit, with all the problems of the Maghreb, particularly the one which has arisen over the process of the decolonization of the Territory of the Sahara, respecting the right of the Saharan people to self-determination.\n27.\tOur hopes have been stirred as-we have seen the recent events in the area, and specifically the movement that began in Mauritania on 10 July, which seems to point the way to dialogue and negotiation. We are glad that the Organization of African Unity [OAU] has decided to set up an ad hoc committee entrusted with the consideration of all the data of the question [see A/331235, annex II, AHG/Res.92 (XV)]. We will support any initiative our Secretary-General may take within the framework of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. We are willing to collaborate actively in every effort to work out formulas which will make possible the relaxation of tension and the achievement and consolidation of peace.\n28.\tAll the peoples of the area must be allowed to make their human and cultural similarities and the. complementary nature of their geography and economies factors for economic and social development for their common and reciprocal benefit. In this way the entire region would become a centre of stability and peace. Obviously, such a peace will not be a lasting one if it is not satisfactory to all the parties concerned.\n29.\tThe question of Cyprus is another source of instability which affects the equilibrium and security in an important strategic area of the eastern Mediterranean. We believe that our Organization should continue to support the efforts of the Secretary-General, encouraging inter-communal talks and, at the same time, ensuring that an atmosphere of relaxation of tension is maintained and that the principles of the Charter are respected. In this way, in the near future the Cypriot people may find a legal and political formula that will enable them to live together peacefully, ensure their independent unity and further their economic and cultural development.\n30.\tThe demand for security is an especially acute and sensitive issue in the entire Mediterranean. That is why my Government presses the need for such security by means of an understanding among the coastal States and the creation of a system of regional co-operation. It fills us with concern that the patterns of global strategy are applied automatically to such a delicate and complex area. The international community must realize that it is necessary and in everyone's interest to contain and gradually reduce the military forces present in that sea, and to set up a complementary system among the coastal States that will make the presence of such forces unnecessary and enable them to be progressively reduced.\n31.\tWe believe that the various sources of tension in the Mediterranean can and must be overcome by negotiation. We also believe that it is both necessary and urgent to increase co-operation among the coastal States so that their greater solidarity might become a factor of peace and stability in the region.\n32.\tThis concern for security, together with the conviction that change is always possible through negotiation and peaceful means, is fully applicable to a historical and political anachronism, namely Gibraltar. As an imposed military base, Gibraltar is a danger to the security of Spain and its 36 million inhabitants, whom it exposes to risks they have never accepted; its status as a colony is a violation of our territorial integrity; as an anachronism, Gibraltar is also an obstacle to co-operation among peoples which, in the natural course of events, are called upon to attain mutual understanding.\n33.\tThe United Nations has already established with clarity and precision a doctrine for the decolonization of the Rock, and has repeatedly emphasized the need for Spain and the United Kingdom to achieve a negotiated settlement which, in accordance with that doctrine, would put an end to this colonial situation. The United Kingdom Government must realize that it can no longer go on ignoring this duty to begin negotiations with Spain. For our part, we are convinced that there are formulas which, while restoring the territorial integrity of Spain, will at the same time give satisfaction to the United Kingdom and provide a due safeguard for the legitimate interests of the people of Gibraltar, by means of a comprehensive approach to the problem.\n34.\tWe have seen recent evidence of how long-standing problems have been successfully channelled or resolved through imagination and political will, and we trust that the United Kingdom will become clearly aware that the present situation cannot continue.\n\n35.\tSecurity and co-operation are indeed the objectives of the next session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, scheduled for 1980 in Madrid. Although the results obtained at the second session of that Conference, held in Belgrade in 1977, were by no means spectacular, my Government is of the opinion that they had one fundamental effect: they showed that compromise is possible and that the basic principles adopted in Helsinki are still fully valid.\n36.\tNow the important thing is to look to the future. The next session of the Conference must contribute to giving real shape to the hopes and expectations which undoubtedly exist concerning security and co-operation within Europe. Spain is determined to discharge its responsibilities as the host country, and will give the greatest attention to proper preparation for the Madrid session.\n37.\tTogether with specific current problems, to some of which I have just referred, the world of today is also faced with more general issues which affect the international community as a whole and cast doubt upon the ability of our Organization to create the conditions for peace. 1 refer to problems such as the safeguarding and protection of human rights; the inequality between developed and developing countries; co-operation; and, finally, security and disarmament.\n38.\tI shall begin by speaking of human rights because this year we commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of one of the most important texts of all those which, on the domestic and international planes, are landmarks in man's struggle for liberty and justice: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n39.\tIn spite of the goals that the United Nations has already achieved in defining the obligations of States on human rights questions, we are still very far from meeting the expectations of 1948. This is undoubtedly serious, because in the last analysis the effectiveness of United Nations activities in this field can be measured only on the basis of the effectiveness of the safeguarding and exercise of human rights on a world-wide scale.\n40.\tWe believe that disregard of and contempt for human rights leads to acts that outrage the conscience of mankind, and we condemn such practices wherever they occur, because we are against tyranny and oppression. Within the regional ambit of the Council of Europe and the world-wide framework of our Organization, Spain has undertaken\u2014and will continue to do so in future\u2014legal obligations that bear witness to our attitude on this issue, which is at once the baas and the ultimate aim of real peace.\n41.\tMy Government is convinced that it is essential to endeavour, now and during the coming years, to improve and perfect the institutional machinery that will guarantee and supervise the exercise of human rights along the lines of the proposals before this Assembly. That is why we advocate a policy based on the following guidelines. First, the persistent violation of basic human rights, wherever it may occur, must be condemned and cannot be dismissed as a matter exclusively within the domestic jurisdiction of States. Secondly, the flagrant suppression of human rights, wherever it may arise, constitutes a threat to peace. Thirdly, existing inspection machinery must be improved in order to make it not only more effective, but also more objective and impartial, because this extremely grave question of human rights cannot be left to the mercy of selective criteria of a subjective nature.\n42.\tThese three fundamental guidelines are the basis of our conviction that the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States cannot be considered as a legal obstacle preventing serious breaches of basic human lights from being examined by the international community; the safeguarding of human rights is a matter which goes beyond the national, domestic sphere and takes its place in the setting of international affairs. At the same time, these guidelines are the reason for our decision to help secure the establishment of a more effective procedure for the protection of human rights; hence our support for the creation of the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and for the appointment and dispatch, when circumstances so require, of United Nations fact-finding missions.\n43.\tin this connexion, and continuing the trend already initiated with the ratification of the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights, I wish to announce that my Government intends to recognize the jurisdiction of the Human Rights Committee in accordance with article 41 of the latter Covenant and to accept its Optional Protocol [see resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex]. That will be Spain's contribution to ensuring that the United Nations machinery for the safeguarding and supervision of human rights can effectively accomplish the aims for which it was established.\n44.\tWhile speaking on this essential issue I can hardly omit a reference to one of the most odious and brutal breaches of human rights: terrorism. This is the latest and most repugnant form of violence, which constitutes an assault on the right to security and life. Terrorism is a threat to all, because its action is characterized by the refusal to recognize the existence of innocent people. For this reason the terrorist must find neither justification nor sanctuary.\n45.\tOur Organization must face this challenge by establishing the bases for an international agreement enabling this scourge of our time to be legally classified and effectively combated.\n46.\tWe consider that poverty, hunger and squalor are equally grievous assaults on human rights, and we firmly believe that this concept cannot continue to be limited to its traditional proportions, but that it must rather take within its compass the new horizons of human rights. Human rights, which include economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights, are interdependent and inseparable. It is not possible to conceive of peace, justice and equity without the guarantee that respect for such rights offers against arbitrariness and all kinds of oppression.\n47.\tThe inequality between developed countries and developing countries is one of the most serious problems facing the international community. Here, too, the time has come to move from words to action, with a view to creating an order which will be the expression of greater international justice and solidarity and in which the right to growth and change, -to development, will be understood as a fundamental human right.\n48.\tWe are in urgent need of practices of international solidarity, for it is not enough to bring about apparent solutions which, based as they are more on self-interest than on any sense of solidarity, may perhaps benefit some countries, but do not eliminate the deepest causes of poverty and squalor. No kind of international action can replace, by itself, national policies aimed at combating under-development. But the full and harmonious development of all peoples is a responsibility incumbent upon the international community. That is why we think that to get rid of the basic causes of poverty and inequality, to endow economic growth with a new direction and a new significance, in short, to lay the foundations for greater international justice, are practical goals within the reach of our Organization.\n49.\tAny assessment of the factors which today bear upon the world economy is to be approached from the viewpoint of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], since the economic progress and the political stability of both industrialized and developing countries depend on its success or failure. We have been seeking solutions for too long; we have come a long way and we have gradually, become aware of the pressing need for interdependence, and of the importance of the idea of a common interest between developed and developing countries.\n50.\tIt is true that there is encouraging evidence of the ability of our Organization to restructure the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system. But there are also reasons for anxiety, and in this connexion we are concerned at the lack of progress at the recent meeting of the so-called Committee of the Whole, or the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, because the North-South dialogue does not affect one country or group of countries, it affects us all.\n51.\tThe seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, whose debates have just concluded, should make us think about how to bring about a global agreement on not only a desirable but a necessary universal maritime code, which is the ambitious goal of the Conference. The legitimate interests of all countries must be reflected there in balanced solutions which contribute to the new international economic order which we want to create. The necessary consensus can be achieved only if there are formulas which are sufficiently harmonious to make them generally acceptable.\n52.\tAmong the matters to which we ascribe most importance is access to the living resources of the exclusive economic zones of other States by customary fishermen. It is necessary to recognize and protect interests worthy of respect in human communities which have made of fishing their traditional livelihood, and the legal and moral justification for that cannot be ignored.\n53.\tIn connexion with living resources and so many other matters, we need an order based on co-operation. That is the only valid way to express the reality of our interdependence. In this connexion, Spain is carrying out a reappraisal of its policy of co-operation, in order to channel it in a more co-ordinated and effective way towards those countries and regions to which we are bound by special geographical or cultural ties.\n54.\tAware of our limitations and possibilities, but aware also of our responsibilities, we are prepared to carry out an active policy of co-operation with those countries as an expression of our desire to establish and consolidate networks of solidarity, interdependence and mutual benefit.\n55.\tThe quest for a peace linked to human rights, development and co-operation also depends on the organization of international security and disarmament,\n56.\tWe live in an insecure world, which has hardly become aware, or has not wished to become aware, of the requirements for security, and thus it is a world of conflict. The quantitative and qualitative arms race has disastrous economic and social effects in such diverse areas as education, public health, nutrition, the environment and human resources.\n57.\tMillions of human beings are unable to understand the reason for this absurd situation, and for the scandalous extravagance that the arms race involves.\n58.\tAt a historical time when the State is too small to face the great challenges of our era\u2014which are problems with world-wide causes and dimensions\u2014our Organization still does not satisfactorily meet the needs of security. We tend to react rather than to foresee, to concern ourselves with the effects of a crisis rather than to ward it off, and this is the reason why our conflicts often seem insoluble. We have not adapted our Organization to a world different from that of 1945, and also different from that of the cold war, and we have not explored all the possibilities that the Charter of the United Nations has to offer with regard to machinery for the peaceful settlement of situations likely to degenerate into conflict, or the peaceful settlement of disputes or questions of collective security.\n59.\tThe organization of international security is closely connected with the control of arms and disarmament. Last June, during the general debate at the tenth special session of the Assembly,  I recalled that the Spanish Government included the question of disarmament among the fundamental objectives of its foreign policy.\n60.\tIn the recently adopted Final Document of the Tenth Special Session [resolution S-10/2J, there is to be found the source of a closer collaboration among all the members of the international community. It is a positive fact that the results obtained by the General Assembly should have been achieved through a consensus, and that means that on an issue of the greatest significance for the cause of peace we have entered a new stage in which all of us will be able to obtain a hearing.\n61.\tFinally, after this rapid analysis of some of the general and specific problems of our world of today, I wish to express our whole-hearted agreement with the observations of the Secretary-General in his annual report on the work (if the Organization, where he points out:\n\\\"The work of the United Nations runs on two main and parallel lines. One is an attempt to deal, through international co-operation, with the immense actual problems of a world in a state of fundamental change and development. [The other is] that of gradually replacing... tensions and conflict with [political solutions reached through negotiation and agreement] and the spirit of solidarity of a world order based on a sense of community.\\\" [See A/33/1/, sect. XII.]\n62.\tCo-operation and negotiation for peaceful change are two of the most important functions of our Organization. For these functions to be performed, the United Nations does not need words, but the firm political support of Member States and practical means. In an imperfect world, the United Nations offers the best approach and the best channel for the solution of the vital problems upon which the well-being of the international community and peace depend.\n63.\tToday more than ever, on account of the gravity and complexity of the problems that beset the world, the United Nations is a necessity. It represents the hope of millions of human beings for a more just world, one freer and less imperfect, and thus it is the United Nations that must guide our steps in dealing with situations which must find the way to a solution through a peaceful process of change, by means of negotiation and co-operation between equals.\n64.\tSuch a process of peaceful change is the means that has made it possible-and may I recall this here with an emotion not untouched by pride\u2014that we in the Kingdom of Spain, through the free and responsible decision of Spaniards, should be living together under a system of political pluralism and freedom; for we are convinced that it is in freedom, justice and respect for human rights that the basis of concord and peace lie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff142.  It is with great pleasure that I extend to Mr. Lievano, on behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and on my own behalf, sincere congratulations and best wishes on his election as President of this thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. My delegation feels sure that under his wise and efficient guidance the arduous tasks facing this Assembly will be tackled with confidence and positive assurance of success.\n143.\tI should like at this time through you, Sir, to extend to Mr. Mojsov our gratitude for his expert and competent handling of the proceedings at the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly and at the special sessions of the General Assembly over the past year.\n144.\tMy delegation wishes to put on record once more its deep appreciation for the work done by our Secretary-General in directing the efforts of the United Nations, particularly in his recent quests for peace in the world, frustrated and thwarted though they have been in some areas by the rabid racism that is synonymous with apartheid.\n145.\tIn closing these words of greeting, it is with a feeling of immense satisfaction that I join with others who have warmly welcomed Solomon Islands to this family of nations. It remains the confirmed view of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago that, notwithstanding the sometimes seemingly insuperable barriers that stand in the way of co-operation between sovereign States, the United Nations continues to provide a stable and acceptable medium for conducting the relations of Member States.\n146.\tAs members of this community of nations, we have both a duty and an obligation to co-operate with one another. This co-operation, in our view, must be founded on four basic and fundamental imperatives. These are: the political will to co-operate; the genuine acceptance of the need to eradicate poverty and enhance the quality of life of the peoples of all countries; the conviction that world peace and the security of all States are necessary prerequisites for optimizing the value of the limited resources of our planet; and the non-exclusion of any State from this international forum and the many benefits which derive from participation therein.\n147.\tIn full recognition and awareness of that fourth imperative\u2014the need to universalize the United Nations - \nmy delegation hopes that the day will soon be here when together we can rejoice as we welcome those peoples still struggling in southern Africa and elsewhere for their dignity and independence. We had dared to hope that we could have already welcomed to our Assembly Namibia and Zimbabwe; but good faith is not the hallmark of the racists in southern Africa.\n148.\tInto what sort of international community are we welcoming new Member States? What hopes for the future can we share with them? How well have our opportunities been used through the auspices of this Organization to create a better human environment for all our peoples?\n149.\tThe record for 1977-1978 is bleak and cheerless; the augury for the coming year most unpropitious. The matters which will be reviewed in this short statement were with us during the thirty-second session; from statements made to this Assembly, it would appear that this thirty-third session is not likely to be the occasion for-universal understanding or for a greater sense of political commitment to meaningful co-operation between developed and developing countries. Rather, there seems to be an explicit desire on the part of some to perpetuate systems of injustice that have enabled the economically strong to develop and maintain an inequitable position of privilege over the economically weak.\n150.\tIt is to the field of economic co-operation that I should like first of all to turn my attention, since it is here that relations between the developed and the developing countries have become decidedly polarized. In fact, it is mainly in economic terms that the divisions between the North and the South have any tangible quality and it is precisely in these matters that resistance to meaningful co-operation has been most pronounced.\n151.\tMuch hope has been pinned on the successful outcome of the discussions in UNCTAD on the Integrated Programme for Commodities. My delegation notes with regret that the deadline which was established under UNCTAD resolution 93 (IV) has not been met and it appears that the negotiations on the common fund will suffer interminable delays. The direction which consideration of this fund seems to be taking, moreover, suggests that developing countries will not succeed in establishing a new regime for commodities which goes beyond the mere setting up of market regulatory mechanisms that now typify international commodity agreements. This would indeed be a retrograde step.\n152.\tIt has been clearly demonstrated during the course of the discussions on both the Integrated Programme for Commodities and the common fund that excellent opportunities exist through the commodity trade for co-operation to the benefit of both the developed and the developing countries. It was hoped that self-interest, at least, could motivate the developed countries to see their way clear to co-operating more fully in this sphere of economic endeavour.\n153.\tThe multilateral trade negotiations, too, have given cause for serious concern to those developing countries that have been following the deliberations. It is with regret that my delegation records its dissatisfaction at the failure of the\ndeveloped countries to accept the principle of non-reciprocity for the granting of trade concessions between the developed and all developing countries. Developed countries appear reluctant to accept the fact +hat the current imbalance in the share of world trade between North and South militates against economic growth in developing regions and consequently acts as a serious impediment to the expansion of world trade. Here again is another area in which the self-interest of developed countries over the long-term should make them more responsive to the requests for short-term concessions to-all developing countries.\n1S4 Shipping is also a matter for concern. Discussions in this field have given little reason to my Government and to others in the developing world to hope for an accommodation which would enable a more meaningful share of world shipping tonnages to be allocated to developing countries.\n155.\tIt is the view of my Government that the circumstances where developing countries own 61 per cent of the bulk cargo but a mere 5 per cent of the shipping tonnage cannot be allowed to persist. Equity demands that there be a more reasonable share in the market in bulk cargo, both liquid and dry; that international lending institutions adopt more flexible attitudes to financing the purchase of ships by developing countries; and that developed countries lend their support to the pooling of resources to enable developing countries to purchase or construct ships and thereby facilitate the transfer to developing countries of a greater share of world shipping.\n156.\tCo-operation on matters relating\\\" to the marine environment presents as many difficulties as those already outlined-if not more.\n157.\tThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago must record its considered objection to tendencies developing within the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea which, if allowed to continue to their logical conclusion, would result in a modern-day manifestation of the attitudes and assumptions that ushered in the colonial era, with the attendant conquest, appropriation and exploitation of regions considered distant, undiscovered territories.\n158.\tThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago recognizes as law that the sea-bed and its resources beyond national jurisdiction constitute mankind's common patrimony. The exploitation of these resources today must not be guided by unbridled opportunism and unprincipled greed. In this regard, unilateral legislative measures must be abhorred. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago holds that unilateral legislation relating to sea-bed resources beyond national jurisdiction can have no validity whatsoever in international law; that activities conducted under such legislation have no legal status; and that States, persons or entities indulging in such illegal practices cannot acquire any rights to the area exploited or its resources.\n159.\tUnilateral legislation would be contrary to' the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof, beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction [resolution 2749 (XXV)], which was adopted without dissent and which established the\nsea-bed and its resources as the common heritage of mankind. Consequently, such unilateral exploitation and appropriation of the resources would constitute illegal acts. These acts would violate the moratorium on sea-bed exploration and exploitation established by General Assembly resolution 2574 D (XXIV).\n160.\tSome industrialized countries have argued against this concept of the sea-bed as the common heritage of mankind and are seeking to frustrate the goals of cooperation by proposing unilateral legislation which they claim would give certain rights to their agents. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago must insist that the Declaration of Principles contained in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV) was declaratory of existing law. Neither analogy nor inference can be regarded as a source of law. Hence the freedom of the high seas cannot be extended to give nor interpreted as giving licence to a few to exploit minerals beyond national jurisdiction. Moreover, it appears that the reluctance on the part of some industrialized countries to undertake the meaningful transfer of technology is, regrettably, linked to their desire to press on with unilateral sea-bed mining operations, without reference to the international authority.\n161.\tThe many areas of non-co-operation I have alluded to notwithstanding, my delegation continues to look forward with optimism to the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development, which is scheduled to take place in August 1979. Members will recall that it was recommended at the twenty-ninth regular session of the General Assembly that science and technology should be used as an instrument to stimulate development, thereby reducing international inequalities and providing the basis for self-reliance [see resolution 3281 (XXIX), art. 13]. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago continues to view this Conference as the vehicle to provide, by way of action-oriented programmes, concrete solutions to the problems of the transfer and application of science and technology within the framework of the New International Economic Order. It must be reiterated here that developing countries should he given access to already existing knowledge in the field of science and technology and that access to science and technology on fair and reasonable terms should be a vital component of the New International Economic Order.\n162 We have for the past two years been engaged in the process of analysis and review.. The time is now ripe for the translation of our research findings into specific objectives. For this, the political will of countries - large and small \u2014 is needed.\n163. The 1977 Arusha symposium on science and technology for development emphasized that the application of science and technology to development should have as its main purpose the attainment of the goals and aspirations of a society and the satisfaction of its basic needs. The symposium pronounced upon the need for indigenous development of science and technology as an integral part of national culture. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago, in its programme for national development, has\nstressed the role of science and technology in the social and economic development of the country.\n164.\tThe imbalance between the countries that have advanced technology and those that have not has contributed to the dominance of the former and the dependency of the latter. We contend that the gap must be bridged and that self-reliance rather than continued dependency must be the essential feature in our socio-economic development. Regional and international co-operation would be meaningless if this were not achieved.\n165.\tThe United Nations through its agencies has a vital part to play in promoting the necessary co-operation among developing countries in this area, so that traditional and new technologies can be shared. Soon the Conference on Science and Technology for Development will have taken place, and the international community ought therefore to focus attention now on modalities for bringing about the technological transformation of the third world. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago, while recognizing the contribution which UNCTAD is making in the comprehensive programme of action for the strengthening of the technological capability of developing countries, is of the view that this process should be strengthened and receive the necessary assistance and co-operation from other agencies within the United Nations family.\n166.\tThis leads me to a consideration of the entire concept of the New International Economic Order. Much has been said, by way of criticism, of the aspirations of developing countries for a new order. Any overview of the history of international economic relations forces us to conclude that the old order has indeed not changed. That old order, where built-in imbalances inevitably led to chaos, confusion and strife, must now give way to the New International Economic Order.\n167.\tThe New International Economic Order must be regarded as a system in which there exists a more equitable sharing of the material, technological, social and other benefits of the human environment. To achieve this, it is absolutely essential that all countries share equitably in decision-making processes; for, in the final analysis, it is the right to share in the decisions that affect us that marks the difference between free men and those not yet free, between the third world and other worlds.\n168.\tThe various measures identified by the international community as being necessary to bring the New International Economic Order into being have all suffered set-backs, owing to lack of co-operation or reluctance on the part of the few to make concessions for the benefit of all. It is clear that greater attention must be devoted to the sensitive areas of the relationships between all countries with a view to redressing the imbalance which now prevails. While comparative advantage was enjoyed in most areas of production by the developed countries, developing countries were lectured on the virtues of free trade. When requests were made for reservation of what developing countries considered to be an equitable share of world industrial production\u2014that is, 25 per cent, a mere quarter, by the end of the century\u2014the response was that interference with the free-market system was not only political anathema but also represented gross economic inefficiency.\n169.\tToday, however, third-world countries, by developing resource-based industries and utilizing their abundant supplies of labour, are beginning, through the acquisition of modern technology, to achieve a competitive edge in an increasing number of areas of economic activity. Unemployment, which is still a dominant feature of the economies of developing countries, is now also common in some developed countries, which have resorted to protectionism rather than to measures which would be less injurious to the interests of developing countries and, indeed, to world trade generally.\n170.\tFurther, efforts on the part of developing countries to diversify into light manufacturing industries such as textile, foot-wear and electronics and into areas such as steel, aluminium and motor vehicles, have been frustrated through the institution of so-called orderly market arrangements and voluntary market restraints.\n171.\tSo far I have sought to underline the degree of importance which my delegation attaches to the role which better access to markets for exports from developing countries must play in the context of the New International Economic Order.\n172.\tThere are, to be sure, other serious problems relating to international economic co-operation. One of these problems is the vexed question of present-day indiscipline in international economic management in which floating exchange rates, and in particular the extent of the depreciation of the value of the major currencies in which most of world trade is financed, deprive developing countries and others of an ever-increasing proportion of their hard-earned export revenues. This is clearly unjust and my delegation takes heart from the recent assurances given with respect to the strengthening of the major trading currency and the creation of a more stable international monetary climate.\n173.\tIn this context, is it too much to hope that the developed countries will see their way clear to allowing developing countries access to their financial markets for development financing on concessionary terms? I should like to lend my voice in support of those who argue that such a policy would act as a catalyst for economic growth and would at the same time help the developed countries emerge from their present sluggishness without the fear of inflation.\n174 In this review of international economic relations, I have illustrated the type of world community that exists today. If the picture I have painted appears to be gloomy, then I hope that I may be excused for making a brief comment on the international political situation, which, though not without hope, is no less gloomy.\n175. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is seriously concerned over the pressures which have been brought to bear on the Government of Belize to cede its national territory as the price of securing its independence. The Government of Belize has quite properly rejected this attempt to destroy its territorial integrity. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago reaffirms its support for the just aspirations of the people of Belize for self-determination and independence in accordance with the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and resolution 1514 (XV), and for the recognition of its territorial integrity. We would urge the parties, in keeping with General Assembly resolutions, to continue their negotiations so that a solution embodying the noble ideals of the United Nations Charter will be found.\n176.\tMy delegation continues to affirm its support for the principles enshrined in Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) on the Middle East question and to hold the view that due recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination is crucial to a just settlement of the issue.\n177.\tThe situation in southern Africa remains grave, and nations of the world continue to be alarmed by the resistance of those regimes to the cries of the conscience of mankind.\n178.\tThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago condemns the illegal minority regime in Southern Rhodesia for its unprovoked attacks on Mozambique and Zambia in a vain attempt to coerce the two Governments and their peoples into abandoning their support for the peoples of Zimbabwe in their valiant struggle for freedom and independence.\n179.\tThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the endorsement by the Security Council in its resolution 431 (1978) of the proposal by the five Western States for implementation of Security Council resolution 385 (1976) in respect of the accession of Namibia to independence.\n180 . The Government of Trinidad and Tobago continues in the international community to deplore the existence of the inhuman regime of apartheid in South Africa and endorses requests to the Security Council to impose economic sanctions on South Africa. It is only through decisive and direct action that the flow of investments, goods-including petroleum and petroleum products-and other essentials can be stemmed, and that this regime, which violates every basic human right, may be brought to heel. Since 11 October has been designated the Day of Solidarity with South African Political Prisoners, I have today despatched to the Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid a message reaffirming the support of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for all measures adopted by the United Nations for the total eradication of the crime of apartheid.\n181.\tIn conclusion, may I express the hope that this thirty-third session of the General Assembly would end with all countries showing evidence of greater commitment to the principles on which this Organization was built. The international community, this family of nations, should not await the strife that leads to armed conflict and bloodshed to redress the injustices that plague our planet and divide the peoples of the world\n182.\tWe cannot await the end of the decade to start applying remedies to situations which continue to deteriorate The New International Economic Order cannot be accomplished by decree or resolution. Every day that passes brings suffering to the majority of peoples of the earth, and the list of grievances is long. Every day people suffer because of ignorance; people die for want of food or proper\nnutrition; people die for lack of health services; and all this takes place mainly in the region which is being euphemistically described as the third world.\n183.\tOur historic responsibility is to take positive measures to redress present social and economic injustices and to improve the quality of life of all peoples. The time to act is now and at this thirty-third session we must seize the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We congratulate him every year, not as a ritual or convention, but because of our appreciation of his faith in the role of the United Nations and his determination to translate that faith into the fulfilment of the purposes for which the Organization was created.\n \t2. We welcome Solomon Islands to this family of nations. The membership of our Organization continues to grow as more and more countries regain their freedom and independence. New systems of relationships develop as erstwhile colonial peoples sit side by side with their former colonial masters, when kingdoms have given way to republics, democracies, dictatorships and other forms of government.\n3. Developing countries continue to express grave impatience at the slowness, or seeming reluctance, of industrial countries to implement decisions aimed at the establishment of a new and just world economic order. Many conferences have been held, the need for change has been acknowledged, targets have been identified, but strategies have been confused in a welter of definitions and procedural arguments. Meanwhile the problem remains, and the terms of trade continue to deteriorate, to the detriment of the economies of developing countries.\n4.

Meanwhile the problem remains, and\nthe terms of trade continue to deteriorate, to the detriment\nof the economies of developing countries.\n5.\tWe in Botswana welcomed the creation of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, which is widely known as the Committee of the Whole and is charged with the responsibility of monitoring the implementation of decisions and agreements, as well as such other duties as are spelled out in paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 32/174, It is, for us, a matter of regret that the Committee's work has been hampered by differences in the understanding and interpretation of the manner in which it should execute its mandate. It is our hope that agreement will be reached soon on this issue.\n6.\tAt the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly, my delegation expressed its cautious appreciation of the agreement in principle to establish a common fund that would Lunch the Integrated Programme for Commodities. Further negotiations had to be undertaken in November last. We are concerned that these have not yet been satisfactorily concluded; for, even acknowledging the complexity of economic issues, the habitual tardiness with which economic matters of vital concern to developing countries are treated is, in effect, tantamount to callous indifference on the part of the developed world to the plight of the developing. We are, however, hopeful that the slowly emerging convergence of views on some issues will ultimately lead to the establishment of the fund.\n7.\tThe second decade of the International Development Strategy [resolution 2626 (XXV)] is drawing to a close. With a few exceptions, developed countries have failed to honour their pledges within the period set; some have even declared the reduced target of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product too steep, unattainable and therefore unrealistic. Since my country is a beneficiary, and since the contributions are voluntary and humanitarian rather than obligatory we can only implore, exhort and urge those countries, which have not already done so to respect themselves and protect their national honour and dignity by providing increased official development aid to the level of the target set for the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n\n8.\tWe welcome the special session of the General Assembly set for 1980 and the possibility of even a third decade of the International Development Strategy. It is the hope of all of us that the special session will be, not another occasion for the identification of problems and the determination of targets, but a formal session for the implementation of strategies worked out in the intervening years.\n9.\tIn the short term the hardships of developing countries\u2014in particular, the least developed among them\u2014 deserve special mention and therefore recognition. Because of their underdevelopment, coupled with imported inflation, they rely on assistance from developed countries. Loans on hard terms can only kill their credit-worthiness and national pride because of their genuine inability to repay. Consideration should therefore be given to granting manageable amortization terms. In this connexion, my delegation pays a tribute to those countries, such as Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, which have converted their loans to the least developed of developing countries into grants, and welcomes the intention by some countries to dispense with the pernicious system of the tying of development assistance to purchases from the donor.\n10.\tThe United Nations Conference on Technical Cooperation Among Developing Countries, held in Buenos Aires in August and September, has provided this Organization with a Plan of Action  Which my delegation hopes the Assembly will adopt; for, by adopting it, the international community will be enabling the developing countries to exploit the mutual advantages of co-operation and complementarity among themselves on the basis of equality and of respect for their national sovereignty.\n11.\tLooking at the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly, one still sees old and familiar topics which have been before us for the past many years. The international community has adopted many resolutions about them, but the problems remain. In the Middle East, Israel continues to occupy Arab lands and to defy Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which urged it to withdraw from occupied territories. My delegation welcomes all the efforts which are being made in the search for ways of resolving the problem We shall continue to be guided by the common desire and common resolve to secure for the region a comprehensive settlement that will include the restoration to the Arab and Palestinian people of their land and property.\n12.\tMy delegation is not at this stage in a position to express public support for or condemnation of the Camp David peace agreements.  Success will depend on the renunciation by Israel of any claim to any part of Arab land and its full co-operation in its return-all this counterpoised by guarantees of secure and recognized boundaries for each State in the area, and respect for its independence and sovereignty. We urge our Arab friends to adopt a united and constructive approach to this complex situation. We urge the international community to make it clear to Israel that no durable peace is possible without the direct involvement of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the search for it.\n13.\tMy delegation regrets that no progress has been made towards finding a lasting solution regarding the restoration\nof the unity of Cyprus. We welcome the Secretary-General's continued interest in the subject. We reaffirm our solidarity with the people of Cyprus and support the call for the urgent implementation of General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) and Security Council resolution 365 (1974).\n14.\tEvents in Africa in the past year aroused the chagrin of the world. Conflict situations developed between brothers in almost every region of the continent. Words assumed new meanings in support of ideologies and hegemonism, and we began too readily to refer to ourselves, or to others, as progressive or reactionary, radical or anti-revolutionary, or as stooges for one super-Power or another. To outstanding problems, such as the question of the Western Sahara and the tragedy in the Horn of Africa, have been added in the past few months the invasion of the Shaba province of Zaire, the invasion of Angola and Zambia by the security forces of racist South Africa, the violation of the territorial integrity of Mozambique, and acts of aggression against Botswana by the security forces of rebel Rhodesia. That, in the view of my delegation, raises the entire question of the security of African States and of intervention in African conflicts by extraterritorial forces.\n15.\tMy country fully accepts the responsibility of every State for the security of its nationals. We concede that no State other than the State concerned can accurately assess - the danger to itself of external aggression and the capability of its defence system to repel it. For this reason my country has always refrained from precipitate adverse comment on extraterritorial military assistance required by African countries. It is our view that the first call for assistance should be made on African States themselves or on the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and that only when this fails because of tardiness or reluctance on the part of Africa should an African country seek assistance elsewhere.\n16.\tBut we are fearful when local conflicts within and among African nations are fanned by external support. The fanning of local conflicts by extracontinental States is a new form of imperialism-not perhaps the classical type, which acquired territories and hoisted flags for the motherland, but that which seeks political control in the name of ideological loyalty. We in Botswana are proud to have won our independence from the territorial control of a colonial Power and we therefore view with suspicion and disfavour the use of military assistance given by any quarter as 'an instrument of ideological recolonization.\n17.\tA year ago at this very rostrum  my delegation expressed its appreciation of and support for the role played by the contact group of five Western members of the Security Council on the question of the decolonization of Namibia. We did so fully cognizant of the fact that theirs was a voluntary act, neither sponsored nor financed by any of the competent organs of the United Nations system; we did so sensitive to and aware of the existence of bodies such as the United Nations Council for Namibia, which had been officially created to deal specifically with the problem. The contact group discharged its undertaking so laudably that now the Security Council has adopted, by its resolution\n435 (1978), the report of the Secretary-General based on the proposals of the contact group and submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 431 (1978). Once again, therefore, my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the contact group of the five Western members of the Security Council for having deployed efforts to reaffirm the dignity of negotiation, rather than confrontation, as an effective tool in international diplomacy.\n18.\tIt should be a matter of grave concern to this Organization if, by its unilateral decision to proceed to elections, South Africa should create the impression that negotiations are a sign of weakness.\n19.\tIt must be stressed that, however commendable the efforts of the contact group, there would have been no progress had it not been for the constructive flexibility of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] during the long negotiations. My delegation therefore wishes to congratulate SWAPO on all this and also on its statesmanship in pledging to the world that, given guarantees of and optimum conditions for free and fair elections leading to genuine independence for Namibia, it would halt all hostilities. My country supports free and fair elections for Namibia, for it is not for us to choose a Government for the people of Namibia, but for the people of Namibia to choose their own Government for themselves. We dismiss the South African assertion that the purpose of the elections now is to establish who has the right to speak for the people of Namibia.\n20.\tWe are opposed to allowing any contretemps or the use of any stratagems to lead to the holding of elections that would preclude the participation of other political parties in the country, the results of which would therefore be unacceptable to the international community. It would be not only self-defeating but also self-destructive for any party to come to power in such circumstances.\n21\u201e The wrecking by South Africa of efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement poses great dangers for countries bordering on Namibia. This can only entail the escalation or' the fighting, with all its attendant suffering for the people of Namibia and the States in the region. Botswana therefore still urges the contact group of the five Western members of the Security Council to muster and mar shall all its negotiating ability in an endeavour to bring South Africa back to the path of peace and an internationally accented solution; for, while we concede that sanctions could lie made effective, given the collective will and concerted action, our sad experience in Zimbabwe has cast serious doubt on the efficacy of sanctions when these are weighed against mercantile and economic considerations. We condemn South Africa's unilateral decision to proceed with elections in the Territory, but we take note of its declaration that the door to further negotiations is not completely shut.\n22. My delegation supports the Secretary-General's report and, for its part, Botswana, as a member of the QAU and the United Nations and as a neighbouring, front-line State, is willing not only to consider favourably the secondment of experienced personnel from its own public service to serve in the civilian component of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group but to pledge its co-operation in ensuring that no act or acts inimical to the effective implementation of the proposals for a settlement of the Namibian situation will be permitted from its territory. We look forward to the independence of Namibia and the emergence of a friendly neighbour.\n23.\tThe question of Zimbabwe is no less with us than that of Namibia. The tragedy of it all is that we are ho closer to the solution than when we met for the thirty-second regular session. In some ways we have even lost ground. The Anglo-American proposals  which we brandished then, hoping that they would be acceptable to all parties to the dispute as a basis for negotiations leading to peaceful transition to majority rule and independence, have been trampled underfoot and described variously as unrealistic or dead and buried. In the view of my delegation those proposals have yet to be explored.\n24.\tIn the period under review Ian Smith and some nationalist leaders, not for lack of advice, have hoodwinked themselves into believing that with the formation of the so-called transitional government the freedom fighters would desert the Patriotic Front, lay down their arms and stop the war of liberation. Having so convinced themselves, they spurned the agreement by the Patriotic Front to attend a round-table conference. They have now been disillusioned as the value of their presumptions has depreciated, but to date they have lacked the courage to concede their mistake and consider other alternatives. They hoped to win international recognition through what they described as \\\"free and fair\\\" elections: free and fair, in a country where the security situation is deteriorating every day; free and fair, where supporters of the Patriotic Front are harassed and imprisoned and many have fled the country; free and fair, when the question as seen by political observers is no longer how one will be voting but which one will be seen to vote. They hoped to win international recognition and secure the lifting of sanctions and the ultimate capitulation of the Patriotic Front, yet we must advise them that without the involvement of the Patriotic Front no settlement in Zimbabwe will endure.\n25.\tBotswana continues to seek a negotiated solution and to support the call for a round-table conference of all parties as soon as possible. We therefore appeal to the internal settlement group to show courage, to come forward and to meet with the Patriotic Front group in order together to seek a new modus operandi that may lead to peace and the participation of all parties in the building of the nation. We appeal to those in America and elsewhere who have given support to the internal settlement group to encourage them to meet the other parties. We appeal to the Patriotic Front group also to take a positive role in constructing the bases for national cohesion. Finally, we appeal to the international community to give unified support to such a meeting.\n26.\tThe acceptance of majority rule in Zimbabwe would not have posed problems for the international community had the racist minority regime in that Territory not drawn its inspiration from South Africa itself and benefited from the material assistance, support and tacit encouragement of that country. It is South Africa also that has hindered the decolonization of Namibia. In South Africa, racism and apartheid established by history have been entrenched in legislation. Whether by-design, strategy or accident, the international community has shown gross reluctance and unpreparedness to address itself vigorously and meaningfully to the problems of apartheid, racism and oppression. Resolutions are passed every year, but they have been of nuisance value only. In that country, the African has no stake in the government of his country; in fact, there is no sharing of power. In that country, Africans are relegated to undeveloped, impoverished and fragmented ethnic homelands and have had the citizenship of the bantustans forced on them.\n27.\tAfrica has always urged South Africa to engage in a dialogue with the leaders of the people of that country, but South Africa has consistently refused. Only last month, opening the National Party's Transvaal Congress, the Minister of Plural Relations and Development ruled out the possibility of any negotiations with the black leaders outside the framework of the Government policy of apartheid.\n28.\tAmong, the questions the international community should ask itself regarding South Africa are the following. How long must Africa and the world wait to see South Africa's friends taking in that country the steps they have taken in Namibia and Zimbabwe? Why does South Africa accept majority rule for a unitary Zimbabwe and a unitary Namibia but not for South Africa itself? Why the double standards?\n29.\tOn this day of observance of the International Anti-Apartheid Year I declare once again Botswana's solidarity with the martyrs of South Africa, those who died in the struggle for liberation from apartheid and those who are languishing in the prisons of South Africa. We derive encouragement and confidence from the knowledge that the international community, by its observance of this year as International Anti-Apartheid Year, is signifying in no uncertain manner its solidarity with the people of South Africa in their quest for freedom and human dignity. We pay a tribute to those who have been honoured today for their work in the cause of freedom in South Africa. We praise the Special Committee against 4partheid for its work in making the observance of this International Anti-Apartheid Year the censor of our consciences\u2014lest we forget.\n30.\tThe road ahead will be long, steep and arduous. That, however, will not discourage those who are destined to travel it in search of human dignity. With its limited resources, Botswana will continue to provide asylum to victims of racism and oppression. We are fully aware that in playing that role we expose ourselves to wanton attacks. That will not deter us.\n31.\tWe express our gratitude to those States Members of this Organization which have in the past assisted us and strengthened our resolve to discharge this our international responsibility.\n32.\tMy country wishes no more and no less for the oppressed people of southern Africa than what the people of Botswana take for granted; freedom and justice for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

If efforts from within this hall and from outside its walls are directed\n\n\ntoday towards achieving and maintaining international peace and security through the establishment of equitable international relations and the guarantee of the right of all States to progress and to develop without interference in their affairs or infringement upon their sovereignty, and through the containment of disputes, then the history of this Organization in living up to its responsibilities will provide an eloquent witness to a continuing international need for the prosperity and well-being of the United Nations.\n6.\tIn this respect, I wish to congratulate the delegation of the State of Solomon Islands for having secured its membership in this Organization, thus contributing to the achievement of one of the most important objectives of this Organization, that of the universality of the United Nations.\n7.\tMy country had the honour, last July, of acting as host to the fifteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, held at Khartoum from 18 to 22 July. African leaders met in a brotherly gathering that was characterized by an intense awareness of the historical responsibility laid upon its shoulders and an unblurred vision of the problems and anxieties of the African continent. Their deliberations on those issues became an embodiment of African wisdom inspired by a heritage deeply rooted in history and a manifestation of the ability of Africa to overcome the obstacles that hinder its path. The Khartoum summit meeting was a sincere and persistent effort on the part of those leaders, an effort in which the wills of their peoples converged and formed solid and unwavering convictions based on the solid foundation of the principles of the Charter of their organization.\n8.\tI am indeed honoured and proud to have been entrusted with the presidency of the OAU for the current year. Hence, if I were to address myself briefly to the African positions and stands, it would be only in such a way as to reveal the extent to which the OAU has progressed in its endeavours to attain the desired degree of effectiveness in handling the various African and international issues included in the agenda of this session. .\n9.\tAs the principles of the OAU were drawn from the same lofty and noble ideals as the United Nations Charter, its establishment, as envisioned by the pioneer-leaders of Africa 15 years ago, came to represent a major tributary of the international Organization that aims at augmenting and upholding the same ideals and principles. The summit meeting in Khartoum commemorated a decade and a half in the life of our organization. This, indeed, is a young and tender age counted in years, but chronicled in afflictions and crises our organization reached a very early maturity and acquired tremendous seasoning. Its creation coincided \nwith that stretch in the stride of Africa's history that witnessed the awakening of the continent and the realization by its peoples of their right to freedom and independence. Hence it chartered for itself the most difficult course where precious blood was spilled and effort and sweat were spent in pursuit of the realization of its peoples' aspiration in dignity and pride. The last 15 years were a difficult and painstaking march as, notwithstanding the heavy burden left behind by colonialism in Africa, they also coincided historically with the ailments that our world suffers from today. The organization could not afford to extricate itself from these dilemmas or afford to play the role of the spectator when it opted to become an integral part of this sphere by way of action and reaction. Hence the various afflictions and crises that befell the continent served only to strengthen its solidarity and unity.\n10.\tThe decisions emanating from the Khartoum summit meeting came to emphasize our strong will to protect the organization and uphold its lofty principles and as a renewal of the pledge we made to our peoples to mobilize our resources and intensify our struggle. They emphasize also our commitment to solidarity, unity, respect for sovereignty and to the maintenance of good neighbourliness and brotherly links through the exploration of all avenues of co-operation between our peoples to speed up the process of social and economic development.\nv\n11.\tThe Khartoum meeting signifies a commitment on our part to preserve our sovereignty, which we forcefully retrieved, and to close the door against foreign intervention, emphasizing a declaration of unwavering determination to repel any danger threatening our countries, our peoples and our continent. It signifies also an affirmation of our solidarity with Arab peoples in their struggle and in the establishment of an African Arab front to confront the political and. economic challenges which face these two peoples.\n12.\tThe Khartoum summit meeting has culminated in directing African efforts towards the resolution of African problems in a manner reflecting the recognition by Africa of its responsibility towards the international community. Hence, being entrusted with the task of conveying to this gathering the decisions of that summit meeting, I find it appropriate to dwell on them in some length in order to be able to properly convey the mood of the meeting and its understanding of the international responsibility it shoulders.\n13 What we are persistently seeking to establish through our bilateral, regional and international relations is a new era of hope and accomplishment. Hence our attention and efforts have been directed towards anticipating events rather than passively awaiting them, initiating steps, saving our strength and advocating our line of thinking by rallying support to it.\n14. It was on this understanding that the African countries based their meetings with the countries of non-aligned movement and with those countries that shared with them the task of laying the foundation of African-Arab co-operation. It is with this same understanding that we join hands with the world community represented by you here today, our responsibility and obligations towards which we fully recognize.\n15.\tAfter Africa's voice, with all clarity and determination, had echoed strongly within the continent and the whole world announcing its firm intention, to uphold the principles and unity of the non-aligned movement and pledging to spare no effort to maintain and increase its effectiveness, African delegations moved towards Belgrade to continue their international effort under the banner of their organization and guided by its decisions and by the understanding I have alluded to earlier. The African voice was an expression of the continent's adherence to the principles of non-alignment as the only framework within which the African struggle to liberate territories under foreign domination and to preserve national independence could be effectively mobilized. It was also an expression of the strong African conviction that the creation of a new international order, first and foremost, entails strict adherence to the main principle of non-alignment that calls for independence in relations with power blocs, the non-use of force and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.\n16.\tAfrican delegations effectively participated in the deliberations of the Belgrade meeting  with the strong conviction that strengthening the non-alignment movement augments the efforts of their organization. This participation was also an expression of their full cognisance of the role entrusted to African peoples in maintaining unity and solidarity among non-aligned States. With this positive and constructive attitude of sympathy and understanding, the meeting in Belgrade looked into the problems and anxieties of the African continent. It was only natural that the non-aligned countries, which share common aspirations and destinies with the African countries, should consider those problems and anxieties within the same context and from the same viewpoint as Africa. Their decisions coincided with the African decisions emanating from the capital of my country and Africa's voice was echoed in Belgrade in a spectacular unison.\n17.\tAccordingly, the decisions taken at Belgrade [see A/33/206] came to lend unlimited international weight and support to the African views expressed at the Khartoum summit meeting. Therefore, if I were to convey to this Assembly Africa's viewpoints on the issues of today, it would only be to emphasize the fact that those views, having met unlimited international' support, are no longer regional stances inasmuch as they are established on a basis of solid international understanding.\n18.\tWhat is now going on in South Africa in the way of consistent violation of basic human rights is a disgrace to humanity and an affront to the moral codes of the world community that deserves complete eradication. The inhuman practices of the racist regime in Pretoria, which are the most repulsive practices ever witnessed in human history, represent only one of the columns supporting that regime's structural entity. The resources of our African people in that part of our continent are not only readily available to an alien minority and inaccessible to the indigenous population, but also offer an inexhaustible source on which the racist regime draws in strengthening its economic influence and the repressive machinery it directs against the African population. It draws on these African resources to increase its military capabilities in order to carry out brutal military campaigns against front-line States and, indeed, against all independent African States.\n19.\tThe Fascist regime of South Africa is obsessed with the false idea that it can, by its consistent aggression against these African States, obstruct their development programmes and thus dissuade them from living up to their responsibilities in supporting the struggle of their heroic brothers in South Africa. The Pretoria regime, which founded its racist entity on false racist concepts, conveniently forgets, in a typical manifestation of callous disregard and arrogance, that African States-no matter what the sacrifices and price they have to pay\u2014will remain faithful to the struggle being waged in that part of the continent, a struggle which is supported by the peoples of Africa and\u201eindeed, by the peoples of the whole world. The strong winds of liberty that have demolished colonial fortresses in the wake of the momentous African awakening will keep on blowing in forceful gusts towards southern Africa, and are certain to eradicate that abhorred, cancerous regime.\n20.\tWhile Africa remembers with appreciation and gratitude the stand taken by the world community represented here in the United Nations when it condemned racial discrimination as a crime against humanity and a danger to international peace and security, it would like to remind this Assembly of the numerous resolutions and decisions that have emanated from this Organization recognizing the legitimacy of the struggle against racial discrimination, including armed struggle. It would also like to reiterate what it has emphatically stated in the past, namely that no option remains open other than resorting to a tight siege against, and direct armed confrontation with, that racist regime. There is no need to review options or to select alternatives if we recognize Security Council resolution 418 (1977) and proceed to the strict implementation of its provisions by imposing a complete arms embargo upon South Africa and severing all forms of military and economic co-operation with it.\n21.\tIt is only fitting on this occasion to salute the front-line States of Angola, Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia for the great sacrifices they are making in shouldering the responsibility of joint struggle against the racist regime for the complete emancipation of the continent. It is in accordance with the various decisions of the international community, represented by this Assembly, that these countries should be afforded moral and material support to strengthen their defensive capabilities and to enable them to offer secure bases for the liberation struggle being waged in southern Africa.\n22.\tIt is indeed saddening to witness today the collusion of some Powers with this degenerate regime, which is thus strengthening its military and economic capabilities, while at the same time those same Powers boast that their charters and constitutions cater to and embody the basic principles of human rights. How compatible are those charters and constitutions with this conduct which not only infuses blood into, and offers a lifeline to, the racist regime but also enables it to have access to nuclear technology and nuclear weapons of destruction in order to safeguard its interests at any price? How harmonious with their charters and constitutions are their practices which enable South Africa to continue its repressive measures and systematic genocide aimed at the perpetuation of the abhorred settler- colonialism in southern Africa?\n23.\tIt was on the basis of these premises that the Khartoum summit meeting called for a strict oil embargo on the racist regime of Pretoria. It went further in expressing a strong demand for the establishment of highly effective standing machinery for the proper implementation of this embargo on the racist regime in southern Africa.\n24.\tThe present critical stage of the heroic Namibian people's struggle, under the banner of the South West Africa People's Organization SWAPO, which steadfastly lived up to its commitment to struggle until that struggle was crowned by the Security Council's latest resolution on the subject\u2014resolution 431 (1978)\u2014was only a natural outcome of SWAPO's able leadership and political maturity. This stage is equally critical in the whole African struggle against the powers of evil and aggression in the southern part of Africa. The utmost vigilance is required in the face of the various plots being concocted by the Pretoria regime against that region.\n25.\tThe international community represented by the United Nations, which supported the Namibian people materially and morally throughout its struggle, is now called upon to continue to provide stable and sustained material aid to SWAPO to enable it effectively to counter those plots being hatched against it by the very Powers which harbour evil intentions against the welfare of our continent. While expressing gratitude for the past efforts of the United Nations by offering unlimited support to the United Nations Council for Namibia, Africa views with mounting appreciation the recent efforts of the Organization to give the needed momentum to the noble international endeavours directed towards the achievement of the complete emancipation of the Namibian people under the flag of SWAPO and towards preserving the territorial unity and integrity of Namibia, including Walvis Bay. It is particularly pertinent in this respect to refer to the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Namibia,  prepared pursuant to Security Council resolution 431 (1978), and to point out that South Africa is again resorting to manoeuvres aimed at preventing the convening of the Security Council and its adoption of the recommendations contained in that report. The Assembly is hereby called upon to put an end to those manoeuvres and go ahead with the final steps towards the attainment of independence by the Namibian people.\n26.\tIn Zimbabwe the Patriotic Front is leading a heroic popular struggle to liberate the country from the yoke of the minority racist regime, which is staggering under the Front's heavy blows. Already so close to collapse and annihilation, this racist regime came out with the so-called Salisbury agreement of 3 March 1978,  whereby it desperately tried to bestow a politically representative character on some opportunist elements which had been rejected and which represent no national entity or sector of the population. The Khartoum summit meeting rejected that Agreement, emphasizing that it amounts to no more than a treacherous and wicked attempt to strengthen and consolidate the military and political establishment of the racist regime. It also condemned it as a feverish attempt on the part of the Salisbury regime to consolidate its grip on the resources of the country and as a devious plot to suppress the heroic aspirations to freedom and to complete emancipation of the people of Zimbabwe. We reiterated in Khartoum the strong African conviction that a just solution to this problem is attainable only if it embodies and caters for the wishes of the majority of the people, represented by the Patriotic Front. A lasting solution of the problem must be to recognize the right of the people of Zimbabwe to self-determination and independence through the transfer of power from the minority to the people of Zimbabwe and their authentic representatives.\n27.\tThe legitimate struggle undertaken by the Patriotic Front as the sole legitimate liberation movement in Zimbabwe meets with full support and solidarity from the African peoples as a struggle that is certain to achieve its objectives of liberty and sovereignty.\n28.\tSo, if the Salisbury racist regime were to launch brutal aggression against the neighbouring African States, the least this international community could do would be fully to support the Zimbabwean people and the peoples of the front-line States by providing them with the necessary material assistance and strictly implementing the provisions of a total economic embargo on the racist regime in accordance with the contents and spirit of Article 41 of the Charter of the United Nations.\n29.\tIt is a fact that colonialism, while retreating from our continent after having plundered its resources, has found it difficult to allow the African peoples to carry on with their processes of economic and social development, so vital after years of oppression and suffering. Since the awakening of Africa, colonialism has openly resorted to intervention in the internal affairs of the African States in order to safeguard its own interests.\n30.\tFurthermore, Africa is being subjected to persistent interference by foreign Powers which are sowing the seeds of dissension and disunity among our peoples in an attempt to widen and increase internal differences, stem the tide of African solidarity and suppress the aspirations and hopes of the African peoples for unity and fraternity. For that reason, the OAU, realizing that this intervention constitutes a direct threat to the very survival of the African peoples and their systems, has continued to monitor with concern and dismay the deteriorating situation resulting from the increasing foreign intervention in the internal affairs of the continent.\n31.\tThe Khartoum summit meeting strongly condemned all policies of intervention in African affairs, whatever their source, since such policies would turn the continent into a battlefield, the effect of which would be the destruction of the socio-economic structures, leading ultimately to opening wide the door for the return of the colonialists.\n32.\tThe meeting also reiterated the established African conviction that African security and peace are contingent on the strict observance of the principles of self-determination, independence, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, the rights of all peoples to protect their national borders, the settlement of disputes through peaceful means, and the illegality of the annexation of lands by the use of force.\n33.\tThe OAU Assembly at Khartoum took full cognisance of the established fact that the solution of African problems is the responsibility of the Africans themselves. African determination and wisdom have seen the continent through many a difficult time before. It was in this spirit of revolutionary determination that the Khartoum Assembly adopted a resolution on the establishment of a common African contingent for the purpose of protecting the independence of member States and their sovereignty over their respective territories, and ensuring the total liberation of the African continent from the remaining pockets of colonialism and racism [see A/33/235, annex I, resolution CM/Res.635 (XXXI)]. The summit gathering also decided that this military force should be conceptually and administratively African and be deployed by African decision under the banner and in accordance with the principles and objectives of the OAU. That resolution emphasizes the seriousness and determination of the Khartoum summit meeting to seek the enhancement and consolidation of the unity, solidarity and strength of the organization. In that connexion, the summit meeting created conciliation and arbitration committees, as well as machinery for the containment of disputes.\n34.\tThe past year in the life of our organization has seen sincere and relentless African efforts demonstrating the ability of the African continent to solve its problems without foreign interference or pressure. The African wisdom which characterized the efforts of African leaders such as Senghor, Houphoufit-Boigny, Sekou Toure and Tolbert was a demonstration of the effectiveness and authenticity of the African approach to solving the problems of the continent and one of the factors that contributed to the success of the Khartoum summit meeting.\n35.\tThe Sudan is the cauldron in which the Arab and African civilizations converged and synthesized in wonderful harmony, complementarity and integration. Although our geographical position contributed to the achievement of this harmony and complementarity, it was not the only factor involved. What attracted Arabs to Africa was a long history of cultural relations and interactions that produced flourishing civilizations in the heart of Africa, such as the civilizations of Timbuktu, Benin and Meroe. Hence, afterwards, both Africans and Arabs were subjected to similar colonialist conditions, characterized by barbarous entities based on racism and racial discrimination seeking to replace the indigenous population. The unity of the African-Arab struggle was a natural and logical result of those difficult conditions that characterized the history of the Arab and African peoples.\n36.\tThe African-Arab Conference held in Cairo in March 1977  represented a landmark in this common fight. That\nConference reinforced the sense of solidarity and laid the basis for co-operation in the political and economic fields which enjoyed the support of Arab and African peoples throughout successive meetings and led to the establishment of a number of economic and social institutions, structures and organizations which uphold and strengthen this solidarity.\n37.\tNaturally, this African-Arab solidarity, which presents a solid front and is a major pillar of the international liberation movement, provoked the forces of racism and colonialism on our African continent and in Palestine discreetly to co-ordinate their efforts and to join hands with the forces of darkness in what came to be known as the Pretoria-Salisbury-Tel Aviv axis.\n38.\tSufficient proof of this is contained in what Mr. Robert' Mugabe, the co-leader of the Zimbabwean Patriotic Front, conveyed to the Khartoum Assembly, namely, that Uzi machine-guns made in Israel found their way into the hands of the forces of the JV regimes fighting the liberation movements.\n39.\tThe Khartoum summit meeting was also a crowning of United Nations efforts to combat racism and racial discrimination and a continuation of its meetings during the United Nations Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, which started with the Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia,  the Conference for Action against Apartheid\u00ab and the recent Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination,  which was held following the Khartoum summit meeting.\n40.\tAfrica, which had instinctively been aware, since the beginning of its awakening, of the-organic relationship between Israel and the racist regimes in the southern part of the continent and had discovered the essential nature of those regimes, once again affirmed that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination which should be denounced and condemned by the international community.\n41.\tOur continent has continued to stress the fact that the problem of Palestine is the core of the present conflict in the Middle East, and that the persistence of Israel in occupying Palestine, its refusal to acknowledge the national and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, if persistence in following a policy of expansion based on racism and challenging the international community in utter disregard of the Charter of the United Nations and of Universal Declaration of Human Rights, constitute, in our view, a direct and very clear threat to international peace and security. At the same time, the persistence of Israel in continuing its occupation of the Arab territories, including holy Jerusalem, and in following a policy of colonial settlement in the occupied Arab territories further complicates the situation, which could lead to an armed conflagration in the region that might eventually develop into a global conflict, the dimensions of which cannot be perceived or envisaged by the human mind.\n42.\tThe establishment of a permanent peace in the region can only be achieved through the solution of both of these outstanding problems at the same time. In this respect, I have to emphasize that it will not be possible to attempt to solve either of the two problems in isolation from the other. The meeting in Khartoum, in conformity with the other African meetings which preceded it, was especially conscious of the fact that the intransigence of Israel constitutes the stumbling-block to the attainment of a just and permanent peace in the region. It is therefore imperative that all forms of pressure be exerted on Israel by the international community, primarily by the adoption of effective measures to implement the provisions of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The international community is therefore called upon to take all the necessary steps to support and consolidate the Palestinian cause by extending the necessary and effective material assistance to the Palestinian Liberation Organization in its capacity as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The international community is also called upon to condemn and reject the changes introduced by the Zionist entity in the region to change its physical, demographic, economic, cultural and religious structure. Africa has confirmed its determination to participate positively and effectively in observing 29 November; of each year as an International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, and calls upon all peace-loving people of the world to support the just struggle of this heroic people to recover its territory and the right to return to its homeland.\n43.\tThe just peace that is so necessary for our world today is a complicated matter, but it can still be achieved through our persistent determination, effort and constructive dialogue in an atmosphere of confidence and hope. This Organization has studied the Middle East question more than once and has adopted several resolutions, including Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which form the basis for peace and set out the minimum rights of the Palestinian people.\n44.\tWe have heard of the initiative undertaken by the President of the United States, Mr. Carter, at the Camp David meeting and this is something that we must welcome from the point of view of principle, because it is an historical attempt to secure pa ace in the region. While we do not attempt to evaluate the results' of that attempt, whether positive or negative, we believe that we should not jump to conclusions in evaluating them or undermine that initiative. We should undertake a thorough and positive study and analysis of those resets in the light of like resolutions adopted by the United Nations and the Arab summit conferences. We should also throw light on the positive elements of that initiative so that it may be seen as a basis and a pillar for the attempts of others to achieve peace. We should not deviate from our main objective, which is a just and durable peace in the Middle East.\n45.\tThe time has come for the OAU to play a more active role in global development efforts and in combating the social and economic problems from which the countries of the third world continue to suffer. If that organization has not addressed itself fully to these issues over the past IS years, it is not because of a lack of interest or a belittling of the importance of this vital sector, but rather because it had to direct all its attention and apply all its abilities to combating colonialism and supporting liberation movements until colonialism had shrank to the remaining three pockets in the southern part of our continent.\n46.\tNotwithstanding what I have just said, the African group of States participated within the Group of 77 in advocating the need to change the structural form of the prevailing economic relations, which is characterized by an aspect of economic and commercial hegemony by the developed industrial countries over the resources of a majority of third-world countries. Consequently, it. is important that this imbalance in the international economic field be corrected by introducing an element of balance and compatibility as between developed and developing countries. A number of resolutions have been adopted in the respective international organizations which constitute an acknowledgement on the part of developed countries of the dimensions of the problem facing the developing world. Unfortunately, this acknowledgement has not been followed by the necessary implementation of those resolutions. Furthermore, the developed countries were not able to honour their commitment in the respective international bodies to provide the new international economic order with an opportunity to prove its viability in correcting the imbalance which characterizes the international economic system. The positive resolutions which were adopted in  the interest of the developing countries concerning debts, the common fund for commodities, the special fund for the least developed countries, which emanated from the Paris dialogue between the North and South,  besides not measuring up to our expectations, were\nnot implemented positively by the industrial countries.\n\n47.\tI wish to declare on behalf of Africa our complete commitment to the resolutions of the sixth special session of the General Assembly, in that we are left with no alternative but to change the prevailing international economic order and consequently to implement the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S- VI)].\n48.\tWe have suffered in Africa, and we continue to suffer from many dangers that loom over our development programmes, mainly because the economies of the African countries depend in the first instance on their exports of raw materials. These exports lack the very much needed stability and fairness in prices to such an extent that, unless they are protected from the serious fluctuations that characterize their markets, our country, along with other third-world countries, will continue to move in a vicious circle. It is our sincere hope in Africa that the developed industrial countries will eventually be prevailed upon to put an end to this state of affairs by honouring their commitment in respect of the establishment of the common fund advocated by UNCTAD. We look forward with much interest to the convening of the second negotiating conference for the common fund,  which is due to take place in Geneva next November, and we earnestly hope that the participants will be able to reach final results and that the industrial countries will at last assume their responsibilities by approaching and dealing with the economic problems of the third world in a positive manner.\n49.\tAfrica is largely composed of a great number of the least developed countries that typically suffer from the burden of foreign indebtedness, which is further aggravated as a result of the growing complexity and the impact the servicing of these debts entails\u2014to the extent that in some cases our countries have to devote half of their foreign- exchange earnings to this aspect. We believe that the time has come to take immediate action to alleviate the burden of these debts and to set up organizational machinery that would comprehensively deal with the various aspects of this problem.\n50.\tIn their persistent striving towards a better future the developing and the least developed countries of Africa have committed themselves to plans for economic and social development, to which they have devoted most of their capabilities and limited resources in order to emerge from the stage of backwardness and to be able to meet the aspirations of their peoples in freedom and pride. This, we believe, entails a moral responsibility on the developed and industrialized countries to participate directly and effectively in the development of those poor countries. In this respect I should like to express our appreciation and gratitude to those countries that offer developmental aid in the size and volume recommended by the United Nations. I take this opportunity to appeal to the developed industrialized countries and capital-exporting oil countries that contribute to the resources of IDA in the IBRD. On the occasion of the current annual meeting in Washington, I appeal to them to initiate urgent negotiations on providing the sixth replenishment to the resources of the IDA. We consider this of special importance for the poor and least developed countries because of IDA's appropriate and easy terms. I al 3 call upon those countries this time to increase their contributions to an extent that would reasonably meet the requirements of those poor countries in soft loans needed to develop and promote their economies and to establish the economic structural set-up to spare them the stiff conditions of the money market, which they cannot afford to bear.\n51.\tAfrica believes it has a duty towards the rest of the world of advocating that the key to progress and development lies in the realization of a great deal of self-reliance both individually and collectively. Africa is firmly convinced that it is imperative that the countries of the third world consolidate their respective national self-reliance, at the same time striving to lessen their collective dependence on others. With this understanding Africa is looking forward with great optimism to taking part in the deliberations of the forthcoming fifth session of UNCTAD to be held in Manila next year. Meanwhile we shall try to rally our fellow members in the Group of 77 around this central point at the forthcoming meetings of the Group to take place in Arusha, United Republic of Tanzania, prior to the Manila Conference.\n52.\tReference to international development will remain devoid of any meaning or impact if we fail o link it integrally with the pathetic reality faced by our contemporary world, in which poverty, hunger and disease continue to prevail at the very time when expenditure on armaments continues to grow at an astronomical rate. Large resources are wasted on armaments, resources that would better be directed towards the cause of international development and raising the standard of living of the human race as a whole. We believe that the convening last June of the tenth special session of the General Assembly on disarmament, which was the culmination of the efforts and initiatives of the non-aligned movement, constituted a step in the right direction since it highlighted the international awareness of the magnitude and dimensions of the armaments race and drew the attention of world public opinion to the danger posed by continuation of this serious situation. Although the decisions adopted by the special session on disarmament fell short of our expectations, it is our considered opinion that the moral support and momentum it created should provide us with the incentive and drive to generate maximum efforts in pursuit of these definitive objectives: first, negotiation and completion of a general and comprehensive agreement to ban all kinds of nuclear tests; secondly, the adherence of all countries to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; and, thirdly, the establishment of nuclear-free zones.\n53.\tAfrica earnestly hopes that the new Committee on Disarmament that Was set up at the tenth special session will be able to follow up implementation of the resolution adopted at the special session [resolution S-10/2]. It welcomes with enthusiasm the establishment of a new negotiating body in which all nuclear Powers and a number of non-nuclear Powers will participate on the basis of equality.\n54.\tPermit me to reiterate that Africa's confidence in the United Nations is unlimited and that its determination to support and' strengthen it is firm and unwavering in recognition of the Organization's role in providing the vital moral and material support to the continent's struggle against colonialism and racism. On behalf of the African peoples I should like to reiterate from this rostrum our pledge to spare no effort in supporting the United Nations in upholding its lofty principles and ideals, in the process antagonizing whoever antagonizes or undermines it, and rallying to whoever shares with us this attitude of devotion and gratitude. Guided by the content and spirit of our Organization's resolutions, our delegations will participate in the work of this session bearing in mind the principles of the United Nations Charter in a spirit of generous devotion.\n55.\tIf Africa draws attention to the fact that its representation in the Organization's Secretariat is inadequate compared to its numerical weight, it is only to emphasize its desire to be at the service of this Organization and to shoulder its responsibilities towards it. This spirit is very evident in the resolution adopted by the last African summit, which was held in my country's capital and commended and expressed appreciation to the Secretariat of the United Nations, under the leadership of the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, for having selected one of the sons of our sister country Ghana, Mr. Kenneth Dadzie, for the post of Director-General for Development and International Economic Co-operation [see A/33/235, annex 1, resolution CM/Res.652 (XXX)]. The resolution also paid a tribute to the capabilities and qualifications of Mr. Dadzie and his devotion to his responsibilities, which it considered a great honour to Africa and its sons.\n56.\tAt the same time the. Khartoum summit meeting recognized and supported the United Republic of Tanzania's nomination of one of its sons for the post of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, and expressed its hope that this auspicious choice would meet with the blessing of the international community [ibid., resolution CM/ Res.626 (XXXI)]. Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim, the Permanent Representative of the United Republic of Tanzania to the United Nations, is one of the illustrious sons of our generous continent in whose hands lies the fulfilment of Africa's expectations and aspirations, and those of the world in general. I need not introduce him as the Assembly, I am certain, is well aware of his knowledge, experience and competence as regards the work and business of this Organization.\n57.\tAs I reflect here on the history of my country and its place in Africa, through which it has been privileged to share a deeply-rooted heritage and civilization, I recall our conviction that words, whether designating conduct or a decision, were an effective weapon among the various weapons we deployed in our struggle for freedom and emancipation. This is particularly true in a gathering such as this since words are still considered by Africa to be a highly effective and powerful factor in shaping the destinies of our individuals and groups.\n58.\tThe responsibility we recognize to participate effectively in the successive sessions of this Assembly will continue to be influenced by the reflections of the past and our experience in this Organization, which produced much evidence of the inherent ability to achieve success in every endeavour whenever good will and confidence exist.\n59.\tIt is my considered belief that nothing surpasses the greatness of commitment to the principles of freedom, equality and respect for the common interests of the peoples of the world. Consequently persistent and progressive efforts towards the development and consolidation of international solidarity have become a prerequisite for overcoming the obstacles facing the peoples in this decade of the twentieth century, characterized as it is by numerous preoccupations, worries and uncertainties regarding a series of complex and intricate problems. I see no way of overcoming those problems other than by positive action and constructive optimism.\n60.\tI am very confident that the statements of the representatives of the peoples of the world delivered in this hall will continue to guide our deliberations at this session, for they are the expression of the conscience of their peoples and of the real worries and preoccupations of the human race.\n61.\tI should like to praise all the constructive efforts which have emanated from the ideas expressed in this hall and which have proved to carry weight and be effective. I sincerely pray that the Almighty God will guide us towards the achievement of the goals of our peoples and that He will preserve those who are behind every endeavour aimed at the establishment of a new world order based on equality, international co-operation and peaceful coexistence.\n62.\tIn the interest of international peace let us all remember that, while our common interests may contribute greatly to guaranteeing peaceful coexistence, our hopes will never get us to our destination unless they arc augmented by equal and sustained effort by all.\n63.\tThank you, brothers, and thank you, Mr. President, and may peace go with you on your path.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff129.\t\n\n\n\n\n130.\tMr. President, the message which the People's Republic of Mozambique wishes to address to this Assembly is the message of struggle: struggle which has been imposed on us by the persistence within our borders of aggressive colonialist and racist regimes; struggle for the affirmation of our independence, our militant internationalism, our dignity and our African personality; struggle for the elimination of the vestiges of colonial exploitation and for the reconstruction of our ravaged country; struggle against the encirclement imposed by imperialism.\n131.\tWe shall therefore be devoting particular attention to live positions of the People's Republic of Mozambique concerning the problems of southern Africa and the fight against colonialism, racism and imperialism. These positions of ours are dictated by our loyalty to the cause of the liberation of oppressed peoples  by our firmness in the affirmation of our revolutionary ideals in the service of peace, progress and the well-being of mankind,\n132.\tThe existing circumstances in southern Africa are a source of great concern to the People's Republic of Mozambique and constitute a serious threat to international peace and security: Those circumstances stem from the colonial situation which prevails in Zimbabwe and Namibia, the oppression exercised by the minority racist regimes and the unbridled exploitation of the resources of those countries by capitalism and imperialism.\n133.\tMinority and racist regimes in southern Africa have always enjoyed the support of imperialist Powers. However, thanks to the success of the armed liberation struggles we haw witnessed in that area an offensive by means of initiatives-said to be in the cause of peace\u2014whereby those same Powers seek, if not to rescue these regimes, at least to preserve their political and economic domination.\n134.\tWe must be clear: the proposals and initiatives of the imperialist Powers are aimed fundamentally at eliminating the armed struggle for national liberation, because imperialism, after its defeat in Mozambique and Angola and after the establishment of people's democracies in those two countries, has learned the lesson of the consequences of a prolonged people's war.\n135.\tIn order to attain its ends, imperialism resorts to a wide variety, of means. It seeks to divide the liberation movements and the African countries, particularly the front-line States; it tries to represent the national liberation struggle as a racial war between black and white; and, on the pretext of contributing to peace, it undertakes activities which reek of racism and are aimed exclusively at perpetuating and consolidating its hegemony.\n136.\tIn Zimbabwe imperialism is pursuing with diabolical perseverance a policy which offers two solutions, one internal and the other international, both always available and ready to be used when the time comes either to neutralize international action which might bring about a solution or to save the situation when the progress of a national liberation struggle indicates that there is an impending victory over the minority regimes.\n137.\tIt is in this context that we should analyse the so-called agreement on internal settlement\\\" and the Anglo-American proposals.\n138.\tIn a recent statement that will be distributed as a United Nations document the President of the People's Republic of Mozambique, Samora Moises Machel, exposed in detail the skilful operation stage-managed by the imperialist Powers. This document indicates how imperialism wishes to preserve the political and economic structures of colonial capitalism in Zimbabwe; how imperialism is aiming at encouraging conflicts between the front-line countries and sowing confusion within the ranks of the OAU; and how it is trying to misrepresent +he national liberation struggle as a civil war and is inventing pretexts on which to intervene militarily in our region.\n139.\tIn the meantime, the odious Ian Smith regime survives and seeks to recruit accomplices for its massacres, hangings and acts of aggression perpetrated against peaceful neighbouring States.\n140.\tThe imperialist world exhibits the greatest possible indifference to the daily murders of defenceless people, political prisoners and nationalist fighters. But the death of a single white man is sufficient to arouse tremendous agitation and give rise to threats of intervention.\n141.\tFurthermore, the greatest possible scorn is evinced as regards-the. international community. We should like to remind this Assembly that the United Kingdom encouraged meetings of the Security Council and that a resident commissioner and a military commander of United Nations forces have been designated, for Rhodesia, But where are they and what are they being used for?\n142.\tFurthermore, we are well aware of the correctness of the intentions underlying the appeal to the international community, but who set the example of the violation of sanctions against the rebel regime of Ian Smith? Who organized the conditions and made it possible for petrol to continue to flow into the Rhodesian economy?\n143.\tThese stakes of imperialism, the advances and. the retreats, the apparent indecision, particularly on the part of the colonial Power, represent direct support for the minority, racist and illegal regime of Ian Smith in his war against the people of Zimbabwe and the neighbouring States.\n144.\tIn the various proposals that have hitherto been made known with a view to bringing about a solution it is possible to discern certain constants that indicate to us the imperialist manoeuvres against Zimbabwe. The proposals and solutions are always represented as initiatives for bringing about a peaceful settlement of the question of Zimbabwe without ever taking account of the progress of the armed struggle and refusing to establish any cause-and- effect relationship between that struggle and the proposals;. Those proposals seek to legitimize the Ian Smith regime and hence to maintain the power structure and the economic and social privileges of the privileged minorities, thus catering for the interests of the settlers without evincing the slightest concern for the rights and interests of the people of Zimbabwe, According to those proposals, independence flows from an act of concession on the part of either the colonial Power or Smith's rebel regime, but never from anything done by the people of Zimbabwe. The proposals always introduce alien elements into the Zimbabwean process\u2014in particular, South Africa, which has suddenly become a decisive element in the agreements proposed.\n145.\tThe People's Republic of Mozambique is keenly aware that all these manoeuvres are not only aimed at perpetuating fee domination and exploitation of the people of Zimbabwe but are also directed against the independence and success of the Mozambican revolution.\n146.\tConstant acts of aggression on the part of the minority racist regime of Ian Smith against our Republic, against the neighbouring peoples and against the economic objectives of four countries have found appropriate response from our people's defence and security forces.\n147.\tWe should here like to pay a tribute to the friendly African and to the socialist countries, which alone, with resolution 411 (1977) adopted by the Security Council on 30 June 1977, have supported the strengthening of our country's defence capacity.\n148.\tNothing can divert us from consistency of principle and our internationalism, and we should like to reaffirm the steadfast support of the People's Republic of Mozambique for the people \u00a9f Zimbabwe In their aimed national liberation struggle under the leadership of their sole and authentic representative, the Patriotic Front,\n149.\tAs President Samora Moises Machel said in the statement I have already mentioned:\n\\\"We reject the theory that claims armed struggle and negotiation to be mutually exclusive, to be contradictions in the process of national liberation. \n\nWe do not like war, but we realize that when the contradiction is unsolvable, war is the only solution to bring about peace. \n\n150.\tit is high time for the imperialism to understand that it can no longer dupe us, that we will no longer allow ourselves to be misled. The Powers which have assumed responsibilities, particularly the Power that has colonized Southern Rhodesia, should clarify their position and choose possible terms for the only true solution. In other words, they should either participate in the process of genuine and immediate independence or openly declare that they have assumed and adopted the positions of the racist and illegal Smith regime.\n151.\tImperialism is repeating in Namibia the procedures and manoeuvres that it practices in Zimbabwe. There again South Africa has been allowed, in flagrant defiance of the international community, to prevent the genuine Independence of the country.\n152.\tThe so-called willingness of South Africa to negotiate has now been completely exposed with the decision announced by Vorster to reject the proposals made in the Secretary-General's report to the Security Council and to continue with his own plan for an internal solution.\n153.\tIn fact, if we look back at the events that led to the Vorster declaration, there can be no doubt as to the bad faith of the so-called willingness to negotiate on fee part of South Africa. Throughout all these months South Africa has continued to raise new obstacles in an attempt to prevent the emergence of a solution to the problem of Namibia, whether by trying to make SWAPO responsible for any possible failure in negotiations or by invoking absurd rights to Walvis Bay or by having recourse to the pretext of the evolution of the liberation struggle to threaten rupture. In the meantime, South Africa has reinforced and .consolidated its military arrangements and has prepared plans for conceding a puppet independence.\n154.\tThe question of Namibia has reached a point where prompt, energetic and decisive action by the international (community is necessary.. The five Western States members of the Security Council must discharge their responsibilities in the process leading to the independence of Namibia. The international community and the Security Council must ensure that the racist regime of Pretoria does not go unpunished and should take the necessary measures to make irreversible the process already begun, which will bring true independence to the Namibian people.\n155.\tWe wish to pay a tribute to the struggle of the Namibian people, led by its sole legitimate representative, SWAPO, and to the victories they have won. We reaffirm here the support of the People's Republic of Mozambique for SWAPO and the Namibian people in their struggle for their just aspirations to sovereignty and complete independence.\n156.\tTo speak of the situation in southern Africa is tantamount to speak also of the situation of oppression, poverty and humiliation into which the vast majority of the people of South Africa has been plunged.\n157.\tThe minority and racist regime of South Africa is committing the gravest possible crimes against mankind and against the South African people: it threatens, invades and attacks neighbouring countries, defies the decisions of the international community, and thus constitutes a threat to world peace and security.\n158.\tThe existence of the cruel and inhumane policy of repression and discrimination of South Africa is an outrage not only to the peoples of South Africa but also to all the peoples of the world who love peace, liberty and democracy.\n159.\tThe long struggle of the South African people for dignity and respect for the human person merits our profound admiration and calls for condemnation and constant support so that the degrading system of apartheid may be finally eliminated.\n160.\tOn behalf of the People's Republic of Mozambique and its delegation, we should like to pay a tribute to the President and to congratulate him on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We wish also to pay a tribute, through him, to the Colombian people, who, like us, lived through a long night of colonial domination, against which they waged a victorious struggle.\n161.\tYesterday as today, our peoples, the peoples of Africa and Latin America, were united in a single effort to put an end to imperialist domination and exploitation. The concern which the President expressed at the opening of our session regarding the establishment of a new international economic order which would be just and advantageous to our peoples is a guarantee that economic problems will be among the priorities of the United Nations and that we shall be devoting our efforts to achieving significant progress in the solution of those problems.\n162.\tWe should also like to associate ourselves with previous speakers in congratulating our friend, Lazar Mojsov, the outgoing President of the General Assembly, on the wisdom and far-sightedness with which he conducted our proceedings. During his term of office, sessions of great importance took place for the political and economic liberation of peoples and for the peace and security of the world. His election constituted a tribute to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and a victory for the non-aligned movement, with which the name of Yugoslavia is intimately linked.\n163.\tThe People's Republic of Mozambique, having emerged victorious over the age-old domination of Portuguese colonialism, is gratified at the independence of Solomon Islands and congratulates that State on its admission to the community of States Members of the United Nations.\n164.\tThe independence of Solomon Islands is an encouragement for all peoples still under colonial domination in the Pacific region; it gives a new momentum to the irreversible march of peoples struggling for their liberation and total emancipation from the colonial yoke.\n165.\tColonialism and imperialism, the prime enemies of the peoples of the world that love peace and freedom, are not present in southern Africa alone.\n166.\tAn alarming situation of conflict also exists in the north of our continent, where the people of Western Sahara are continuing their difficult fight against attempts at the annexation and partition of their territory. We denounce most vehemently the expansionist designs which are a most flagrant violation of the principles of the Charters of the United Nations and of the OAU.\n167.\tWe cannot pass over this struggle in silence unless we wish to run the risk of becoming accomplices of the colonialist schemes of foreign domination. Today the dimension of the struggle being waged in the Sahara is a subject of concern within the international community.\n168.\tThe victories which have been won, politically and militarily, by the Saharan people and the revolutionary avant garde Frente P0LISARIO deserve our admiration and make it incumbent upon the United Nations to assume responsibility for implementing its principles, particularly that of the recognition of the right to self-determination and independence of colonized peoples.\n169.\tWithin the same context of problems regarding the annexation of territory by violence, there is the question of East Timor, where the occupation of the country and the cruel genocide of the Maubere people still continues.\n170.\tThe People's Republic of Mozambique appeals to the international community to demonstrate its support and solidarity with the Maubere people in their struggle under the leadership of FRETILIN,  and also to reaffirm their right to self-determination and national independence.\n171.\tIn the Middle East, imperialist intervention has gained fresh momentum and divisive manoeuvres are increasing with the clear objective of destroying the liberation movement and the fight for emancipation of the Arab peoples. Imperialism, faithful as always to its strategy, wishes to perpetuate the exploitation of the peoples of that region and to ensure control of its resources and communication lines.\n172.\tBy dodging the solution of the fundamental questions of the Middle East, imperialism is accentuating the instability there and creating conditions conducive to increased suffering and destruction. Lebanon is a tragic example of this.\n173.\tBy fomenting conflicts between the Arab States and seeking to isolate progressive forces, imperialism will enjoy the transient illusion of having been successful. But until the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to a free, sovereign and independent fatherland under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, its sole legitimate representative, is implemented, and until the territory occupied by force in 1967 is returned, there will be no true peace in the Middle East.\n174.\tIn Korea and in Cyprus, division and the presence of military forces persist. We reaffirm our whole-hearted support for the Korean people and the people of Cyprus in their just struggle for the restoration of their unity and territorial integrity.\n175.\tWe should like, to draw the attention of States Members of the United Nations and of all peace-loving forces to the fact that as part of a new strategy, imperialism is setting up more and more military bases in the Indian Ocean, thus creating a dangerous situation in the area. Thus the occupation of the island of Mayotte continues and a mercenary coup has been carried out in the Comoros. All this falls within the plan of action of imperialism for the recolonizing of Africa.\n176.\tThe OAU, the non-aligned movement and the United Nations have adopted several resolutions reiterating the need to keep the Indian Ocean free of foreign military bases to ensure international peace and security. The People's Republic of Mozambique vigorously condemns the establishment of new military bases and demands the dismantling of those already in existence.\n177.\tWe are living at a time when the progressive forces and the forces of socialism are winning remarkable successes. However, while, on the one hand, thanks to the courageous struggle of the peoples, such progress has been made, on the other hand, ever more subtle and more perfidious manoeuvres are being resorted to in order to ensure domination and exploitation, in flagrant violation of the most elementary human rights, and in flagrant defiance of the deepest and most just aspirations of peoples.\n178.\tImperialism is embarking upon concentrated acts of interference, which are nothing but a form of aggression against our peoples, and an attempt to keep us under constant domination, in a state of economic dependence and of social and cultural alienation.\n179.\tThese interventionist actions are not only exemplified by attempts at destabilizing newly-independent countries, but are also taking place within organizations to which the majority of the developing countries belong.\n180.\tIn accordance with its new tactics imperialism is resorting to economic pressure on countries where penetration has proved difficult, in order to provoke economic, financial and social instability.\n181.\tDemands by the developing countries for the establishment of more just and equitable economic relations are not new.\n182.\tFrom Bandung to Buenos Aires, the developing countries have not ceased to put forward concrete proposals and feasible programmes of action with a view to defining and implementing international economic relations of a new type which will make possible the elimination of poverty, of the exploitation of man by man, of injustice and of domination.\n183.\tWhen the developing countries call for the establishment of a new international economic order, they do so as an expression of their political will and of their determination to free themselves on the basis of principles of national and collective autonomy that will reduce their dependence on the developed countries.\n184.\tIn the present world economic context, international economic relations continue to be dominated by the same dialectic, with the result that the poor countries become ever poorer and the rich countries richer. Exploitation is carried out continuously in the developing countries in the most diverse and sophisticated forms.\n185.\tCapitalist countries never tire of preparing long studies and inventories of the debts of the developing countries and making projections of. the amount of these debts in future years, but so far we have not seen in these studies any accounting for the total sums involved in the exploitation carried out by the developed countries in the developing countries..\n186.\tThe conclusions to be drawn from the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris in 1977 and from the so-called North-South dialogue are more than obvious, as are the embarrassing results so far achieved.\n187.\tThis situation of deadlock cannot go on. That is why we consider it necessary, even essential, that immediate resolutions should be adopted in the light of proposals made by the developing countries on economic questions, international trade, monetary matters, the development of productive forces and international co-operation.\n188.\tThe present situation of dependence and economic exploitation, together with the specific problems inherent in each of our countries, can only curb the progress of our respective economies.\t.\n189.\tWith regard to our specific case, the economy of the People's Republic of Mozambique has suffered great losses as a result of its application of sanctions against the British colony of Southern Rhodesia in compliance with a decision of the international community. The situation has been aggravated by the fact that the racist forces of Salisbury have massacred our people and undermined our economy. All this has made it necessary for us to establish other priorities, with the grave consequences that entails.\n190.\tCalamitous floods have sorely afflicted our country and made difficult the accomplishment of our development plans and projects.\n191.\tIn certain cases our requests to the international community for aid have met with a response, but that response has not always measured up to what we might legitimately have expected, as a result of our efforts to apply the embargo imposed by the United Nations upon the British colony of Southern Rhodesia.\n192.\tOne of the essential objectives of our policy in the economic and social field is satisfying at all times the fundamental needs of our people in accordance with the level of development of our productive forces.\n.282. Immediately following the achievement of independence, the People's Republic of Mozambique initiated certain measures to cope with the serious situation of the time, measures which later created conditions for the application of our course of development.\n283. Thus began the process of recovery of the land and the collectivization of life and production in the countryside, where the greatest concentration of manpower and of our principal resources is to be found. We also developed communal villages in order to improve the living conditions of our people and socialize productive relations. Important measures have been taken in the economic field which has made it possible for our Party and Government to exercise more effective control over the economic sectors.\n284.\tAt the same time, by the socialization of education and health, fundamental progress has been achieved for the well-being of our people.\n285.\tIn order to emerge from a state of under-development we have been drawing on the revolutionary experience acquired during the armed liberation struggle and we seek to pursue our development by adopting solutions of and for the people.\n286.\tThe growing, but gradual and balanced, socialization and mechanization of agriculture, the promotion of the development of our natural resources, the creation of conditions for the establishment of heavy industry and the consolidation of the role of the State in the economy at this stage constitute the bases for the building of socialism.\n287.\tUntil independence was proclaimed, the key sectors of our economy were controlled by international financial groups and the existing infrastructure essentially served the interests of neighbouring racist regimes. All the established colonial machinery favoured the export of profits and the provision of outlets for surplus production. Our country was fundamentally serving as a producer of primary commodities and a consumer of finished products, a fact which served only to promote the accumulation of international capital and to intensify our commercial and technological dependence.\n288.\tIn view of the situation we inherited from colonial and Fascist domination and consequently the concrete conditions in which our present struggle for national reconstruction is taking place, international co-operation is proving of the greatest importance.\n289.\tWithin the sphere of technical and economic cooperation, the People's Republic of Mozambique has already had some rich and fruitful experiences, particularly with African countries and with socialist countries. That co-operation takes place on the basis of equality and mutual advantage, and in relations of peaceful coexistence, of respect for sovereignty, and of non-interference in the internal affairs of any of the parties concerned. Those conditions are fundamental if co-operation is genuinely to achieve its objective: socio-economic development.\n290- Our relations of co-operation with regional and international organizations and those with capitalist countries also respect those conditions.\n291.\tWith the developing countries our co-operation represents the union of our forces in order to face the economic imbalance we inherited from imperialism.\n292.\tOur ties are those of our former subjection to exploitation and the pillaging of our natural resources. This is the tradition and the common experience of resistance and struggle, against colonialist-capitalist domination. We are united in the defence of our peoples and countries against external attempts to establish neo-colonialism and new forms of domination and exploitation.\n293.\tSuch co-operation is particularly necessary from the standpoint of our economic and social situation and also from that of the economic and financial phase through which the international community is at present passing.\n294.\tAs a means of overcoming those difficulties which we, the developing countries, suffer at present, day after day, the concerting of common efforts and the creation of a united front will make our just struggle for the implementation of more equitable international economic relations ever more productive.\n295.\tWithin this context, we are pleased with the action that we, the developing countries, have taken with the aim of preserving experience, expertise and national capacity for the service of all of us as well as for our mutual development and for expanding this regional co-operation to the international level.\n296.\tWe are gratified also at the results recently achieved at the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries and we are sure that this will mark a new stage in co-operation. We are sure that this Assembly will unanimously adopt the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and Implementing Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries and that every effort will be made to find appropriate machinery for the application of that plan.\n297.\tWhile on the one hand we can take pleasure in the progress achieved by developing countries in their will and determination to see their economic and social development problems resolved, progress at the international level is jeopardized by the policies of imperialism, by the attitude of the industrialized and capitalist countries in their systematic refusal to comply with the conditions necessary for the establishment of a new international economic order.\n298.\tThe capitalist countries are striving to preserve rules and terms of trade which are advantageous to them in their attempts to consolidate their monopolies in the economies and the external trade of developing countries. But the present system of international economic relations is disjointed and can no longer stand up to the constant pressure of the recently independent countries.\n299.\tThe strategy pursued by the imperialist Powers on the question of the restructuring of international economic relations is one of delaying and reducing the-numerous necessary changes, making only minor and individual concessions while representing them as privileges granted to the \\\"third world\\\", and avoiding the repetition of an open confrontation with developing countries similar to that which was set off by the petroleum-producing countries.\n300.\tThe capitalist countries are striving to preserve as\\\" long as possible the present basis of international economic relations. That is the kind of restructuring proposed by the imperialist States.\n301.\tSuch manoeuvres are aimed also at deterring the co-operation of developing countries with the socialist countries. In that way imperialism is attempting to ensure more stable conditions for the development of the capitalist economy and at the same time continuing to keep the countries of the former colonial periphery oriented towards the industrialized centres of the capitalist world.\n302.\tWith regard to the law of the sea, the imperialist Powers are once again opposing a decision of the international community, threatening to take unilateral measures with the aim of embarking right away on the exploitation of marine resources, thus frustrating the consensus of the negotiations which are under way.\n303.\tThe main concern of imperialist strategy consists in preventing the movement towards a new international economic order becoming a struggle against the foundations of imperialist exploitation. That is why the imperialist Powers are seeking to conduct the dialogue within the capitalist framework.\n304.\tThe international community is on the eve of the third development decade, which will soon begin. The progress we had hoped for has not been made in the achievement of the stages and the objectives we set ourselves.\n305.\tFaithful to the policy of the non-aligned movement and reaffirming its commitment to that movement, the People's Republic of Mozambique hopes that, in the defining of die strategy for the third development decade, the proposals formulated by that movement will be taken into account for the establishment of a new, just and equitable international economic order, based upon political independence, equality and economic justice, not forgetting that its fundamental objective is the accelerated development of the countries of the third world. Within this context, the adoption of appropriate measures to bring about true disarmament will make it possible to free vast resources which now are being wasted in the arms race and which could well be used for the benefit of the development of the developing countries. At the same time, it would contribute to international peace and security.\n306.\tWe have brought before this Assembly the expression of the main concerns of the People's Republic of Mozambique with regard to the major problems which affect the world. The paths leading to the liberation of man are arduous and difficult. But we are firmly convinced that with every passing day decisive progress will be achieved towards the transformation and improvement of the life of the peoples of the world and that only with the total commitment of the whole of mankind in the struggle for these just causes will it be possible to achieve new and glorious victories.\nThe struggle continues.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff87.\tMr. President, it is a particular pleasure for\nme, on behalf of the delegation of Guatemala to congratulate you most cordially on your election to the presidency of the thirty-third regular session of the General Assembly. The delegation of Guatemala is convinced that your election to so lofty a post is but the expression of the high value which the international community places on your great merits. We trust that your personal qualities, your experience in international affairs and your devotion to the ideals of the United Nations will be an effective guarantee that this world Assembly will successfully complete the important tasks entrusted to it, and to that end I offer you the complete co-operation of the delegation I lead.\n-88. My delegation wishes to place on record its appreciation to Mr. Lazar Mojsov for the efficient manner in which he guided the deliberations of the General Assembly during the past year.\n89.\tMay I also avail myself of this opportunity to express from this rostrum the appreciation of my Government for the effective, positive, devoted work performed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose dedication to duty, to the United Nations and its objectives, has been recognized by the international community.\n90.\tMy delegation, greets Solomon Islands on its admission to this Organization and we most warmly welcome this new State to the international community.\n91.\tAs the Governments of States Members of this Organization, represented here by high-ranking dignitaries, know, on 1 July last the new Government of Guatemala took office. The President is General Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia, who was sworn in to uphold the principles of democracy and defend freedom. The main goals set were the effective establishment of order and security on the basis of legality; the enjoyment of social justice, full employment and an equitable distribution of income; the organization of the people; the participation of women in national life; municipal and regional development; the national use, increase and conservation of renewable natural resources. These goals were set with a view to accelerating the balanced, integrated and harmonious development of the people of Guatemala.\n92.\tThe Government of Guatemala is deeply devoted to Central America. Accordingly, we maintain and cultivate brotherly relations of co-operation and solidarity with the other Governments and peoples of the area which constitute the Central American community, by proposing and supporting ways and means which may produce a total convergence of our aspirations so that in the future we may be able to re-establish the Great Motherland.\n93.\tWithin the region, the Government of Guatemala is making efforts to reactivate the integration process in Central America. The scheme needs to be given fresh life so that its results will be to the benefit of all Central Americans.\n94.\tI shall now refer to some items on our agenda, first to state in general terms the thinking of my country in the fields of international politics and economics and to define\nthe position of my Government in relation to both as a contribution to the work of this Assembly.\n95.\tOne of the basic principles of the international policy of the Government of Guatemala if to give full effect to universally recognized human rights, as well as to respect and guarantee their exercise. In my country, human rights are enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic itself and are part of the internal legal order of the country.\n96.\tObviously, at present the world is going through a delicate period in its history, characterized by a deterioration in human values, inflation, the alienation of sectors of the population, the constant impoverishment of large masses, the lack of satisfactory means of meeting their material and spiritual needs, sectarian intransigence and\npolitical intolerance. \n97.\tGiven that picture, the Government of Guatemala turns to this world forum with faith in the purposes and principles of the United Nations, aware that the attainment of its ideals continues to be the greatest commitment of and the optimum solution for our generation, in view of the challenge presented by tensions, injustice and international imbalances.\n98.\tRecognizing that universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is one of the primary objectives of the United Nations, and aware that those rights and freedoms are the subject of universal interest and concern, my Government offers its full co-operation in order that their observance and enjoyment may become a living reality.\n99.\tIf we are to make use of the enormous contribution of the United Nations, which proclaims the rules regarding human rights in terms of aspirations and guarantees, in terms of principles of political freedoms and economic and social justice, all Member States must apply those rules and respect the exercise of those rights by their citizens.\n100.\tIn conformity with that philosophy, in 1948 my Government approved the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. Recently we ratified a regional instrument of far-reaching importance in this field, the American Convention on Human Rights,8 which is known as the Pact of San Jose because it was signed in the capital of the sister Republic of Costa Rica. That instrument creates two bodies of great importance for the protection of human rights: one, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and, the other, the Inter-American Court on Human Rights. That is to say, there is not only a body for political monitoring but another for jurisdictional monitoring.\n101.\tIn this very Organization, the Government of Guatemala has for. some years now been supporting the idea of establishing the post of ombudsman or High Commissioner for Human Rights, to ensure their enjoyment throughout the world.\n102.\tMy Government wishes to guarantee Guatemalans conditions for a life of dignity that will enable them to develop and improve within a framework of legality and freedom so that all may enjoy the effective protection of good health, decent housing, broad social security coverage, access to all levels of education and the enjoyment of dignified working conditions-in a word, social justice. Thus our attitude of respect for human rights has always been consistent, both internally and internationally.\n103.\tThe present Government of Guatemala believes it essential to introduce a profound change in the approach to human rights so as to do away with any vestige of political or ideological intentions which so often distort and thwart the very impartiality on which they should be based. The Government of Guatemala wishes to place on record in this Assembly its deep respect for human rights and its firm support for the signature of international instruments that would make them universally applicable.\n104.\tMy Government is highly sympathetic to and is most pleased with the initiative of the Government of Costa Rica to the effect that the United Nations should decide to establish a peace university, and in this world forum we place on record our firm support for the location of that centre for higher studies in that sister nation.\n105.\tThere is no doubt that an institution of that kind, the fundamental purpose of which is to create an awareness of one of the highest values of human coexistence\u2014the establishment of world peace\u2014will be widely acclaimed and will enjoy the blessings of all Member States. My Government fully supports the praiseworthy proposal of the Government of Costa Rica to establish, within the United Nations framework, such a centre for study and research, designed to educate people for peace, which is the noblest objective of mankind.\n106.\tThe Government of Guatemala considers that terrorist acts which affect innocent victims are also-quite apart from the motives which lead to them\u2014an intolerable form of violation of human rights. So far the United Nations has not been able to establish effective procedures to solve this grave problem.\n107.\tFor several years the General Assembly has been dealing with the issue of international terrorism and the means to combat it. However, at the outset amendments were submitted to the very wording of the item in an effort, even before the debate began, to introduce the concept that the system of terror could be considered as a plausible political instrument. In my Government's view, that not only is unacceptable, but has prevented this Organization from taking any practical action against international terrorism.\n108.\tActually, the only effort to deal with this problem, which is of such vital importance, has been an almost academic debate on its definition and causes, as well as various procedural debates which have prevented an in-depth energetic consideration of the subject. The problem has not existed in this world Organization alone, since the highest regional American organization\u2014the Organization of American States [OAS] \u2014 has been unable to make\nprogress towards the signature of an international instrument against terrorism, despite the gravity of this complex, multifaceted problem.\n109.\tThe delegation of Guatemala considers that, in view of the difficulties in the way of signing a world convention to control international terrorism in all its forms, including its underlying causes it would be advisable, without prejudice to continued efforts at attaining this objective, to seek partial solutions designed to protect innocent victims, through the signing of instruments regulating specific aspects within the vast complexity of the subject of international terrorism. For that reason my delegation supports the extension of the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Taking of Hostages, set up by the Sixth Committee  at the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n110.\tThe delegation of Guatemala wishes to make it quite dear that respect for international law, which traditionally has prevailed in my country, makes us vigorously reject the claim that might is right or that extortion and indiscriminate violence can be acceptable instruments in international law.\n111.\tA few days ago, here at the United Nations, the resumed seventh regular session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea adjourned, leaving unresolved matters of great importance to ail nations of the world.\n112.\tGuatemala, like many developing countries, has a special interest in the elaboration of an adequately structured world convention of the law of the sea in as complete a. form as possible. My delegation believes that the convention should reflect tire just position of the developing countries, whose basic concept is the sovereignty of the coastal State over all resources in its exclusive economic zone extending to 200 nautical miles measured from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.\n113.\tMy country also subscribes to the principle, regarding the exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, that the natural resources existing therein are the common heritage of mankind and that, therefore, there must be an equitable distribution of the benefits to be derived from them. We also maintain that the international regime and machinery in connexion with Hid sea-bed must have sufficient and exclusive control powers over the exploration and exploitation of those resources.\n114.\tAs regards the problem of the reunification of Korea, the Government of Guatemala believes that the most desirable way to achieve a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula, is by a resumption of the dialogue between South and North Korea that has been broken off, so that by means of direct negotiations between the parties a solution to a conflict may be found. \n115. It is undeniable that the world economy has in recant years experienced a series of grave crises which have had serious effects, especially in the developing countries\nbecause of their greater vulnerability in general to external economic shocks.\n116. The developing countries have become a powerful factor and their influence is being felt in all spheres of international activity. This irreversible change in the balance of power in the world makes it necessary to have the active, full participation, on a footing of equality, of the developing countries in the formulation and implementation of all decisions which are of interest to the international community.\n117. A few years ago the General Assembly adopted the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)], which declares that a fundamental objective is to promote the establishment of a new international economic order based on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence, common interest and cooperation among all States, irrespective of their economic and social systems. To that end it is necessary to make international economic relations more rational and equitable, to promote structure changes in the world economy, to create conditions which will permit a greater expansion of trade and the intensification of economic co-operation among all nations, to Strengthen the economic independence of the developing countries and to establish and further international economic relations, bearing in mind the recognized differences in development among the developing countries and their specific needs.\n113. Efforts at a global transformation of the international economy are still far from attaining their eventual goal. In the various forums in which the main items of the international economy are being discussed no significant advance has been made.\n119.\tThe Government of Guatemala will continue to co-operate constructively in the various forums in efforts to arrive at global solutions by means of negotiation and concerted positions so that in all the existing machinery or any that may be established favourable treatment will be given to the developing economies. At the same time we advocate the opening up of markets and the correction of protectionist policies in developed countries, the horizontal and vertical expansion of preferences for developing countries, as well as the elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers which, to the detriment of those countries, militate against a balanced expansion of the world economy.\n120.\tLast month at Buenos Aires the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries was held with the purpose of creating a structure of multiple links among those countries and of devising mechanisms for genuine co-operation and linkage in the developing world.\n121.\tObviously, to lend support to the process of technical co-operation among developing countries, it would be necessary to introduce changes in the content and the flow of traditional technical: cooperation, in the conviction that technical co-operation among developing countries should not exempt the industrialized countries from fulfilling their responsibilities to the developing world. On the contrary those countries should substantially increase their contribution to development and to bringing about structural changes in the international system,\n122.\tMy Government holds the view that in the developing countries there is broad and Varied know-how in various areas, experience and ability that could be placed at the service of development. Furthermore, the respective national institutions should be encouraged to realize that self-help and a complete awareness of their own capabilities is essential for the success of technical co-operation among developing countries,\n123.\tGuatemala wishes to emphasize the far-reaching role which regional efforts can and must play in technical cooperation Within the region as well as with other developing regions,\n124.\tLatin America is placed in a situation of intermediate development with special characteristics, since its main economic and social indicators and the rate of growth of the economy of the countries of the region are usually higher than the average in the developing countries. Our Latin American region has maintained economic relations with the developed countries for a long while and lately by means of mechanisms for integration we have also begun to undertake intraregional economic activities in addition to the historical relations of the continent. In view of these circumstances the Latin American region is in a position to contribute to a greater understanding at the world level among the various developing areas.\n125.\tMy Government has every intention of participating in efforts aimed at giving impetus to technical co-operation among developing countries, as we are aware that this is a historical imperative deriving from the need for a new international economic order.\n126.\tIt is obvious that the conditions in which international trade is carried out are unfair. Thus any structural change must start with the basic premise that present marketing mechanisms are defective and distorted. For a basic restructuring of the patterns of international trade, there must be more careful planning at the international level, The delegation of Guatemala considers that this problem must be viewed in a far broader perspective than that of the usual discussion in terms of tariffs and quotas on individual products.\n127.\tAmong the most serious problems which affect international trade is the fluctuation in prices of raw materials and the constant deterioration of the terms of trade for countries producing primary goods. Therefore what is needed is specific action so that when better conditions are negotiated in international trade there will be protection against violence and progressive fluctuations.\n128.\tIt is a certain fact that the present marketing structures make it impossible for the countries of the third world to obtain a just price for their exports. Therefore among other measures it is desirable to organize associations of raw-materials suppliers so as to counteract the vast concentration of negotiating power on the demand side.\n129.\tThe Government of Guatemala has fully supported within this context the work of the UNCTAD Ad Hoc\nIntergovernmental Committee for the Integrated Programme for Commodities, and fully supports the establishment of a common fund within UNCTAD and regrets that the negotiating conference on that subject that was held last year-in the United Nations9 was unable to take any concrete decision on the subject, despite the justness of its objectives, such as the establishment and maintenance of prices for commodities at levels that are equitable for consumers and remunerative for producers; the reduction of excessive fluctuation of prices of commodities and in the volume of trade; security of access to markets and to suppliers; expansion of the processing of primary products; improvement in competition and restructuring and rationalization of the marketing and distribution system.\n130.\tMy delegation wishes also to refer to the multilateral trade negotiations held within the framework of GATT. The question regarding the reform of the international institution where world trade is developed appears as one of the means established by the Tokyo Declaration10 to achieve the growing expansion and liberalization of world trade, as well as raising the standard of living and well-being of mankind.\n131.\tThe Declaration has the merit of recognizing the special problems encountered by developing countries in their participation in world trade, and contains a series of commitments intended to solve their problems by reform in the legal framework in which world trade is earned out, making it more effective and equitable for developing countries.\n132.\tMultilateral trade negotiations are of primary importance for the developing countries, given the task of bringing up to date and revising the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade so that it takes into account their special situation by granting more favourable treatment.\n133.\tThe multilateral trade negotiations are about to come to an end, and it will be obvious that the industrialized countries have not accepted in their entirety the principles of the Tokyo Declaration on a different and more favourable treatment for the developing countries.\n134.\tQuantitative restrictions still remain, as do surcharges, tariff and non-tariff barriers, and agreements on products which, in their modalities, restrict the natural progression of imports to the detriment of the trade interests of the developing counties.\n135.\tIn brief, it would seem that so far, the developed countries are not convinced that the economic growth of the developing countries constitutes an objective of common interest to all contracting parties.\n136. My Government has actively participated in the multilateral trade negotiations in GATT, and will continue to make its contribution so that, in so far as possible,\n9\tThe first and second parts of the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fond under the Integrated Programme for Commodities were held in Geneva from 7 March to 2 April and from 7 November to 1 December 1977, respectively.\n10\tDeclaration of 14 September 1973 approved by the Ministerial Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade held in Tokyo.\nchanges may come about both in the liberalization of trade and in the legal regime that governs it.\n137.\tMy delegation wishes to refer to the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development, which is scheduled to be held next year in Vienna.\n138.\tDuring the First United Nations Decade for Development, it was obvious that science and technology were not able to satisfy the hope of providing the developing countries with the means of improving their social and economic condition. During the first half of that Decade, there was a plan here at the United Nations to convene the United Nations Conference on the Application of Science and Technology for the Benefit of the Less Developed Areas, but even when we succeeded in creating an awareness of the importance of science and technology in the development process the political will to carry this out was missing. This is why the Government of Guatemala attaches great importance to the world conference to be held on this subject. We optimistically hope that it will establish the mechanisms for the transfer of know-how as well as for promoting local technologies and improving the capability of the developing countries to adapt imported technology.\n139.\tLast year, the General Assembly established the Commission on Human Settlements, so as to assist countries and regions to increase and improve their own efforts to solve the problems of human settlements, as well as promoting greater international co-operation, in order to increase the resources to\nbe made available to developing countries and regions.\n140.\tIt is obvious that this is a problem that affects many nations, and several international organizations are carrying out activities related to human settlements.\n141.\tMy country is a member of the Commission on Human Settlements, to which we attach much importance, and we are prepared to co-operate fully so that that Commission will formulate and promote policy objectives, priorities and guidelines regarding existing and future work programmes in the sphere of human settlements, in accordance with the recommendations adopted by Habitat.\n142.\tOn the occasion of the earthquake of 4 February 1976 which Guatemala suffered, the problem of human settlements acquired greater urgency. Therefore, my Government is making every possible effort to increase the building of decent housing to meet the needs of the population most gravely affected by that catastrophe. Undoubtedly, international co-operation in this field is very significant for my country, within the global framework of reconstruction of the areas damaged by that seismic movement.\n143.\tWithin this context, my Government considers that the Vancouver Declaration on Human Settlements, 1976,\nis most important, as are the existing programmes of international co-operation, which constitute an instrument to open up new horizons so as to guide national and international action more effectively and with greater impetus to solve the problems of Habitat.\n144.\tIt has been recognized with a growing sense of urgency in recent years that mankind is not interested in protecting the environment in which human beings live.\n145.\tMy country participated in the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm in June 1972, when the Declaration14 was adopted which affirmed that nations are responsible for ensuring that their activities cause no damage to the environment of other countries and that they must co-operate in developing international law regarding liability and indemnity for pollution and other damage caused to the environment beyond their frontiers. It also pointed out that environmental policies must promote, and not adversely affect, the potential development of the developing countries.\n146.\tMy Government attaches special importance to environmental matters. Nationally we have a committee for the conservation and improvement of the environment, which has technical advisory committees. My Government, which is a member of the Governing Council of UNEP, will continue to co-operate in this field at the international level.\n147.\tIt is a fact that some nations have been affected by the continuous looting of their archaeological treasures and of their cultural heritage in general. My country is one of those affected, since several relics inherited from our forefathers have been illegally removed from our national territory. It is a fact that these archaeological relics constitute the testimony of a history, a culture and a civilization such as the Mayan civilization, whose spirit is perpetuated and renewed in them.\n148.\tThe endless speculation which goes on today in connexion with the prices paid for works of art inspires dealers and looters to use all possible means to appropriate artistic and archaeological treasures from the countries to which they belong.\n149.\tThe return of cultural goods to the countries which have lost them continues to raise specific problems which neither concerted agreement nor spontaneous action has been able to solve, so that it has become necessary to deal with this matter on a global basis. Recently the Director-General of UNESCO appealed to the international press to try to arouse a wide and strong movement of public opinion throughout the world to encourage respect for works of art to be expressed by the return of these works of art to their countries of origin whenever necessary.\n150.\tMy Government believes that the restitution of a work of art, a document or an archaeological treasure to the country to which it belongs helps a people to recover part of its memory and of its identity, and is proof of the value which mankind attaches to these treasures, which represent the history of the world.\n151.\tMy delegation believes that the United Nations, through one of its specialized agencies, such as UNESCO, can do much to develop a world conscience, so that archaeological treasures may be restored to their countries of origin. Nationally, my Government will continue to make every effort to recover its archaeological heritage, which constitutes our history and which is part of the cultural patrimony of its people.\n152.\tI shall now refer to a matter which is of vital importance for my country, that is, the question of the territory of Belize, which is illegally occupied by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n153.\tDespite the fact that on repeated occasions different representatives of my country have detailed the legal, historical, geographical, political and moral arguments substantiating the legitimate rights of Guatemala over the territory of Belize, I deem it appropriate, as Minister for Foreign Affairs of the new Government of Guatemala, to refer once again specifically to the background of this problem. At the same time, I wish to insist once again that the case of Belize cannot be resolves/, through the regular decolonization process, because this is a matter of a territory subject to a century-old claim. That is why the inter-American system has excluded it from that procedure, as it has the other territories which are the subject of dispute between American Republics and extra-continental Powers. I also wish to reiterate that the United Nations lacks competence to intervene in a dispute which is subject to the procedure of direct negotiations between two sovereign States, Guatemala and the United Kingdom. Therefore, since the dispute is now subject to a legal procedure advocated in the Charter of the United Nations itself, it is in no way fitting that the General Assembly should dictate guidelines for a political solution.\n154.\tIt is also vital for my delegation to clarify many distorted allegations of the truth in relation to this problem, since some delegations in past years have made Guatemala appear in this Assembly to be a nation with expansionist aims. Yet others have forged the theory that the claim of Guatemala to Belize, although it is legitimate, should be subject to principles which are still under discussion in the doctrine of international law, and attempts are made to give preferential validity to this over certain definite rights. Attempts are thus made to reduce the matter to a question of indemnity by remuneration, as though the legitimate rights of a country over its territory can be the subject of financial or pecuniary terms.\n155.\tFrom the discovery of the new world and during the three centuries of Spanish colonization, Spain's possessions in America were constantly attacked by other European Powers, sometimes openly in acts of war, at other times by marauders, corsairs, buccaneers and pirates who made a hunting ground of Spanish America, and particularly of the Caribbean Sea.\n156.\tIt is in these latter activities that we find the origins of the British establishment on the coasts of Guatemala. Some of those seamen found it easier to devote themselves to the illegal extraction of wood, logwood, mahogany and cedar, abandoned the risks of the hunt and settled down in the Belize region. These clandestine operations were protected by distance and by the special configuration of the coasts in the area, whose reefs and chains of keys and islets made them a good refuge.\n157.\tSpain and its governors in America constantly attempted to expel the plundering intruders, but the nation, weakened by the great endeavour of colonization in America and bled white by constant wars, was eventually constrained to seek a logical settlement by means of the peace treaties of 1783 and 1786. Those treaties authorized the presence of British subjects in the Belize region but only for the purpose of cutting timber in a very limited, clearly defined area, with an express prohibition against erecting permanent establishments or fortifications, and with express recognition by Great Britain that sovereignty in the zone granted for specific use belonged clearly and categorically to Spain. All the rest that has been said about battles and deeds of war is pure legend and fables woven around the conspiracy of certain Belize political groups who are trying to deprive Guatemala of part of its territory.\n158.\tWhen independence was proclaimed in 1821 within the context of the ancient kingdom of Guatemala and the United Provinces of Central America were constituted by virtue of the legal principle of uti possidetis, which was universally recognized as determining boundaries in the new States of Spanish America, the United Provinces succeeded Spain in its sovereignty over the region of the isthmus and there was a concomitant rash of usurpation and occupation. Almost all of the Caribbean coast of Central America was occupied by vanguards of British imperialism: Belize in Guatemala, the Bahia Islands in Honduras, and Mosquitia at the mouth of the San Juan River in Nicaragua all represented British attempts to transform Central America into yet another colony. The men of Central American nationality persevered patriotically and gradually expelled the invaders, sometimes by means of diplomacy and at other times by force, until the point we have reached today when the last stronghold of the British presence in Central America is Belize.\n159.\tSince the day of independence Guatemala began to suffer the harassment of the British in Belize, and we also began consistently and tenaciously to fight for the return of the territory. The authorities of the so-called Establishment of the Bay of Honduras, or Belize, constantly threatened Guatemala, not only because of the attempts of that country to recover its territory, but also because Guatemalan law considered any man who entered its domain as a free man. That was why the slaves brought to Belize by the loggers, most of whom came from Trinidad and Jamaica, found secure protection in Guatemala. While they were treated by the British as savages and fugitives, and branded with fire by the ignominious symbol of the carimba, or branding iron, in Guatemala they were free men who fully recovered the right to be treated as such. This gave rise to indignant actions and even to intimidation by the British naval forces, which demanded return or indemnity. Guatemala did not accede to any of this.\n160.\tTo this must be added the very serious fact that territorial usurpation continued. The English were not satisfied with occupying and exploiting the region designated for their specific use in the treaties with Spain; they carried their depredation further and, aided by their\nsuperior power, penetrated by force of arms fresh areas of Guatemalan territory. Through the east of Belize they entered Peten, and from the south they reached the Sarstum River. The Guatemalan population and the vast majority of indigenous groups such as the Kekchies and Mopanes were expelled or enslaved, as were the local Guatemalan authorities. Even to this day we find vestiges of this treatment in Belize, where indigenous groups which have succeeded in surviving exploitation are constrained to live in limited zones which are officially called Reservations.\n161.\tThe democratic actions undertaken by Guatemala, a new and weak nation, both to recover its occupied territory and to put an end to new deprivations were viewed with disdain by Great Britain. Our diplomatic archives are full of tales and records of the affronts and humiliations which our envoys suffered.\n162.\tIn the middle of the last century the United States of America began to acquire the rank of a great Power and also set its sights on the Central American isthmus. Transportation to the gold mines of California, which had just been acquired, was routed through Nicaragua. The possibility of building a canal in some part of Central America generated acute rivalry between the United States and Great Britain, each of which fought for the sole right to exploit us. The conflict was resolved in 1850 by the signing of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, whereby England and the United States undertook, vis-\u00e0-vis each other, not to acquire possessions or colonies in Central America. It was also agreed that any canal to be built would be neutral and open to navigation by all Powers. This instrument, res inter alios acta for all Central American nations, in a certain indirect way led to the withdrawal of Great Britain from some of the regions which it had occupied in Central America and to the gradual disappearance of the absurd Kingdom of Mosquitia which had been established by England on the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua.\n163.\tBut Great Britain did not leave Belize and compelled Guatemala to sign the 1859 Convention.1 s This instrument is not only a violation of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty; it is also a typical example of a covenant between two parties who are unequal in force. Guatemala agreed to cede territory under a transparent disguise of a boundaries convention as the only way to contain English advances because our Caribbean coastline was rapidly disappearing. Furthermore, this Convention deluded an indemnity clause which consisted of a British commitment to build a highway towards the narrow part of the Caribbean beaches which Guatemala still owned. It believed that the latter would at least comply with its obligations.\n164.\tThe United Kingdom obstinately refused to comply with the indemnity clause to which it had subscribed. Guatemala took action and constantly and repeatedly submitted requests to the British Government for compliance with what had been solemnly agreed upon. All was in vain. On the contrary, in a singularly cavalier manner\nGreat Britain not only proclaimed itself, as it still does, in legitimate possession of the regions that it exploited under the precarious right of specific use in accordance with the treaties with the Spanish crown, but also claimed new and extensive areas over which it had never had any title and which it had taken away from the Republic of Guatemala.\n165.\tThis accumulation of circumstances led to my country's declaring that the 1859 Convention had lapsed because of non-compliance by one of the parties. We had no other choice. Out of necessity we reached the conclusion that if the indemnity clause had no effect for Great Britain then neither did the clause on the boundaries of the territories have any effect for Guatemala. The entire treaty then lapsed as was recognized many years ago in London by British officials. This enabled Guatemala to maintain firmly, as it always has done and will continue to do, its claims for the recovery of the territory which was seized from us.\n166.\tNevertheless, the Government of Guatemala has always been ready to resolve the matter in the best manner possible, and to this end it put forward various proposals which repeatedly met with the barrier of British inflexibility or manoeuvring. After various attempts at a direct settlement, arbitration was proposed, but London did not approve the candidate for arbitrator. Then there was a proposal to bring the problem before the International Court of Justice, but the United Kingdom insisted that that lofty tribunal consider the case stricto jure as against the Guatemalan request to apply the procedure ex aequo et bono, so as to make it possible for the judges to learn the historical, legal and moral circumstances which had been decisive in this question. After many diplomatic initiatives, it was later agreed that there the United States of America would act as mediator, and once again the British put up opposition, this time to the proposals of the mediator. Lastly, for the past three years we have been committed to direct negotiations, in conformity with Article 33 of the United Nations Charter, and we trust that by this means we shall soon be able to arrive at a final settlement. Naturally that can only happen if the process is not disturbed by persistent interference and if the craftiness of the other side does not render null and void the desire to reach agreement which has been shown. That side can give the best proof of its sincerity by adopting an understanding and a flexible position.\n167.\tI have set forth very briefly the background and present status of this historical territorial claim. I have also demonstrated that the territory of Belize is an integral part of the national Guatemalan territory. All of this compels me vehemently to-reject any hint that my country has any expansionist or colonialist intentions. As has been rightly said in this forum by one eminent representative, Guatemala has no imperialist tradition; all it wishes is to recover part of its territory, which belongs to it in accordance with unquestionable legal titles and obvious social facts and realities.\n168.\tGuatemala was one of the 89 countries which voted to adopt the historic resolution 1514 (XV), containing the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. In so doing, we placed clearly and unequivocally on record that the Declaration, in accordance\nwith the provisions of paragraph 6, was not applicable to the age-old dispute over Belize, since it expresses in categorical terms that:\n\\\"Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\\\"\n169.\tAt the meeting of the General Assembly on 14 December 1960, Mr. Palar of Indonesia explained that his delegation was one of the delegations which has proposed paragraph 6-which I have just quoted-and that he considered that the situation of the territory \\\"which the Guatemalan delegation had in mind [has] been taken into consideration in paragraph 6\\\". At that time Indonesia was claiming its rights over West Irian, which it considered to be an integral part of its territory and which was later restored to it.\n170.\tIt is fitting to recall that the Goa enclave was also incorporated into the sovereign possessions of India, which considered it an integral part of its territory.\n171.\tThere is no doubt that the principle of self-determination cannot be extended to the point where it causes the territorial dismemberment of a State; this would be contrary to the fundamental right of existence of the State and of its own integrity.\n172.\tObviously, many delegations supported the resolutions on the case of Belize adopted by the General Assembly in the years 1975, 1976 and 1977, prompted by deep feelings, since they represented peoples which had had to fight and to shed their blood to free themselves from colonialism.\n173.\tMy Government wishes to appeal to the delegations here present to meditate very seriously over the Belize problem and understand that my country cannot recognize as binding or constituent any resolutions which exceed the competence of any political organ, such as the General Assembly.\n174.\tRepresentatives should also give thought to the designs of the colonialist Power, which apparently incites foolhardy movements to precipitate a declaration of independence in Belize, even though this runs counter to the procedure which this same Power has proclaimed as legal and viable for the attainment of that objective. In this respect I must reiterate that Guatemala clearly, definitely and categorically opposes a sudden or unilaterally granted independence for Belize, as well as any act aimed at transforming the status of Belize behind Guatemala's back; we also oppose any attempt to circumscribe, limit or disturb the framework of the negotiations taking place between Guatemala and Great Britain, with the participation of the Government and the people of Belize, to settle the territorial dispute.\n175.\tIn connexion with this matter, it is fitting to recall what the representative of Congo (Leopoldville) said in this Assembly more than 15 years ago:\n\\\"In obedience to the wave of new ideas, they [the colonialists] intend to 'decolonize' at any cost, as if to ease their consciences. But Africa remains vigilant and refuses to be taken in by the peddlers of good intentions.\\\"\n176.\tThe Head of State of Ghana at the same Assembly in 1960 said that:\n\\\"... something has happened... which has justified the constant warning to the African countries to be on their guard against what I call 'clientele-sovereignty', or fake independence, granted by the metropolitan Power, with the concealed intention of making the liberated country a 'client-state' and controlling it effectively by means other than political ones.\\\"18\n177.\tI should like to ask this Assembly whether there is any Government which, in compliance with the principle of self-determination, is prepared to accept the claim of a tribe, population clusters, ethnic group or minority which, taking refuge in this principle, wants to remove a good part of its territory, as is the case with part of Guatemalan territory which they intend to separate from Guatemala, on the basis of a convenient interpretation of the principle of the self-determination of peoples.\n178.\tGuatemala has fully shown its willingness to have this matter solved by means of negotiations so as to arrive at a just and equitable settlement of its historic territorial claim of more than a century. Being in favour of peaceful solutions to settle international disputes in accordance with international law, we have held uninterrupted talks with the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland aimed at ending this dispute.\n179.\tIn the same spirit, the Government of Guatemala is prepared to continue those negotiations so as to find an equitable, honourable, peaceful and negotiated solution to this dispute without undermining the rights of Guatemala and taking into account the vital interests of the people of Belize.\n180.\tWe, the Guatemalans, are able to offer every kind of guarantee and security to the people of Belize, who will always find among us a brotherly willingness to arrive at fruitful and constructive coexistence. Destiny has linked us to strengthen a development we can carry out jointly, overcoming any obstacle that might bar our way. However strong the factors that might divide us, our will to achieve mutual understanding will be more powerful and more resolute.\n181.\tI wish to express my Government's hops that the work of the thirty-third regular session of the General Assembly will be crowned with successful results compatible with the aspirations of the peoples of all the world.\n182.\tI believe the United Nations must devote its best efforts to maintaining the new international spirit so as to build a new era of solidarity and co-operation for the benefit of our peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff103.\tMr. President, I congratulate you on your election to this important office.\n104.\tWe all learned this morning with shock and sadness of the sudden death of Pope John Paul I. His passing deprives the world of a wise and compassionate leader whose brief ministry had already given promise of greatness.\n106.\tA generation ago the United Nations was created by men and women who shared a vision. They saw the need in the wake of war to create stronger international institutions that could dampen the flames of conflict and life nations and people to a new level of material well-being; they saw the need to afford self-determination to millions; and they saw the need for the world community to take a compelling stand against repression, discrimination and the denial of the rights of man.\n107. The men and women who gathered in San Francisco in 1945 raised their sights above the differences and divisions of the moment. They dared to see the world as it could be\u2014a world where- those who are hungry are fed; where those who are poor have escaped the degradation of poverty; where diplomacy among nations is a pervasive substitute for violence among nations; and where the resources of the world are used effectively and shared equitably.\n108.\tIn the years since, the record of the United Nations in working towards that vision has been one of accomplishment. It has played an indispensable part in the process of peaceful decolonization, in defusing tensions among nations through its peace-keeping missions, and in promoting , genuine economic and social progress.\n109.\tToday the Members of this body still share that common vision. And we understand far better than ever before our common destiny: that no nation acting alone can assure for its people peace and economic security; that the future of each of our nations depends upon the future of all of our nations.\n110.\tOur challenge today is to summon the political, will to act in concert towards the goals we share, to go beyond the rhetoric of interdependence and to begin to recognize its inescapable implications for the national interests of each of us.\n111.\tWe must build a new consensus on this proposition: that in this new era each nation must weigh more carefully than ever before its long-term interest in a healthy global community when making decisions about its immediate concerns. For only through co-operation and compromise in the short run can we assure our longer-term future.\n112.\tOn crucial issues, the coming months will present turning-points of incalculable importance. In negotiations on the Middle East, on southern Africa, on trade, on arms control and on many other pressing problems, genuine progress has been made. Without continued progress, the gains we have already made can be lost.\n113.\tThis point applies not to any single nation nor any group of nations but to every nation, including my own.\n114.\tThe resolution of dangerous regional disputes and progress in limiting weaponry must always be at the top of the immediate international agenda. I shall return to these issues later. But we cannot so concentrate our energies on the political diplomacy of international peace, essential as it is, that we discover too late that international inequities and poverty and injustice within nations make peace among nations impossible.\n115.\tSo let me concentrate my comments today on those issues that so centrally touch people's lives around the globe-economic security, the equitable development of the earth's resources and individual freedom.\n116.\tShared economic progress requires a global consensus on the benefits of co-operation among nations. Cooperation and compromise are often difficult. The economic problems we share require long-term efforts, but we are all constrained by domestic concerns which call for immediate attention; the problems we share are so widespread in their impact that solutions cannot be found by a single nation or group of nations; and these problems require more than general agreements. The application of substantial technical and financial resources is necessary. Debate over sterile texts will neither feed the hungry nor create new jobs for the unemployed. Only common action can be effective. And each must contribute if all are to benefit.\n117.\tOnly three or four years ago there was extraordinary tension between North and South. Each side was deeply suspicious of the other's motives. Each held sharply different perceptions of global needs and priorities. But these differences have been narrowed. From the seventh special session of the General Assembly through the fourth session of UNCTAD, the Conference on International Economic Co-operation and the meetings of this Assembly, and through other serious efforts in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the economic summits, agreement has been achieved on several basic issues relating to a new international economic order.\n118.\tWe are agreed on the need to work towards the elimination of poverty in all countries. Concessional aid flows have been increased. More attention is being devoted to food production. Satisfying basic economic needs is becoming a greater priority of the international community.\n119.\tWe are agreed on the urgent need to accelerate equitable non-inflationary growth. The round of multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of GATT now proceeding at Geneva are in their final stages. We are discussing guidelines for international investment. Private capital flows are increasing. The facilities of IMF have been expanded, and discussions are under way to expand the facilities of the multilateral development banks.\n120.\tWe are agreed on the need to reduce economic instability and uncertainty. The IMF is playing a major role in providing balance-of-payments financing to those most severely affected by recent disruptions in the world economy. We are engaged in serious discussions on a variety of commodity arrangements, including a system of internationally co-ordinated national grain reserves.\n121.\tAnd we are agreed on the need to facilitate smooth adjustment for workers and businesses that have borne the brunt of changing economic circumstances. The Bonn Economic Summit Conference this year made clear that we must intensify our efforts in this area.\n122.\tBecause we have come far, the road ahead will be even more challenging, for the most difficult issues remain. To maintain our progress, we should be guided by three fundamental principles in the North-South discussions over the coming months. First, every nation must resist the temptation to solve its own economic problems at the expense of others. We must fashion our domestic policies on the basis of global as well as national needs. Secondly, all nations which bear their fair share of responsibility should benefit from a healthy world economy. And, thirdly, all nations must enter international economic negotiations in a spirit of accommodation.\n123.\tThese principles will not by themselves solve the problems we face. But without their general acceptance, there can be no genuine progress. Adherence to them will prevent critical negotiations from turning into polarizing and self-defeating tests of will.\n124.\tLet me discuss several major issues where the application of these principles can make the difference between success and failure.\n125.\tFirst I shall speak of the \\\"Committee of the Whole\\\" that is, the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174. One of our most recent collective efforts to address the economic challenges we share was the establishment of that Committee. The Committee has the potential to look at economic issues comprehensively and to identify longer-term priorities. The United States strongly supports that forum. At its meeting in May it made progress in identifying some important areas of agreement between the industrial and the developing countries. Substantive discussions in the Committee had an important impact on the Ministerial Meeting of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, held on 14 and 15 June, and on the Bonn Economic Summit Conference. We of course shared the disappointment of other representatives that a procedural impasse earlier this month interrupted the Committee's work.\n126.\tSince the September meeting, we have carefully examined the statements made by others on this issue. We have noted in particular statements made by the Chairman to the Committee on 8 September and to the press on 11 September, and have taken into account subsequent consultations. It is now generally agreed that the Committee would not seek to provide specific solutions to problems outstanding in other bodies. Rather, it would achieve agreed conclusions on fundamental or crucial underlying issues, and only to the extent that all members agreed to decide on them.\n127.\tWe are satisfied that on the basis of these statements sufficient procedural agreement now exists to resume substantive work in the manner suggested by the Chairman at the end of the informal consultations on 6 September [see A[33/34, part two, annex A].\n128.\tI turn now to the question of trade. The spirit which must guide our work in the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 applies as well to our policies on trade. The developing world is no longer on the periphery of world trade. Increasingly, growth in the developing countries is important to the health of the industrial countries.\n129.\tCommitment to open trade, however, is extremely fragile. It is tempting for one nation to use trade restrictions to export its economic difficulties. It is often easy to avoid adjustments which are beneficial in the long run, but which in the short run present difficult problems for workers and for industry.\n130.\tWe must be concerned about rising protectionist pressures, but we should also recognize that world trade has expanded remarkably well in recent; years. Despite a deep recession in the early 1970s, we not only avoided the trading wars of the 1930s, but we continued negotiations to liberalize and to improve the world trading system. Our ability to conclude these trade negotiations successfully this year is a critical test of our commitment to an open trading system. An agreement will stimulate production, it will provide jobs, and it will help reduce inflation.\n131.\tBeyond our efforts to expand trade, the United States will fulfil our commitment to assist developing nations through differential measures, including, where appropriate, special and more favourable treatment. We, in turn, expect those developing countries which can do so to contribute to trade liberalization by improving access to their markets. Improved access will not only benefit the industrial countries; it will be even more important to many developing countries.\n132.\tFinally, we believe that in trade, as elsewhere, the developing countries should have a voice in determining the policies which affect them. We have encouraged their full involvement in the Geneva multilateral trade negotiations. We urge developing countries, especially those which play a large role in international trade, to participate actively in\nGATT and in the agreements that result from the Geneva negotiations so that their interests are fully represented.\n133.\tI turn now to the question of commodities. An essential element of trade for most developing nations is their export of basic commodities. At the fourth session of UNCTAD we agreed to intensify our collective effort to address commodity problems. Progress has not always been as fast as we all would like, but this has generally reflected the technical complexity of commodity issues rather than the lack of political will or good faith. We will continue to work for stabilization agreements and other measures that strengthen commodity markets.\n134.\tLet me affirm that we believe a soundly designed common fund could play a useful role in alleviating commodity problems. A well-structured fund will provide economic benefits to participating countries. We also recognize that the establishment of a fund is of major political importance to the general North-South dialogue.\n135.\tWe will co-operate with others to bring the common fund negotiations to a successful conclusion. Recent consultations have identified a convergence of views on some issues. All agree that a fund could play a useful role in reducing the over-all financial costs of supporting buffer stocks, which effectively stabilize prices.\n136.\tIn addition, there is a growing recognition of the importance of encouraging improved productivity and more effective marketing of many commodities. A separate \\\"second window\\\" of the common fund, based on voluntary contributions and operating under agreed guidelines, might be an appropriate mechanism. We are-prepared to negotiate flexibly on this issue, as on others, if there is a similar approach on all sides.\n137.\tWhile progress has been made on some issues, important differences still remain. Movement on all sides of the conference table will be necessary. But we are convinced that with mutual accommodation a workable agreement can be achieved.\n138.\tAs with trade, increased resource flows to the developing world must be part of an international system of shared responsibility.\n139.\tWe ought not to think of resource transfers as a sacrifice for donors or a unilateral benefit for recipients They are an economic investment in the future of all countries. They will contribute to global economic growth, greater trade and enhanced prosperity for us all.\n140.\tMy country is committed to increasing our contributions to both multilateral and bilateral development efforts. We have\\\" done so in the past year: our multilateral commitments increased by 31 per cent and our bilateral programme expanded by 20 per cent. And, because we are determined that United States aid funds will be used effectively, we will concentrate our efforts in countries where programmes are aimed most directly at meeting the essential needs of their people.\n141.\tThe United States believes strongly that a key objective of foreign assistance should be to help meet basic human needs. We recognize that nations will have different development priorities in approaching this goal. Whether emphasis is on enhancing the productivity of the poor, increasing food production, improving health or expanding industry which creates jobs, the critical ingredient in every nation is to have all its citizens\u2014men and women\u2014as active participants in and beneficiaries of their nation's growth.\n142.\tFinally, we recognize the debt problems that many of the least developed countries face. We will soon have authority from our Congress for retroactive adjustment of certain aid terms which would permit us to help those most in need.\n143.\tAs we work together to promote economic development, we must also ensure an equitable sharing of the world's resources. Four issues demand our immediate attention. Our first urgent priority is ensuring adequate food and stable agricultural prices for all people. Four years have now passed since the World Food Conference, where we agreed on measures we must take for the future.5 But despite our efforts the fundamental problems remain: food production is hardly keeping pace with the growth in population; food deficits in many countries are increasing; and negotiations on grain reserves have dragged on without success. We believe progress must be made.\n144.\tThe United States has created a 9-million-ton farmer-held grain reserve. We have proposed to our Congress the establishment of an international emergency wheat reserve of 6 million tons to provide food for emergency needs in developing countries. We intend to maintain our food aid level at a fair share of the target set at the World Food Conference.\n145.\tWe will continue to support the activities of international organizations devoted to food production such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development. And we intend to make food aid a more effective tool in support of development.\n146.\tI propose that this Assembly review the world food situation to identify the current obstacles to progress and to restore a sense of urgency in meeting mankind's most basic need. We must not be lulled by good weather and plentiful harvests. Another tragedy is inevitable unless we act now.\n147.\tSecondly, we must act now to develop new energy resources so that we may avoid a harsh transition to the time when fossil fuels will no longer be plentiful. This task has several dimensions.\n148.\tThere must be an expansion of oil and gas production, and we need to improve our conservation of these energy resources, especially in my country, the United States. The World Bank has expanded its lending to help developing countries increase their fossil fuel supplies. We welcome this, and we also encourage the regional development banks to assist.\n\n149.\tThe development of nuclear energy will also be central to the future of many countries. We hope the' International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation will provide a consensus on nuclear technologies free from the serious risk of nuclear-weapon proliferation. My Government supports the development of safeguardable nuclear power, including assured nuclear fuel supplies. The developing nations should, of course, participate in the design and management of the institutions which form the basis of an international nuclear energy regime.\n150.\tPriority attention must be given to the development of renewable energy resources. Many technologies already exist for harnessing solar, wind and geothermal power. All of us can benefit from these technologies, but a special effort should be made to meet the needs of the poorer countries.\n151.\tTwo opportunities now exist for the United Nations to continue to play an important role. The United States supports the proposed United Nations conference on new and renewable sources of energy.  Such a conference could result in a more co-ordinated United Nations energy effort and clearer priorities. It could also provide up-to-date information on renewable energy technology, and examine the role of the private sector in energy development. UNDP might also expand its efforts to help nations assess their own renewable energy possibilities, finance the testing of new technologies and provide training and technical assistance for effective energy management.\n152.\tThe United States is willing to contribute to a major global effort to develop new energy resources. We will intensify our assistance programmes in this area. We will increase domestic research, which can benefit all nations. And we will expand co-operative energy programmes from which we, too, stand to benefit.\n153.\tThirdly, we must strive to conclude successfully the negotiations on the law of the sea. At stake is whether that vast expanse of the globe will be an arena of conflict or of co-operation. Considerable progress has been made on a number of issues in these negotiations. These achievements have been obscured, however, by continued stalemate over sea-bed mining. The basis for an equitable solution already exists and is widely accepted. It permits all sides to benefit fully from sea-bed mining, with- private firms as well as an international enterprise being allowed to mine on a competitive basis. A mutually acceptable solution is imperative, and it is, we believe, possible. Time is running out for reaching an agreed solution. Without it, sea-bed mining will inevitably take place, but in the absence of an international agreed framework. That would be less satisfactory than a widely supported international regime.\n154.\tFourthly, and finally, there is the critical question of how best to harness technology and science for the benefit of mankind. We hope that the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development, to be held next year in Vienna, will focus attention on how all countries can contribute their knowledge to global development. It will be particularly important to find ways for developing nations to enhance their capacity to generate, select and apply technology for their own development priorities. We will contribute to the work of the Conference, and we hope to benefit from it.\n155.\tFurthermore, to help mobilize the technical talents and knowledge of our nation on behalf of the development of others, we intend to establish during the coming year a new foundation for international technical co-operation.\n156.\tThe ultimate purpose of all our policies is the enhancement of human dignity. The rights to food, to shelter, to a decent education, to adequate health\u2014the' rights which lie at the heart of our approach to economic issues\u2014are hollow without political and civil freedoms: freedom from torture and government mistreatment, freedom to worship, to travel and to speak without fear, freedom to participate in the affairs of one's Government. There is no incompatibility among economic, political and civil rights; no choice that must be made among them. They reinforce one another.\n157.\tWe commemorate in this Assembly the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Dag Hammarskjold described the Declaration as a living document. We have a continuing obligation to keep that document alive in our own nations. And as Members of the United Nations we must strengthen the international machinery that serves to promote the full range of human rights, including political and economic rights.\n158.\tWe have made significant progress in the past year. Concern for human rights is more central to international discourse today than ever before. But more needs to be done. This Assembly should review the activities of the various United Nations human rights institutions. We must resolve in this Assembly to make torture alien to the experience of every nation and to conclude an international agreement to outlaw it. We need to ensure that we are doing all we can to end conditions which are tantamount to genocide. And we must ask what more each of us can do to ensure the vitality of the Universal Declaration, to provide amnesty to prisoners of conscience, to ensure due process for all and to advance social justice and equity for our people.\n159.\tIn addition, the plight of one group of individuals, refugees, demands our special compassion. We urge all nations to increase their support for the vital humanitarian work of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n160.\tThe refugee problem is not confined to any single region. In Africa alone, some 2 million individuals are now outside their native lands. We must do more to offer them sustenance, security and a realistic hope of resettlement or return to their homelands.\n161.\tIn South-East Asia hundreds of new refugees from Indo-China appear daily, some risking their lives to cross borders, others challenging the sea in every form of vessel. We urgently need greater efforts to provide them with sanctuary. We hope that the High Commissioner will consider convening an international conference in the very near future to seek humane solutions to the desperate plight of these refugees.\n162.\tWe propose that consideration also be given at a later date to a general conference on the world-wide refugee problem.\n163.\tLet me now turn to international peace-keeping. Too often the anguish of the uprooted is grim testimony to our collective failure to achieve international peace. War and strife are the enemies of the fundamental rights I have discussed. Today my Government and many of those assembled here are actively pursuing the path of peace in troubled areas of the world.\n164.\tThe accords achieved at Camp David  offer hope that at long last a turning-point has been reached in the Middle East. The agreements achieved between Egypt and Israel, with active American participation, constitute a framework for a comprehensive peace settlement. Much remains to be done in the ensuing stages of negotiations, but a major step has been taken in resolving the difficult issues that lie at the heart of 30 years of Arab-Israel hostility. As negotiations are pursued on the basis of the Camp David framework a dynamic process will be set in motion that can profoundly change attitudes on the issues that remain to be resolved. That process will significantly advance legitimate Arab objectives while protecting Israel's security. It is our hope that the Members of this body will lend their full support to the task of building a just and lasting peace upon this framework.\n165.\tIn his address before Congress on 18 September  President Carter reviewed the main elements of the Camp David agreements. As the President said, our historic position on settlements in occupied territory has remained constant. As he further said, no peace agreement will be either just or secure if it does not 'resolve the problem of the Palestinians in the broadest sense. We believe that the Palestinian people must be assured that they and their descendants can live with dignity and freedom and have the opportunity for economic fulfilment and political expression. The Camp David accords state that the negotiated solution must recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n166.\tThe Camp David accords make a solid start towards achieving these goals for the Palestinians in real terms. In the West Bank and Gaza, the framework provides that Israeli occupation shall end and a self-governing authority shall be instituted. This can be achieved within a few months. Thus, for the first time the Palestinians have the prospect of governing themselves within the framework that has been agreed.\n167.\tThe Camp David framework also gives the Palestinians a vital role in shaping their destiny by recognizing them as participants in all aspects of the negotiations that determine their future. The Palestinians will participate in the negotiations to set up their self-governing authority, in those to determine the final status of the West Bank and \\\" Gaza, and in those leading to a Jordan-Israel peace treaty. Finally, the agreement on the final status of the West Bank\nand Gaza will be submitted to a vote of representatives of the inhabitants for either ratification or rejection. These steps set in motion a political process of the utmost importance to all Palestinians.\n168.\tThe Camp David accords concentrate on the means by which self-government can be established for the Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza, but there was also clear recognition by all three leaders at Camp David that the problem of the Palestinians living outside these areas must also be addressed. We recognize that this problem has political as well as humanitarian dimensions which must be resolved as an integral part of a durable peace settlement. When the Camp David accords call for the resolution of the Palestinian problem in all its aspects, they acknowledge and embrace that central fact. As the political institutions of self-government take shape, West Bank and Gaza through negotiations among parties, the relationship between those institutions and the Palestinians living outside the area should be defined, including the question of admission of Palestinian refugees to the West Bank and Gaza.\n169.\tThe framework provides for the establishment of a committee to decide on the modalities of admission to the West Bank and Gaza of persons displaced in the 1967 war. For the first time the parties to the conflict, Egypt and Israel, have agreed to work with each other and with other interested parties to establish agreed procedures for a prompt, just and permanent resolution of the refugee problem.\n170.\tAs President Carter stated in his address to Congress, the United States is irrevocably committed to bringing about a satisfactory solution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees. We will play an active role in the resolution of this problem. A solution must reflect the relevant United Nations resolutions relating to the refugees. We urge the international community to support Egypt and Israel in establishing procedures urgently to address this issue in all its aspects. And the international community should contribute to a programme to promote economic development in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as to assist those refugees residing elsewhere.\n171. We are determined to achieve a fair and just\nsettlement of the Middle East question in all its parts, and\nwe hope the Palestinian people will seize this historic\nopportunity. It is our hope that the people of the Middle\nEast will agree that it is imperative to begin the negotiating\nprocess now and not to stand still until every last issue is\nresolved. We urge the other interested parties to join the\nnegotiations without delay.\n172. As the Middle East peace process moves forward, it is\nvital to maintain the effectiveness of the United Nations\npeace-keeping role there. It is critical that the mandates of\nthe United Nations Peace-keeping Forces in the Golan\nHeights [UNDOF] and Sinai [UNEF] be renewed this fall.\nThose Forces have thus far helped all sides avoid renewed\nhostilities; they must now remain to help achieve a stable\npeace.\n173. Let me briefly review several other regional disputes\nof major importance. \n174. In Lebanon, the fighting and tragic loss of life\ncontinue. UNIFIL in southern Lebanon has done much to\nstabilize the situation in that part of the country, and we\ncall on all to support this effort to help reassert Lebanese\nauthority. Elsewhere in Lebanon confrontation and tensions\ncontinue at a high pitch. President Carter made clear\nin his address to the joint session of Congress following the\nCamp David summit meetings, and again yesterday, his\ndetermination to spare no effort to assist in finding a\nsolution to the Lebanese tragedy. As the President said\nyesterday, it is time for us to take joint action to call a\nconference of those who are involved and to try to reach\nsome solution. It may involve a new charter for Lebanon.\n175. In Namibia the world community faces a fundamental\nchallenge. I will be commenting on this more\nfully this afternoon in the Security Council. Let me\nsimply say now that \\\"the United States is determined to see\nNamibia achieve independence in accordance with the\ncontact group proposal and Security Council resolution\n431 (1978). We call upon South Africa to co-operate fully\nwith the United Nations so that this critical opportunity for\na peaceful settlement will not be lost.\n176. In Rhodesia, time may be running out for the\npossibilities of diplomacy. But we will continue to work\nwith the United Kingdom Government, the Governments in\nthe region and the parties to seek a negotiated solution, We\ncondemn the murder of innocent civilians as a matter of\nboth conscience and reason. The prospects for peace in\nRhodesia will diminish if violence increases.\n177. On Cyprus, an opportunity now exists to help the\ntwo communities narrow their differences and achieve a\njust and lasting solution to this long-standing problem. The\nUnited Nations has done a commendable job of nurturing\nan atmosphere which should now make possible productive\nintercommunal negotiations. To grasp this opportunity, we\nwould welcome and. actively support a renewed effort by\nSecretary-General Waldheim to help the parties reach\nagreement on a sovereign, bicommunal, non-aligned federal\nRepublic of Cyprus which would meet the concerns of the\npeople of Cyprus.\n178. In this Hemisphere, we must respond to the agony of\nthose caught up in the violence and bloodshed of\nNicaragua. We and several countries in Latin America have\noffered to assist in the mediation of Nicaragua's internal\ncrisis. It is our hope and expectation that all parties\nconcerned will accept these offers and 'agree to a fair\nmediation process in which all can have confidence. Only a\ndemocratic solution in Nicaragua-not repression or\n.violence-can lead to an enduring stability and to true\npeace.\n179. As we work together to find peaceful resolutions to\nthe most dangerous regional disputes, we must also seek in\nthis Assembly to strengthen the United Nations peacekeeping\ncapability.\n\n180. And while this Organization works to limit violence\namong nations, we must not lose sight of the havoc\nwreaked by those who perpetrate terrorist acts on innocent\npersons. No sin(;k' nation, acting alone, can deal adequately\nwith this serious problem. Collective action is essential.\n\n\n\n181.\tWe are beginning to make some progress. Last year the General Assembly adopted a significant resolution on aircraft hijacking resolution 32/8. The Joint Statement on International Terrorism adopted on 17 July 1978 at the Bonn Economic Summit Conference  produced a much needed agreement on the harbouring of hijackers. We strongly urge all nations to subscribe to this Statement.\n182.\tThe pursuit of peace and security must go beyond resolving conflicts and preventing violence. The security of all is enhanced if nations limit the weapons of war through mutually negotiated arms control agreements.\n183.\tWe are engaged with the Soviet Union and other nations in a broad range of arms control negotiations.\n184.\tThe conclusion of a strategic arms limitation agreement with the Soviet Union is a fundamental goal of the United States. We hope that we may conclude an agreement as a result of the second series of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks before the end of this year.\n185.\tThe United States hopes that early progress can be made in concluding a comprehensive agreement to end the testing of nuclear weapons.\n186.\tIncreased efforts are critically needed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. It is important to prepare fully for the 1980 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; to continue to make progress in the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation; and to recognize one of the important achievements of the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament: the decision by several nuclear Powers to pledge, under specific circumstances, to refrain from use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States. We suggest that the Security Council take note of these pledges.\n187.\tThe United States will also work to ensure compliance with the call in the Declaration of Principles and Programme of Action of the special session on disarmament [see resolution S-10/2] for restraint in the transfer of conventional arms. We are actively discussing with the Soviet Union how our two nations might encourage restraint in consistency with the legitimate right to self-defence and international obligations. We are encouraged by the new initiatives already being taken to promote restraint on a regional basis in Latin America and we stand ready to support similar efforts by countries in other regions.\n188.\tIn conclusion, let me emphasize that on all the issues I have addressed today what we share is greater than how we differ. We share the same small planet. We share human aspirations\u2014for better lives, for greater opportunity, for freedom and security. And because we share a common destiny, we are compelled to resolve our differences.\n189.\tIf we focus on these common interests, we can begin to find the common ground for global progress. We can, as Jean Monnet said, \\\"put our problems on one side of the table and all of us on the other\\\".\n190.\tThe measure of our progress will not be whether we achieve all our goals in this generation, for that will surely not be possible. It is whether we can now summon the will to move forward together so that our children may benefit from our efforts and our vision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff138.\tIt is a great pleasure and honour for me to convey to Mr. Lievano, through you, Sir, on behalf of my Foreign Minister\u2014who, for compelling reasons, is unable to attend this crucial session-and on behalf of the delegation of the State of Qatar, warmest and most sincere congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. His election to that important post is a clear acknowledgement of his excellent personal attributes and his thorough knowledge of the working of this Organization, which fill us with confidence that he will carry out his immense task with skill and wisdom.\n139.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the President's predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, on the excellent way in which he directed the work of the thirty-second session of the .General Assembly.\n140.\tSimilarly, my country's delegation would like to praise the great efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in the service of the international community, and to assure him of our total and sincere co-operation in his noble task.\n141.\tIt is also with pleasure that my country salutes and welcomes the admission of the Republic of Solomon Islands to membership in the United Nations, a new victory for justice and for the freedom-loving peoples. My country's delegation would like to take this opportunity to wish this young nation success in consolidating its independence.\n142.\tThe true suffering experienced by humanity makes it incumbent on the United Nations not to be a mere rostrum for ideologies or only a medium for disseminating messages of peoples' aspirations and hopes. Man's suffering imposes on our world Organization the need to be a base for serious work and a place for achievement and the achievement of all our legitimate ambitions as an international family, united in striving for a. better life.\n143.\tThe United Nations emerged at the end of the Second World War pledged to achieve peace, security and freedom for all peoples, but we find a bitter state of affairs after 30 years of activity. Our international Organization has not fulfilled its pledge, not out of lack of capability or deficiency in the provisions of its Charter, but because of the great Powers' hegemony and their persistence in imposing schemes and policies based on interests that do not correspond with human aspirations to freedom, peace and security. We can only reiterate that the proclaimed human rights are an ideal. We ask at the same time, \\\"Where is its effective implementation, and what is its extent? \\\"\nToday, 30 years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted, we find countries practising racial discrimination in its most abominable forms, discrimination based on race, religion, language or thought, in addition to colonialism and other forms of military and economic aggression practised by Governments signatories of the Declaration. The principles and articles of the Declaration have no effect in restraining those Governments from using those hideous methods, which amount to a degradation of human dignity and a denial of basic rights.\n144.\tThe issue of decolonization and the liquidation of all the remnants of racism and racial discrimination is directly related to the preservation of international peace and security and the alleviation of world tensions, sparing the world the misery of war and armed struggles. Yet racist regimes still practise various forms of repression, persecution and mass murder against the original inhabitants of South Africa and Rhodesia.\n145.\tThose odious racist regimes would not have been able to survive without the political, military and economic support that they receive from some Western countries, and especially from Israel, which has now come to represent the prime source of weapons for those despised regimes. We in the State of Qatar hail and support the heroic struggle of those peoples who still suffer under the yoke of colonialism and foreign domination. We shall support their efforts until they achieve total liberation. We appeal to the countries that support the racist regimes, whether in the economic, military or nuclear fields, to stop their assistance immediately. We also appeal to all countries to increase their assistance to the peoples that have fallen under the yoke of racial discrimination and segregation. We call upon the world community to reject any steps taken by the South African Government tending to weaken the geographical unity and security of the territory of Namibia and to oppose the legitimate and free expression of the will of the people of the Territory concerning its future. Any constitutional arrangements drawn up for this Territory ought to be considered invalid unless they are based on the views and wishes of the legitimate representatives of the Namibian people under the leadership of SWAPO and in conformity with Security Council resolution 385 (1976), concerning the exercise by Namibia of its inalienable right to freedom, national independence and the integrity of its territory, including Walvis Bay, which is an integral part of that Territory.\n146.\tThe world today is heading towards a catastrophe which threatens humanity with extinction as a result of the frantic arms race and the accumulation of destructive weapons, especially nuclear weapons. The arms race not only threatens us with the catastrophe of extinction but saps our human, material and intellectual resources at a time when the peoples of the world in general, and the developing countries in particular, are in dire need of those resources to dispel the spectre of hunger. To that end the non-aligned countries took the first initiative for the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the problems of disarmament. Its aim was to dispel the spectre of war and extermination that threatens mankind and to divert the material and human resources devoted to the production of weapons to the field of development. For the first time in the history of the United\nNations a special session was convinced for a global evaluation of the question of disarmament, a question that lies at the heart of the problem of our world order. International concern regarding that session gave us reason to hope that resolutions and recommendations would be adopted that would further disarmament and limit armaments, thus speeding up the process of economic development. Yet the great Powers which are directly responsible for the escalation of armaments did not make any tangible efforts for the success of the session, because they had a negative attitude to it. They also torpedoed many of the constructive proposals put forward by the third-world countries.\n147.\tMy Government supports and reaffirms the principal role to be played by the United Nations in the field of disarmament in achieving the complete implementation of the provisions of the Final Document of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament [resolution S-10/2J, in increasing efforts to ensure an end to the arms race, especially the nuclear arms race, and in diverting efforts in the opposite direction to serve the economic and social development of all peoples.\n148.\tThe State of Qatar also fully supports the special declarations regarding the establishment of nuclear-free zones in the Middle East, the Indian Ocean, South Asia, Africa and Latin America and to make all the oceans and seas zones of peace. In our view, this will contribute to the alleviation of international tension, dissipate the fear that hovers over the peoples in those areas and strengthen international peace and security.\n149.\tMy country also supports the notion of providing comprehensive international guarantees to the countries that do not have nuclear weapons and of having the United Nations, and especially the Security Council, take effective measures against South Africa and Israel to prevent them from exercising nuclear blackmail. There is no doubt that Israel's refusal to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will certainly expose that particular region to the dangers of destructive nuclear weapons.\n150.\tThe imbalance in the economic relations between the developed and the developing countries has come to endanger peace and stability in the world and to jeopardize its prosperity and progress. It is among the most important reasons for the initiation of the North-South dialogue for the building of a new international economic order based on the principles of justice and equality among nations in regard to their policies and the control of their national resources without foreign interference. However, that dialogue did not reach its desired conclusion, because of the developed countries' position. Therefore my country stresses the importance of resuming the North-South dialogue in order to deal with the problems of raw materials, energy and development and to solve them on the basis of the resolutions of the General Assembly's sixth special session, namely the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)].\n151.\tIn the light of the worsening economic situation in the developing countries, which are unable to solve their development problems alone, it is imperative to establish profitable technical co-operation between those developing countries and the developed ones and to stop foreign monopolies from jeopardizing and obstructing the efforts of the developing countries for the achievement of economic independence. It is deplorable that the developed countries export their economic problems of inflation and rising costs to developing ones instead of assisting them with their practical experience, technology and technical training. All the present economic indicators point unequivocally to the fact that the international monopolies are plundering the third world's wealth without helping its development, thus creating a huge gap between the revenues of the developing - countries and those of the developed ones.\n152.\tThe consecutive sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea constitute an outstanding precedent in the history of our Organization and that of the world, but we note that those meetings have not yet produced an agreement on a final convention which would deal with extremely important subjects on a just basis and specify the means for the maximum utilization of the vast natural resources in the oceans in order to make them available for the general good of humanity at large. Some very important questions are still under discussion, such as those of the international authority, economic zones, the rights of land-locked and geographically disadvantaged countries, the peaceful and legal means necessary to solve disputes that arise between countries over the aforementioned questions and others related to the exploitation of maritime natural resources.\n153.\tIt is obvious from the discussions and1 deliberations of the Conference that the major Powers are ignoring the vital interests of the developing countries and raising obstacles in order to prevent the Conference from reaching its desired conclusion and from solving the questions under consideration in a way that would enhance the exploitation of resources and their just distribution. The State of Qatar appeals to the great Powers to abandon their egotism and give the same consideration to the interests of other countries, especially the developing ones, as they give to their own. \n154.\tThe question of Cyprus remains unsolved despite the commendable efforts exerted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Consequently, the Government of Qatar supports the holding of serious and constructive negotiations to solve this problem. Those negotiations should be held freely with equality of representation, and without foreign intervention, so that eventually an agreement acceptable to the relevant parties could be reached which would achieve independence and territorial integrity for the island and guarantee its non-alignment, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX).\n155.\tMy Government also welcomes the efforts being exerted to solve the Korean problem by peaceful means free from foreign intervention. My Government believes that a peaceful solution of the Cypriot and Korean problems would contribute to the easing of international tensions and the strengthening of world peace and security.\n156.\tThe situation in the Middle East is fraught with the . gloomiest consequences as a result of the stubborn intransigence of the Zionist entity and its procrastination and lack of commitment to United Nations resolutions, especially General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX), which aims at the establishment of a just and permanent peace in the Middle East. This entity, based on Zionism, which has been judged by the United Nations to be a form of racism, is still occupying Syrian and Egyptian territories in addition to the whole Palestinian homeland, thereby violating the sovereignty of Member nations of the United Nations and preventing the Palestinian people from exercising its legitimate inalienable national rights, including the right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent State on its own national soil.\n157.\tThe primary goal of Israeli aggression is the achievement of Israel's expansionist aims, as has been clear from the time of the armistice until now from the various ways in which the Israeli authorities have annexed demilitarized zones and subsequently occupied the whole of Palestine and portions of Egypt, Syria and Lebanon. As this is not the time to list continuous Israeli aggressions from the inception of Israel to the present day, I shall limit myself to the latest aggression against Lebanon and the occupation of parts of the territory of that country. Israel is still persisting in this occupation, defying the United Nations Charter and disregarding Security Council resolution 425 (1978), which calls for immediate Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, and Security Council resolution 426(1978). Israel committed that aggression in fulfilment of goals and plans that are based on expansion and aggression, in fulfilment of the Zionist colonialist plan to establish a Jewish national homeland and the desire of some Western nations to secure their interests in the Arab region, and in fulfilment of Israel's role of the powerful guard who guarantees the division of the Arab world and its exhaustion in order to prevent its progress towards the exploitation of its own natural resources.\n158.\tBy repeated aggressions Israel is manoeuvring itself into a more strategic position for further territorial expansion, and therefore Zionism will never accept any international guarantees of its boundaries with Arab States in spite of its persistent claim to want those guarantees. Israel can never live in peace within the boundaries that were decided upon at its inception for the following five reasons: first, because of considerations appropriate to its basic ideological belief that it must establish a state within an area larger than its boundaries; secondly, because it follows a policy of encouraging immigration and the absorption of the majority of world Jewry; thirdly, because of its worsening economic situation; fourthly, because of its nature as a colonialist stooge in the area, which makes it constantly seek to keep the area in a state of tension and upheaval; and fifthly, because it has benefited from the constant state of tension and upheaval in the area which has enabled it to remain in the spotlight and allowed it to request more funds from international Zionist organizations and to receive increased support from some countries which have a vested interest in it.\n159.\tThe Palestinian problem is at the core of the dispute in the Middle East and at the heart of its bloody struggle, a struggle that was imposed by Israel on the Palestinian Arab people after Israel forced them to leave their homeland and possessions through repeated savage and barbaric aggressions over recent years. That wicked aggressor has used various savage and barbaric practices against the Palestinian people and is planning to liquidate the Palestinian cause. In spite of all Israel's criminal, barbaric deeds it has not succeeded in exterminating the Palestinian people or in liquidating their just cause. Instead, the Palestinian people, through its national liberation struggle, is proceeding to the recovery of its legitimate rights and will be able through its steadfastness and continuous struggle and with the assistance and support of the peace-loving nations of the world, to impose its existence and defeat all Zionist plans to eliminate it.\n160.\tThe world community as a whole is convinced that the Palestinian question is at the heart of the Middle East struggle and that there cannot be a solution to that struggle without a just solution to this problem in accordance with international law and the resolutions and Charter of the United Nations. A just and lasting peace in the Middle East requires the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the territories Israel occupies and its recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people. The Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries that was held in Belgrade recently reiterated what has already been accepted by the world community, namely, the importance of strengthening co-ordination between the non-aligned countries and the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people [see Aj33/206, annex I, para. 65J. It also reiterated the right of the PLO to reject all forms of compromise settlements and solutions that aim at the liquidation of the Palestinian cause and the denial of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people. The Government of Qatar totally supports the important decision adopted by the Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries which calls for the convening of a special session of the General Assembly on the question of Palestine, with a view to adopting measures conducive to the implementation of the United Nations resolutions concerning Israeli withdrawal from occupied Palestinian and Arab territories as well as the achievement of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people [ibid., annex III, resolution on the Middle East, para. 21].\n161.\tThe question of Palestine is an international issue at the heart of the Middle East struggle and upon its solution depends peace or war in the region. There cannot be peace and security in the Middle East without the recovery by the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights under the leadership of the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and the total withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories, including Arab Jerusalem. It is therefore incumbent on our world Organization, and all its organs to strengthen international faith in its capacity to make peace, bring about stability, ensure justice and restore the rights of rightful owners. We are confident that through the honest collective determination of all Member States we shall be able to realize these noble and lofty objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff236.\tAllow me first of all to convey to you, Sir, the cordial congratulations of the delegation of the People's Republic of Benin on the occasion of your outstanding election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. My country is glad to see you in charge of the work of the Assembly this year. By elevating you to this high office, the Assembly has sought to pay tribute to your eminent self, but at the same time it has paid a tribute to your country, the Republic of Colombia, a country which has always played a dynamic role, not just within the Latin American sphere, but also in the context of the countries of the world which are resolutely committed to the sacred battle for the establishment of the new international economic order. My delegation is convinced that under your wise and far-sighted leadership the work of this session will be crowned with success.\n237.\tMr. President, you are the successor to one of the most distinguished Presidents of the Assembly, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, Deputy Federal Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to whom my delegation offers its admiration and esteem for the remarkable way in which he conducted the work of the thirty-second session, and for the unflagging spirit he showed at the eighth, ninth and tenth special sessions of this Assembly. The results achieved by those sessions might not appear to amount to very much, but that in no way detracts from the merits and the qualities of this statesman, who is known for his tact and perspicacity. We would now be congratulating Mr. Mojsov on the positive result, achieved during his term of office, were it not for the discreet but extremely effective and praiseworthy assistance he received from our Secretary-General, Mr. Kua Waldheim. My delegation yet again wishes to pay a tribute to the outstanding qualities of the chief officer of this Organization, and his dedication to the cause of the noble ideals of international peace and security. We are convinced that, with him, this Organization will continue to make positive progress towards the realization of the noble objectives which it has set itself, and will do so thanks to the support of each and every one of us.\n238.\tMy country, the People's Republic of Benin, warmly welcomes the accession of Solomon Islands to full national sovereignty and its admission to the United Nations. My delegation assures the representatives of this new State of its active solidarity and brotherly co-operation.\n239.\tWe find ourselves today meeting once again in this forum to express our hopes for a better future. We are meeting here again to seek through the growing awareness of the peoples of the whole world\u2014and more particularly the awareness of the exploited and oppressed peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America\u2014just solutions to the numerous problems confronting mankind at the present time. The decisions that we take here and the challenges with which we will be confronted involve not only the immediate future of the exploited and oppressed peoples of the world, who are refusing to remain eternally passive in their status of outcasts and refusing to be excluded from the march of progress, but also the future of the generations to come and the future of our children, who will have to continue the task of promoting the cause of the human person, the cause of peace and justice, and all the noble ideals which form the very purpose of the existence of this Organization.\n240.\tThe problems confronting the international community are numerous and complex. But some of these problems, by their scope and their importance, are coextensive with -certain others and are viewed by our peoples as being of particular relevance. This is true, for example, of the problem of international peace and security.\n241.\tIt is without question a platitude to affirm that the peoples of the world want peace, a peace which would make possible their development and the satisfaction of their legitimate aspirations. It is equally banal to say that the peoples of the world desire security. The quest for peace and security has always been in fact at the very core of the concern of the peoples of the world as a whole. The Government of the People's Republic of Benin, faithful to the legitimate aspirations of its people, struggles resolutely and consistently for the establishment of effective peace and security among all the nations of the globe and makes available its militant and unreserved support for all concrete initiatives taken in this sphere by friendly countries. The People's Republic of Benin supports the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the first review session in Belgrade, and regards their results as of great importance in the quest for international peace and security. It salutes the countries and organizations which promoted those conferences and congratulates in particular the Soviet Union and the socialist countries for the decisive role which they have played in the success and in the results which have been achieved. Thanks to the efforts of those countries and the farces of progress in the world at large, a measure of detente has come about in relations between socialist and capitalist countries. This is certainly an important contribution to the cause of international peace and security, and a major new factor in international relations.\n242.\tNone the less, to be quite truthful my delegation must say that in order to achieve the desired effectiveness and take into account the true problems of the present time, those agreements must be extended to all regions of the world, and their content applied to the whole of the international community.\n243.\tPeace, like security, is a fundamental aspiration common to all the peoples of the world which, both in its conception and its realization, cannot be split up into\nsectors. There will be peace and security for all peoples or for none. Here more than in any other area we must show great vigilance to ensure that our laborious efforts to attain an objective so close to the hearts of our peoples will not be surreptitiously and dishonestly used by some for their own purposes, against our peoples and, in the last resort, against international peace and security.\n244.\tWe must be quite aware that, even considered in a partial sense, peace today has nothing but friends but some of those who speak most loudly about it do not always have the purest of intentions. Otherwise, how is it possible that, while everyone talks about international peace and security, the yearning of the African peoples for peace and security is being thwarted in the most brutal and, indeed, the most official manner by the diabolical undertakings, the subversive manoeuvres and the repeated and manifold forms of aggression committed by certain Western capitalist Powers, which openly oppose peace and security for the African peoples?\n245.\tHow is it possible that, at a time when everyone talks about international peace and security, the leaders of those countries at the very highest level openly make threats of reprisals and of colonial reconquest against the countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America which oppose their exploitation and diktat, and indeed actually carry out those threats?\n246.\tWe very much fear that behind these professions of faith and sweet words the imperialist Power really see in the agreements signed at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at Helsinki and the limited detente achieved in Europe as nothing more than a long-dreamed-of opportunity for them to free themselves of the European front in order to concentrate all their military, economic\nfinancial might against our defenceless countries.\n247.\tEveryone is aware that the dominant fact of the international situation today is the exacerbation at a critical level of the contradictions between international imperialism, with its record of exploitation, and the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America, who have been oppressed and plundered, between the camp of the forces of liberation and progress and the camp of oppression and man's exploitation of man.\n248.\tThroughout the world today, the dominant and irreversible trend of the struggle of the peoples is towards revolution. In Asia, in Latin America and, more particularly, in Africa, the situation is characterized by the struggle of countries and peoples to break the chains of imperialist domination, to put an end once and for all to reactionary social and economic structures inherited from colonialism and neo-colonialism and to take their destiny into their own hands.\n249.\tFrom being exploited, alienated and mere chattels, the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America have now become enlightened and active participants in world history. That is why the liberation movements in the various parts of the world are struggling to snatch their confiscated national independence and sovereignty from the claws of the colonial Powers. That is why the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America are resolutely struggling to snatch their\npilfered natural resources from the grasp of the great capitalist monopolies. That is why the working classes of the capitalist countries are struggling to overthrow the bourgeoisie and to eliminate the unjust system of exploitation practised at their expense. That is why the revolutionary storm is blowing ever stronger each day causing disarray in the imperialist circles of the world.\n250.\tFaced with this irresistible surge of the struggle of the peoples for their liberation and independence, international imperialism, finding itself hard pressed, now aims at our countries certain criminal designs involving armed aggression, the physical elimination of political leaders, the destabilization of progressive regimes in order to recover their lost positions, to gag our peoples and quietly to pursue the plundering of our natural resources.\n251.\tIn the People's Republic of Benin, the continuous and impetuous development of our democratic and popular revolution and the brilliant victories won by the militant and hard-working people of Benin on all fronts of the struggle, especially since the proclamation of 30 November 1974 of its choice of scientific socialism as the path of development, has constantly given rise to the fury and rage of international imperialism.\n252.\tOur fundamental objective is the complete and final elimination of the material and ideological bases of imperialism in our country with a view to its liberation from foreign domination and all forms of exploitation, oppression and alienation, in order to construct in the People's Republic of Benin a prosperous and independent national economy and a socialist society in which it will be good for all citizens, both men and women, of Benin to live, relying on their own strength.\t\n253.\tIt is our firm determination to attain these noble objectives, which accounts for all the plots and attacks on the part of reactionary forces, both local and international, plots and attacks which reached their pinnacle with the ignoble imperialist armed aggression of which our country, our people and the revolution were the victims on Sunday, 16 January 1977.\n254.\tCondemning armed imperialist aggression in its resolutions 404 (1977), 405 (1977) and 419 (1977), the Security Council invited the international community to contribute to making good the damages suffered by our country. The Secretary-General's report, which appeared on 29 September in document S/1287320 gives an account of the favourable and positive reactions of the international community with regard to the appeal made at that time by the Security Council.\n255.\tThis is a fitting occasion on which to renew our sincere thanks to all the States and international organizations which have been unstinting in their support during these painful events.\n256.\tWe are surprised that certain States which without any doubt play a major role on the international political scene and which unequivocally declare their concern for the\nmaintenance of peace and security throughout the world did not feel any obligation to contribute towards compensating the People's Republic of Benin for the damages it suffered, although they recognized and condemned that ignominious and criminal act against a sovereign State as a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of an independent country and a grave threat to international peace and security. At any rate, taking into account the gravity of this iniquitous act and the danger which it represents for the independent African countries, the African Heads of State and Government at the fifteenth ordinary session of the Organization of African Unity [OAUJ roundly condemned the armed imperialist aggression committed against my country, as well as those who had planned, organized, financed and carried it out.\n257.\tThe people of Benin is not suffering from \\\"aggressionitis\\\". No, far from it; the people of Benin is not obsessed with the fear of aggression.\n258.\tThe question of imperialist aggression and policies of war and colonial reconquest is not something peculiar to my country. It concerns all the progressive countries wishing to affirm their sovereignty and national independence.\n259.\tImperialist aggression and the implementation of policies of war and colonial reconquest today constitute a real danger to international peace and security.\n260.\tIf it wishes to remain consistent with its own declarations, the international community is not entitled to remain indifferent to this important problem.\n261.\tInternational imperialism in its essence and objectives has remained true to form. It is not prepared to yield on any of the countless interests which it has dishonestly arrogated to itself at the expense of the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America. It obstinately insists on maintaining its domination over the world and continuing with the shameless plunder of our wealth, and any desire for genuine independence immediately brings intervention on its part. Thus numerous threats of aggression still hover over our countries, which only aspire to peace and security so that the pressing objectives of their economic and social development can be attained. My country, the People's Republic of Benin, is one of those countries.\n262.\tIn the implementation of the policy of war and -colonial reconquest of international imperialism, certain .African Heads of State are playing a role which is\nparticularly harmful and prejudicial to peace and security in Africa. There is one among them who is personally most hostile to the peace and security of the people of Benin.\n263.\tIndeed, when at Khartoum, in the Democratic Republic of the Sudan, the Heads of State of the OAU adopted a resolution vigorously condemning the armed imperialist aggression which had been cynically perpetrated against my country, the People's Republic of Benin, as well as those who had planned, organized, financed and carried it out; when at Khartoum the Heads of State of the OAU resolutely condemned all threats of imperialist aggression which weigh so dangerously on the sister Republic of Sao Tome and Principe; when at Khartoum the Council of\nMinisters of the OAU took the historic decision to expel from the Assembly the representatives of Bob Denard\u2014this adventure-seeking mercenary well known in Africa and the world, this international outlaw who in a still recent past was the sole and genuine master of the Comoros-when at the Assembly of the Heads of State of the OAU at Khartoum the question of the base, cowardly and barbaric armed aggression of colonial reconquest against my country, the People's Republic of Benin, was discussed and firmly condemned, international imperialism, with the culpable complicity of that puppet African Head of State, decided to launch a new criminal assault in its senseless dream to destabilize at all costs our revolutionary regime and put an end to the revolution of the people of Benin. Thus, after the crushing defeat of the vile aggressors on 16 January 1977, a particularly bloody and murderous man-hunt was unleashed on 21 July 1978 against my compatriots, throughout the country and on the express order of this African Head of State.\n264.\tThis African Head of State has thereby incurred grave historical responsibility by violating more than once the fundamental principles of human rights so dear to all of us, principles which are contained in the Charters of the OAU and the United Nations.\n265.\tThat is why, on behalf of the peaceful industrious and militant people of Benin as a whole and its democratic popular revolution, we appeal in this Assembly to all States Members of the United Nations and all the peoples of the world which desire peace, justice, dignity and social progress to bear witness to our words.\n266.\tThe OAU and the United Nations, as well as history, have recognized and recorded the sole responsibility of that African Head of State for these criminal and inhumane acts of plunder and the systematic looting of property, rapes, murders, humiliations and extortions of all sorts against thousands of men, women and children of Benin who were living in peace and working together with the people of that brother country and who were torn away from their work and gagged, pushed along and led away like cattle and left in concentration camps without food or care in abominable hygienic conditions and at the mercy of the weather. What is more, it was in those conditions that on 5 August 1978, upon the personal instructions of that African Head of State, his country's soldiers opened fire in cold blood on a crowd of innocent victims, again causing several dead and wounded.\n267.\tThe criminal decision on the expulsion of Benin citizens taken by that puppet African Head of State and his imperialist masters fits nicely into their policy of aggression and destabilization of the regimes of progressive countries of our great and beautiful African continent.\n268.\tHowever, in the face of the increasingly aggressive behaviour of its enemies from within and outside, the people of Benin have closed ranks so as to move more resolutely towards socialist development.\n269.\tMy country, the People's Republic of Benin, can but renew here before this Assembly the expression - of its satisfaction at the historic decision of the Council of Ministers of the OAU at its thirty-first session at Khartoum\nto expel from the Conference the representatives of Bob Denard, that well-known French mercenary and adventurer.\n270.\tNo one today has any doubt that Bob Denard, this knave well known to the peoples of Zaire, Nigeria, the Sudan and Angola, was the infamous Colonel Bourgeaud of Cotonou. This professional perpetrator of mass crimes has now been reported as having left Moroni for an unknown destination, after having, of course, completed his crime. Towards what country and towards the murder of which African or other people are the dark forces which manipulate this dangerous adventurer soon to be steering him? And what kind of international peace and security will result?\n271.\tAll of these facts eloquently prove that the imperialist policy of colonial reconquest is not mere empty words. International imperialism shrinks from nothing in its attempt once again to endanger the independence of numerous African States and the most effective and least compromising way for them to achieve their diabolical aims is the use of mercenaries. The peoples of the world must courageously denounce those Powers which come here and talk profusely of international peace and security, the need to leave Africa to the Africans, of non-interference in the affairs of independent African States, but at the same time step up their policy of aggression and brute force in Africa.\n272.\tThe people of Benin, its Government and progressive party, the Party of the Popular Revolution of Benin, headed by our distinguished militant comrade, President Kerekou, have clearly understood all these fine honeyed words of imperialism which is so arrogant in its exploitation and oppression. The Benin people, its Government and party have understood now that international imperialism will continue with repeated plots and acts of aggression against our national democratic and popular revolution and it will not resign itself to the crushing defeat which it suffered in our country on 16 January 1977. The Benin people, its Government and party, have perfectly well understood that, in order to thwart the subversive designs of international imperialism and to free itself completely from foreign rule, the continuous strengthening of the unity and solidarity of the peoples of the world who cherish peace and liberty is indispensable. This is why, on the initiative of our progressive party, the Party of the Popular Revolution of Benin, a week, of solidarity with the peoples and countries which are struggling for their national liberation and the International Conference on Mercenaries were organized at Cotonou from 9 to 16 January 1978 to celebrate the first anniversary of 16 January 1977, on which date our people crushed the imperialist aggression against it.\n273.\tForty or so delegations representing democratic countries, parties and organizations took an active part in these events. The delegations worked without interruption in an atmosphere of cordial friendship and drafted a number of important documents including the Declaration of Cotonouz1 and a general declaration on the use of mercenaries. These documents are a positive contribution\nto the problem of the maintenance of international peace and security and as such they have been published as official documents of the Security Council.\n274.\tThe peoples of the world that are the victims of humiliation, harassment and aggression by international imperialism, those peoples whose national resources have been systematically looted by capitalist monopolies, must abide strictly by the spirit of Cotonou. They must unite and organize themselves increasingly over a broad front in order to oppose imperialism's policy of war and intervention and must by deeds require imperialism not only to. recognize the rights of peoples to self-determination and to the choice of the economic and social system they prefer, but also to abolish the use of mercenaries in the world, in other words to respect international peace and security.\n275.\tTotal decolonization of the territories still under colonial rule is also an essential prerequisite for the preservation of international peace and security. The imperialist Powers which pursue their policy of war, aggression and provocation are quite well aware of this, so much so that they spare no effort to prevent the real decolonization of countries still under colonial rule.\n276.\tThat is why those imperialist Powers give massive financial, economic, political and military support to the minority colonialist, racist and Fascist regimes of southern Africa with a view to keeping under their control the  immense wealth of Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa.\n277.\tThese territories under colonial and foreign rule are the main bridge-head of international imperialism in Africa today. Their total liberation and the ending of the oppression and exploitation suffered by the African populations of southern Africa is a matter of grave concern for the imperialist Powers, which still cling to their selfish and dishonest interests. Everything, including armed violence, has been set in motion in order to thwart the legitimate aspirations of the people of these territories to independence, sovereignty, peace and security in the land of their forefathers. The decolonization of Namibia and Zimbabwe are thus two matters of very special concern to imperialism and for a very good reason. The strategy of the imperialist Powers, confronted as they are with the inevitability of the liberation and independence of these Territories is now to use every stratagem to put in their own puppets and set up fake neo-colonial regimes wholly dedicated to the defence of imperialist interests. This is the aim of the numerous plans for so-called \\\"peaceful negotiation\\\" being rigged up here and there today in connexion with Namibia and Rhodesia and which, to the accompaniment of great diplomatic proclamations, are being forced down the throat of the international community.\n278.\tNamibia, a Territory adjacent to the racist bastion of oppression and exploitation, South Africa, is the subject of a plan for a settlement of this sort.\n279.\tMy delegation wishes to reaffirm that the famous so-called Western plan for the settlement of the Namibian question23 would never have seen the light of day at all had\nit not been for the long armed struggle of the Namibian people under the far-sighted leadership of its revolutionary vanguard, SWAPO, and without the concessions and serious compromises made by the leaders of SWAPO.\n280.\tWe therefore wish to express our concern at the results to be expected from the present set-up which is designed solely to encourage an alleged internal solution where everything is being done to facilitate the task of the Pretoria regime, which has already rigged the electoral rolls so as to permit the placing in office of a bogus regime which would set up a nice cordon sanitaire, as it were, for the racist bastion of southern Africa. The Namibian people, in our opinion, must recover their full independence and enjoy the integrity of their territory, including Walvis Bay.\n281.\tIn Southern Rhodesia the masquerade of the imperialist Powers who support the regime of the devious Mr. Smith has now reached its peak, all the attempts to break the united activity of the Patriotic Front and the front-line countries, for the benefit of the internal settlement, having literally failed.\n282.\tEver since the so-called rebellion of that British colony, despite all the assurances we were given here, the Western Powers-and particularly the United Kingdom, the administering Power\u2014have done nothing but openly violate the mandatory sanctions imposed by our Organization on the illegal Smith regime.\n283.\tThe recent scandal of the breach of the sanctions discovered in the United Kingdom is one more proof of the immoral nature of Western policies in southern Africa.\n284.\tThe People's Republic of Benin will continue to support the policy defined and defended by the Patriotic Front for the total liberation of Zimbabwe. The internal settlement concluded on 3 March 1978 is entirely bogus. It is a gross attempt to fool everyone. We condemn and oppose it because it is designed not, as some would have us believe, to create an independent Zimbabwe, but simply to set up a neo-colonial regime dedicated to international imperialism.\n285.\tThe People's Republic of Benin appeals to all peoples that cherish peace and justice to give diplomatic and material aid to the Patriotic Front in the armed struggle that must lead to the total independence of Zimbabwe.\n286.\tIn Western Sahara international imperialism gives financial and economic support, and support in the form of the most sophisticated military equipment, to the Moroccan annexationists and expansionists, with their insane dream of preventing the Saharan people by all means, including genocide, from exercising their legitimate right to self-determination, independence and national sovereignty.\n287.\tYet the Frente POLISARIO, in deciding on a unilateral cease-fire on the Mauritanian front after the recent political changes in that country, a decision confirmed by the recent Congress of the Frente POLISARIO, has proved to the world that its people want only to have\npeace and to live in complete harmony with all the peoples of the region.\n288.\tThe People's Republic of Benin reaffirms its complete support for the just cause of the Saharan people, and supports the resolutions of the Third Congress of the Frente POLISARIO calling for the total liberation of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic from the claws of international imperialism and its Moroccan puppets.\n289.\tThe Middle East is also a region in which, in order to endanger peace and security there, imperialism is doing its best to spread disorder and terror.\n290.\tThe People's Republic of Benin unequivocally reaffirms the right of the Palestinian people to life, independence and national sovereignty. The twin policy of the imperialist Powers, to stifle and eliminate Palestinian resistance, makes it necessary for this Organization to remain vigilant in order to thwart all the Machiavellian delaying tactics and the attempts at division cynically carried out by imperialism so that the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East will not take place with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization PLO.\n291.\tMy delegation reaffirms that the Palestinian problem is the very core of the question of the Middle East, and that no just and lasting solution can be found unless this painful problem is settled with the effective participation of the PLO.\n292.\tRecently a great deal of ink and a great deal of hot air have been .expended on the subject of human rights. Human rights are the right to life, freedom, work, well-being and dignity. It is paradoxical that it is precisely those who would pass themselves off as the champions and most ardent defenders of those rights that are the first to deny them to others.\n293.\tWhat countries give economic, military and political support to the Fascist regimes of Latin America, the racist regimes of Africa and the puppet regimes of Asia?\n294.\tHow can one talk of human rights and at the same time ally oneself with Pinochet, Vorster, and Park Chung Hee?\n295.\tHow can one talk- of human rights and permit on one's own soil the recruitment, training and financing of mercenaries, these specialists in mass crimes?\n296.\tHow can one talk of human rights and refuse to the peoples the right to self-determination?\n297.\tHow can one talk of human rights and stubbornly oppose the principle of the sovereignty of States over their natural resources?\n298.\tHow can one talk of human rights and firmly support the odious system of apartheid and racial discrimination?\n299.\tTo establish the rights to life, freedom, dignity, work and human well-being, it is necessary to put an end to the odious system of the exploitation of man by man.\n300.\tYoung people and students from all over the world, who represent mankind's future, have well understood this question. That is why at the Eleventh Festival of Youth and Students held in Havana, in the free land of Cuba, in July this year, they accused and rightly condemned imperialism as being responsible for all the evils afflicting mankind. That is why they rightly proclaimed that the struggle for a new international economic order was an integral part of the anti-imperialist struggle, of the struggle for independence and national sovereignty.\n301.\tThe forces of exploitation and domination are today becoming increasingly aware of the danger of destruction hanging over them in the shape of the struggles for liberation of the peoples. That is why they are increasing their brutality and violence, allying themselves with reactionary forces in all countries, maintaining military bases and recruiting mercenaries. That is why the oppressed countries and peoples must resolve the contradictions that must inevitably arise between them and unite in the common struggle against the common enemy.\n302.\tThe forces of exploitation and oppression are allying themselves in all spheres with the forces of reaction throughout the world. The forces of progress, democracy and the well-being of the people must also unite and help each other, giving each other mutual support.\n303.\tThat is why we wish to declare aloud our militant gratitude to all the friendly countries whose internationalist aid constitutes a powerful factor in the development and consolidation of the national liberation struggle.\n304.\tFor the triumph of real peace and security for all the peoples of the world, my country, the People's Republic of Benin, firmly and resolutely supports the just struggle of the Korean people for the independence and peaceful reunification of their country. The puppet clique of Park Chung Hee must put an end to its policy of fascism and terror in the South of the country and stop its acts of provocation against the North. Foreign troops and arms must be completely removed.\n305.\tThe People's Republic of Benin firmly and resolutely supports the just struggle of the heroic peoples of Viet Nam, Kampuchea and Laos for the strengthening of their sovereignty and their national reconstruction.\n306.\tThe People's Republic of Benin firmly and resolutely supports the courageous struggle for national independence and sovereignty waged by the peoples of East Timor, the South Moluccas and Belize.\n307.\tThe People's Republic of Benin firmly and resolutely supports the revolutionary national liberation struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa and the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic.\n308.\tThe People's Republic of Benin firmly and resolutely supports the revolutionary struggle waged by the peoples of the Front-line countries in southern Africa-Angola, Mozambique, Botswana, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia.\n3Q9, The People's Republic of Benin firmly and resolutely supports the struggle of the peoples of Latin America against fascism and terror,\n310.\tSome 30 years ago the nations of the world, having seen the horrible, spectacular destruction of the Second World War, decided to create the United Nations as a centre for the permanent search for harmony, for the cause of peace and international security and the development of man\n311.\tSince then, however, many of the countries which at the time were most enthusiastic about the establishment of the United Nations and seemed most interested in its noble objectives, appear to have forgotten even the meaning of gratuitous armed violence, humiliation and misery unjustly inflicted on a people. They appear to have forgotten even the meaning of justice, liberty and the dignity of man. Impelled by their sordid designs and pursuing their petty mercantile interests and dreams of power, they have today become the champions of the repression of peoples who seek peace and freedom They have become the champions of oppression and the robbing of the hard-working masses and inflexible and merciless executioners arrogantly inflicting on defenceless peoples precisely those things which the world had fought from 1939 to 1945 to spare itself. We are profoundly dedicated to international peace and security and we are convinced that the shortest way to achieve it is not by war but by the simple restoration of justice for the benefit of the legion of the oppressed..\n312.\tAll the States represented in this Assembly, particularly those which still aspire to control and exploit others, must at last realize the meaning of true international peace and security and act accordingly to establish it. Those Powers which talk so much about peace and security in their own countries must put an end to their policies of war and plunder in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n313.\tThe militant, hard-working people of Benin, who seek to build in their own country an independent, prosperous national economy and construct a socialist society, are ready to work in harmony with all the nations of the world for the triumph of the noble ideals of this Organization: peace, security and justice. They are ripe for the revolution. The struggle continues.\n"

GAIRY (Grenada):\n\\\"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands,\n\\\"Serve the Lord with gladness; come before His presence with singing.\n\\\"Know ye that the Lord He is God; it is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.\n\\\"Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise: be thankful unto Him, and bless His name.\n\\\"For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting; and his Truth endureth to all generations.\\\" [Psalm 100.J\n174.\tPlease accept from our people, our Government and myself personally, from the depths of our hearts, warm and sincere greetings and felicitations, and, indeed, very best wishes for a successful and meaningful thirty-third session of our General Assembly currently in progress. Grenada is still the smallest Member of the United Nations, and we continue to reassert that we will not be inhibited in any way or at any time by our size. We have an irrevocable commitment to make our contribution, and in consequence we have been making-and by God's grace we shall continue to make\u2014our contributions in every sphere within the boundaries of the United Nations.\n175.\tPermit me, Sir, for and on behalf of our people and our Government and for myself personally, to extend to you our heartiest congratulations on your election as President of this thirty-third session of our General Assembly. Your election to that high and enviable office should be no surprise to those who have kept in touch with the illustrious record you have established in your public life in the areas of law, political ingenuity and statesmanship. Your supreme and excellent performance in these and certainly other areas leaves us with absolutely no doubt in our minds as to your ability to harness, identify and surmount the challenges and perform with excellence the task concomitant with your office, the office of the presidency. May God, the Supreme Architect, guide you, direct you and inspire you in the execution of your duties and obligations.\n176.\tMr. President, may I take this opportunity also to express congratulations and commendation to your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who held his office with dignity and with eminence. His task was by no means an easy one, since he had to preside over the thirty-second session and three special sessions during his term of office. I commend him and wish for him God's divine blessings.\n177.\tAnd now please permit me to say that I feel a deep sense of compulsion in stating that Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our Secretary-General, is loved and admired by all who come in contact with him. Mr. Waldheim is a true and living symbol and, indeed, a graphic manifestation of discipline with an unflinching dedication to world peace and a marked and special concern for the developing countries and the under privileged. It gives a feeling of joy and comfort, a feeling of inspiration, to hold a dialogue with our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, It is indeed a privilege and a blessing for us to have him as our Secretary-General. I wish him continued success in his office.\n178.\tOver the past year we have been saddened by the passing of men who had had distinguished careers and who in their private and public life gave hope for a world built on the principles of the freedom of peoples, peace and human rights. I refer to the untimely death of one of Italy's foremost statesmen, Prime Minister Aldo Moro. I refer also to the passing of the well respected Senator and former Vice-President of the United States of America, Hubert Humphrey, and more recently that of one of the champions of the liberation of black Africa, the late President of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta. The Caribbean also mourns the passing of a distinguished leader, Premier Robert Bradshaw of St. Kitts, Nevis and Anguila, a man who during his 30 years of political activities earned respect, not only among the people of the Caribbean, but also among the leaders of the Western Hemisphere.\n179.\tThe Christian Church in particular, especially millions of Roman Catholics the world over, and in a general way people of all denominations, beliefs and doctrines are still in a state of shock over the passing of such eminent spiritual leaders as Pope Paul VI and, more recently and more shockingly, Pope John Paul I. Death, transition, is indeed a very necessary and inescapable phenomenon. Unfortunately, however, the average man has not yet grown to accept this phenomenon as a rebirth. Death simply allows us to divest ourselves of our earthly habiliments, for man's body is simply a garment of flesh, a material robe, a vehicle by which man operates within earth's vibrations. But, fortunately or unfortunately, after physical death we must face the world of reality with full consciousness.\n180.\tWe mourn the passing, the transition, of our beloved ones. But mourning and sorrowfulness should never be allowed to supersede or to take precedence over the importance of the lessons we ought to learn from death- physical death. Man has grown to be so materialistic today that he places undue value and importance on his physical self, his material worth, his political power and achievements, in such a manner that all these things seem to overshadow the recognition of the real man, the soul- man's consciousness. From this important and inescapable event, death, let us learn a lesson; let us face the realities of life and recognize the fact that our life-span on earth is comparatively short and, in consequence, let us in conscience and in truth examine our life style; let us restructure our patterns of behaviour towards our fellow- men, for in the final analysis the decisive and all-important question is, \\\"How well we truly loved; how well we truly served\\\",\n181.\tPlease permit me to add my quota to the expressions of congratulations and welcome to Solomon Islands. Grenada has already stated its stand regarding freedom and independence for all emerging countries, and I now respectfully crave indulgence to repeat among the many expressions I adduced in this regard, one short statement:\n\\\"I am particularly gratified by every step taken, at any time, and in any part of the globe, bilaterally or unilaterally, with a view to giving full, uninhibited and unconditional freedom from colonial oppression or minority domination to our brothers and sisters, to join us in this assembly of people.\\\"\nI offer my heartiest congratulations to the Government and people of Solomon Islands and welcome that State as a Member of this body.\n182.\tDuring our four years of membership in the United Nations we have raised many matters of importance-some of which have been considered innovative, others were current and regular but our views ushered in new thoughts about them, thoughts that aroused new vistas in an attempt to tackle traditional thought-patterns. And still further we have been introducing some very thought-provoking subjects of world importance and world concern, subjects considered by some to be strange and extraneous, but which we feel are sufficiently important and significant to merit our constant articulation and review of them, however and whenever the opportunity permits. Permit me to refer to only a few: the question of women's rights, the universality of God, economic cruelty, the problems of man and his environment, disarmament, man and his material and spiritual behaviour, the Bermuda Triangle, unidentified flying objects and extraterrestrial phenomena, decolonization and territorial integrity, human rights, and undue solace given to terrorists.\n183.\tIt is my desire to make a contribution to the subject of the New International Economic Order relating to the third-world countries, and I must emphatically state that one of the most tragic circumstances in our time is the disturbingly slow rate at which the world is moving towards the establishment of a New International Economic Order based on equality and social justice. Last year during the thirty-second session of the General Assembly I said:\n\\\"Grenada is concerned and feels a sense of frustration over the seemingly endless dialogue that has been proceeding in international forums on the establishment of a new international economic order, though there are certain hopeful signs which indicate that the discussions concluded so far cannot be regarded as a 'dialogue of the deaf\nIndeed, we in Grenada are grateful for the considerations we have received from the \\\"North\\\" through the existing Lome Convention  and we are heartened by the spirit of co-operation now prevailing at discussions taking place for the preparation of the second tome Convention.\n184.\tGrenada welcomes the action taken by the Caribbean Group for Co-operation in Economic Development and the tangible results that have been forthcoming through the establishment of a Caribbean development facility. This initiative, spearheaded by the World Bank, the IMF and the Inter-American Development Bank, indicates a concern and a desire to act positively in an effort to help the countries of the Caribbean. There is still need for other developed countries to follow this example and demonstrate that they are really committed to the fullest possible extent to providing meaningful and substantial assistance in the less developed countries of the world, realizing, of course, that the world is indeed a family of nations and that what affects one country, in spite of geographical distance, can and does affect the rest of the world in varying degrees. And so when poverty and the absence of the basic requirements of life tend to relegate Governments and people to a state of dehumanization and economic belittlement, it then becomes inevitably incumbent upon the developed countries to do something meaningful and effective about it.\n185.\tThere is need to create an economic interdependence among developing countries and to take drastic measures designed to change the conditions that now compel the developing countries to remain producers of raw materials with little or no control over prices and, at the same time, enable the developed countries to remain as the processing agents of those raw materials, and the beneficiaries of the value added.\n186.\tIn this context let me repeat the point I have made here on several occasions: that there is an urgent need to revise the criteria on which co-operation from developed countries is based, criteria which were devised for different times and in different circumstances and which today are anachronistic and unrealistic, especially as they relate to the small island nations of the world.\n187.\tThere is need for the developed world to pay a modicum of attention to the problems of energy, and to assist the developing countries in their search both for conventional energy resources, which are known to be available but which are untapped, as well as for alternative sources of energy, including solar, wind and geothermal energy in many of the developing countries, where these exist in great abundance.\n188.\tThere is need for greater justice and equity in the allocation and exploitation of the abundant resources of the ocean, and in particular for the protection of the rights of island nations in this matter. Hence Grenada's interest in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and the results that might emerge from it.\n189.\tThere is also great need for the developed countries to assist in the transfer of technology to developing countries, but we must be very careful to avoid the \\\"dumping\\\" of certain technology which is unsuitable to the scale of operations, the culture of the people and the trust of the \\\"developmental exercise\\\" itself. Indeed, perhaps it might be appropriate to suggest to developing countries that they must supplement the transfer of technology from developed countries with research into their own \\\"folk technology\\\" and the development of their own \\\"indigenous technology\\\", both of which might be more relevant to their needs and circumstances.\n190.\tFurthermore, the recently concluded United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation Among Developing Countries, held in Buenos Aires, indicated that the developing world is recognizing that there is already a good deal of co-operation and assistance given by developing countries to one another, and the Plan of Action agreed upon at the Conference holds out great possibilities for national, regional and international' co-operation among the least developed countries, building a bridge across the South, as it were. However, the developed countries continue to have a great responsibility for assisting the developing countries as a contribution towards the establishment, fostering and maintenance of world peace.\n191.\tIt is not that developing countries do not want to help themselves. The fact is that many of our developing countries need as a \\\"take-off' the necessary infrastructure: roads, international airports, water, electricity, trained manpower, and so on. In Grenada, we have just launched an ambitious development programme, called \\\"Operation Industrialization and Employment Bootstring\\\", designed to encourage the establishment of industrial projects through partnership' between the private and public sectors, and to provide employment for the many unemployed young people in our State. Grenada recognizes that in order not to remain for ever hewers of wood and drawers of water we must take deliberate action to lift ourselves by our own bootstring. The response to our project, both by our own people and by foreign entrepreneurs, is most satisfying, and indeed it gives me a deep sense of gratification at having taken that initiative, which in some ways and to many developed and affluent countries and funding agencies is a logical and attractive prerequisite for economic and technical co-operation.\n192.\tWe in Grenada have also- embarked upon another developmental project which might be worth mentioning in this international forum. It is called \\\"The Prime Minister's weekly national project\\\" and it is designed to encourage in our people a spirit of self-help and community development. It is led by me, as Prime Minister, actively supported by my cabinet Ministers. The projects include: land reclamation; building of sea defences; action against hillside erosion; cleaning and beautification of parks, roundabouts and other public areas; collecting and cultivating particular types of plants; building and repairing bridges; repairing the homes of poor and helpless people; and reconstruction and resurfacing of roads, among other things. This project also has created a tremendous public stir and has aroused the consciousness of all people regarding their participation in community self-help projects as part of a national development plan. This is a project which we undertake one day in every week when I, as Prime Minister and chief servant of my people, actually lead and launch the attack with approximately 600 persons, including peasants, police, military personnel, people from the agronomic and extension divisions of our Ministry of Agriculture and volunteer citizens and residents. We are certainly making the world's loveliest island even lovelier, and that is Grenada, the beautiful isle of spice.\n193.\tI now turn my attention to the question of human rights, a matter of increasing concern not only to the international community but also to peoples everywhere which continue to struggle against want and oppression. Our concept of human rights in Grenada encompasses the basic needs of the human species: food; water; shelter; health care; education; the right to work, earn and own; the right to due legal process; the right of association; the right to worship; the right to protection against terrorists, and so on.\n194.\tOur position in these matters is quite clear and precise, and this has been manifestly borne out by our action. When Grenada, with pride and a sense of satisfaction, put into effect the American Convention on Human Rights by depositing the necessary instruments of accession on the historic day of 18 July 1978, and when Grenada became the eleventh State to ratify and thus give effect to the Convention which, for the first time, provides for the establishment of an Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Grenada joined the other acceding nations in undertaking the obligation to preserve and uphold the rights and freedoms recognized by the Convention; and agreed to ensure that all persons are subject to the jurisdiction of the free and full exercise of those freedoms, without any discrimination for reasons of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or 9ocial origin, economic status, birth or any social condition.\n195.\tOur Government took further action to protect and preserve human rights by ratifying the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft signed at The Hague in 1970; the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal in 1971; and the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board aircraft, signed at Tokyo in 1963.\n196.\tIn addition, my Government is currently giving active and special consideration to all the international Conventions of the United Nations in the field of human rights, with a view to taking appropriate action as expeditiously as possible.\n197.\tBut please allow me to remind this Assembly that I have always held that human rights must not be regarded as a one-way street. We need to be objective and concerned about the over-all well-being of a nation and avoid supporting or encouraging terrorist and other disruptive groups whose operations are often carried out in the guise of the protection of human rights. How can we support the terrorists who held up that train in Holland and made hostages of pregnant mothers and children? How can we support the terrorists who kidnapped the distinguished Italian statesman, Aldo Moro, and savagely butchered him in pursuit of the interest of a small and dangerous group? I respectfully submit that groups like these very often mislead the public, mislead the media, mislead commissions of enquiry and even mislead honest, well-meaning human rights bodies into believing that their causes are justified and are in the public interest. This could be most dangerous, and calls for continuous vigilance at both national and regional levels.\n198.\tTo underscore the point I have been making, let me use Grenada as an example to show what small, disruptive, politically ambitious groups within a country can do, not only to undermine the stability of a Government, but also, which is more important, to bring discredit on the entire country and frustrate the hopes and aspirations of its people.\n199.\tThere is a group in my country known as the New Jewel Movement, a group with a strange and highly dangerous ideology, which has deliberately embarked upon a propaganda campaign to smear Grenada's good name and to interrupt the country's development. For instance, Grenada had the good fortune to get the assistance of some expert fishermen from Korea who came to help us make a survey of our fishing banks and to assist our fishermen with improved methods of fishing, fishing being one of our very important economic activities. The members of the New Jewel Movement, however, gave out the false propaganda that the Koreans had come to scrape the bottom of our sea and destroy all the fish with their trawlers, and thus deprive the local fishermen of their livelihood. They also said that the Korean fishing experts would be shooting any Grenadian fishermen they met at sea. It is surprising how many people believed this, despite the obvious benefits the country had derived from the Koreans, who left a most revealing and helpful report on Grenada's fishing industry and its potential.\n200.\tThe New Jewel Movement spread the rumour that we did not hold fair elections in 1976, and actually filed an election petition against one of our Ministers. Many gullible people believed this, until that movement lost the petition both in the lower court and in the Court of Appeal, and in addition was made to meet all the costs involved in both trials.\n201.\tThe New Jewel Movement spread some unbelievably vicious rumours about Grenada's connexions with Chile, saying that at home Chileans were training our people in methods of torture and that we had policemen in Chile being trained likewise. Representatives would be surprised to know how many people believed that, and indeed that matter was actually discussed in the United Kingdom Parliament and Grenada was even threatened with the withdrawal of aid.\n202.\tChile is a member of the Organization of American States [OAS]; we have cordial relations with Chile, as we have with other members of the OAS; and we received some assistance from it, as from others, in connexion with the holding of the seventh regular session of the General Assembly of the OAS in Grenada last year. Other propaganda emanating from that group and carried extensively by the international press about Grenada was so vicious that it almost led to a cancellation of the OAS meeting in Grenada. I am happy to say, however, that the good name of our country has been amply vindicated by the many ministers, ambassadors and other representatives and officials from the OAS who actually visited our paradise during the seventh regular session of the General Assembly of the OAS in June 1977. So it is with Chile. The world will see that our relations with that country are above-board and have nothing to do with any ruthless purpose of undermining the human rights of our people.\n203.\tLet me mention one more example of that phenomenon of wilful disruption by the New Jewel Movement with which my country is afflicted and which imposed tremendous hardships on our people about the time of our independence. That Movement, in an attempt to wrest political power from a duly elected Government holding 12 out of the 13 elected seats in Parliament- and with its authority deeply rooted in the confidence of the people, actually attacked a\\\" police station and attempted to take over control. The people reacted against this treachery and might have taken strong action against the leaders of that group were it not for the quick and considerate action taken by \\\"the Senior Inspector of Police, Innocent Belmar.\n204.\tDespite that, the New Jewel leaders were able to get many people and organizations, including some churches, some trade unions and some service groups\u201422 such organizations in all-to accept that deliberate propaganda that they had been denied their human rights and beaten up by the police, especially by Innocent Belmar. That almost led to a complete paralysis of the country. Demonstrations were mounted\u201421 within one month\u2014in which schoolchildren, farmers, housewives, business people, trade unions and so on participated. As a result of that a commission of inquiry was set up, headed by the Chief Justice of Jamaica. The Commission's report, based on the evidence of many misguided persons, blamed the Government, condemned Mr. Belmar, the senior police officer, and condemned him as being unfit to hold any public office. The Government was not satisfied with the findings about Mr. Belmar and put him up as a candidate for election. Mr. Belmar won an overwhelming victory and was made a minister of government. The Jewel members were not satisfied. Belmar was assassinated the very day he was sworn in as Minister of Agriculture.\n205.\tGod works and brings out the truth in people in many ways-and this is the point I wish to make: the conscience of the New Jewel Movement, through its Deputy Leader, Senator Kenrick Radix, prodded its members to make a startling confession in the Senate regarding the innocence of Mr. Belmar and, therefore by implication, the extent to which that Jewel Movement had deliberately misled the country under the guise of promoting human rights. The following is what Senator Radix said in the Senate on Saturday, 18 February 1978:\n\\\"The memory of Innocent Belmar will live on. It is often said that the evil which men do lives after them-this is certainly true\u2014but the good is often interred with their bones. Let me say-and I will say something today in the memory of Innocent Belmar which I have never said on any public occasion\u2014in the Parliament of the people, that, had it not been for Innocent Belmar on the night of 18 January 1973,1 would not be alive today. He was a complex man. I say publicly that, had it not been for Innocent Belmar, the Leader of the Opposition today would not have been alive to chart the destiny of our country in the years ahead. Had it not been for Innocent Belmar, the Honourable Unison Whiteman would not be alive today; Mr. Selwyn Strachan and Mr. Hudson Austin would not have been alive today. This is a confession that I make, because it is true.\\\"\n206.\tThe cost to Grenada resulting from that last incident ending with the assassination of a trusted government minister has been heavy: our port, the lifeline of our country, was closed for several months, and so our economic life was at a standstill. The many schoolchildren who participated in the demonstrations were denied a full education and were all the worse for that experience. The inquiry cost the Government approximately $150,000, which the country could hardly afford. And then after that confession \\\"bombshell\\\", the commissioners, the churches and several prominent people in Grenada must have been terribly embarrassed by the extent to which they themselves had been grossly misled by an irresponsible group which mistakenly peddled its struggle for political power under the guise of advocacy of human rights.\n207.\tThe aforementioned reference is to a purely domestic matter affecting Grenada, but it is certainly a lesson for the rest of the world. Nations must not take action against other nations on the basis of the vicious propaganda from small, vocal, disruptive groups within a country whose main purpose is to seize political power for the selfish ends of their members. A nation must not heed a call to isolate another nation just because small groups within the country make such a request. We must be warned about this unrealistic and unacceptable appeal on behalf of human rights. The world is full of deceit and deliberately false information.\n208.\tI remember when I was recently in Costa Rica there was an international rumour that a certain Mr. Vesco was in Grenada negotiating resident status with the Government. There is absolutely no truth in that. But somehow it suited the purpose of disruptive groups to peddle that propaganda against Grenada, our isle of spice, God's veritable paradise.\n209.\tPlease allow me once again to reaffirm Grenada's unswerving commitment to upholding the principles of human rights enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in the inter-American Conventions and in several other Conventions relating to human rights. Grenada stands unswervingly with the rest of the international community in this firm resolve.\n210.\tAnd now, having presented our contribution on the subject of human rights, permit me to cross a new threshold and to dwell upon a subject somewhat innovative but at the same time not entirely unrelated to human rights. The subject is \\\"The rights of life on earth other than human life\\\". Let us bring into focus for a moment some of God's other creations-the animals of the forest, the pets at home, the mammals, the birds, the fishes, the reptiles, the huge forest trees soaring high in splendour and elegance, and the sheltering shrubs, the carnivorous and numerous other sensitive plants, the flowers and the multifarious varieties of other plant and animal life.\n211.\tI wish to state here and now with unchallengeable authenticity that every creature, animal or plant, has a purpose to serve on this planet earth and is serving that purpose, except when obstructed by their several enemies- man being the greatest.\n212.\tIn actual fact, some animals and some plants have proved to be more responsive than some human beings. Today many individuals, groups and institutions, and some Governments as well, are engaged in research programmes that are revealing some very astounding facts supporting the theory relating to the importance of the so-called lower creatures on our planet. Man is busily engaged in wars and conflicts within and against himself and against his brother man. Man is so deeply embroiled by his greed for power, through politics, through wealth, through territorial expansion, through the control of the basic and important commodities of our world\u2014indeed man is so unduly preoccupied with the material things of life\u2014that somehow he fails to get into tune with the needs and concerns of forms of life which he considers lower than himself but from which he can learn many important lessons.\n213.\tFor many reasons, each of those so-called lower creatures could be congratulated and commended for the manner in which it has retained its natural endowments in terms of the sensitivity of its physical senses, in terms of intuitiveness and instinct, in terms of emotion, while on the other hand it could justifiably be said that man has lost some of his natural endowments by virtue of what he calls civilization, inventions, modern gadgetry and amenities. The dog has kept its sense of smell, the cat can see in the dark, the horse can perceive beyond the dimensions of man, and some plants and flowers, loved and cherished by a person, react more spontaneously in the event of sadness, mishap, accident or death involving such a person-in fact, some react even before the event took place.\n214.\tHave we ever stopped for a moment to study the life of a family of ants, bees, birds or some wild game? We would be amazed. Each group of creatures has its means of communication, be it sounds, signs or otherwise. God, the Supreme Architect, has certainly placed these creatures on this planet for specific purposes, but man with his complex mentality, man with his complications and in his madness, has set out without any justification whatever, and in some cases simply for fun, wantonly to destroy animal and plant life without any regard for the Creator, or for the purposes served by those so-called lower creatures. The demonstration of love by some pets for their owners is definitely more impressive than that displayed by some people for members of their own families and their friends.\n215,\tI have said all those things to preface the following: first, that all things on earth created by the Great Master, be they animal or plant life, have been put here to serve specific purposes' secondly, that it is no fault of theirs that we cannot understand them or in a general way communicate with them; and thirdly, that they cannot represent themselves within this noble Organization. Consequently, for and on behalf of all animals and plants I appeal to tills world body, and certainly to every Member Government, to take the necessary steps first, to recognize the importance of every creature on this planet, be it animal, mammal, reptile, plant, flower, bird, fish or any other; secondly, to take steps to protect and preserve their lives. In this context, if bullfighters and spectators must find their fun and pleasure in bull-fighting they should by all means go ahead, but they should stop before maiming, paralysing or killing the poor, dumb animal innocently taken from its natural habitat to provide fun for thousands and then suffer a merciless and painful termination of its natural life.\n216.\tHave we ever stopped to consider how we would feel if some beings superior to humans came on our planet earth and decided to use us and treat us as we treat animals and plants? Let us imagine that they were making us fight to kill for their pleasure, shooting us down as food for lunch or dinner, crushing us to bits with their huge feet, piercing us with spears and sticks, peeling the skins off our backs as we peel the bark from trees, cruelly trapping us by putting food, alcohol, cigarettes, and other things that man craves for into traps that crush our bones, inflicting on us excruciating pains until we die. Yes, amazing and depressing as all this may appear, that is exactly how some people treat those poor creatures created by the great, universal, divine God for specific purposes.\n217.\tI appeal to all Governments and peoples to try to recognize the divine nature and beauty in all that God has created and placed on our planet and to take the necessary measures to care for, protect and preserve the lives of those creatures. They in turn would then love our human kind, and the Master would bless us and give us peace abundantly.\n218.\tI should like now to deal with another subject of great importance, the International Year of the Child. The declaration of 1979 as the International Year of the Child focuses the attention of all Member States on the rights of the child. The children of today are the men and women of tomorrow. Given a good start in life, given the tools and equipment for decision-making and physical, psychological, spiritual and social guidance from an early age, children will become better citizens of tomorrow. Parents, teachers and societies have an obligation to promote their interests and Governments have an obligation to protect those interests.\n219.\tThe Government of Grenada is committed to the protection of the child and to ensuring that, although its resources are limited, the children have access to shelter, food, clothing, security, health and dental care, recreational facilities and education at all levels-pre-primary, primary, secondary, technical and vocational and university education where possible. In the case of the handicapped-the mentally retarded, the deaf, the blind and the physically handicapped-special educational facilities are being made available for children at an early age.\n220.\tIt is the duty of parents, guardians, society and the State to provide the child with the basic requirements and skills in order to bring him to the threshold of self-reliance. It is important also that the educational system should bring out, develop and reinforce the natural aptitude of the child without making him deviant and anti-social.\n221.\tWe believe that the quality of the child's life is related directly to that of the parents, so we have striven first to improve the lot of parents, especially those in the rural areas in Grenada. We were responsible for introducing an active trade-union movement as early as 1950 and we can say with some pride that through our efforts in the trade-union movement the great mass of our people are now enjoying vastly improved conditions of living and enhanced levels of human dignity. Young people can now enjoy greater hope for the future mainly because of the improved lot of their parents.\n222.\tDespite our limited resources, the Government-of Grenada will continue to seek ways and means of expanding the day-care facilities for infants whose parents must work, and in many cases the mother is the only concerned parent and sole breadwinner. It will continue to seek solutions to problems of nutritional deficiencies among infants and to provide adequate pre-primary school facilities for the two- to five-year-olds; to intensify its efforts to improve educational facilities and opportunities at the primary and secondary levels; and to provide recreational facilities for children in specially prepared centres all over the country. In the field of health, our Government in its efforts to cut down the incidence of disease, has embarked upon a massive immunization programme against the perennial-diseases which usually affect young children- poliomyelitis, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, measles and typhoid. In this connexion, I should like to pay special tribute to the Brothers' Foundation of Pennsylvania and Rotary International for the tremendous assistance given in this massive inoculation programme.\n223.\tWe recognize that this is only the start and that much more needs to be done. That is why we are so deeply involved in preparations for the International Year of the Child. We have established a national committee of which I myself am Chairman, and there are several sub-Committees dealing with specific concerns such as social legislation, exhibitions of art and craftwork, the improvement of social amenities for children and so on. We join with the rest of the world in the effort to improve the lot of our young people. The expenditure involved for the proper care and the right kind of education for the child today, in preparation for his role in society tomorrow, must be identified as a very vital and laudable expenditure which must inevitably lead to a better world for him, with a better chance for a survival, and to lasting world peace.\n224.\tIt is my strong and irrevocable conviction that die time has come when the United Nations and, certainly , Governments of Member States should adopt appropriate measures, possibly through legislation, designed to correct improper behavioural patterns among pregnant mothers, behavioural patterns inimical to the interest of their yet-unborn children. I refer to pregnant mothers who indulge in excesses of alcohol and smoking and even in the abuse of dangerous drugs. I feel that I am to some extent reflecting the views of the various women's organizations that are concerned and desirous to ensure that all steps be taken so that children are born strong and healthy after having spent a period of nine months under the best possible conditions. And since I am well known to champion the cause of women in United Nations organizations and elsewhere in the struggle for equality, I now call upon the women of the world to indicate their support to their respective Governments wherever they may be for the benefit of children yet unborn.\n225.\tI come now to a matter of great concern to Grenada and one which I have been bringing to the attention of the General Assembly since 1975. I refer to the subject of unidentified flying objects [UFOs].\n226.\tGrenada is now identified the world over with efforts to get the greater Powers to share information on the phenomenon of unidentified flying objects, mainly because of the persistence with which we have been raising this matter in this General Assembly since 1975. We are satisfied that the subject of UFOs is of sufficient interest and importance for it to be raised again this year and for us to seek the support of Member States for research in this field to be co-ordinated by the United Nations organizations.\n227.\tSightings of UFOs are not restricted to just one or two parts of our planet. Reports come from all over the world today, and scientific analysis of these reports strongly suggests not only that a growing number of people believe that UFOs exist as a physical phenomenon but also that more and more countries believe that a more in-depth investigation into this phenomenon might make a significant contribution towards the well-being of the planet earth as well as towards man's better understanding of himself and his purpose on earth.\n228.\tThe question is now being increasingly asked, why should man be precluded from information on UFOs, a matter of great interest and importance to man, while at the same time he is fed so many trivialities which can contribute nothing to his personal enrichment or to the advancement of mankind.\n229.\tWhen I spoke before this body last year I made the following statement:\n\\\"Grenada takes no categorical theoretical stand on the question of unidentified flying objects. Theories as to the nature, origin, and intent of unidentified flying objects are many, and are amply known to civilian and governmental research groups. Irrespective of theory, however, the major research groups are dedicated foremost to achieving the following main objectives in their endeavours: to study all significant reports on unidentified flying objects with a view to making a reasonable and acceptable determination of the nature, origin and intent...; to disseminate the substantive results of such study to the public and the news media; to work co-operatively with, or within the framework of, the United Nations to- help establish a communications system through which important data can be rapidly exchanged internationally.\\\"'\n230.\tI wish to say that I have received the strongest support from individuals and organizations as well as from distinguished \\\"ufologists\\\", or trackers of unidentified flying objects, the world over in our efforts to get the United Nations more actively involved in co-ordinating research on the phenomenon.\n231.\tIndeed, it was with great pleasure that I met some of the undoubtedly most prominent of these scientists earlier this year, and together with them I met the Secretary- General of the United Nations to discuss how best we might make our presentation to the General Assembly in our continued efforts to persuade the United Nations to take positive steps in the matter of UFO research. That joint effort involving distinguished scientists of world repute in UFO research has indeed given a great boost to our efforts in this important matter.\n232.\tThose scientists who joined us in dialogue with the Secretary-General included Mr. J. Allen Hynek, recently- retired director of the Center of UFO Studies, Evanston, Illinois, often called the \\\"father of ufology\\\" or the study of unidentified flying objects; Mr. Claude Poher, director of the French Agency for the Investigation of UFOs; Mr. Jacques Vallee, distinguished astronomer, mathematician and UFO researcher; Mr. Ted Phillips, leading trace expert on UFO landings; Mr Gordon Cooper, well- known astronaut, executive vice-president of Walt Disney Enterprises; Mr. David Saunders, statistical psychologist and creator of \\\"UFOCAT\\\", a computerized listing of between 60,000 and 70,000 UFO sightings throughout the world; L. Strongfield, UFO researcher, and author; Lee Spiegel, researcher and visual consultant on UFOs; Mr. G. Bravo, UFO researcher and organizer of the First International Congress on the Unidentified Flying Object Phenomenon, held in Acapulco; and many other distinguished \\\"ufologists\\\", some of whom are here today.\n233.\tIn addition, we are in touch with scientists, research groups, writers and people in all walks of life from all parts of the earth, people who have expressed great interest in what we are attempting to do hers in the United Nations and who have promised support when the matter comes up for discussion in the Special Political Committee.\n234.\t1 would be the first to admit that there is no unanimity among scientists regarding all aspects of the UFO phenomenon. Some believe that international security is endangered by the appearances of UFOs, Others deny that and affirm that UFOs are surveying our planet with a view to giving assistance to the weaker and less sophisticated earthlings. Still others believe that UFOs are embarked upon a mission to save man from self-destruction. It is my purpose not to touch on those controversies here today but rather to point out, with Mr. Allen Hynek, that UFOs are undoubtedly a global phenomenon. However, it is astounding to note that the various characteristics in terms of physical structure and patterns of behaviour have been observed and corroborated by reputable persons in places scattered all over the world.\n235.\tSince addressing the General Assembly in October 1977 I have been literally inundated with literature of all kinds as well as direct calls urging me to continue pursuing in this forum the matter of UFO research and its co-ordination by the United Nations. Indeed, there is a strong possibility that a centre for UFO research will be established in Grenada by agencies with a deep interest in this matter. Also, in response to the resolution unanimously adopted at the First International Congress on the Unidentified Flying Object Phenomenon, held in Acapulco from 17 to 24 April 1977, preliminary plans are now being worked out for the second international congress, to be held in Grenada in late 1979.\n236.\tSomehow great forces are at work in support of our efforts, to have the United Nations play a more general role and a more central role in the matter of co-ordination of research and dissemination of information on the UFO phenomenon. The time is more than opportune for the United Nations to become involved in this important area of knowledge and research. The pools show that the peoples of the world are expecting such involvement. Again 1 call upon Members of this distinguished world body to support the call of the world's leading scientists in this field of ufology, the call of the communications media, and today, certainly, the peoples' call for the United Nations to play an active and leading role n co-ordinating research on the UFO phenomenon and in disseminating the information for the benefit and enlightenment of all mankind. .\n237.\tFinally, I turn to the subject of God and His universe. Here I wish to crave the indulgence of members while I reiterate a few of the many thoughts I have already adduced, in this General Assembly on past occasions:\n.. I am proposing that the time is ripe and that the peoples of the world are ready and willing to discuss the concept, the recognition, the acknowledgement and the acceptance of a universal God.\t\n\\\"I am not unaware, however, of the fact that this subject may offer some degree of controversy. I speak without fear of challenge that there is no subject throughout this, planet that is of greater significance or greater importance or greater urgency than this subject, and I call upon the leaders of the world-political, philosophical, mystical, spiritual, doctrinal, theological and religious\u2014to consider its importance ....\n\\\"Do the astronauts, when they are in outer space or when they traverse the surface of the moon, feel themselves outside the precincts of the God we worship on earth? The God we worship is certainly the God who is present in outer space, on the moon and all other planets, for He is God of the universes-the God of galaxies of worlds, and yet that God is also present in the minutest entity conceivable by the human mind. In other words, God is everywhere: He is within and without, around and above, in us and all around us. God is filling this room with His loving presence.\n\\\"Man has made great advances in science and technology and so man can construct a building or a room that is completely light-proof, completely sound-proof, completely magnetism-proof and, by proper insulation, even completely electricity-proof, but man cannot make anything that is God-proof, for God is everywhere.\\\"\n238.\tMan may claim with some measure of justification to be the greatest creation on God's earth; but certainly man would be more than short-sighted and conceited if he were to conceive for a minute that the planet earth is the whole of God's estate, for God created universes and many worlds. It would be more than short-sighted and conceited for man to think that he is the most intelligent being of his time created by the divine Master, for certainly evidence in contradiction of this theory is not only voluminous but ever unlimited. We are on this small, nay infinitesimal, portion of God's domain and we fail to recognize the glory and the splendour with which this planet is so copiously endowed. We should spend some time trying to recognize some of nature's beauty all around us; and beauty is certainly an attribute of the universal divine. For instance, examine any flower closely and discover for yourselves the wondrous works of nature-of God\u2014the symmetry, the precision in its pattern, the coloration and so many other features vividly revealing the presence of a divine intelligence. If man were to allow himself to grow psychically and to pursue the inner development, he would certainly perceive the beautiful auras emanating; from the flowers- colours of crimson, of gold, of blue, among other elevating and inspiring auras; but the average man seems to be degenerating and losing some of his natural endowments.\n239.\tIn God's universe\u2014and more specifically on our planet earth\u2014there are always wars and rumours of wars. There are many inhibitions and obstacles that man himself has established which are inimical to world peace; but there are also some other factors that contribute significantly to wars and conflicts. For instance, the lack of a universal language is certainly an eminent factor, and perhaps it is not out of context to suggest that the time is ripe for the United Nations to give serious consideration to initiating the measures necessary to establish an international language, a language of the people, a language for the people of this globe, a language that will essentially transcend all boundaries. Now please allow me to conclude with the prayer and supplication of the great saint, Saint Francis of Assisi:\n\\\"Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace; where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy.\n\\\"Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood, as to \nunderstand; to be loved, as to love; for it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.\\\"\n\n\n  \n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff102.\tFirst of all, may I express to you, Sir, my great pleasure in extending to you, on behalf of the Romanian delegation, our warm congratulations on the occasion of your election as President of the thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. We greet in your person a distinguished representative of friendly Colombia, a country with which Romania is so felicitously developing close relations of co-operation.\n103.\tThe current session of the General Assembly is called upon to consider issues of major importance for international life and to open up new prospects for the strengthening of peace, co-operation and security in the world, and for the solution of major problems confronting mankind today with the participation, on an equal footing of all States.\n104.\tThe problems of peace, security and international co-operation, the establishment of new, democratic relations among States and the strengthening the role of the United Nations occupy a central place in the political thinking and prodigious international activity of the President of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu. The attention and particular interest of the President of Romania in the problems that now confront the world community of States have found new expression in the speech he delivered at the beginning of the month of August. That is a' document which expresses the very essence of the whole international policy of my country.\n105.\tThe foreign policy of Romania stems from the very nature of the socialist society, to the building of which the entire people are devoting their best efforts. It is consistent with the general development needs of the country 6n the path of economic and social progress and of the building of the multilaterally developed socialist society. Based on the permanent concern for defending and strengthening its sovereignty and independence as fundamental factors of its progress, our foreign policy at the same time attests to our devotion to the cause of freedom and equality of peoples and of peace, friendship and co-operation among all nations.\n106.\tAs a socialist country, Romania naturally develops political, economic, technical, scientific and cultural relations with all socialist countries and actively co-operates with those countries both bilaterally and in international life. That serves both the interests of our peoples and those of the general cause of peace, security and socialism all over\nthe world. At the same time, the relations of friendship, co-operation and solidarity between Romania and the developing countries and the non-aligned States are expanding constantly. In the spirit of the principles of peaceful coexistence, Romania is developing relations with all the States of the world, irrespective of their social system, and takes an active part in the international division of labour, as well as in the world-wide exchange of material and spiritual assets.\n107.\tA particularly important role in the development of the international activities and relations of my country was played by the visits and talks that the President of the Republic had with Heads of State and Government, and political leaders from many countries, as well as by the agreements reached on those occasions which laid down solid foundations for Romania's relations with the respective countries.\n108.\tRomania consistently places at the basis of its relations with all States the principles of full equality of rights, respect for national independence and sovereignty, non-interference in domestic affairs, non-use of force or threat of force, and the safeguarding of every people's right to independent development according to its own will and aspirations. We hold the view that it is only on the basis of those principles that relations of a new type, of peaceful and equal co-operation among States, can be achieved. It is only on such grounds that confidence and stability in international life and peace and security in the world can be assured. That is why it is imperative that the United Nations and all States act with a sense of high responsibility for a wide international recognition and full observance of those principles.\n109.\tIn evaluating the international situation, my country proceeds from the fact that profound political, economic, social and national changes are continuing to take place in the world. A new impetus has been given to the will and struggle of peoples for freedom and independence, for the complete liquidation of the old imperialist, colonialist and neo-colonialist policy of domination, aggression and diktat, for becoming masters of their natural resources and of their own destiny, for ensuring a free and independent economic and social development Mid for the establishment of a new world economic and political order. At the same time we witness a sharpening of contradictions in international life, the intensification of tendencies towards a redivision of spheres of influence, a strengthening of domination in various parts of the world and of interference in the domestic affairs of other States. We witnessed recently the intensification of tendencies towards the use of force and of military ways to promote domination to obtain and consolidate zones of influence. We have witnessed also the intensification of tendencies to use economic means, in various forms, for strengthening the domination of monopolies and multinational corporations and for consolidating the influence of certain States in various regions of the world. Protectionist, restrictive measures which create obstacles to economic exchanges and co-operation among States have multiplied and thus have negatively affected the normal course of international relations.\n110.\tRomania deems that those negative trends and phenomena in international life constitute a serious threat to the independence and sovereignty of peoples, generate and maintain situations of tension and conflict, aggravate the state of insecurity and instability in relations among States, and endanger the peace and security of all mankind. These trends confirm that the detente in international relations which began to take shape during the last several years is extremely fragile and is still in an incipient stage.\n111.\tThat is why Romania thinks that no effort should be spared at this moment to lessen tensions in international life, and that all States and the United Nations must act for the political solution of all disputes, completely renouncing the policy of force and interference in whatever form in the domestic affairs of other States, and for the firm promotion of the policy of detente, peace, co-operation and security in the world.\n112.\tOne of the cardinal problems of mankind-namely, general disarmament, and in the first place nuclear disarmament-has figured for many years on the agenda of the Assembly. This reflects the apprehensions of mankind about the unabated arms race and points to the responsibility of the United Nations to save mankind from the nightmare of a new world conflagration.\n113.\tThis year Romania took an active part in the tenth special session, devoted to disarmament, and considers that its results are positive. Romania believes that it is now essential that responsible action be taken to start implementing the recommendations and measures envisaged in the Final Document.\n114.\tWhile again affirming the proposals contained in the document submitted by Romania to the special session, we consider it necessary that the new United Nations bodies for deliberation and negotiation, namely, the armament Commission and the Committee on Disarmament, should examine with the utmost care the opinions, suggestions and proposals submitted by various States. These constitute, on the whole, an important source of ideas and measures whose implementation could bring the disarmament process out of its impasse. It is imperative that the activity of these bodies be firmly oriented towards negotiating and concluding comprehensive agreements establishing concrete measures able to bring about the reduction of military expenditures and the cessation of the production of new weapons, both nuclear and conventional, thus creating conditions for starting the disarmament process and, first of all, that of nuclear disarmament under an adequate international control.\n115. The supreme interests of the peoples require that disarmament measures should be firmly carried out, that firm commitments not to use nuclear weapons and, in general, not to use force against the non-nuclear-weapon States should be made. Considering that this is a major duty of the United Nations and of all States, Romania is firmly determined to spare no effort to bring about general disarmament and, first of all, nuclear disarmament; the reduction of military budgets, armaments and troops; and the allocation of part of the funds wasted on arms to the\neconomic and social development of every nation, to permit more rapid progress in the developing countries.\n116. We are, all of us, in agreement that one of the fundamental problems of mankind, upon the solution of which depends the very peace and security of the world, is the eradication of under-development, and the building of a new international economic order that could ensure the establishment of relations of equitable co-operation among all States, stimulate the more rapid development of less developed countries and further the economic, technological and social progress of mankind as a whole.\n117: Therefore, Romania attaches great importance to the intensification of international efforts aimed at the achievement of tills objective. The Romanian Government deems that the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1980 devoted to the new international economic order should adopt a clear strategy for development to be elaborated with the participation of all States and to include principles, guidance and ways for the elimination of under-development and of the serious delays in the development of some countries, and for the establishment of international relations of a new type based on full equality and equity. We consider that even at the current session of the General Assembly we should agree upon ways and means for the preparation and work of the special session, including the beginning of the elaboration of the documents that will be submitted for discussion. With the special session in view, it blames necessary for the developing countries, which have stayed and we continue to play a role of primary importance in the efforts to establish a new international economic order, to strengthen their unity of action, to co-operate more closely in this sense and to agree upon working out a clear concept and a programme of concrete measures.\n118.\tAs a socialist country and at the same time as a member of the Group of 77, Romania is determined to contribute actively, together with the other developing countries and with all countries, to the thorough and adequate preparation of the special session so that the latter may give a strong impetus to the efforts at liquidating under-development and at establishing equitable economic relations.\n119.\tWe attach particular importance to measures intended to establish a more equitable proportion between the prices of industrial products and those of raw materials and to open unrestricted access to science and modem technology with a view to accelerating the progress of economically retarded countries. As initiator and host country of the European regional preparatory conference, Romania will fully contribute in the future as well to the adoption of such measures at the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development, which is to take place in 1979.\n120.\tAs a European country, Romania attaches particular importance to the achievement of security and the development of co-operation on the continent of Europe, and to the furtherance of the implementation of the commitments assumed under the Helsinki Final Act. Taking into\naccount that the Belgrade review session ended with unsatisfactory results, it is necessary for all States that participated in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to intensify their activity with a view to developing relations in the economic, scientific, technical, cultural and other fields, and to improving the political climate on the continent. Since Europe is the area in which the most powerful military forces in the world, including nuclear armaments, are at present concentrated, it is particularly necessary to proceed to take concrete and effective measures for reducing armaments and troops, for achieving military disengagement and disarmament, without which it is not possible to guarantee peace and achieve security in Europe and elsewhere in the world.\n121.\tIn this spirit, we consider that all attention should be focused on the thorough preparation of the next session of the Conference, to be held in Madrid in 1980, which should live up to the expectations of the peoples and lead to the adoption of measures capable of ensuring the acceleration of the process of detente, security and co-operation in Europe.\n122.\tIn the process of achieving security and developing co-operation, we attach particular importance to the transformation of the Balkans, and other areas of the continent, into zones of peace, understanding and good neighbourliness, without nuclear weapons. As a Balkan country, Romania pays steadfast attention to, and acts constantly for, the development of bilateral and multilateral co-operation between the Balkan countries and the strengthening of peace in that region.\n123.\tWith regard to the situation in Cyprus, we advocate a political settlement of the conflict by negotiations between the representatives of the two communities on the basis of respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus, which would ensure the peaceful coexistence and co-operation of the two communities.\n124.\tAs is known, Romania is consistently in favour of the political settlement by negotiations of all litigious international problems, since it is convinced that this is the only way to avoid the aggravation and extension of conflicts and to find solutions acceptable to all States concerned. It is our considered view that the United Nations and all States must act with determination for the elimination of force from international relations and for the peaceful settlement, by way of negotiations, of any dispute between States.\n125.\tBeing situated as it is in the immediate proximity of the Middle East, Romania is directly interested in the achievement of a just and lasting peace in that area of the world. In this spirit, Romania has consistently called, and continues to call, for a political settlement, through negotiations, of the Middle East conflict, which would ensure the withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories occupied as a result of the war of 1967, the solution of the problem of the' Palestinian people, the recognition of its right to self-determination, including the establishment of an independent Palestinian State, and respect for the integrity and sovereignty of all States in the area. In our\nview, in order to make progress towards the effective and judicious solution of all Middle East problems and to achieve a comprehensive settlement, it is now necessary to carry out negotiations, with the full support and active participation of the United Nations. The participants in such negotiations would consist of Egypt, the Syrian Arab Republic, Jordan, Lebanon, the Palestine Liberation Organization as the legitimate and recognized representative of the Palestinian people, Israel, and the Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East-the Soviet Union and the United States-together with other States wishing to contribute to the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the area.\n126.\tThe long colonial domination has left unresolved a series of problems, including territorial ones, which of late have led, particularly in Africa, to tensions and armed conflicts. In accordance with its constant position, Romania has held that the African peoples must be allowed to solve their problems themselves, through negotiations and by excluding any outside intervention, and has stressed the particular importance of strengthening the unity and solidarity of the African States, which is an essential prerequisite for the defence and consolidation of their national sovereignty and independence.\n127.\tConsidering that the unification of Korea is a problem to be dealt with by the Korean people itself, Romania supports, as in the past, the constructive initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at achieving the great national ideal of the Korean people, which is the peaceful and democratic independent reunification of the country, without any foreign interference.\n128.\tAn imperative of our time is the complete liquidation of the remnants of colonialism, and of the policy of racial discrimination and apartheid. Romania lends its full support to the national liberation movements, and to the struggle of the Namibian and Zimbabwe peoples for the achievement, as soon as possible, of their total national independence. Romania supports and expresses its solidarity with the people of South Africa in its struggle for the liquidation of the policy of apartheid and of any racial discrimination.\n129.\tWe consider that the United Nations and all Member States must do everything in their power to put an end to any manifestations of colonialism, and to any policy of oppression of one people by another, and to liquidate completely the imperialist, colonialist pd neo-colonialist policies everywhere on our planet.\n130.\tThe international community has for a long time been confronted by a major problem of our days, namely, the free and full development of human personality. Socialist' Romania has taken an active part in the efforts made within the United Nations to promote human rights and freedoms, and to work out international documents aimed at ensuring the effective exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n131.\tRomania guarantees full political, economic and social equality to its citizens, as well as equitable economic and social relations, and it strives to create favourable\nconditions so that every citizen, irrespective of nationality, can live a dignified life.\n132. Romania has achieved equality of rights and free access to work, education, culture and science, and the participation, without political, national, sex or racial discrimination, in running the affairs of the society. According to my country's concept, genuine democracy and real humanism are incompatible with the maintenance of grave economic, social and political inequalities, and of national, class and racial discrimination between peoples. We are convinced that individuals can be truly free only when social and national exploitation and oppression are abolished, and when conditions are created for the full development of the human personality. It is precisely on such fundamental rights, which define real human freedom, that the attention of the world community of States must be focused, and not on secondary elements and superficial aspects, which only divert attention from the grave social anomalies fundamentally affecting the status of the individual in certain countries.\n133.\tBeing deeply devoted to its international commitments and proceeding from its philosophical concept of revolutionary humanism, on the basis of which it is building new social relations, socialist Romania acts for the real solution of the basic requirements of the individual's existence and for the continued development of democracy in social life, as well as for a wide democratization of international relations, and for the full sovereign equality of all States.\n134.\tAs is well known, Romania attaches particular importance to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations and of other international organizations in the solution of the complex problems of our time. President Nicolae Ceausescu has stated:\n\\\"Under the present circumstances, these bodies provide the best organizational framework for the active participation of all States in solving the problems, and for the strong assertion in the world of the principles of international law and the policy of equality among all the world's countries.\\\"\n135.\tCommitted as we are to the continued improvement of the work of the United Nations, we consider that it is necessary to intensify efforts in order to finalize the work of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization and find new practical ways and means of raising the United Nations to the level of the responsibilities with which it is entrusted in the defence of international peace and security and the development of co-operation between all States. To this end, we believe it would be appropriate for the General Assembly to proceed even at this stage to the consideration of those proposals and actions which are likely to meet with the general agreement of the Member States.\n136.\tWe are of the view that the United Nations can make a valuable contribution to the peaceful settlement of international problems. This is precisely why we reaffirm, on this occasion as well, the proposal by Romania to proceed to the conclusion of a general treaty under which all States would undertake to settle any disputes between them exclusively by peaceful means, and we are ready to co-operate with the delegations of other States towards this end.\n137.\tWe believe that the setting up of an organ of good offices and conciliation, responsible to the General Assembly, could make a noteworthy contribution to the prevention of situations of tension, and support the States concerned in finding solutions in a spirit of good neighbourliness and peaceful coexistence.\n138.\tRomania also stands and strives for the active participation in the solution of international problems of all States, particularly of small and medium-size countries, which must take part, on a footing of equality, in the settlement of those problems in the interest of each nation and of the progress of mankind as a whole.\n139.\tRomania takes part in this session of the General Assembly convinced that under the present international circumstances, the United Nations should engage itself more directly in the just and lasting settlement of major international problems, particularly in the prevention and the elimination of crises and conflicts between States, and in the initiation of effective actions to contribute to understanding and peaceful co-operation among all States.\n140.\tRomania cherishes an unshakable confidence in the political will and capacity of States, of the peoples, and of the democratic and progressive forces throughout the world to settle by political means in the interests of all nations the complex problems mankind is faced with, and to eliminate the situations of tension in the interest of peace, detente, security and co-operation between all States of the world.\n141.\tIn conclusion, I wish to assure you, Mr. President, and to assure the representatives of States attending this session that the delegation of Romania is determined to play its part, together with all other delegations, in finding just and equitable solutions to the problems with which the United Nations is confronted in order to hasten the achievement of a better and more just world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff57.\tMr. President, the delegation of Sao Tome and Principe, which I have the honour to lead this year at the thirty-third regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, hastens to convey to you its most heart-felt congratulations upon your unanimous election to the high office of President of the current session.\n58.\tOur hope in participating is that the results we achieve may be such as to bring us closer to the realization of the great expectations of all the peoples on earth: namely, dignity for all nations, peace and progress for all the countries in the world.\n59.\tMy delegation does not forget the President of the thirty-second session, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who conducted, with firmness and competence, the very important work of the eighth, ninth and tenth special sessions of the General Assembly.\n60.\tOver and beyond the sometimes necessary procedural business which is a characteristic feature of our debates, over and above routine, the United Nations remains the place where all hopes, all the efforts of the peoples of the world in search of justice, peace and freedom converge. The United Nations and all its specialized agencies are perhaps today the most vigorous expression of international solidarity. The balance-sheet that we can draw up after an objective analysis of United Nations world action cannot but strengthen our optimism, the optimism with which the peoples of the world view our Organization. Possible failures and short-comings do not change the essential; namely, our faith in the United Nations.\n61.\tBut before going any further, I should like to extend our warmest greetings to Solomon Islands and to express to that State our satisfaction as being able to welcome it in our midst. I am certain that the people and Government of Solomon Islands will successfully accomplish the difficult but exalting task of national reconstruction.\n62.\tEven a cursory perusal of the agenda of this thirty- third session prompts our delegation straightaway to make a number of observations.\n63.\tThere is first of all the fact that certain questions have become almost classic items continually before this Organization, from session to session and from meeting to meeting. How many relevant resolutions have we already adopted to reaffirm the right of peoples to self-determination? How many times have we denounced and condemned the glaring imbalance that exists between the industrialized countries in the Northern Hemisphere and the developing countries in the Southern Hemisphere? How many times have we recognized the illusory nature of the so-called North-South dialogue?\n64.\tFrom this high rostrum of the United Nations, our declarations, however strongly-worded or energetic, appear to have no effect on stubborn reality. Everything goes on as if the magic of words only served to express, by way of confession, its impotence in the present-day world.\n65.\tWe feel deeply the uneasiness created by the distance that separates words from deeds, our statements from the actions that those same statements should engender.\n66.\tLet me explain this point, because the serious questions of contemporary inequalities affect above all the underprivileged peoples of the world,\n67.\tThe dispossessed are weighed down by misery. For them each day means privation, humiliation and political, economic and cultural, if not military, aggression. They wait and hope as they toil.\n68.\tIt is here that we find the greatest injustice in the world. Peace and progress for the whole of mankind implies, first and foremost, -the elimination of this enormous international injustice.\n69.\tIt is worth mentioning that the poorer peoples do not form an envious retinue knocking at the door of outrageous opulence. Neither do the dispossessed covet the comforts of the rich. They do not ask for charity or pity. It is a much more important question that is involved, a political one, which concerns the very structure of contemporary society. What we are talking about is human justice in the world today.\n70.\tVery often a semi-historical, semi-political explanation is offered for this important problem that we have highlighted, namely, that of the international injustice which is evident at the level of the economic and social structure of the world today.\n\n71.\tAccording to the historical explanation we have to take account of the process of time, because the wealth accumulated today by the rich countries is the product of many centuries of unremitting labours. All the dispossessed have to do is wait; their demands, their impatience for quick results, are not understood.\n72.\tWhat is not said in those allegedly historical explanations is that the actual development of the rich countries of Western Europe, for instance, was not in the beginning separable from the exploitation of the colonial empires. The international division of labour is affected even today by colonial exploitation.\n73.\tThe political explanation would have us believe that the Western consumer society is the ideal model. The fact that the material and intellectual products of Europe have spread throughout the world is deliberately confused with the model of a social organization as it exists in Western Europe.\n74.\tSuffice it to say to rebut that argument that the Western society itself is no paradise, since a general crisis pervades the West today, a crisis which manifests itself in inflation, unemployment and a degree of alienation of the young, the women and the aged, as well as in violence, terrorism and waste.\n75.\tThe problem we have mentioned cannot be solved by a selfish approach. A dialogue is necessary, but it must be an open, frank dialogue, without distortion and without inhibiting the intellectual capacities of any of the parties involved.\n76.\tAfter all, we must have a global vision of things in this world, and historical experience cannot be transposed from one country to another without its undergoing certain necessary modifications and changes. The development of the poor countries can only follow the course that is most fitting for those countries at a pace that guarantees harmony, security and progress in dignity.\n77.\tThat means, essentially, that the poorer peoples today must become the true masters of their natural resources and win their economic independence, which is the basis \\\"of social justice and political independence.\n78.\tThus we see in which way and on which premises international co-operation should be carried on today to be mutually advantageous for all the peoples and countries on earth. It is a question less of quoting statistics than of respecting political options for the underprivileged countries, whose development in the modern world does not depend solely on assistance but, in the last resort, on their own desire and effort to build a better world.\n79.\tIncidentally, in the present state of affairs, we know very well who profits from co-operation between the developed countries of the West and the poor countries of the world. A comparative analysis of the existing information is very enlightening.\n80.\tA new spirit in the general framework of the new international order should emerge in order to govern co-operation among the peoples of the world. So long as the spirit of international justice is lacking there will be nothing but difficulties in the way of human solidarity. _\n81.\tThe problem of international justice to which I have just referred is urgent. Africa is suffering from great contradictions as a result of the existing international division of labour. Moreover, that continent is the object of the covetousness of many, and the chosen arena for the forces of evil, which can lead to bloody and lacerating confrontations. Acts of aggression by mercenaries seek to destabilize the continent and divide African States members of the OAU in order to divert them from the important common task of national and continental reconstruction.\n82.\tIn February 1978 President Pinto da Costa warned the Security Councils and the OAU of certain disquieting events that were taking place at that time in my country, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. Indeed, our country, from June 1977 to July 1978\u2014that is, for almost one year\u2014experienced very serious events which I must describe in detail at this rostrum of the United Nations.\n83.\tFrom June 1977 to October of that same year a number of attempts at a coup d'etat were made, and what was especially sought was the assassination of the President of the Republic.\n84.\tFrom December 1977 to July 1978 the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe was constantly threatened by the violation of its air space by unidentified aircraft flying at low altitudes over strategic areas. During that same year its territorial waters were violated by vessels which were obviously spying on our coasts.\n85.\tOn 10 February 1978 a foreign vessel anchored in our port and the captain requested assistance and asylum from a group of 34 persons alleged to be in distress.\n86.\tOn 11 February, that is to say the next day, five persons in military clothing and carrying weapons landed in an isolated area of the island.\n87.\tThose intimidating manoeuvres were intended to create a climate propitious for future intervention by mercenaries. Of that there is no doubt. The mercenaries use the same tactics everywhere: first they create a situation of confusion, then they stage provocations, acts of aggression and attacks and, finally, they destabilize a country.\n88.\tBut what the mercenaries forget is that people are put on the alert by such acts. That is why our people reacted with indignation against the provocations of the forces of evil and have redoubled their vigilance and watchfulness over our leaders.\n89.\tThere is a general context which gives a broader and more tragic dimension to the destabilization manoeuvres to which I have referred. Those intimidating manoeuvres and acts of provocation and aggression are criminal acts which fall within the framework of a vast neo-colonialist strategy that obviously seeks to recapture the African continent.\n90.\tSpecifically, that anti-African policy is reflected in the strengthening of retrograde positions, the proliferation of attempted coups d'etat, the assassination of Heads of State, the artificial creation of border conflicts and the installation of military bases in many African countries including the islands of the continent. The assassination of President Marien Ngouabi of the Congo, the mercenary aggression in Benin and the latest events in the independent and sovereign State of the Comoros are dramatic examples of that strategy which thus reveal that there is a permanent conspiracy against the peoples of Africa.\n91.\tWe are all aware of the strategic importance of the African islands, which are therefore particularly the target of the forces of domination. The situation prevailing in the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe therefore merits the attention of our Organization. I am in duty bound to inform this Organization of the situation, which is as disquieting. as it is urgent. It is the duty of our Organization to seek ways and means of assisting the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe to safeguard what it has obtained through its revolution.\n92.\tUnited Nations assistance to the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe in accordance with resolutions 31/187 and 32/96 should be provided within a reasonable period of time.\n93.\tThe short- and long-term requirements of our country do not require vast means of implementation. We believe that the international community is in a position to provide a rapid, effective and adequate response to the request for assistance of a country threatened by aggression.\n94.\tWe share the hopes of those who believe in human solidarity. The Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, well deserves the tribute we pay him. We are convinced that his unremitting efforts to make human solidarity a reality will bear fruit, that they will be healthy and that they will prepare mankind for a new phase in its development.\n95.\tIn the independent countries of Africa which have chosen a particular system of development, aggression, acts of .provocation and intimidation have become the daily lot, while another part of that same continent of Africa struggles to achieve freedom, political independence and national sovereignty, It is in fact one and the same struggle, an anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist, anti-neo-colonialist struggle. That is why the situation at present prevailing in southern Africa is of the greatest interest to my Government.\n96.\tThe situation in Namibia evolves slowly, nevertheless it evolves. That is a positive fact. It is a good thing that South Africa's allies should have understood at long last that history militates in favour of the Namibian people, who are entitled to self-determination and independence, which is their inalienable right. My Government strongly supports anything that our Organization may do to bring to fruition in a reasonable period of time the Declaration on Namibia and Programme of Action in Support of Self- Determination and National Independence of Namibia adopted at the ninth special session of the General Assembly [resolution S-9/2].\n97.\tIn view of the imminent solution of the problem of Namibia, in other words the inevitable accession to independence of the people of Namibia under its sole representative, SWAPO, it is indispensable for our Organization to speak with one voice in view of the delaying tactics of South Africa and its continued flouting of the decisions of this Organization.\n98.\tOur delegation reaffirms its unswerving solidarity with the sister people of Namibia and their leading force, SWAPO, and sincerely hopes that we shall share the joy of that people at the next session of the General Assembly, which will welcome Namibia as a full member of the world community.\n99.\tWith respect to the situation in Zimbabwe, it is obvious that the armed struggle being waged by the Patriotic Front has considerably changed the relations of strength in that region.\n100.\tWhen Ian Smith refuses to heed the voice of reason, when Ian Smith and his troops attack and massacre the defenceless civilian populations of Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia, when Ian Smith seeks to divide the black majority in Zimbabwe, all he does is demonstrate to, the world the illegality of his regime.\n101.\tHenceforth, any dialogue with the Rhodesia of Ian Smith, as with the South Africa of Vorster is manifestly impossible, because neither Smith nor Vorster is a man of dialogue or a man of justice. They bring evil.\n102.\tThe countries which co-operate with South Africa therefore bear a heavy responsibility before mankind because they allow the most abhorrent regime of our time to survive. Nothing could be more harmful to peace and security in Africa and in the world as a whole.\n103.\tMy Government is equally concerned by the problem of the Western Sahara.\n104.\tFor many years the Saharan people have been prevented from freely exercising their right to self- determination. The incomplete decolonization of their country has facilitated the fulfilment of ambitions of which we are all aware. It has led to the present war for survival of the Saharan people. That courageous people, under the Frente POLISARIO, wages that war to express its elementary right to exist. That is what the whole question is essentially about. The international community must therefore do everything in its power to put an end to the martyrdom of the Saharan people.\n105.\tThe colonized peoples of yesterday and those still under the colonialist yoke today have in common a centuries-long history of foreign domination, of deep suffering, of rebellion, which reflects their resistance to annihilation, or, in other words, their hope for the progress of mankind.\n106.\tFrom that springs the feeling of true identification of all the oppressed peoples which claim the right to life, dignity, well-being and international co-operation\u2014in fact, their status as men in the international community.\n107.\tThat is why my country has not ceased to express its solidarity with the people of East Timor, under the direction of FRETILIN, in its struggle for freedom and national independence.\n108.\tThe position of my Government concerning the Palestinian question, which arose soon after the Second World War, is well known. Israel must be asked to abandon its policy of aggression, occupation and expansion, a policy which keeps alive the existing conflict in the Middle East, which we all deplore. To be more explicit, Israel must be asked to withdraw from the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and to recognize the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland. Peace in that region is closely linked with a change of attitude by Israel, which must henceforward understand that war is in no way beneficial to the development and progress of the world or to understanding among the nations and peoples of the earth. War renders ill service to international peace and security. War is destructive from every point of view.\n109.\tIsrael's recent aggression against southern Lebanon is an unacceptable violation of the sovereignty and integrity of that country. That aggression has intensified the evils besetting the Middle East, the constant state of siege in which innocent peaceful peoples have been living for so many years.\n110.\tWe wish to reiterate our full support for the Palestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organization in their struggle to regain their dignity, a struggle which they wage with so much courage and resolution. The cause of the Palestinian people is a just cause, and that is why we support it unconditionally.\n111.\tIn Cyprus, the evolution of the crisis towards a lasting solution through peaceful negotiations still appears difficult.\n112.\tHowever, if we want to eliminate the source of tension in the eastern Mediterranean we must concentrate all our energies on ensuring the implementation of United Nations resolutions, in particular resolution 3212 (XXIX).\n113.\tThe arbitrary and tragic division of the Korean people is also of concern to my Government. General Assembly resolution 3390 B (XXX) embodies basic elements likely to promote the peaceful reunification of that Asian country without foreign interference.\n114.\tDisarmament has become a matter of life and death for the whole of mankind. It is at once horrifying and scandalous that so much physical and intellectual energy, so many material and financial resources, so many sacrifices- in short, so much work-should be devoted to research on and the manufacture of weapons of war of high destructive capacity capable of destroying all human life on our planet if ever there were to be a confrontation between those possessing such weapons of mass destruction.\n115.\tHave the fantasies of modern man become so confused that the will to die prevails over the will to live?\n116.\tIn the face of the horrifying and senseless accumulation of destructive weapons of every kind it is necessary to\nadopt every possible measure to ensure the application of the ideas put forward at the tenth special session of the General Assembly, on disarmament.\n117.\tMy country's Government fully subscribes to the idea of convening a world conference on disarmament. We are profoundly convinced that the United Nations remains the most fitting body for the discussion of both general and specific questions of disarmament, which affect all the peoples and countries of the world.\n118.\tI now wish to explain my Government's position on another important and redoubtable question affecting contemporary life.\n119.\tThe Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order I resolution 3202 (S-VI)] and the Charter of economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] emphasize a very important fact: it is not enough to reorganize the traditional framework of co-operation among the countries of the world; henceforward we must establish among the nations of the world new relations based on the principle of reciprocity in terms of both the interests of peoples and respect for their dignity.\n120.\tThe pressing need for a better balance among countries makes it necessary for decision-making powers to be shared more equitably by all.\n121.\tWe believe it is imperative to destroy the vicious circle that links the development of the developing countries to the continued growth and prosperity of the rich countries.\n122.\tWe think that it is neither rational nor equitable for about a billion human beings-more than one quarter of the earth's population\u2014to have to content themselves with per capita revenue of little more than $100 whereas in the developed world $3,000 per capita is regarded as quite insufficient.\n123.\tIt is quite clear that the structures that turn on the fundamental axis of international co-operation require great and sweeping changes at every level, otherwise many commitments will go unfulfilled.\n124.\tIn the context of these questions, assistance for the development of the Sahelian countries, the island countries and the least privileged countries appears to be an urgent duty of the United Nations.\n125.\tWe await with great hope the holding in Manila in May 1979 of the fifth session of UNCTAD. We are convinced that that session will consider in detail the results achieved through the implementation of the decisions of the forth session,  including the possible results of negotiations at present under way.\n126.\tBut all of this presupposes the political will of the more fortunate rich countries.\n127.\tThe new alternative-that is, technical co-operation among developing countries\u2014is also a historical necessity. This is a conscious, responsible, politically motivated process the fundamental objective of which is to forge all kinds of links between developing countries.\n128.\tIn conclusion, we should like to express our support for the principles of the movement of non-aligned countries. We are convinced that the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, to be held in Havana next year, will help to strengthen the united action of that movement.\n129.\tIn fact, the non-aligned movement is a dynamic force whose contribution is highly constructive within the context of the many contradictions of the contemporary world.\n130.\tSuffice it to recall the assistance given by that movement to national liberation struggles throughout the world, in particular in the African continent. The non- aligned movement fights imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism, racism and apartheid; and that is good; it is healthy.\n131.\tThe link between national liberation struggles, international economic, technical and cultural co-operation and disarmament is a strong one, and this makes all those problems the real problems of our time. Therefore, there must be greater solidarity and justice to ensure that peace and progress prevail for the whole of mankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff73.\tMr. President, allow me, on behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, to extend to you my heartfelt congratulations on your election to the lofty post of President of the thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am convinced that you will successfully perform the arduous task entrusted to you.\n74.\tMy heartfelt congratulations and my sincere thanks go likewise to Mr, Lazar Mojsov for the excellent way in which he guided the work of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly.\n75.\tI take this opportunity to tell the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, how much we appreciate his persevering efforts to strengthen peace and international co-operation, and his appeals for international aid for my country following the serious drought that beset us last year and the unprecedented floods we have suffered this year.\n76.\tFinally, I should like to congratulate most sincerely the people of Solomon Islands on the admission of their country this year to membership of the United Nations after a long struggle for independence. I am convinced that the accession of that country to full national sovereignty will speed up the decolonization process.\n77.\tGenerally speaking, throughout this year the international situation has continued to develop in favour of the forces of national independence, peace, democracy and social progress. Nevertheless, the world is confronted by fresh problems which seriously threaten international peace and co-operation. Recently, in view of the intensified revolutionary struggle of peoples, imperialism and international reactionary forces, notwithstanding the failure of their manoeuvres to perpetuate international tension- an J their attempts at sabotage, division, intimidation, interference and aggression against the peoples, have closed their ranks in order to maintain their position and to extend their sphere of influence at the expense of peoples struggling for their national independence, peace, democracy and social progress.\n78.\tIn order to achieve their evil designs, imperialism and reactionary forces have, in certain parts of the world, had recourse to pressure and subversion, to try to topple or destabilize progressive' regimes. They have also practised, in certain parts of the world, the policy \\\"of decrying interference in order to justify \\\"their own treacherous interference and aggression.\n79.\tBut, thanks to vigilance and the resolute struggle of peoples and international solidarity, imperialism and the forces of international reaction have not succeeded in their criminal designs and it is obvious that they will not succeed just as they will never manage to stop the march of history. The world has noted that since the overwhelming victory won by the peoples of Laos, Viet-Nam and Kampuchea over aggressive imperialism, the balance of power in the world has always tipped in favour of the forces of peace, national independence, democracy and social progress. In that respect the brilliant victories won by the stalwart peoples of Angola and Mozambique against Portuguese colonialism, the victory of the revolution in Ethiopia, as well as that of the people of Afghanistan, are eloquent examples.\n\n80.\tWe hail those great successes, so many positive contributions to the strengthening of peace and so many defeats for imperialism, colonialism and reaction.\n81.\tI should like to take stock of the present situation in the Lao People's Democratic Republic. While relying basically on our own capacity, with the benefit of the assistance and support of various United Nations bodies, the socialist countries, the non-aligned countries and our friends, as well as various international organizations, the Lao people has exerted great efforts to defend its independence and to rebuild its homeland.\n82.\tWhile overcoming countless difficulties and obstacles our people has achieved major successes in the creation of the material bases for a socialist economy, in maintaining security and order in the country, in eliminating the aftermath of war and the defects that were the legacy of the former regime, in improving the material and cultural conditions of life of our people, and in making an active contribution to the strengthening of peace and stability in South-East Asia and throughout the world.\n83.\tI should like to take this opportunity to express on behalf of my Government my deep thanks to the specialized agencies and the United Nations, the socialist countries, the non-aligned countries and other friendly countries, as well as to' the lion-governmental organizations, for the assistance and valuable support they have given to us in our immense task of national rebuilding.\n84.\tI express the hope that the movement of assistance and international support for my country will be expanded even further in the future to allow us to resolve the urgent problems posed by the serious floods which have just severely affected the centre and south of my country, causing considerable damage to our economy, which is essentially based upon agriculture. According to the preliminary estimate more than 110,000 hectares of paddy fields have been flooded. That represents a loss of about 120.500 tons of rice; 500,000 people are threatened with famine; 22,381 families have been left without shelter; and hundreds of head of cattle have been lost. Those losses must be added to those caused by the great drought of last year and they have compounded our difficulties. I wish to appeal to the international community for sizeable temporary assistance.\n85.\tSince its creation on 2 December 1975, the Lao People's Democratic Republic has always pursued a foreign policy of peace, independence, friendship and non- alignment. In pursuit of that policy, we are in favour of relations of friendship and co-operation with all countries, irrespective of their social and political regimes, on the basis of a strict respect for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well a & non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, equality and mutual advantage.\n86.\tWe are an integral part of the vast region of South-East Asia and my country cannot remain indifferent to the events which are taking place in that part of the world and which might disrupt, in one way or another, peace and stability in the region. The countries of South-East Asia which have been through a long and painful period of hostility and conflict created by external Powers which aimed to divide and dominate the peoples of the region, now need peace and stability, the necessary prerequisites for their independence and development, and that is why we advocate co-operation between the countries and South-East Asia and condemn any policy of the big Powers which would intervene in the internal affairs of those countries, foment confrontation between them and make South-East Asia an instrument of their expansionist and hegemonistic policy. Therefore, we profoundly regret the conflicts which now pit our close neighbours against each other and which destroy the solidarity and the friendship which have long existed between those countries.\n87.\tFaithful to its policy of peace and friendship, the Lao People's Democratic Republic has always maintained the principle according to which any dispute between countries of the region should be resolved by peaceful negotiations without any foreign interference. We deem the proposals put forward by the Socialist Republic of Viet-Nam in a search for a negotiated settlement to the conflict, on the basis of good will and sincerity on both sides, to be just and reasonable. Such a settlement would meet not only the interests of the peoples of the countries concerned but also those of all peoples throughout the region.\n88.\tFurthermore, we staunchly support the efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at replacing the Armistice Agreement by a peace agreement, and calling for the speedy, total and unconditional withdrawal of American troops from South Korea for a peaceful and independent reunification of Korea.\n89.\tWith regard to the Indian Ocean, we are against the presence of imperialist military bases in Diego Garcia and we support efforts to have the Indian Ocean made a zone of peace.\n90.\tWhen we look at other parts of the world we note with concern that the Zionist and expansionist State of Israel, benefiting from the massive assistance and unconditional support of imperialism, continues unabashedly to occupy Arab territories and Palestine in utter contempt for international law and United Nations resolutions.\n91.\tIt is quite obvious that the settlement of the Middle East problem will be achieved only by the resolute struggle and solidarity of all the Arab parties concerned. Manoeuvres designed to divide the Arab countries and, possibly, to obtain a separate settlement of the Middle East problem run counter to the legitimate interests of the Arab and Palestinian peoples and do not serve the cause of peace in the Middle East or in the world. Similarly, any attempt to minimize or destroy the PLO, the sole authentic representative of the Palestinian people, will certainly be doomed to failure.\n92.\tWith regard to Cyprus, we continue to call for the urgent, total and effective implementation of United Nations General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) and we support the just struggle of the Cypriot people for the preservation of the unity, territorial integrity and non- aligned policy of Cyprus, and for the speedy, total and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops from the island.\n93.\tIn the African continent, and especially in southern Africa, we vigorously denounce the acts of barbaric repression of the racist regimes of Rhodesia and South Africa and of imperialism against the peoples of South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe and their obstinate refusal to allow those valiant African peoples to exercise their right to self-determination and independence and we firmly support the South African, Namibian and Zimbabwean peoples in their struggle against racism and apartheid,, colonial oppression and exploitation and interference and acts of aggression by imperialism, neo-colonialism and forces of international reaction, and for the recovery of their fundamental national rights.\n94.\tWe support the peoples of Angola and Mozambique, as well as the other peoples of the front-line countries, their struggle to defend their sovereignty, territorial integrity and national independence against the aggressive machinations of imperialism and its reactionary flunkeys.\n95.\tWe support the struggle, of the Saharan people,, under the leadership of the Frente POLISARIO, for its self- determination, in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).\n96.\tWe firmly support the peoples of Africa in their., struggle to eliminate all vestiges of colonialism, racism and apartheid and to foil all manoeuvres of interference and aggression of imperialism.\n97.\tWe vigorously condemn the economic blockade imposed by the United States of America on the Republic of Cuba and we firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban people in its tasks of national defence, building socialism and the realization of its noble internationalist duty.\n98.\tWe support the efforts of the people of Panama fully to recover its sovereignty over the Canal Zone.\n99.\tLast June the General Assembly held a special session devoted to disarmament, a problem of particular importance. The Lao People's Democratic Republic welcomes the results of the work of the tenth special session, which constitutes an important stage towards the World Disarmament Conference. That is to say that we favour a halt to the arms race and the banning of weapons of mass destruction, including the neutron bomb.\n100.\tAs a developing country the Lao People's Democratic Republic is in complete solidarity with the struggle being waged by the countries of the Group of 77 to establish the new international economic order. However, we are of the opinion that the developing countries owe it to themselves to forge the new international economic order themselves. To this effect, they must at all costs succeed in building up an independent and autonomous economy, which can be achieved only by increasing relations of co-operation between all developing countries, on the basis of equality and mutual advantage, and between the developing countries and the socialist countries, and the developed countries which are sincerely working to bring about the new international economic order.\n101.\tThe Lao People's Democratic Republic is a small country whose centuries-old backwardness has been made much worse by decades of a colonialist and imperialist war of aggression. At the present time, notwithstanding the numerous difficulties caused by acts of sabotage, intimidation, pressure, interference and the aggression of imperialism and reactionary forces, the Lao people is determined to go forward and to build up its country and make it rich and prosperous, thus contributing to the development of the forces of peace and socialism.\n102.\tOn behalf of the Lao people, which is concerned about peace and friendship among peoples, our delegation pledges its active contribution to the work of our Assembly, which has been allotted the tasks of strengthening peace and international security and of promoting friendship, co-operation and progress for all peoples.\n103.\tIn conclusion, I hope for the brilliant success of the work of the thirty-third regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff103.\tOn behalf of our delegation I should like to congratulate you, Sir, upon your election to the high post of President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly and to wish you success in that responsible task.\n104.\tThe delegation of the Ukrainian SSR wishes to welcome the delegation of the State of Solomon Islands on the occasion of its admission to membership in the United Nations. We sincerely wish the people of that State prosperity and good fortune.\n105.\tThe actual situation in the world and the evaluation of it made by many delegations during this session give occasion to conclude that, despite the intrigues of the opponents of peace and co-operation among nations, the struggle for stable detente, peace and disarmament has demonstrated that it has enormous vitality and enjoys the wide support of peoples. The example of Europe, where the situation is developing under the favourable impact of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference, shows how detente is becoming something quite specific and tangible, that becomes particularly apparent in the relations of the Soviet Union with France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Sweden, Austria, Finland and other countries, in an over-all development of the links of socialist countries with countries of Western Europe.\n106.\tBeing closely united by mutual objectives and unbreakable friendship, and acting as one, the States of the socialist community are doing everything possible further to widen and deepen detente, to curb the arms race and to strengthen peace and international security. Peoples are becoming ever more convinced that peace and socialism are inseparable.\n107.\tHowever, at this time we should like to draw attention to what is complicating the international situation. Facts reveal that at the present time we are witnessing an activation of the imperialist and other reactionary forces which are trying to block the dynamic development of detente and its extension to the entire world. Recent developments show that the world is undergoing dangerous changes which are impeding the future development of positive trends. What is really the matter?\n108.\tIn our opinion, the activation of the opponents of detente and of imperialists and reactionaries can be explained, first and foremost by the fact that positive processes in international relations have threatened the interests of those who capitalize on the arms race, on the preservation of colonial bonds, on inequality and exploitation, and also on the needs arising from the waging of the \\\"cold war\\\".\n109.\tTo block the further development of detente, to prevent the merging of political and military detente and to halt social progress\u2014that is the goal set for themselves by the enemies of -the peoples, from the imperialists and extreme reactionaries to the Chinese leaders who work hand in hand with them. -\n110.\tA real affront was dealt to the peoples by the militarist decisions of the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which approved a long-term programme for stepping up the arms race of the North Atlantic bloc at the time when the tenth special session of the General Assembly was being held. In the United States, a huge military budget has been approved for the fiscal year\n. 1979, with tremendous appropriations earmarked for the development and production of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction, such as the neutron bomb and the cruise missile. One hears again bellicose speeches which are reminiscent of the days of the \\\"cold war\\\" and which are designed, according to the United States press, to demonstrate \\\"military muscle\\\". In order to camouflage their militarist course, they present the Soviet Union as a \\\"danger to peace\\\" and slander its policy of solidarity with peoples fighting against colonialism in all its forms and manifestations. That absurdity reaches its peak with allegations that new types of weapons and bellicose speeches are, as it were, necessary only as a \\\"trump card in the game\\\" with the Soviet side or as a \\\"confirmation of the strength and courage\\\" of various leaders in the administration. There is too much at stake; the world is oversaturated with armaments; one should not play with fire and risk peace for the sake of one or another temporary consideration.\n111.\tThe aggressive forces of the West are joined by the Peking leaders in openly boasting of their course towards the militarization of their country and in predicting the inevitability of new war and a thermonuclear clash. By provoking conflicts and zealously opposing detente, the statesmen in Peking are, however, increasingly unmasking themselves. Their attempts to fall into step with the non-aligned countries will hardly mislead anyone. It was quite recently in this very hall, at the tenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly, which was devoted to disarmament, that Peking's representatives spoke against the aspirations of the non-aligned countries towards the consolidation of detente and the halting of the arms race, only to find themselves covered with shame. Now they are, in fact, opposed to the non-nuclear States being given special guarantees by the nuclear Powers. We are confident that that position will not find support either at this session or at any subsequent one.\n112.\tRejecting the dangerous course of rivalry in the field of armaments, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, have put forward a realistic and wide-ranging programme of measures to curb the arms race. This programme covers both nuclear and conventional weapons.\n113.\tThe halting of the arms race and disarmament are the cardinal problems of contemporary international relations. They are the cardinal problems because, to borrow Leonid Brezhnev's graphic phrase, \\\"the soil for peaceful cooperation between States has obviously been seriously disturbed by the continuing arms race\\\".\n114.\tIn recent years some important steps towards curbing the arms race have been taken. Certain progress has already been achieved in the negotiations between the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom on the general and complete prohibition of all nuclear test explosions in all spheres. The Soviet-American negotiations on the prohibition of chemical weapons have continued to harmonize positions. However, no agreement on these issues has been reached as yet and we urge the speeding-up of the work on them.\n115.\tThere is a reasonably clear understanding in the world that to stop the nuclear-arms race and in particular to prevent the increase in the number of its participants means coming to grips with nuclear disarmament. A substantial contribution to the solution of this problem could be made by the conclusion of an agreement which would enable non-nuclear-weapon States to strengthen their security.\n116.\tThe Soviet Union has submitted for the consideration of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, as an important and urgent matter,, a proposal for the conclusion of an international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States [A/33f241]. This proposal was convincingly explained here a few days ago [8th meeting] by Mr. A. A. Gromyko, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR fully supports this proposal and the draft convention submitted by the Soviet Union.\n117.\tThis proposal takes into account the wishes of non-nuclear States concerning their security guarantees, a subject they have spoken of repeatedly in the United Nations. At the same time the proposal takes into account the relevant appeal by the special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament.\n118.\tThe Soviet Union has recently stated that it will never use nuclear weapons again v. States which renounce the production and acquisition of nuclear weapons and do not have them in their territories. At the same time the Soviet Union has called upon other nuclear Powers to follow its example and assume similar obligations. The United States and the United Kingdom are known also to have made statements in this respect, but their reservations lessened the importance of those statements. It is obvious that the most effective solution of this problem would be a universal commitment on the subject embodied in the form of a multilateral agreement. Such is the purpose of the draft international convention submitted by the Soviet Union.\n119.\tThis convention would undoubtedly strengthen the rules governing the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is no secret that many feel anxiety over the possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of such States as South Africa and Israel. Their policies of nuclear armament would be extremely dangerous for peace, particularly in Africa and in the Middle East.\n120.\tThe problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is closely related to the problem of the non-deployment of nuclear weapons in the territories of States where there are no such weapons at the present time. What is meant here is that those States should pledge themselves to prevent nuclear devices from being introduced into their territories, and nuclear States, in turn, should pledge themselves not to deploy nuclear weapons in countries where there are no such weapons at present. A pledge given-to this effect by nuclear and non-nuclear Powers would help prevent a possible destabilization of the present strategic situation and would constitute a step towards the complete withdrawal of these weapons from the territories of other countries. We support the idea of such obligations being undertaken by the States concerned.\n121.\tThe Soviet Union proposed at the special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament the discontinuance of the production of nuclear weapons and the gradual reduction of their stockpiles with a view to their subsequent total elimination. The Final Document of the session pointed out that negotiations on this subject should be started as a matter of the highest priority.\n122.\tOur delegation, too, supports the idea of starting such negotiations as soon as possible.\n123.\tWe understand that many important problems will have to be negotiated in the course of those talks, such as how to stop the manufacture of nuclear arms, how to begin gradually reducing accumulated stockpiles; what should be the stages and phases of this process; to what extent some nuclear Powers would participate in each stage of this process, bearing in mind the differences in their nuclear war potential; how to preserve intact the present balance of nuclear power while continually reducing its levels. The very fact that these problems were raised in the document submitted by the Soviet Union  for consideration at the special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament testifies to a profoundly businesslike approach on the part of the USSR to the forthcoming talks and indicates that various opinions on this question, particularly those voiced at the United Nations General Assembly sessions, have been taken into account. Thus the purpose is clear and the ways to achieve it are well denned. We call upon delegations to the current session to do all they can to ensure that the talks start immediately.\n124.\tOur delegation is in favour of commencing concrete preparatory work for the World Disarmament Conference. Such an authoritative international forum as the World Disarmament Conference could take practical decisions which would be binding on all States.\n125.\tWe will continue to state that the development and implementation of measures of nuclear disarmament should naturally be inseparably connected with the consolidation of international legal guarantees for the security of States, such as a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations. In this connexion we note with satisfaction that the United Nations Special Committee on Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Principle of Non-Use of Force in International Relations, which is considering this draft treaty, has started its work. In our opinion this draft deserves universal support.\n126.\tOur delegation regards as very important the proposal of the Polish People's Republic that the General Assembly adopt a declaration on preparation of societies for life in peace [A[C.l/33/2]. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR favours its adoption.\n127.\tThe agenda of the session, as usual, includes many items related to the complete elimination of the colonial system and the establishment of such relations in the world as would make it impossible for imperialist Powers to exploit newly independent States. Of late, Africa has become the focus of world politics. The end of colonial and racist domination in the south of that continent is near. The United Nations, and in particular its Special Committee against Apartheid of which the Ukrainian SSR is a member, plays its proper role in this matter.\n128.\tIt is more than two years now since imperialism began the offensive against the forces of national and social liberation in Africa. That offensive is conducted under the false slogan of \\\"restoring stability\\\", which the peoples of that continent allegedly need. From the imperialists' point of view \\\"stability\\\" means, first of all, the possibility of exploiting Africa unhindered and confidence as to the security and safety of the economic positions of imperialist Powers and monopolies in African countries for centuries to come. Similarly, everything that poses a threat to the preservation and consolidation of the neo-colonialist positions of the West is called \\\"destabilization\\\" of Africa or a violation of the \\\"code of detente\\\" interpreted in a very peculiar way. Meanwhile, the West is busy making up so-called plans for a settlement in Zimbabwe that would keep, in a slightly renovated form, the same old racist regime. Moreover, imperialists are frustrating the implementation of the decisions taken at the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on Namibia. We are confident that the peoples of Africa will not allow their destiny to be decided by those who some 15 to 20 years ago exercised complete colonial domination on their continent.\n129.\tThe policy pursued by the socialist countries with respect to Africa is clear and consistent. As usual, they are on the side of the forces which defend the cause of national independence, social progress and democracy. At the same time, they seek no advantages for themselves, nor hunt for concessions, nor strive for political domination, nor seek any military bases. The Ukrainian SSR, in particular, takes an active part in the development of relations between the USSR and young, independent States that are designed to strengthen their political and economic independence, to help combat the vestiges of colonial oppression, apartheid and racism. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR will also be guided by this position of principle in the discussion of appropriate items on the session's agenda.\n130.\tThe settlement of the Middle East crisis takes a place of prominence in United Nations activities. The Middle East crisis continues unabated, and the coals of the hotbed of war smoulder, threatening to burst into flame. Behind-the- scenes manoeuvres and separate deals, which are now under way, cannot untie the knot of differences in the Middle East. In fact, these behind-the-scenes separate deals are really aimed at splitting the Arabs and pitting them one against the other, imposing upon the Arab countries conditions profitable to Israel and consolidating the existing situation, under which Israel is reaping the fruits of its aggression without let or hindrance. These deals push aside the Palestine Liberation Organization from any part in solving the crisis, although it is the legitimate representative of the Arab people of Palestine and is at the head of their just struggle for freedom and national independence.\n131.\tThe conflict can be eliminated only on the basis of complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967; the implementation of the inalienable rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including the creation of their own independent State; and international guarantees for the security of all States of this region.\n132.\tNot far from the Middle East lies Cyprus. The situation on the island remains tense. The Ukrainian SSR advocates, as before, the solution of the Cyprus problem on the basis of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus, as well as the convening of a representative international conference on Cyprus under the auspices of the United Nations.\n133.\tOf late, greater understanding has been developing in Asia to the effect that peace and security on that continent also should be strengthened by joint action by all Asian States. To achieve this, it is necessary, above all, to put an end to the attempts at hegemonic pressure on socialist Viet Nam and at violations of its sovereignty. We declare from this rostrum the complete solidarity of the Ukrainian people, together with the entire Soviet people, with heroic Viet Nam.\n134.\tIt is nigh time to fulfil the resolution adopted at the thirtieth session of the General Assembly on the Korean question [resolution 3390 A (XXX)] that is aimed ct a peaceful reunification of Korea without foreign interference and at the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea.\n135.\tAmong the distracting manoeuvres of imperialism designed to prevent the adoption of concrete decisions on acute contemporary issues there is also the prominent hypocritical campaign waged by it in defence of human rights. Attempts are made to interfere in the internal affairs of other peoples, including the Ukrainian people, and to distort the real nature of socialist democracy. The echoes of that campaign are also heard in the United Nations, where the Western Powers engineered the notorious proposal to establish a post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. In the recent past, that campaign developed the very peculiar and frequent practice of defending persons who, being recruited by foreign intelligence agencies, are engaged in subversive activities against the socialist system. But there is no State in the world that would not punish crimes and would not protect its security from the plotting of agents of foreign intelligence services. The socialist countries are no exception to this general rule.\n136.\tWe stand for the co-operation of States in promoting and encouraging human rights. The capitalist countries\u2014 where unemployment is on the rise and where the right to work, to housing, to rest and to health services is not ensured\u2014violate blatantly and on a large scale the rights of many millions of working peoples. Despite the fact that these countries practise discrimination against national minorities, that immigrants from developing countries are subjected there to ruthless exploitation and that thousands of political prisoners languish in gaols, responsible representatives of these countries set records of hypocrisy in speaking out in defence of human rights.\n137.\tThere is no moral right to speak of human rights for those who maintain close ties with South African racists oppressing 20 million Africans, those who supply modern weapons to the Israeli aggressors, who have deprived, the Arab people of Palestine of their ancestral lands, or those who have brought to power the Pinochet Fascist clique in Chile, The Ukrainian SSR, a member of the Special Committee against Apartheid and of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, will, as before, make its contribution to the struggle for ensuring human rights, which are trampled underfoot in the countries where capitalism rules supreme. To those who are eager to interfere in our domestic affairs, to \\\"critics\\\" of social democracy, we should like to reply with the following words of V. V. Shcherbitsky, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party, delivered from the rostrum of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR on the occasion of the adoption of the Republic's new Constitution. Our democracy, he said,\n\\\"... reflects and defends the interests of the working class, of all working people of socialist society. The people of the Ukraine has always stood and stands in support of such a democracy.\\\"\n138.\tThe agenda of this session also contains another group of major problems of world significance whose solutions are being impatiently awaited by a large part of humanity. These are the problems of overcoming the backwardness of developing countries and of restructuring international economic relations on a just and democratic basis.\n139.\tThe matter is that the present character of international economic relations, which has developed under a completely different correlation of world forces and which satisfies only the selfish interests of imperialist monopolies, has run counter to the vital interests of the overwhelming majority of countries and to the development of the international situation in general. This discrepancy became especially evident as the process of detente produced the prerequisites needed for solving pressing economic problems in the interests of all the nations of the world.\n140.\tAs for the substantive contribution to the solution of the problems of development, the direct way to increase it is indicated in the Soviet proposal on the reduction of military budgets.  We hope that proposal will win universal support and will be implemented.\n141.\tWe emphatically stress that the main factor for the achievement of real progress by developing countries lies in their uncompromising struggle against the policy of diktat and neo-colonialism in international economic relations and the implementation of sweeping social and economic reforms in those countries. In this struggle, the developing countries can fully count on the solidarity of the peoples of the socialist countries, their allies in the struggle against the common enemy\u2014imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism.\n142.\tAt present the world situation has become more complex. The burning problems of today are awaiting resolution. The course towards detente pursued by the Soviet Union, other socialist countries and peace-loving forces in the world has created possibilities for stopping the arms race, eliminating hotbeds of conflict and developing co-operation between States., The duty of the United Nations is to use these opportunities and to remove the road-blocks put up by those who are afraid of the prospects of peace and international security. What is necessary today is to turn from words to deeds. This concerns above all the problem of stopping the arms race and of disarmament. We are quite sure that, if we do not take resolute steps against the arms race in the very near future, we shall have to pay dearly. The thirty-third session of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly should make its contribution to ensuring the change to concrete activities and actions, practical solutions and understandings.\n143.\tAlong with other delegations, the delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic is ready for such a change and is ready to support it. Let deeds speak louder than words; let the cause of peace all over the world really grow in strength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff251.\tThe delegation of Liberia extends its warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your well-deserved election to the presidency of this thirty-third session of the General Assembly. We wish you well in the performance of your tedious responsibilities and pledge our unswerving co-operation and support. It is our hope that under your able leadership and guidance this session will be marked by a constructive and creative spirit.\n252.\tIn the same light, we wish to express our appreciation to your illustrious predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who presided with distinction over the thirty-second session of this Assembly and three special sessions of significant historic meaning. His tactful handling of delicate issues and\nhis wise conduct of difficult negotiations certainly merit our high commendation.\n253.\tTo the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, we offer a special word of appreciation for his undaunted efforts in the interest of peace, prosperity and justice for all mankind, again reflected in his concise but comprehensive annual report to this Assembly on the work of the Organization. The selfless, loyal and dedicated service he continues to render to the international community has won for him high esteem and credit.\n254.\tOnce again we have assembled in this great hall of the United Nations, as we do each year, to assess the progress of peace in our world, to debate the problems of global concern and to chart the course for a better future for mankind. Standing on the threshold of the last quarter of this century, we perceive grave challenges for the international community with respect to those noble principles and great objectives which we as Members of this Organization are pledged to pursue and implement.\n255.\tPeace remains precarious and human rights are wantonly denied in many parts of our one world. Self-determination is still less than universal. Debasing policies of apartheid, racism and racial discrimination continue to insult the conscience of humanity. Vestiges and upsurges of colonialist and neo-colonialist oppression and foreign domination remain deeply entrenched. Exploitation and deprivation bear heavily on the underprivileged. The race for weapons of mass destruction escalates unabated. Imbalances in world economic relations seem to defy change. Various forms of pollution and the wasteful use of limited and irreplaceable resources threaten to plunge humanity into an environmental crisis of unprecedented magnitude.\n256.\tThose are the dismal realities of our times. A reversal of those trends and the blossoming of a more hopeful future demand concerted and positive action by us all. It will require the adoption of an approach truly reflective of the interdependence of nations, an approach transcending parochial conceptions of national interests and demonstrating genuine commitment to the fulfilment of shared goals and aspirations. The seeds of mistrust, fear and suspicion, whether planted in the Middle East, southern Africa or Cyprus, must be uprooted and replaced by mutual trust and understanding, friendship and co-operation.\n257.\tOur total energies, our determined efforts must be galvanized and directed towards the resolution of problems that affect our common interests. It is through these efforts that we might ensure for all mankind the enjoyment of a minimum standard of living devoid of hunger, apprehensions, ignorance, disease and poverty.\n258.\tIn this global undertaking we welcome the participation of Solomon Islands, whose admission as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of the United Nations represents a step forward in this Organization's endeavour to attain true universality , as envisaged by the Charter. But mere increase in membership alone is no guarantee of an effective and viable organization; nor will it ensure the realization of established objectives: those can come to\nfruition only through the determined will and combined effort of each and every Member State.\n259.\tThe new world order to which we aspire must envisage an equitable and democratic system of international relations. It must be based on co-operation, equality and justice, rooted in respect for fundamental rights, and geared towards the achievement of the greatest good for the greatest number.\n260.\tWe can all agree that those factors constitute the essential prerequisites for an enduring international peace. And yet, peace continues to elude us. Whether mankind's common fate will be one of peace or of destruction remains uncertain. That uncertainty is as glaring in southern Africa as in the Middle East and other vortices of tension.\n261.\tIn the case of southern Africa, the inhuman, abhorrent and repressive system of apartheid and racial discrimination still undermines the dignity and worth of the true African personality. There, an immoral and callous white minority daily suppresses the majority black population. There, racist obstinacy and recalcitrance sharply confront the wrath and dogged determination of a people whose just claim to freedom, human dignity, equality and independence will inevitably triumph.\n262.\tThe just entitlement of Namibia to independence in the entirety of its territory has always been upheld by this Assembly, as recently confirmed at its ninth special session devoted to that question. My Government had taken the occasion of that special session to indicate its recognition of the proposal of the five Western nations\\\" as a basis for further negotiations towards independence of the Territory. In the same vein our doubts were expressed about the sincerity of South Africa's acceptance of the proposal. Time and events have substantiated those apprehensions. The deceptive nature of the South African regime has thus been exposed by its decision to implement its own formula for independence in Namibia, implicitly rejecting the proposal of the five Western nations, which has won the endorsement of the Security Council and the international community.\n263.\tThe historical role of Liberia in championing the cause of independence for Namibia is well known and needs no further elaboration here. My Government maintains that any formula for independence in Namibia must accord to SWAPO a distinction commensurate with its role in the vanguard of the liberation struggle.\n264.\tThe United Nations cannot accept, without losing credibility, yet another affront by South Africa to' its legitimate authority over Namibia. The international community cannot shirk its responsibility by tolerating the subterfuges, schemes and machinations of racist bigots in South Africa who are bent on imposing an unrepresentative and puppet leadership on the Namibian people. It is more imperative now than ever before that we counter this new South African challenge by imposing mandatory economic sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. We believe that even those countries which heretofore had opposed the application of those measures should by now be convinced of their necessity given the continued intransigence and obstinacy of racist South Africa.\n265.\tWith respect to Zimbabwe, the international community has rejected the so-called internal settlement as a basis for genuine independence with majority rule. Even the signatories to that agreement have come to recognize its inadequacy. Yet they refuse to join the international community in the search for a more wholesome settlement. Thus, increasing violence is the state of affairs in that troubled Territory.\n266.\tMy Government believes that the last hope for a peaceful resolution of this crisis lies in the proposal for an all-party conference involving the Patriotic Front and other political factions of Zimbabwe, aimed at reaching an acceptable formula for independence on the basis of the Anglo-American proposal.\n267.\tWe have repeatedly cautioned that time is of the essence if we are to avert a catastrophe in southern Africa. For the patience and endurance of the oppressed people are by no means without limits. Already their quest for freedom has taken the form of armed resistance. It will intensify and escalate unless the international community resolves to take firm, positive and united action to remove all obstructions in the path of independence in Namibia, independence with majority rule in Zimbabwe, and majority rule in South Africa itself. For its part, Liberia will continue to consolidate its efforts for the attainment of those objectives, whether by peaceful means or through an intensified armed struggle.\n268.\tTowards the establishment of a lasting peace in the Middle East, recent developments have given cause for guarded optimism. I refer to the historic tripartite summit meetings convened at Camp David in the United States between the heads of State of Egypt, Israel and the United States. It has been disclosed that the summit meetings succeeded in designing a framework for peace in the Middle East and laying the basis for the conclusion of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.\n269.\tMy Government, always preferring that conflicts be resolved through the instruments of  conciliation and  negotiation, commends the initiative taken by President Jimmy Carter in hosting this important meeting and the flexibility, goodwill and compromising spirit demonstrated by the parties concerned. The results of the summit meetings no doubt represent a significant step in the application of the principle of peaceful coexistence in the Middle East.\n270.\tIt remains our hope, however, that within the framework of the agreements reached at Camp David the Palestinian people will be allowed fully to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and the establishment of a State of their own. To this we add the wish that the impact of a just and lasting settlement in the Middle East will serve to extinguish the fires of hatred and conflict now ablaze in Lebanon. Such a settlement, if it is to\\\" occasion genuine and enduring peace, must rest on Arab unity and solidarity.\n271.\tThe calm that prevails in Cyprus, in the presence of a United Nations peace-keeping force, should not lure the\ninternational community into a false notion that conditions for a genuine peace have thus been fulfilled; for the danger of renewed explosion simmers beneath the current stalemate, making real the possibility of an eruption of hostilities. Liberia remains convinced that the two communities in Cyprus have the capacity to decide their common fate with due regard to the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the island and the enjoyment of freedom, justice and equality by both communities. This cause can be advanced through the implementation of relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\n272.\tSimilarly, as regards the Korean question, my Government strongly believes that the joint communiqu\u00e9 of 4 July 1972 constitutes a realistic basis for bridging the chasm that divides the Korean people. We hold the view that a pragmatic and realistic effort to resolve this problem should be aimed at encouraging the two parties directly concerned to resume their dialogue as early as possible. This approach would enable them to dispel lingering mistrust and fear.\n273.\tIt is regrettable to note that 30 years have elapsed since the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and yet gross violations of these fundamental rights are still common occurrences in many parts of our one world. Man's inhumanity to his fellow man has taken more repugnant forms, clearly violating internationally accepted standards of morality and decency.\n274.\tThere is a pressing need to reaffirm these rights in all their aspects since they must be recognized as the strongest foundation for international peace and security. It is here that the phenomenon of progress finds its truest significance, for. development can be fully appreciated only when man serves as the central point of all development objectives and goals. This is the conviction that shapes and directs Liberia's domestic and foreign policy. There could be no better way to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights than by a common resolve to translate these lofty principles into meaningful action for human progress.\n275.\tThe question of international terrorism continues to be of deep concern to the world community. My Government regrets any action by anyone anywhere that takes or endangers innocent human life. We stand ready to cooperate with other Members of the United Nations in pursuing appropriate action to combat international terrorism, whether it be the hijacking of international carriers or the indiscriminate taking of hostages or the killing of innocent persons. Indeed, my Government during the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly supported the drafting of an international convention against the taking of hostages.\n276.\tAt this point, permit me to express to the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, through its Foreign Minister and Vice-Chancellor, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, my Government's deep appreciation. of the\nFederal Republic's initiative in this grave and important matter. We pledge our full support for this laudable effort.\n277.\tDuring the thirty-second session of the General Assembly my delegation also joined in the efforts to seek measures to prevent international terrorism, which resulted in the adoption of a resolution on this question. We remain deeply disturbed over all acts of international terrorism, but my delegation also recognizes that there are often underlying causes that breed and spawn terrorism and that these causes need to be redressed if international terrorism is to be eliminated.\n278.\tThe process of human development could be aided by a progressive movement towards general and complete disarmament. The tenth special session, devoted to this question, marked a major step towards the attainment of this goal. We consider that session to be indicative of the growing awareness that peace remains fragile in the face of a mounting arms race, with the unchecked economic burden it entails. Perhaps the greatest achievement of the session lies in the establishment of a constructive framework for deliberations on and negotiation of disarmament issues in all their aspects. While institutional machinery cannot be a guarantee of the translation of ideals into realities or serve as a substitute for political will, it constitutes an essential link in the realization of declared intentions and aspirations. Therefore we believe that a rededication of our efforts would contribute to maintaining the momentum of the tenth special session both in principle and in practice.\n279.\tThe central role of the sea for the future quality of life cannot be over-emphasized. As the last untapped reservoir of terrestrial natural resources, it represents man's last hope in the management of the limited resources of our planet. It must, therefore, be the link that unites us in our endeavour to achieve collective economic security. Thus the oceans and the sea-bed must remain the common heritage of mankind, allowing all to benefit equally from the exploration and exploitation of resources in that region. We should each refrain from undertaking unilateral action which could undermine the efforts of the international community to formulate an acceptable convention on the law of the sea.\n280.\tThe quest for sustained-world economic growth and development remains a major preoccupation of my Government. We are mindful that only after the first decade of its existence did this Organization become regularly seized of problems of economic development. The sixth and seventh special sessions of this Assembly are historic for the unequivocal and unprecedented emphasis they placed on development and economic issues, which were made co-equal with political and security questions. We are gratified by the creation, within the structure of the United Nations, of the new post of Director-General for Development and International Economic Co-operation and here we commend the Secretary-General for his selection of Mr. Dadzie, a worthy son of Africa, to serve the international community in this vitally important position.\n281.\tNevertheless, it is a sad commentary that the constructive spirit that characterized the two special\nsessions has not permeated the wide range of negotiations motivated by them. Empty pronouncements, stalemated talks and endless rhetoric remain the order of the day. This is most evident in the case of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, which has failed to reach agreement on a matter as elementary as its mandate and terms of reference. The North-South dialogue remains deadlocked on such issues as orderly commodity markets, stabilized foreign exchange earnings, mutually beneficial corporate partnership, debt problems and an increased transfer of real resources to developing countries.'\n282.\tThe need for structural adjustments to meet the imbalances and inequalities among nations must be considered, negotiated and promoted. It is only through a continuing commitment to change and reform, coupled with the requisite political will and co-operation, that the New International Economic Order will be achieved.\n283.\tFacing the future, we have endorsed a blueprint for harmonious inter-State relations based on justice and solidarity. The United Nations provides the most appropriate framework for the attainment of this objective. It is within this Organization that a veritable code of conduct for nations can be progressively defined and adopted; it is here that peaceful co-operation between countries possessing different social structures can be developed, nurtured and transformed into more dynamic collaboration in building a genuinely humane world.\n284.\tWhile this Organization has been severely criticized for its weaknesses and short-comings, it has nevertheless remained a dynamic organism for contemporary international relations. From its very inception it was hampered by great-Power conflicts, buffeted by racism and nationalism and beset by financial and constitutional crises which threatened its very existence. It has not only survived these crises but has made significant contributions to peace and security. It has localized major conflicts, spearheaded the transition from colonialism to independence, mobilized substantial resources to enhance the socio-economic progress of peoples all over the world and championed the search for equality and justice in inter-State relations. In essence, the United Nations has served the interest of its Member States and the world community reasonably well.\n285.\tWhatever its short-comings, we must remain mindful of the fact that this Organization will be no less and can be no better than what we, its Member States, endeavour to make it. In an era of magnanimity and ruthlessness, of hopes and fears, of faith and doubt, of noble prospects and challenging adventure, ours is the duty to make this Organization a viable instrument of international peace and security. This is our challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff138.\tDominated as it is by hegemonistic rivalries, the international situation during the past year has been characterized by mounting tensions, the rousing and exacerbation of feelings and the proliferation of political and military conflicts, particularly in the countries of the third world, resulting in greater instability and poverty; This situation might, because of its serious and persistent vicissitudes, cloud our vision of the future, were it not for the fortunate appearance of a few rays of light in the diplomatic sky that give us reason for hope and strengthen our belief in the progress of mankind.\n139.\tConcern and hope, then, make up my mixed and seemingly contradictory feelings as I take part in these reflections on the state of the world that is this general debate, and as I set out the position of Cameroon on the problems of concern to the international community.\n140.\tBut I first join previous speakers in extending to you, Mr. President, most sincere and warm congratulations on your election, which pleases us immensely because, through your country, Colombia, it is a tribute to all of Latin America, a continent so close to Africa because of certain similarities in its human, material and cultural diversity but especially because of its commitment to the struggle against hunger, sickness and poverty and for the promotion of human dignity. There can be no doubt, Mr. President, that our work will benefit from your wise statesmanship, prudence, forbearance and awareness of the need for diplomatic compromise and from your sensitivity and creative imagination as a writer. I wish to assure you of the support and full co-operation of my delegation as you carry out your important tasks.\n141.\tI am also pleased, Mr. President, to express once again to Mr, Lazar Mojsov, your distinguished predecessor, my particular admiration of the competence and devotion that he showed as President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. He will surely go down in the history of our Organization as an accomplished diplomat who presided over four sessions of the General Assembly in one year and, above all, helped our universal Organization to adopt its first global plan of action for disarmament.\n142.\tThis year we have devoted a special session to one of the most distressing problems of our time, one that is of concern to all mankind because it relates directly to man's survival. My delegation took part in the tenth special session devoted to disarmament, convinced that all States, great and small, must at long last face up to their responsibilities and agree on new measures to remove the danger of another world-wide confrontation, which could occur if an end is not put to the spread of weapons of mass destruction.\n143.\tWe must deplore the fact that the great surge of hope created by the tenth special session did not lead States, especially those States that possess such weapons, to change their attitude with a view to making a concrete and affirmative start on the process of general disarmament, beginning with nuclear disarmament.\n144.\tWe do not wish to underestimate the importance of the Final Document adopted by consensus at the end of the tenth special session, which, in laying down the principles of the Programme of Action and of disarmament machinery, outlined a new approach to this extremely complex problem. We even believe that certain decisions, such as the decision to reform the negotiating structures of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, will considerably strengthen the bases of an international disarmament strategy. What causes us constant concern is the lack of a spirit of co-operation shown by States whose determination to dominate others seems to be at the root of the continuing excessive arms build-up, consuming untold resources and making world peace more and more precarious.\t...\n145.\tHow is it possible to explain the attitude of the nuclear States which, while affirming the principle of the non-use of nuclear weapons or . the threat of their use against non-nuclear States, refuse to adopt a binding international system that provides adequate guarantees of security?\n146.\tAs a non-aligned country, Cameroon, which has made peace a corner-stone of its development, remains convinced that world peace must be based not on a dangerous balance between over-armed military blocs, but rather on active co-operation among all States, all nations, and all peoples.\n147.\tWe can never denounce enough the shocking and growing disproportion between the enormous resources devoted to the build-up and perfecting of weapons and the modest sums, which incidentally are decreasing, allocated to assistance to the developing countries, whose debts have been soaring.\n148.\tIt is perhaps fitting to recall here what was said on this very subject nine years ago by the President of the United Republic of Cameroon, His Excellency Ahmadou Ahidjo. He said:\n\\\"It is, indeed, absurd that huge sums should continue to be swallowed up by the arms race while the bulk of mankind lives in tragic and unjust penury ... Unjust because, in the world today, one of the common tasks of mankind is to achieve progress the benefits of which must be shared fairly among all.\\\" \n149.\tYour brilliant introductory statement, Mr. President [1st meeting], which shared that conviction, particularly caught the attention of my delegation in a year when the development of the world economy is far from encouraging optimism\u2014a year when, disheartened by persistent turmoil, we are tempted to resort to ridiculous palliatives that push us farther and farther away from the accomplishments of the sixth and seventh special sessions, whose undeniable merit was to have been to make all the countries of the world aware of their interdependence and common destiny.\n150.\tIn the face of all these uncertainties and of the difficulties of all kinds, only the new international economic order is capable of re-establishing confidence in the future and the economic development of the world.\n151.\tStates must go beyond the mere management of the existing system, which has caused the disruptions to which our countries find themselves exposed, and embark resolutely on a far-reaching reform of conditions for a joint, just and equitable functioning of the international economy.\n152.\tHow can we fail to regret that international negotiations that are supposed to lead to that new order seem still to be getting nowhere because of the lack of political will and spirit of solidarity of the affluent countries, which, clinging to their privileges and the exorbitant advantages that they have bestowed upon themselves, reject any fundamental change or seek refuge behind flimsy ideological allegations?\n153.\tHence, the negotiations on debt relief and on the setting up of a common fund have met with no appreciable result. Yet these questions, about which I spoke here three years ago,  are of vital importance to the developing countries. We hope that the reassuring statements made at die beginning of this debate by certain industrialized countries about the common fund will make it possible for the negotiating conference  to produce fruitful results when it resumes work in November.\n154.\tBecause of the lack of solidarity, because of the lack of political Will, multilateral trade negotiations have not yet led to a liberalization of trade and the adoption of a generalized system of preferences, without reciprocity, in favour of the 'developing countries. Because of the reappearance in the developed countries of protectionist and restrictive measures, and because of the virtually ubiquitous usi1 of safeguard clauses, we cannot fail to be concerned about the future of these negotiations. In addition, we wonder whether in using as an excuse 9 new form of competition from the Southern Hemisphere there is not a risk that the international market will become fragmented and indeed may eventually disappear. Presumably there is no need to remind the Assembly that, had it not been for the liberalization of trade, the growth the world has experienced over the past quarter of a century would never have been possible.\n155.\tDevelopments at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea have also been a source of concern because of the lack of human solidarity on the part of the industrialized countries, which once again want the Bon's share of fee common heritage of man represented by the sea-bed and the ocean floor.\n156.\tThe Conference has been going on for five years, and significant progress seems to have been made regarding the definition of the new concept of an exclusive economic acme; many countries have derived considerable benefit from that by proclaiming their sovereignty over large fishing zones. In contrast, no consensus seems to be near regarding the system for exploiting the resources of the ocean floor. And, as the Assembly is aware, that situation can certainly not be blamed on the Group of 77, which has come forward with every form of compromise imaginable. In addition, -we must deplore that certain developed countries, using as an excuse the fact that negotiations have been proceeding slowly, are now considering unilateral legislation. Cameroon believes that the Conference has gone on long enough and that the sessions set for next year should be the last ones before the adoption of a convention. We simply fail to comprehend why the Conference has remained deadlocked simply because there must be unanimity before a decision is reached. That seems to be nothing more than a subtle form of veto.\n157.\tAfter the failure of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation, last year we invited the States Members of our Organization to direct their efforts consistently towards the future and in three directions: fulfilment by the developed countries of freely accepted commitments; resumption of negotiations within the framework of the United Notions in areas in which agreement is possible; and continuance of negotiations on questions that have hitherto been stumbling-blocks. Obviously, we welcomed the creation of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, called the Committee of the Whole, whose mission it was to deal with these three problems.\n158.\tAfter a year of debate, however, we must recognize that the differences of opinion that paralysed negotiations within the framework of GATT and within UNCTAD have cropped up once again in the Committee, thereby making it impossible for that Committee to do anything productive owing to lack of agreement on the content of its mandate.\n159.\tWe should like to remind the Assembly that under the terms of resolution 32/174, which set up the Committee of the Whole, the Committee should assist the General Assembly in overseeing and monitoring the implementation of decisions and agreements reached in the negotiations on the establishment of the new international economic order in the United Nations; in providing impetus for resolving difficulties in negotiations; in serving, where appropriate, as a forum for facilitating and expediting agreement on the resolution of outstanding issues; and in exploring and exchanging views on global economic problems and priorities.\n160.\tWhile the complexity of the issues that are pending might make it necessary to give priority to one of these functions over another from time to time, the fact remains that the constant goal should be to achieve tangible results. Providing, as it does, machinery for supervision and the putting into effect of commitments entered into, the Committee cannot be considered a mere forum. It must instead mobilize the political will of all States and provide direct or indirect momentum for the development of international co-operation and the establishment of a new international economic order.\n161.\tIt is our hope that the present session will lead to wide consultations, so that the so-often expressed will to prevent the failure of the North-South dialogue will truly be felt at the forthcoming sessions of the Committee. We are sure that would lead to a more relaxed atmosphere and to the co-operation and mutual confidence that are necessary if an international development strategy is to be formulated in 1980.\n162.\tChanges in international economic relations and the strengthening of co-operation for development require concrete, bold and imaginative decisions. It is high time, then, for us to give concrete expression to our common political will and to bring about, in a new climate of peace and solidarity, substantial progress in the major negotiations at present under way, in particular those on North- South issues.\n163.\tOnly by paying this price can the world economy emerge from its state of uncertainty and sluggishness. The stakes are high. We must succeed, for failure would bring increased hardship to untold millions of human beings. If we fail to meet this challenge, all future generations will, as the Secretary-General of our Organization has warned, inherit from us our shortages and confrontations. In giving this warning we cannot fail to express once again our gratitude and our great admiration for Mr. Kurt Waldheim and his untiring efforts to make it possible for our Organization, which he guides with such competence, devotion and courage, to play a leading role in bringing about the new international economic order. Our congratulations and the congratulations of all of Africa go to him in particular for his prompt response to the wishes of the General Assembly in reorganizing the structure of the Secretariat in such a way as to streamline its activities for the benefit of development and increase its impact on economic co-operation.\n164.\tThere must be reforms in other United Nations bodies too, as we have been advocating for many years, so that our Organization may more faithfully reflect the new global configuration.\n165.\tWe have in mind first of all the General Assembly, which must reconsider its working methods, as the Secretary-General has suggested, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee that was especially created for that purpose. \n166.\tNext - and perhaps more important\u2014comes to mind the Security Council, which because of its present procedures is simply incapable of adequately performing its functions under the Charter.\n167.\tIt is in dispensable that the countries of the third world, which represent three quarters of mankind, be represented more adequately in decision-making bodies which are responsible for world peace and collective security.\n168.\tNext, all States, including the most powerful, must agree without any mental reservations to yield part of the attributes to their sovereignty to our Organization, so that it may be able to cope with the various problems, which no State or group of States, no matter how powerful, can resolve. After all, our Organization has only the power conferred upon it by Governments.\n169.\tIn the implementation of its decisions it is indispensable that our Organization should be able to count on the good faith of Governments. Regrettably, there are many reasons to question the degree of loyalty of all States. Perhaps the most regrettable case is that of southern Africa, where for decades a minority regime of white racists, whose arrogance exceeds all tolerable limits, has spurned the ideals, objectives and decisions of our Organization. Is it not also a matter for regret that, even though they We unanimously been held up to public obloquy by a'/l States represented here, the outlawed regimes & Pretoria and Salisbury still seem to find defenders whenever it comes to applying sanctions under the Charter of our Organization against them? Is it not a matter for regret that there have been reports of violations of sanctions with the knowledge of certain States which have called for and supported the adoption of those sanctions in the Security Council?\n170.\tOur position on that subject and on many other subjects relating to the present international situation is well known. Our position with regard to Cyprus is certainly well known: the sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-alignment of that country must be safeguarded and respected, without any foreign interference, in conformity with the relevant resolutions of our Organization. Members are also familiar with our position on Lebanon, a country that is our friend and whose unity has been seriously threatened by a crisis that seems to go on endlessly. They are also familiar with our position in regard to detente, which, if it is to become a reality, must spread to all countries, including the countries of the third world that are seeking peace in order to be able to tackle the work of national construction and the promotion of the well-being of their peoples in independence and freedom. They are also familiar with our position in regard to the kinds of international relations which should exist, based on equality, mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.\n171.\tCameroon took part in the Committee of African Heads of State, the so-called mission of \\\"wise men\\\" of the Organization of African Unity on the Middle East and it supports and indeed always will support any efforts to bring about a just, global and lasting settlement of the situation existing in that part of the world, which is a threat to world peace.\n172.\tThe Palestinian problem is the very core of the Israeli-Arab conflict, and in addition to the complete implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), the solution of that problem implies the participation in all negotiations on the subject of the Palestinian people, under the leadership of the PLO, their genuine representative, and the exercise of all their rights, including their right to a homeland. We believe that the Camp David agreements, although they have given rise to certain hopes, reveal certain ambiguities, short-comings and uncertainties.\n173.\tThe presence among us of a delegation from Solomon Islands, in addition to confirming the aspiration to universality of our Organization, has aroused great hopes for the peoples of Africa that are still being oppressed by colonialist and imperialist domination and racial discrimination.\n174.\tThus it is a real pleasure to welcome the delegation of that new, free country upon the occasion of its entry into our Organization as the one hundred and fiftieth Member State, and we wish to convey to it the sincerest congratulations of the Cameroonian Government and people.\n175.\tWe wish to congratulate the former administering Power on the manner in which it discharged its responsibilities towards that former Non-Self-Governing Territory in guiding it to independence, just as it did in the case of the many Territories formerly under its dominion.\n176.\tWe regret that it has not so far met the insulting challenge both to itself and to the international community posed for 13 years by the minority of racist white settlers who seized power in Southern Rhodesia in disregard of the deeper aspirations of the majority of the population, who since then have been subjected to a regime of terror and the violation of their most fundamental rights.\n177.\tIt is undeniable that the so-called internal agreement of 3 March 1978 is a farce and a sinister plot against the people of Zimbabwe. With regard to the Anglo-American plan  advocating the peaceful transfer of power to the majority by means of negotiations, we have already said that we are, interested in such a solution, which of necessity implies that we are interested in such a solution, which of necessity implies that the parties show a determination to negotiate in good faith.\n178.\tBut we have always been sceptical of the possibility of an honest and constructive dialogue with those who are ruling in Salisbury and Pretoria, for their ulterior motives as supporters of slavery are certainly clear to everyone.\n179.\tThe sudden about-face of South Africa regarding the plan of the five Western Powers  and the settlement fn Namibia is particularly significant. In rejecting the report of the Secretary-General,  South Africa has once again committed an affront against the five Powers, the Security Council and the international community as a whole.\n180.\tThat is why we reaffirm our complete support for the liberation struggle being conducted by the people of Zimbabwe under the leadership of the Patriotic Front. Their heroic action has been a source of constant trouble to the Ian Smith regime, which has its back against the wall. This desperate situation of Ian Smith explains the growing aggressiveness of the Fascists in Salisbury, who are allied with those in Pretoria, and the killing of civilian populations in neighbouring African communities.\n181.\tThere can be no doubt in our minds that the peoples of southern Africa will soon recover their dignity and sovereignty and will soon set up democratic regimes under which freedom, concord and racial equality will prevail.\n182.\tIf our continent gave favourable consideration to the five-Power plan put forward by the members of the Security Council regarding the peaceful settlement of the problem of Namibia, it was-need we mention this\u2014due to the prestige of the sponsors.\n183.\tWe are convinced that those who assumed the major responsibility of encouraging the Security Council to adopt that plan will not jeopardize their credibility in the eyes of world's public. The Government of South Africa has resorted to a good deal of quibbling and various stratagems, but we are sure that no one will be deceived. The goal of the Pretoria regime has been to oppose majority government in Namibia and to keep control over the international Territory, and its plan is to establish there a pseudo- independent regime controlled by representatives of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance.\n184.\tCameroon welcomes resolution 435 (1978), by which the Security Council approved the report of the Secretary-General and created the United Nations Transition Assistance Group to ensure, in the near future, the independence of Namibia by means of free elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations.\n185.\tWe have noted with satisfaction the declared intention of the five Powers to see to the implementation of that resolution.\n186.\tClearly, if Pretoria continues to oppose the Western plan and stubbornly rejects the report of the Secretary- General, the Council should then draw the logical consequences from the situation and invoke the relevant provisions of the Charter. Our Organization has already acknowledged that the policy of apartheid is a crime against mankind and that it is a serious threat to international peace and security.\n187.\tWhat situation would be more suitable for the application of the provisions of Chapter VII?\n188.\tCameroon believes that it is a matter of great urgency that severe sanctions, and first and foremost a strict oil embargo, be adopted and implemented against South Africa, so as to induce some repentance on the part of that country.\n189.\tCameroon reaffirms its complete support for the noble struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of its genuine representative, SWAPO, as it struggles to win real independence and respect for the unity and integrity of its territory, including Walvis Bay.\n190.\tWe are at the eve of the solemn celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and yet, despite the considerable accomplishments of our Organization in safeguarding international peace and security, it is a fact that decolonization and economic co-operation among States, the persistence of colonialism and racial discrimination, the systematic and institutionalized violation of human rights in southern Africa, the economic inequalities which have caused tensions and still keep the great majority of mankind in a state of chronic poverty, and the stubborn egotism of affluent States prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that our Organization has much unfinished business before it.\n191. Needless to point out that the major changes in international life since the Second World War brought about by the newly independent States of Africa, Asia and Latin America, by the development of technology in all areas, by the world-wide spread of military alliances and conflicts, by the yearning of all peoples for the ideals of peace and justice, and the growing awareness of our common destiny all require the liberalization and democratization of international relations. When that is achieved, and only then, will all States, great and small, powerful and weak, rich and poor, be able to work together to safeguard and strengthen that supra-national common asset of which peace, collective security and the well-being of all peoples are the essential elements.\n192. But changes of that order would require that the United Nations provide leadership and that its responsibility for taking action be increased so that it may, in a permanent and dynamic manner, regulate the furtherance of our common interests in conformity with the principles and purposes of the Charter.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff291.\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n292.\tAt the outset, and on behalf of the delegation of Nepal, I express my heartfelt condolence on the passing of His Holiness Pope John Paul I.\n293.\tIt is my privilege to convey to the President of the General Assembly, and through him to the representatives assembled here, the cordial and best wishes of my Sovereign His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev for the success of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.\n294.\tI should like to associate myself with all the preceding speakers in congratulating the President on his election to the high office of the presidency of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. We are confident that, with his experience, understanding and diplomatic skill, he will be able to guide the deliberations of the present session to a fruitful conclusion. I wish to assure him of my delegation's fullest co-operation.\n295.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to Lazar Mojsov, President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly, for the very able and effective manner in which he conducted the proceedings not only of the annual session, but also of the three special sessions that took place during his presidency.\n296.\tWe welcome Solomon Islands as a new Member of this Organization and extend to it our warm congratulations. With the admission of Solomon Islands, the United Nations has moved one more step forward towards the goal of universal membership.\n297.\tSince the last regular session of the General Assembly, important international meetings and conferences, including the three special sessions of the General Assembly, have been held. We find ourselves asking how far these meetings and conferences on wide-ranging issues which affect the well-being of mankind have improved international relations so essential to the harmonious development of a new world order. Despite numerous resolutions, declarations and agreements, the international situation continues to be uncertain, plagued by unrest, new rivalries and age-old tensions.\n298.\tThe explosive nature of the Middle East situation has been underlined in various statements made in this Assembly. The clearly established stand of my country on the Middle East problem remains unchanged. We reiterate our faithful and strict commitment to the three essentials for lasting peace in the Middle East, namely, Israel's withdrawal within its 1967 boundaries, the right of all States in the region, including Israel, to live within secure and recognized boundaries, and the creation of a Palestinian homeland. Any solution that fails to recognize these rights and realities will pose a constant threat to peace and stability in the region.\n299.\tThe peace initiative of President El-Sadat of Egypt, hailed by many as bold and encouraging less than a year ago, aroused hopes for a dramatic breakthrough in the long-standing Middle East crisis. However, Israel's continued occupation of Arab lands has frustrated efforts at a negotiated settlement. Moreover, the violation by Israel last March of the territorial integrity of Lebanon gave a setback to the already foundering peace process. Given goodwill, mutual trust and the willingness to compromise, the Middle East problem could be amicably solved.\n300.\tWe appreciate the efforts made recently by President Carter of the United States towards a settlement of the Middle East conflict by bringing together the leaders of Egypt and Israel. It is our hope that the Camp David agreements will prove a positive step towards creating a congenial atmosphere for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n301.\tIt is, however, essential that all parties to the conflict, including the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, should be actively involved in all efforts towards a peaceful, enduring and comprehensive solution. We consider that the forcible establishment in the occupied territories of Israeli settlements designed to alter the legal status, geographical character and demographic composition of those territories is unlawful and contrary to the principles of the United Nations.\n302.\tIt is regrettable that the situation in Cyprus continues to be grave and tense. The lack of progress in the solution of the Cyprus problem on the basis of the principles laid down in General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX), further endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 365 (1974), is indeed a matter of deep concern. We have consistently held the view that the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus should be preserved and respected. We reiterate our conviction that meaningful and constructive negotiations between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities, without outside interference, could lead to a mutually acceptable agreement. We have noted with appreciation the continuing efforts of the Secretary- General to resume the intercommunal talks.\n303.\tIn southern Africa the racist and minority regimes are attempting to perpetuate the system of colonialism, domination, oppression and exploitation. We have always sympathized with the vast majority of the people of South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe in their agonies and we have supported their aspirations to majority rule and basic human rights.\n304.\tIn South Africa there is no sight that the criminal apartheid regime is turning away front its odious policies of institutionalized racial discrimination. We have condemned South African policy of so-called bantustanization as a pernicious attempt to perpetuate racist domination. We have viewed with alarm South Africa's massive military build-up, including plans to develop nuclear weapons.\n305.\tWhile the unanimous imposition by the Security Council, in its resolution 418 (1977), under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, of a mandatory embargo on military and nuclear collaboration with the racist regime of South Africa was, a positive move, we are convinced that the strongest measures, such as the imposition of economic sanctions and the withdrawal of foreign investments, would contribute decisively to the total eradication of the system of apartheid.\n322: We express out total solidarity with the national liberation movements, as. well as with the oppressed people of South Africa.\n323. In Namibia, we have all along upheld the inalienable right of the people of Namibia to freedom, national independence and territorial: integrity, and have staunchly supported the legitimate struggle waged under the leadership- of SWAPO, the sole and legitimate representative of the people of Namibia, for the liquidation of the illegal occupation- of Namibia by South Africa, We welcome the historic decision-of the Security Council on 27 July 1978, as expressed  in resolution 431 (1978), concerning the question of Namibia and commend the contributions made by all concerned to effect a peaceful settlement of the long-standing question of Namibia.\n324-. The Security Council, in a separate resolution, resolution 432 (1978) emphatically declared that Namibia's territorial integrity and unity must be assured through the reintegration of Walvis Bay within its territory. We have emphasized in the past, and emphasize again, the primary responsibility of the United Nations for ensuring early independence for Namibia through free elections under its own supervision and control. South Africa's threat to proceed with elections in total disregard of the United Nations is most regrettable.\n325.\tIn Southern Rhodesia, the mounting unrest and violence demonstrate that there can be no lasting and viable solution until majority rule is established on the principle of \\\"one man, one vote\\\". The so-called internal settlement, which was another manoeuvre of the illegal racist minority regime to maintain its domination and oppression of the African people of Zimbabwe, has been categorically rejected by the Security Council. The Rhodesian settlement calls for a round table conference of all the parties concerned. In this respect we welcome the Anglo-American initiative to try to arrange for all-party talks, including all Rhodesian leaders.\n326.\tThe increasingly frequent violation of the sanctions imposed against the racist regime by the Security Council is utterly deplorable. We stress the importance of maintaining the sanctions until such, time as all parties directly concerned negotiate an agreement which would bring about a constitutional conference on the  basis of majority rule for Zimbabwe. My delegation reaffirms its unequivocal commitment to support the struggle of the people of Zimbabwe until complete and genuine freedom and independence of the territory is achieved.\n327.\tA crucial issue of paramount concern to mankind is disarmament. It is now widely recognized that the ever- escalating arms race poses a serious threat to the survival of mankind. It is disheartening to note that, despite the unremitting efforts of the United Nations, progress in disarmament negotiations has been woefully slow. While existing arms-control measures have created an atmosphere more conducive to fruitful negotiations on wide-ranging issues of disarmament, it has not been possible to make any significant breakthrough on the attainment of the goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control, which is the fundamental objective of the United Nations.\n328.\tThe present session has before it the results of the tenth special session on disarmament which was convened at the initiative of the non-aligned countries. We agree with the view that, disarmament being a complex issue, it would be unrealistic to- expect dramatic results with a single special session of the General Assembly. In spite of the fact that the Final Document of the session [resolution S-10/2J was adopted by consensus, which is a remarkable achievement,: fundamental differences on approach, emphasis and priority concerning the whole gamut of disarmament issues remain unresolved. We share the view expressed by the\nPresident of the tenth special session that the Final Document \\\"represents the broadest possible platform for further work and for additional efforts by the United Nations in the field of disarmament\\\". It is our hope that the provisions contained in this Final Document will be translated into practical terms.\n329.\tIt is a pity that many constructive proposals and suggestions could not be incorporated in the Final Document. However, the strengthening of the machinery, and especially of a negotiating body which will facilitate further deliberation, harmonization and the conclusion of a number of measures aimed at disarmament, was no doubt a significant achievement of the tenth special session. We attach great importance to the participation of all nuclear- weapon States in the revamped negotiating body.\n330.\tThe establishment of a Disarmament Commission composed of all Members of the United Nations as a deliberative body is another welcome step. That these bodies will be closely linked to the United Nations is an explicit recognition of the role of this world body in dealing with all disarmament issues. In fact, my delegation has made it clear repeatedly that the United Nations is the only forum in which it is possible for all, be they nuclear Powers, medium-sized Powers or the powerless ones, to deliberate and take decisions on issues affecting the future of mankind on a footing of equality.\n331.\tWe have consistently held the view that the responsibility for ending the nuclear-arms race rests primarily with the nuclear Powers. We reiterate our conviction that nuclear Powers possessing the largest stockpiles of deadly and sophisticated weapons must prove by action their commitment to disarmament. We urge the super-Powers to agree immediately on significant reductions and qualitative limitations in strategic weapons as a prelude to the total and speedy dismantling of stockpiles of nuclear weapons. We hope that the inconclusive negotiations at the second series of the Strategic Arms limitation Talks will be successfully concluded soon and that agreement on a comprehensive test ban will also be reached.\n332.\tAs a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Nepal is deeply concerned over the proliferation of nuclear weapons, both vertical Aid horizontal. While stressing the urgency of universal adherence to and strict observance of the Treaty and the necessity of strengthening safeguard measures in order to fortify the non-proliferation regime, my delegation shares the view that the transfer of nuclear technology and non- proliferation objectives are not contradictory, but complementary. It is equally essential that adequate steps should be taken for the limitation and reduction of conventional weapons. We have strongly supported the proposal for the reduction of military budgets of the major militarily significant States, in particular, of the States members of the Security Council. We insist on our proposal that the gradual reduction of military budgets must be preceded by a freeze on the level of military spending.\n333.\tNepal has been an ardent champion of peace in the world and has supported establishment of \\\"zones of peace\\\". We lent our support to the 1971 Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. We call upon the great Powers to speed up their negotiations for the purpose of implementing the provisions of that General Assembly resolution. We have supported the proposal of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality of the Association of South East Asian Nations. Nepal's own proposal for a zone of peace, as put forward by His Majesty King Birendra three years ago, is motivated by our deep-seated desire to institutionalize peace for accelerated national development through the maximum mobilization of our limited resources.\n334.\tWe appreciate the growing support extended to this proposal by friendly countries. It is our firm conviction that national initiative for peace contributes significantly to the maintenance of world peace and security. We further believe that Nepal as a zone of peace could be a significant contribution to the establishment of a zone of peace in the region as a whole. Nepal's participation in UNIFIL is further evidence of our sincere desire to see peace established in all parts of the world. Nepal is keen on maintaining and strengthening friendly relations with all countries of the world, and in particular with neighbouring States. In our own region of South Asia, there has been significant improvement in relations among countries based on goodwill, mutually beneficial co-operation, respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and strict adherence to the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs. We hope and trust that such goodwill, co-operation and mutual understanding will continue to underline the relationship between and among the countries of the region.\n335.\tThe international economic situation is by no means sound, stable and promising. While the struggle to establish the New International Economic Order is assuming greater significance, developing countries have expressed concern at the slow pace of progress towards the establishment of the New International Economic Order. The position of developing countries is deteriorating constantly. Contradictions stemming from the concentration of tremendous economic resources in a small number of developed countries have further widened the gap in the level of economic development and the standard of living in developed and developing countries. Developing countries are convinced that the structural transformation of the existing international economic system is the only way out of the present crisis.\n336.\tIn the fields of trade and financial transfers, the response of developed countries has not been a positive one for She sapid development .of developing countries. Exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures from developing countries are denied access to the markets of developed countries under hard-hitting tariff and non-tariff barriers. Besides, increasing recourse in developed countries to protectionist measures has further resulted an unfavourable terms of trade for the developing countries. The outcome is the steadily growing trade and balance-of-payments deficit of developing countries and the inevitable growth of their indebtedness. Despite a raise in the flow of official development assistance in real terms from the developed to the developing countries, the target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries has not yet been reached, with a few exceptions.\n337.\tIt is regrettable that no headway was made on the establishment of the common fund at the two negotiating conferences and that, despite their verbal support, certain developed countries continue to oppose the fundamentals underlying the common fund. We hope that negotiations to find common solutions will successfully be brought to a conclusion before the end of this year.\n338.\tSince the Manila session of the World Food Council in 1977, no improvement has taken place in food production, food security and food trade. In order to enable the developing countries to achieve the agreed rate of growth for their agricultural sectors of at least 4 per cent per annum, the targets for external assistance which were established by the World Food Council should be reached as soon as possible and not later than 1980.\n339.\tIt is of vital importance that the multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of GATT should come to a successful conclusion in 1978, and that these negotiations should take fully into account the interests of developing countries and their requirements on issues related to trade in agricultural products. We hope that the inconclusive negotiations to transform UNIDO into a United Nations specialized agency will be brought to a successful conclusion without further delay.\n340.\tDespite increasing international awareness of the serious and pressing problems of the hard core least developed countries, as evidenced in various resolutions of the United Nations, the special measures so far adopted in their favour have produced negligible results. Their growth rate in terms of gross domestic product per capita was only 0.4 per cent per year in the period 1970 to 1976, in contrast to the growth rate of 2.7 per cent per capita for the same period in all developing countries. Thus the position of the least developed countries is now worse than at the beginning of the decade.\n341.\tSpecial measures in the fields of trade, finance, technical assistance and infrastructural development which were unanimously agreed upon, including the relevant provisions of the International Development Strategy, for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], have not been fully implemented. Against this background, we urge the international community, in particular the developed countries, to undertake urgent measures so as to bring about significant improvement in the position of the least developed countries. At least a doubling of the real flow of assistance to the least developed countries by 1980 in order to assist them to achieve the minimum growth target of 3.5 per cent per capita per year in real terms, as set forth in the Strategy, is essential. We sincerely appreciate the decisions of the Governments of Sweden, Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom to alleviate the debt burden of the least developed among the developing countries and wish that others would follow their example.\n342.\tAs a land-locked developing country, Nepal is acutely aware that the lack of access to the sea, together with remoteness and isolation from world markets, constitutes a major persistent hindrance to the social and economic development of the land-locked developing countries. The land-locked developing countries are doubly disadvantaged, since most of them are also among the least developed countries. Adequate solutions to the problems of the land-locked developing countries have not been found, and concrete and operational measures have not yet been taken in their favour by the international community. The result of the first pledging conference of the United Nations Special Fund for Land-Locked Developing Countries was disappointing. While appreciating those countries which made modest contributions to the Fund, we once again urge the developed countries and other potential donors to make substantial voluntary contributions so that the Fund can become operational as quickly as possible.\n343.\tThe primary responsibility for the development of developing countries rests with the developing countries themselves. They cannot, however, carry out this responsibility unless their efforts are matched by gradual realization of the basic objectives of the New International Economic Order. Developing countries have clearly defined their firm commitment to the settlement of all issues in international economic co-operation and development through negotiations and talks. In this connexion, mention must be made of the Committee on economic matters known as the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, or the Committee of the Whole. In our opinion this Committee, set up to monitor and to give political impetus to the negotiations in various agencies and organizations of the United Nations system until the special session of the General Assembly to review the results achieved in settling economic problems is held in. 1980, should be action- oriented and avoid the duplication of being another debating forum.\n344.\tHowever, it is regrettable that the first session of that Committee, which resumed in the first week of this month, ended in an impasse over the precise interpretation of the Committee's mandate. We reaffirm our belief that the Committee should be competent enough to reach agreed conclusions through negotiations.\n345.\tWe supported the resolution adopted by the General Assembly last year on the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system [resolution 32/197] which is an integral part of the larger effort at revamping the global economy to establish the New International Economic Order. We take this opportunity to congratulate the new Director-General for Development and International Economic Co-operation, and we wish him all success in the challenging tasks that lie ahead of him.\n346.\tThe recently concluded United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, offered new opportunities for a more comprehensive assessment of the scope for co-operation among developing countries. We hope that the Plan of Action and recommendations of that Conference2 9 will be effectively implemented. Similarly, the forthcoming United Nations conferences-namely, the fifth session of UNCTAD to be held in Manila next May and the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development to be held in Vienna next year\u2014are of immense importance for the resolution of the most pressing problems in the domains of trade and development and the building of scientific and technological capacities in developing countries. We look forward to the positive results of those conferences.\n347.\tMy delegation also welcomes resolution 1978/61, adopted by the Economic and Social Council at its second regular session this year, on the convening of a United Nations conference on new and renewable sources of energy. It is hardly possible to over-emphasize the importance of such a conference, as all countries, particularly the least developed ones, are severely affected by the rising costs of energy.\n348.\tThe adoption of a comprehensive and universally acceptable international convention on the law of the sea is not yet within reach. My delegation has repeatedly emphasized the fact that a new convention on the law of the sea, if it is to be just, fair and equitable, must reflect the concerns and aspirations of all countries which will later become parties to it. Progress so far achieved at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea suggests that the contrary is taking place. The persistent refusal of the group of coastal States to recognize the right of the group of land-locked and geographically disadvantaged States to participate on an equitable basis in the exploitation of the living resources of the economic zone of adjoining coastal States and States of the same region or subregion invalidates the concept of the common heritage of mankind.\n349.\tThe informal composite negotiating text, the product of four years of intensive negotiation, makes it crystal-clear that the control by coastal States of ocean-based resources is being substantially advanced and the needs and rights of land-locked and geographically disadvantaged States are being unscrupulously ignored. The so-called sovereign rights of the coastal States in the exclusive economic zone will result in a further growth of the already widening gap between rich and poor nations and create a fourth world of least developed and most-disadvantaged States.\n350.\tWith a view to reviving the eroding concept of the common heritage of mankind, my delegation took the opportunity to submit a draft proposal entitled \\\"A common heritage fund\\\" at the seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea at Geneva.3,0 It is our earnest hope that that proposal, which is in the interests of humanity and by no means designed merely to promote the interests of land-locked and geographically disadvantaged States, will enjoy the support of all countries.\n351.\tFurthermore, as a land-locked, developing country, Nepal has all along been drawing the attention of the international community to the fact that the disadvantage of being land-locked has had an adverse impact upon our\n\nobjectives and goals of accelerated development. The right of free access to and from the sea and the right of unrestricted transit in terms of the free flow of goods and people are of vital significance to land-locked countries. We hope that these legitimate concerns of the land-locked countries will be accommodated in the new international convention on the law of the sea.\n352.\tAt the recently concluded resumed seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, we supported the statement declaring the position of the Group of 77 on unilateral legislation relating to the exploitation of the resources of the deep sea-bed being enacted or contemplated in several industrialized countries. We appeal once again to those countries to exercise restraint and to refrain from taking unilateral measures which could adversely affect current negotiations for the adoption of a comprehensive convention on the law of the sea.\n353.\tThe unanimous decision of the thirty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly to observe the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this year brings out the importance attached by the world community to the valued principles of fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person, as enshrined in the well-known Declaration and in the Charter of the United Nations. Nepal has profound respect for the principles of the Declaration and it is pertinent to point out that our Constitution guarantees the people of Nepal, irrespective of sex, caste, creed, colour or religion, their fundamental rights and liberties. My delegation is therefore happy to join the international community in observing the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration.\nFinally, the increasingly important role that the United Nations is called upon to play in world affairs, particularly in the domains of the establishment of the New International Economic Order, disarmament and the resolution of potentially explosive situations is a vindication of the confidence and hope nations have reposed in this world Organization. While reiterating our commitment to the ideals and principles of the United Nations, we stress the importance of further strengthening this world body to make it an even more effective mechanism for safeguarding and consolidating peace and security and for promoting international co-operation to usher in a new order based on equity, justice, peace and harmony of common interests. It is our firm conviction that the effective guarantee of international peace and security lies in a much stronger United Nations embodying the collective will and strength of its Member States.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n116.\tOn behalf of my delegation, permit me to extend to Ambassador Lievano our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly I wish him every success in his noble task and assure him of my delegation's full co-operation in his effort to steer this current session to a successful conclusion\n117.\tI should also like to pay a warm tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia, for the valuable contribution he made to the work of our Organization during the past year at the thirty-second regular session and the three special sessions of the General Assembly.\n118.\tOur thanks go also to the Secretary-General for his dedication and good work at the helm of our Organization.\n119.\tMy delegation offers a warm welcome to Solomon Islands on the occasion of its admission as the one hundred and fiftieth State Member of our Organization. We look forward to co-operating closely with it in the General Assembly and in other United Nations bodies.\n120.\tThe year that has passed since I last addressed this Assembly  has seen many significant changes in my part of the world, namely, in eastern and South-East Asia. The present Government of Thailand assumed office in November of last year. From the beginning it has spared no effort in pursuing, with determination and earnestness, its foreign-policy objectives of cultivating and promoting friendly relations with all countries regardless of their size and power and irrespective of their political, economic and social systems. Special emphasis is placed on developing such relations with neighbouring countries and with those in the South-East Asian region based on the principles of peaceful coexistence An important aim is to achieve effective and fruitful co-operation with those countries for the benefit of the peoples and in the interest of the stability and prosperity of the region as a whole.\n121.\tAs regional co-operation is one of the main cornerstones of our policy my Government attaches great importance to the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] of which Thailand is a member. As ASEAN is embarking on its second decade it has become more cohesive and has gained wider recognition and acceptance. That is manifested by the fact that ASEAN now regularly holds dialogues not only with the European Economic Community but also with the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Other countries have also shown interest in establishing contacts with ASEAN. As ASEAN gains more recognition and acceptance it is encouraging that its concept of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality for South-East Asia, as proclaimed at the ASEAN Meeting of Foreign Ministers, held in Kuala Lumpur in 1971,  has also received broader support. Thailand is fully committed to the implementation of that ASEAN concept as a major step forward towards securing permanent peace and stability for the region.\n122.\tThe unrelenting efforts of my Government to develop good-neighbourly relations with all the countries in the region have finally borne fruit.\n123.\tOur relations with the Socialist Republic of Viet N\u00abm have been normalized and further strengthened.\nAgreements on trade and economic co-operation and on air services between the two countries have been concluded, and many high-level visits have been exchanged. Only last month the Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam paid an official visit to Thailand which resulted in further consolidating the friendship and co-operation between the two nations.\n124.\tThe friendly ties between the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Thailand have likewise been, considerably strengthened. A new agreement on the transit of goods, so vital to Laos and so important to the relationship between the two countries, has been concluded. A trade agreement has also been signed. The exchange of visits and increasing contacts have further served to promote wider co-operation and understanding between our two brotherly nations.\n125.\tWith regard to Democratic Kampuchea, my goodwill visit to that country early this year, followed by the visit to Bangkok in July by the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of Foreign Affairs of Democratic Kampuchea, enabled the two sides to engage in full and frank discussions with a view to normalizing relations between the two countries. The reduction of tension and incidents along the common border was also discussed. The promotion of trade and reopening of our respective embassies and the exchange of ambassadors in Phnom Penh and Bangkok were agreed to.\n126.\tRelations between Burma and Thailand have also been further strengthened.. During the visit to Burma of the Thai Prime Minister in May of this year many substantive issues of common concern and interest were discussed and a number of measures for ongoing co-operation were agreed upon. Those measures were meant for the mutual benefit of both our countries and peoples, and they are now being implemented.\n127.\tAlthough the general situation in South-East Asia has markedly improved, there are still some areas of conflict and instability which are a source of concern to us all. Therefore, it is hoped that the existing problems will soon be peacefully resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned, thus creating more favourable conditions for wider and mutually beneficial co-operation among countries in the region.\n128.\tLet me turn to developments in other parts of the world\n129.\tIn the case of the Middle East, it has always been the conviction of my delegation that the solution to that highly complex problem must be based on Security Council resolution 242(1967) and other relevant United Nations resolutions, and must be in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. Thus, Israel's forces must be withdrawn from all occupied Arab territories and the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people must be strictly upheld.\n130.\tIn this connexion, my delegation is deeply appreciative of all efforts aimed at bringing the parties concerned to the negotiating table. In this spirit, therefore, we wish to pay a tribute to the President of the United States for his initiative in arranging a meeting at Camp David where two agreements were concluded between the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel. Although the agreements fell short of the expectations of many, including perhaps the individual parties themselves-as is often the case in difficult negotiations-they have renewed our hope that further steps will be taken on the road to a lasting peace in the Middle East.\n131.\tThe situation in Lebanon has deteriorated, and large-scale fighting has again erupted. My delegation wishes, therefore, to endorse the unanimous decision of the Security Council in adopting on 6 October its resolution 436(1978) calling for a cease-fire in Lebanon It is our hope that a cease-fire will be effectively implemented, thus paving the way for peaceful negotiations, and that conditions in that unfortunate country will soon return to normal.\n132.\tIn southern Africa, the basic problem facing the United Nations remains how best this world Organization can encourage and bring about a peaceful transition in accordance with the relevant resolutions and decisions already adopted by our Organization.\n133.\tIn Namibia, the events that occurred immediately after the ninth special session have brought great hopes of an effective solution being found to this problem which has been with the United Nations for over three decades. The plans for Namibia's independence which envisaged a major role for the United Nations in peace-keeping as well as in the supervision of elections during a transitional period leading to independence were endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 431 (1978), adopted on 27 July. The Council also requested the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Representative to ensure early independence for Namibia through free elections. In this regard, the Secretary-General is to be congratulated on his choice of Mr Ahtisaari as his Special Representative. The latter has tried to maintain close contacts with the parties concerned. However, my delegation noted with deep regret the announcement by South Africa that it would proceed to hold an election in Namibia before the end of this year without the involvement of the United Nations. This unilateral move constitutes a grave set-back to the United Nations efforts to bring a peaceful and durable solution to this problem. It is patently clear that the responsibility for this set-back must be laid at South Africa's door. It is equally clear that the free exercise of the right to self-determination by the Namibian people can no longer be postponed without dire consequences.\n134.\tIn Zimbabwe the legitimate rights and aspirations of the people continue to be frustrated. The illegal minority regime must realize that actions in contravention of the United Nations resolutions and in defiance of world opinion only aggravate the danger to peace and stability in the whole of southern Africa.\n135.\tMy Government reaffirms its resolute opposition to the policy of apartheid. Discrimination against a fellow human being on racial grounds violates human decency and is repugnant to mankind. My delegation joins the international community in condemning and calling for an end to the apartheid policy of South Africa.\n136.\tI now turn to the question of disarmament and arms control. The historic tenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly, devoted to disarmament and arms control, resulted in noteworthy accomplishments. The session produced substantive advances in new ideas and perspectives, and the linkage between disarmament and development was also discussed. Newly broadened areas of consensus were matched in practical terms by the agreement to establish a new forum for disarmament negotiations. This was a significant move which admits the possibility of participation by all nuclear-weapon States. The Thai delegation to the special session also supported strongly the proposal that the Secretary-General establish an advisory board of eminent persons.  The decisions taken during that special session reflected a greater degree of realism and accommodation in the formation of national policies than had hitherto prevailed. This development is, in the view of my delegation, in the interests of practical security considerations as well as of economic development and national progress. Therefore is imperative for all of us to pursue these goals further with foresight and in a statesmanlike manner, as the ultimate choice is either the end of the arms race or the end of the human race.\n137.\tThere continues to exist a serious international humanitarian problem due to the presence of Indo-Chinese refugees in Thailand and some neighbouring countries. Since the end of the tragic war in Indo-China, my country has provided a temporary refuge for over 160,000 such displaced persons. Although a significant number of them were subsequently accepted for resettlement in third countries, more than 110,000 refugees still remain in Thailand. Moreover, their number has been on the increase, thus adding further to the already heavy burden and creating additional problems for my country. Thailand, after all, is a developing country and cannot be expected to cope with a problem of such magnitude for an extended period of time. Out of purely humanitarian considerations, Thailand is already carrying too large a share of the burden, which concerns the international conscience of all mankind. My Government feels that the responsibility for dealing with this humanitarian problem must be shared equitably by the whole international community. In this connexion, my delegation warmly appreciates the new initiatives taken by some countries to strengthen their support for the efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to find durable solutions to this problem. Our sincere gratitude goes also to those countries which have quietly and consistently assumed important roles in helping to alleviate the tragic plight of the refugees and giving them new opportunities in life.\n138.\tHowever, a greater responsibility can and should be assumed by the international community. There are two practical difficulties which can be resolved by international co-operation. First, there is lack of adequate co-ordination among the third countries on the number of displaced persons they could individually accept for resettlement. Secondly, there is the problem of time-consuming and oft-repeated procedures for the selection of refugees. Consequently, the resettlement programme has been behind schedule, and a backlog continues to build up, to the detriment of future planning.\n139: The time has come, therefore, for a more practical arrangement to be established by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or under his auspices, after consultations with countries of temporary asylum and third countries, in order to effect better co-ordination between their national programmes and procedures for resettling the Indo-Chinese displaced persons in third countries. In this respect, my Government has proposed that there be established pooling arrangements that would provide an advance indication of resettlement opportunities on an annual basis for those Indo-Chinese displaced persons who arrived in Thailand by land, since they constitute the vast majority\u2014they now number over 110,000-and their condition is no less deserving of our humanitarian concern than that of the so-called boat people. This does not preclude the possibility of convening a meeting of interested delegations under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees at an appropriate time in the future.\n140.\tFor its part, the Royal Thai Government intends to continue the policy and practice of extending its full co-operation to the international community and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the concerted effort to find durable solutions to this problem. In this regard it was most happy to welcome the High Commissioner, Mr. Poul Hartling, on his official visit to Thailand from 4 to 9 September of this year. At the conclusion of that visit a joint press statement was issued, reading in part as follows:\n\\\"It was the opinion of both sides that the problem of Indo-Chinese displaced persons was not a problem for Thailand alone, but one of international concern, and the responsibility for resolving this humanitarian problem should be shared by the international community on the widest possible basis.\\\"\nCertain measures which might yield durable solutions were also discussed, including pooling arrangements. It is the earnest hope of my Government that the proposals and ideas discussed will be the subject of urgent consultations between the High Commissioner and the Governments concerned.\n141.\tMy delegation would like to take this opportunity to convey the deep appreciation of the Royal Thai Government to the High Commissioner and his able staff for their valuable work and the dedicated manner in which they performed their duties in assisting the Indo-Chinese displaced persons in Thailand.\n142.\tMy Government continues to attach the greatest importance to problems of drug-abuse control and the elimination of the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotics. It remains committed to a four-pronged policy in this regard. First, law enforcement measures have been further strengthened to interdict drug trafficking with outsiders. Secondly, the crop-substitution programme among the hill tribes to reduce opium production is being vigorously pursued, with significant progress being made, under the joint United Nations-Thai programme for drug- abuse control. Thirdly, the educational campaign against illicit drugs has been intensified. Fourthly, Thailand continues to extend full co-operation to the United Nations and other international agencies concerned, as well as to interested Governments, in the global effort to eradicate these serious problems. Our common aim remains the same-namely, to stamp out the evils of drug abuse and thus to reduce the human suffering and misery resulting from drug addiction together with its repercussions on social and economic conditions throughout the world.\n143.\tAs a developing nation, Thailand faces many problems similar to those of other developing countries, the most urgent of which are those of economic and social development. It is for this reason that my Government devotes the greater part of its efforts to the improvement of the economic and social conditions of the Thai people, which can proceed more rapidly in a state of domestic tranquillity and national unity. In this connexion it does not neglect its role of trying to bring about a better political climate in the country or its responsibility to maintain law and order in the nation. Thus, within the limits of the laws, and in a spirit of national reconciliation as well as in the interest of human rights, my Government recently passed the necessary legislation granting amnesty to 18 students and other persons previously arrested on various grave charges and to all other persons who had escaped arrest on similar charges. This has enabled the Government to turn its attention to other pressing issues, while awaiting the general elections which are scheduled to take place next year.\n144.\tDuring the past year, my country, along with the other developing countries in the Group of 77, has sought to carry forward processes of change and improvement in international economic co-operation, using the platform offered by the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, the so-called Committee of the Whole. The task of the Committee was to oversee and monitor the implementation of decisions and agreements regarding the establishment of a New International Economic Order. The Committee was to provide impetus for the resolution of difficulties encountered in the various negotiations and to serve as a forum to facilitate and expedite agreement on outstanding issues as well as to explore and exchange views on global economic problems and priorities.\n145.\tIn the ensuing discussions, both formal and informal, there emerged a divergence of views as to the role of the Committee. The majority felt that the Committee would be the central forum for discussion of the North-South dialogue. Furthermore, it was also envisaged that the Committee should try to arrive at action-oriented conclusions, although it would be unrealistic to expect it to come to agreement on all items and issues.\n146.\tIn mid-July of this year at the Bonn Economic Summit Conference major Western developed countries agreed on a set of common principles  which affirmed the major industrial nations' commitment to bringing about more rapid economic growth in the developing countries as well as support for the freer flow of international trade and investment essential to the economic life of those countries. This indication of well-meaning concern on the part of the major industrial nations was warmly welcomed by the developing world -and gave rise to increased expectations in the Committee of the Whole in New York. Thus the member States of the Group of 77, including Thailand, were deeply disappointed when, early in September, the Committee's meetings had to be suspended because no consensus could be arrived at concerning the interpretation of its mandate. This impasse was a tremendous set-back for the efforts of the international community to continue, within a well-defined and institutionalized framework, the dialogue between the North and the South. However, the developing countries must persist in their common effort to establish a just and equitable system of economic relations through constructive dialogue and negotiations, for in an interdependent world the real interest of all countries is rooted in the equitable sharing of benefits. My delegation therefore can be counted upon-during this session to support any common effort aimed at overcoming the present impasse. Failure to overcome that impasse will weaken immeasurably the prospects for the establishment of a New International Economic Order, a worthy goal to which Thailand, for one, remains firmly committed.\n\n147.\tWith regard to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, my delegation noted with satisfaction that the seventh session, held in Geneva last May, had made, in the words of the Conference's President, \\\"appreciable progress\\\". The resumed seventh session, held in New York in August and September this year, rightly concentrated on those unresolved hard-core issues, particularly on the question of sea-bed mining. In this regard, unilateral actions should be avoided as they would endanger ongoing negotiations. Therefore my delegation fully supports the position of the Group of 77 and wishes to join with others in appealing to the industrialized nations to wait for the conclusion of a convention before proceeding with any unilateral move.\n148.\tAs for the role of the United Nations in present-day world affairs, Thailand continues to consider the United Nations as an indispensable global instrument for peace and international economic co-operation. But the United Nations is not a supranational organization but one consisting of 150 sovereign States. Its strength depends mainly on the sincere political will of the Member States to abide by the Charter and to understand and respect the interests and aspirations of others. The Organization can effectively carry out the provisions of the Charter only when Member States exhibit a willingness to subordinate their national aspirations and short-term interests to the common interests and the universal yearning for peace, equality and prosperity.\n149.\tMany have posed the question whether the United Nations will be able to cope with the ever-increasing complexities of today's world. My answer is that with the right kind of co-operation from Member States it will. And it is up to us to do everything in our power to ensure that the United Nations achieves its basic goals, as outlined in the Charter, for the sake of peace, stability, justice, equality and prosperity, for all peoples of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Undoubtedly, the choice of you to bear this great responsibility is the best proof of the high qualifications and excellent qualities you possess.\n107.\tI would like to express my deep appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, for his great contribution and excellent ability in conducting the work of the thirty-second session and the eighth, ninth and tenth special sessions of the General Assembly.\n108.\tI take this opportunity also to thank the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his report on the work of the Organization [A/33/1], which contains a useful evaluation of the Organization's work and of the international situation in general. I should also like to thank him for his efforts in the service of international peace and co-operation and the achievement of the goals of this Organization.\n109.\tThe delegation of my country congratulates the Government and people of Solomon Islands on the independence of that State and welcomes its admission to the membership of the United Nations. Its admission to the United Nations family is a positive step towards the liquidation of colonialism. It brings our Organization closer to the attainment of its goal of universality, as the number of its Members has now reached 150. We hope that we shall be able in the near future to welcome new Member States from among nations which are still struggling for their freedom and independence.\n110.\tWe meet every year in this Assembly several States to which, despite the long distance that separates us, we are linked by ties of friendship and co-operation on the basis of the principles of the United Nations Charter. These principles still retain their force and value in the conduct of our work and the direction of our international relations in a way that enables the nations of the world to avoid the dangers that surround them.\n111.\tThe United Nations has been able throughout the last 33 years to adapt itself to a rapidly changing world, and has become truly the only and proper forum for the continuance of dialogue between nations, big and small, rich and poor, on the consolidation of efforts to solve the questions that confront humanity, such as the establishment of a new international economic order, the achievement of general and complete disarmament, the liquidation of imperialism and the combating of racism and racial discrimination.\n112.\tThe General Assembly meets these days at the time of utmost importance because of current world developments. Tension is increasing because of the re-emergence of the cold war in the sphere of international relations, involving a threat to the future of detente. It has been clear to the world that armed conflicts and centres of tension are not confined to the great Powers, but extend to developing States. The clearest example is the events in the African continent and the Horn of Africa during this year.\n113.\tAll this is taking place at this historic stage when the aims arc the liquidation of colonialism and the establishment of just and equitable international relations based on the principles of complete equality, respect for the independence and sovereignty of all States and the exchange of interests and benefits among them. In our opinion, if detente is to be durable and permanent all States must act effectively to find positive solutions to the crises and problems that threaten the world. This means that detente should extend politically and geographically to all parts of the world and not be confined to Europe and the great Powers alone. We should therefore exert unceasing efforts to liquidate imperialism, racism and aggression, lay the foundations for a new international economic order and solve all conflicts between States through mutual understanding, common sense and justice.\n114.\tThe Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Belgrade in July of this year, reaffirmed the principles of non-alignment to international blocks, non-subjection to the influence of the great Powers and resistance to all forms of pressure, including interference in the internal affairs of States. It called for action to change the system of political and economic relations based on domination, subjugation and hegemony, and for the establishment of new rules and bases for political aid economic relations based on the principles of sovereignty, equality and justice.\n115.\tOur agenda is comprehensive and full of important and pressing matters which are far-reaching and of great consequence. I should like now to state concisely our views on some of these international matters which engage the attention of the world and the United Nations in particular. The attention of the community of nations should be to them in order to find just and proper solutions for them before it is too late.\n116.\tIf we go through our agenda for this session we find that fee problem of the Middle East and the question of Palestine are among the most important and pressing matters, and are of particular concern to us. It is needless to remind the Assembly of the gravity of the situation in the Middle East. As the international community admits, the problem does not concern the Arab States and Israel only, but the whole world, as it may involve a threat to international peace and security.\n117.\tThe question of Palestine, which has existed as long as our Organization itself, is still foremost among the matters which are before the community of nations. It is greatly to be regretted that, since 1947 when this question was first brought before the United Nations, no just and permanent solution for it has been found. The people of Palestine have been throughout all these years subjected to grave injustice and excessive sufferings, waiting for the United Nations to rid them of the oppression and unjust treatment that have befallen them. In spite of the many resolutions of the United Nations adopted in a quest for a peaceful settlement to the problem of the Middle East, no such settlement has been reached because of the persistent refusal of Israel to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n118.\tWorld Zionism was not content with expelling the Palestinian people from their homeland and uprooting them from their land by violence, terrorism, oppression and persecution; Israel persisted in its endeavours by all unlawful m3ans to eliminate the traces of the Palestinian cause and distort their lawful struggle for the recovery of their usurped rights.\n119.\tIt has become clear that no progress has been made towards a comprehensive solution to this problem because of the persistent refusal of Israel to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and the PLO as the sole lawful representative of the people of Palestine, in addition to the continuation by Israel of its aggressive and expansionist policy through the establishment of more settlements and the annexation of large parts of the Palestinian and Arab lands occupied since 1967. The main problem is still the continual aggression of Israel against the people of Palestine and the Arab States, and the refusal of the Zionist regime to abandon its policy of expansion at the cost of the Palestinian people and the Arab States.\n120.\tThe position of the State of Bahrain as regards the question of Palestine and the critical situation in the Middle East is known to this Assembly. We explained before that the core of the problem of the Middle East is the question of Palestine, and that no permanent solution of that problem can be reached without the recognition of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the people of Palestine and the complete and conditional withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Palestinian and Arab lands. We are firmly convinced that no comprehensive and permanent solution to the Palestinian question and the Middle East situation can be found except on the basis of the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council relating to the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East.\n121.\tThe basic conditions for a peaceful settlement are the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied in 1967 and the exercise by the Palestinian people of their lawful and inalienable national rights, including the right to self-determination and to the establishment of a State of their own. Any solution which does not meet these two conditions will undoubtedly lead to a deadlock.\n122.\tThe State of Bahrain considers that for any negotiations, initiatives Or political or diplomatic activities to be successful in settling the Middle East crisis they should be conducted under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of all parties to the dispute, including the PLO on terms of equality with the other parties, since it is the main party to the dispute, as is admitted by the United Nations and the international community. Its participation is indispensable for the success of the negotiations and international conferences aimed at finding a comprehensive settlement of this issue.\n123.\tWe cannot imagine that any efforts will be successful without the participation of all the parties concerned, including the representatives of the people of Palestine. We Would like to emphasize that no solution or effort for peace will be meaningful or effective if it excludes the PLO.\n124.\tThe time has come for the international community to make intensive efforts to promote the reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East for the establishment of a just and durable peace in the Middle East at the earliest possible time. As a first step, Israel should prove its good intentions with regard to peace by recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. If Israel persists in disregarding reason and logic, the United Nations should take all measures under the Charter, including the imposition of sanctions under Chapter VII, to compel Israel to abandon its expansionist policy and its persistent disregard of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, and to force it to end its aggression and restore the legitimate rights it has usurped. If the United Nations fails to do that, a renewal of hostilities in the Middle East will be inevitable and the international Organization will bear the corresponding responsibility for the grave dangers to which the area and the world will be exposed through the threat to international peace and security.\n125.\tWith regard to the situation in the African continent, we expressed in former sessions our optimism with regard to developments in the international field, particularly as regards the end of imperialism and the transition of the world from the cold war to detente in the relations between the two great Powers. But the developments which have taken place in Africa have led us to be very cautious in our optimism. We have been greatly concerned over the development of the situation in Africa, which has become the scene of painful events and bloody conflicts between African States. Such conflicts have led to foreign military and political intervention in the internal affairs of African States. It is hoped that the African States will be able to settle their differences by resorting to negotiations and peaceful settlements and renouncing the use of force for the settlement of their disputes within the framework of the Organization of African Unity. We call upon all States not to interfere in the internal affairs of the African States. We think that the African States, which have suffered for many centuries from under-development, oppression and exploitation, are much in need today of directing their efforts towards development and economic and social advancement, rather than wasting such efforts in armed conflicts which will be of no benefit to their people and which will only lead to continued under-development and deterioration. We hope that the General Assembly will issue a declaration condemning interference in the internal affairs of other States for we > consider that this subject should be given special priority during the current session.\n126.\tThe deteriorating situation in southern Africa is also a matter of great concern to the international community. The policies of apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa, Namibia and Rhodesia are the core of the problem in southern Africa. Many initiatives have been taken during this year under the auspices of the United Nations and by some great Powers to find a peaceful solution to the questions arising out of the domination of the white minority through oppression and racial discrimination. All such initiatives have been thwarted by the persistent refusals of the ruling minority racial regimes in Pretoria and Salisbury to accept a peaceful solution. The withdrawal by the Pretoria regime from the plan for the independence of Namibia to be achieved under the auspices of the United Nations is a challenge to the principles, of the Charter and an outrageous violation of the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council in particular.\n127.\tThe same is true of the situation in Rhodesia, where the illegal Ian Smith racial regime still procrastinates against the will of the international community over the transfer of authority to the black majority. As in the case in the Middle East, no permanent peace can be reached in southern Africa unless the principles of the United Nations Charter are observed and the principle's of justice, equality and self-determination applied. We consider that the United Nations should discharge its responsibility towards the people of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania and take effective measures against the two racial regimes in Salisbury and Pretoria until they submit to the will of the international community. The State of Bahrain will continue to support the struggles of these peoples to attain their aspirations to independence, equality, justice and self-determination.\n128.\tThe World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination,  which was held for the purpose of assisting the victims of racial discrimination, has been of great significance to the African and other peoples in their arduous struggle against such evil policies.\n129.\tThe Conference condemned racism and apartheid as crimes against mankind. It also condemned the connexion existing between the racialist regimes in Rhodesia, South Africa and Israel and the close ties that exist between them, particularly in the political and military fields.\n130.\tThe State of Bahrain, convinced of the justice of the cause of the African and other peoples which are combating racial regimes, would like to take this opportunity to affirm its opposition to, and condemnation of, all forms of racism and racial discrimination anywhere as grave violations of International Covenants, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the principles of the United Nations Charter and its resolutions in this respect.\n131.\tAs a centre for co-ordinating relations and cooperation among States to attain joint goals and maintain international peace and security, the United Nations has this year been able to achieve some success in efforts to halt the frightful arms race.\n132.\tThe tenth special session, which was devoted to disarmament and held at the initiative of non-aligned countries, emphasized the determination of the international community to resolve this question which is vital to the future of humanity and will decide between the destruction and the prosperity of man. Disarmament and the limitation of the arms race, particularly in nuclear weapons, has been one of the prominent matters and questions dealt with by the United Nations since its inception and one of the principal issues before the Organization. The huge allocations set aside for armaments could be better utilized for raising the standard of living in developing countries. It is indeed regrettable to note that the financial, technological and human resources allocated to the production and purchase of arms far exceed the financial and technological resources needed to correct the current inequitable international economic order and raise the standard of living in developing countries.\n133.\tAlthough the tenth special session did not adopt specific and concrete measures to halt the arms race, as we had hoped it would, we nevertheless truly hope that the Final Document adopted by the General Assembly at that session /resolution S-10/2J will contribute effectively to the attainment of our final goal\u2014general and complete disarmament. It is also hoped that the new Disarmament Commission of the General Assembly established at that session will be able to pursue its efforts to arrive at a genuine programme for general and complete disarmament under effective international control and at the channelling of present military expenditure to economic development, particularly in developing countries.\n134.\tWe should like on this occasion to reaffirm our support of the efforts made within the United Nations to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean with a view to maintaining the independence and sovereignty of the States of the regions.\n135.\tOur agenda for this session contains numerous items dealing with international questions which occupy the attention of the community. Foremost among them is the question of the implementation of the new international economic order. It has become clear that no State, whatever its strength or economic capability or the degree of its technological advancement, can by itself deal with the economic problems confronting it. Hence the importance of the United Nations as a vehicle for the co-ordination of efforts to solve economic problems which are insoluble without collective action, particularly since we live in an age in which the interdependence of States is increasing daily. Although more than four years have elapsed since the General Assembly resolved to establish a new international economic order [see resolutions 3201 (S-Vl) and 3202 (S-VI)], a wide gap still exists between what was decided in this respect and what it has been possible to achieve in practice. It is not in the interest of developed States to correct the defects in the current economic order and replace the existing relations, which are based on unfair advantages, by more just and equitable international relations. The gap between the economic standards in the developed and the developing countries is widening day by day. In other words, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer without any appreciable progress being made in bridging the increasing gap between the developing and the developed countries. It is a matter for great concern that, as IBRD pointed out in its report this year,  approximately 800 million people in the developing world suffer from abject poverty, malnutrition, illiteracy, disease and a high mortality rate among children. The report warned that unless industrial States increase their aid to developing countries such problems will remain unsolved until the end of the century and that they are likely to get worse. It is important to re-emphasize here the pressing need for restructuring international economic relations by establishing the new international economic order, which guarantees the establishment of balanced mutually beneficial relations among States, thus leading to stability, prosperity and progress for mankind as a whole.\n136.\tThe seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea ended recently after some progress had been made towards the solution of hard-core issues. We should like on this occasion to support the appeal that no unilateral national legislation be adopted with regard to the exploration and exploitation of the international area before the conclusion of the convention, because of the detrimental effect that this would have on the work and success of the Conference. It is hoped that it will not be long before a generally acceptable and comprehensive convention on the law of the sea is concluded, thus contributing to the implementation of the new international economic order, which would benefit all the nations of the world.\n137.\tIn outlining my statement in my country's position on the most important items on our agenda it has not been my intention merely to refer to successes or failures but rather to draw attention to what in our view, are the pressing problems now confronting the world and point out the means and the possibilities for their solution under the auspices of the United Nations. There are many major, hard and complex problems' confronting us. We hope that by looking at the problem as a whole and exerting real and relentless efforts, we shall be able ,to find the path to peace, co-operation and justice. In this respect we should be guided by the objectives and principles of the Charter, which we have vowed to support. For our part, my country's delegation would like to reaffirm the continuous adherence of the State of Bahrain to the principles and purposes of the United Nations and its readiness to work together with States which love peace and justice for their implementation. Our position stems from our firm conviction that this Organization provides the most effective means for the community of mankind to achieve its aspirations to peace, justice and economic and social progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff104.\tOn behalf of the President of the Republic of Gabon, may I join previous speakers in warmly congratulating the President on having been unanimously chosen by our Assembly to guide its debates. In so doing, my delegation, far from simply following tradition is genuinely convinced that our President's eminent qualities as a seasoned diplomat, together with his wealth of experience of international affairs, naturally fit him for his delicate but noble and exalting task and undoubtedly guarantee the final success of our work.\n105.\tNeed I emphasize that these congratulations are also extended to the Vice-Presidents and other members of the General Committee, who, together with the President, will be called upon to play a leading role in the course of our debates.\n106.\tI am particularly happy to pay a lively tribute to the President of the thirty-second session of this Assembly, Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia, for his remarkable work during that session as well as during the three special sessions, the success of which was so striking. I am happy to attribute that success to that brilliant statesman.\n107.\tFinally, I welcome the admission of Solomon Islands as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of our Organization. I can but rejoice at this further step towards universality, one of the Organization's fundamental objectives.\n108.\tWhile it is fitting to point out with satisfaction that from one year to another solutions of some sort are finally found to certain problems debated here, it is no less true that a cursory look at the agenda of the present session shows us that, most unfortunately, the items included remain the same from one session to the next. This is particularly so in regard to the problems of decolonization and of security and international economic co-operation, for which no solutions are forthcoming. In this range of problems, which never ceases to grow, one can affirm without fear of being mistaken or misjudged that Africa, our advancing Africa, has been in the course of the past few years at the core of the burning concerns of our Organization.\n109.\tAs proof of this I need mention only the various meetings held within the framework of our Organization in 1977 and, more particularly, during the present year. Last April we met here in the ninth special session to discuss the problem of Namibia. Without wishing to enter into the details of that question, which is still before the Security Council and on which each of our States has already had an opportunity to be heard, I wish simply to recall some of the terms of the message from the President of the Gabonese Republic, His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, which was read to this body by the Prime Minister during the special session of the General Assembly on Namibia. He said:\n\\\"We cannot continue to leave in the balance on the one hand the lives of thousands of human beings, slaves in their own countries, and on the other the no doubt considerable material interests, the benefits of which can hardly be compared with their cost in suffering and humiliation.\\\"\n110.\tWe are pleased, by the Security Council's appeal to the Government of South-Africa to co-operate immediately with the Secretary-General in implementing its resolution 435 (1978), in which the Council approved the Secretary- General's report,  which is an outline of the various stages necessary to lead Namibia to genuine independence.\n111.\tIt is reasonable to-hope that the Western countries that have many links with South Africa will show themselves to be more determined with regard to their partner so as to bring it to accept a dialogue within the framework of the proposals in the Western plan, which was endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 431 (1978) and which my country welcomed here as a positive initiative to be encouraged-and which seems to us to be the minimum that is acceptable. It must be understood that without it there will be a struggle to the death into which the whole of Africa is prepared to throw all its forces.\n112.\tEveryone will recognize that the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPOJ has given sufficient proof of its moderation and keen sense of responsibility for justice finally to be done to it. We shall not despair, once again, of the unanimous support of the international community within the United Nations so that at the opening of the thirty-fourth session we may be able to welcome Namibia as a new Member of the Organization. The unanimous pressure of the international community, and in particular of the Western members of the Security Council, seems to us all the more essential now, when we see the present attempts by South Africa to torpedo peace in order to safeguard its interests.\n113.\tLike the countries members of the OAU, in particular the countries members of the non-aligned movement, and in general all countries that love peace, justice and freedom, the Gabonese Republic supports the tireless struggle of the Namibian people to establish independence on the soil of their ancestors.\n114.\tAs regards the question of Zimbabwe, I shall limit myself to repeating what we have had the opportunity to say many times within our pan-African organization as well as in the non-aligned movement and here at the United Nations: that while recognizing the decisive role of the Patriotic Front in finding an equitable solution in Zimbabwe we no less firmly support any constructive dialogue between the various parties to the conflict. Information from the region confirms us in that position.\n115.\tThe fighting in the region proves that peace in that Territory can come about only through dialogue between the various parties. That implies sufficient flexibility and understanding on all sides. In this connexion I remind the Assembly that the Gabonese Republic takes the view that the satisfaction of the elementary needs of the African peoples and the free exercise of their political, economic and social rights are not functions of any ideology. There is no reason why the dialogue that we freely accept among nations with different political systems should not be practised within one nation. From that point of view, the proposed meeting between those responsible for the internal settlement and the leaders ,of the Patriotic Front seems to us the only way likely to lead to the formation of a genuine government of national unity-and to put an end to the fratricidal battles, thus preventing those who fought for independence yesterday, both inside and outside the country, from becoming enemies tomorrow. We must not forget that the African signatories to the internal settlement have suffered as much as have the present leaders of the Patriotic Front from the blind repression and brutality of the white racist minority;\n116.\tNeed I remind the Assembly that Africa needs peace. We firmly believe that. It is for this reason that we appeal to the wisdom of all concerned. We hope that the minority regime of South Africa will give proof of such wisdom in this part of Africa, that regime which continues to disgrace mankind because of the extent of its obscurantism and political blindness, as we have shown on several occasions.\n117.\tIf there are indeed serious reasons to hope for a definite and early solution to the problems in Namibia and Zimbabwe-with South Africa, the only bastions of apartheid as a system of government\u2014we are bound to note that there is still no prospect of improvement for the black peoples of that part of our continent so long as it is true that, as President Bongo emphasized at the thirty-second session of the- General Assembly,  abominable racial segregation blocks any political negotiation.\n118.\tWhile the changes that will not fail to take place in Namibia and Zimbabwe should lead South Africa to greater understanding, a better discernment of the just claims of the South African peoples, there seems to be a trend in that sanctuary of apartheid towards a hardening of that policy. We repeat that the white minority regime of South Africa, with its 4 million whites-not all of whom agree with its policies-will never be able to resist the pressure of the 400 million inhabitants of independent and free Africa, despite its military superiority, acquired with the assistance of the Western Powers, which no longer dare to sanction its ignoble policy. As the President of the Gabonese Republic, His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo said during the thirty-second session: \\\"It must, therefore, be eliminated, not in six years, six months or six weeks, but right now.\\\" It is the only chance of survival for a minority population which already has its back to the wall.\n119.\tIn November last an astonished world learned of the heroic gesture of the President of Egypt, Mr. Anwar El-Sadat, in taking the risk going personally to Israel to propose to the Hebrew State peace in acceptable conditions.\n120.\tWe have real hopes as a result of the evolution of events since then\u2014and in this respect we are pleased that it now appears to be almost unanimously agreed that any solution to this problem must duly take into account the legitimate interests of the Palestinian people represented by the PLO, which our Organization has recognized as the sole representative of the Palestinian people.\n121.\tIt is, in fact, inconceivable that the people of Israel, which owes its existence as a State solely to the will of the United Nations, should refuse to implement the decisions  of the Organization in favour of the Palestinian people, which, like the Israeli people, has a right to a homeland. History has indeed taught us that force alone does not constitute a solution to the major problems of the times. Yesterday's victor may well prove to be the vanquished of tomorrow.\n122.\tThis last remark applies equally to the Cypriot problem, which can be solved only through implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions. Here again, no solution is possible without genuine dialogue between the two communities on the island free of foreign interference, a dialogue that would safeguard their territorial integrity as well as the independence of the country , which has played a major role in the formation of the non-aligned movement, of which we are a part.\n123.\tSuch dialogue and mutual understanding between two communities that have the same ethnic background but different beliefs have always been specific characteristics of Lebanon. Regrettably, that unusual character has been destroyed by circumstances beyond the control of the Lebanese people, but we do not despair of its restoration With the valuable assistance of the Arab nations in particular and the United Nations in general, whose presence in that country is an undeniable factor for peace.\n124.\t\\\"Dialogue, tolerance and peace\\\": that is the motto of our great national political party, the Gabonese Democratic- Party, under the leadership of His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, in building a united and new Gabon.\n125.\tTo engage in dialogue, a factor of peace among men and nations, is what we recommend also to all peoples that are destroying each other for reasons that are ultimately non-existent or have been created by foreign interference. In the same way that we have recommended it to African peoples and to the peoples of the Middle East; we recommend this method to the people of Korea, who can arrive at peaceful reunification and the restoration of peace only through dialogue free of foreign interference.\n126.\tWhile we recognize the virtues of dialogue on a bilateral or even a regional level, we also recognize that, because of the powers conferred on it under the Charter, the United Nations constitutes a valuable instrument for the purpose of dialogue. It is therefore fitting to praise the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to promote understanding, tolerance and nonviolence among people of different nations or people having different political or religious opinions. His excellent report on the work of the Organization [A/33/1] submitted to us at the opening of this session is sufficiently eloquent from that point of view, and we congratulate him for it.\n127.\tThe deplorable situation we have just recalled, which is reflected in various parts of the world, seems all the more exacerbated since each party thinks or knows it has the means or can count on the necessary support to allow it to crush its adversary. This situation would not obtain if some were to abandon their roles as providers of a\u00abms to all sides. True, there were wars even before the invention of these increasingly sophisticated weapons, but we are bound to recognize that they make war even more deadly. At the tenth special session of the United Nations, held recently, the Assembly dealt specifically with this problem. We do not doubt the goodwill of all and the genuine determination to defuse hotbeds of tension throughout the world so as progressively to adopt measures likely to eradicate the arms race for ever. I am certain that at the present session the Assembly will not fail to adopt resolutions intended to achieve that end.\n128.\tWe have already had an opportunity to indicate that man does not live by ideology alone; also, and above all, he lives by bread. Thus we cannot fail to speak of economic problems, which have a definite effect upon development.\n129.\tI emphasized a moment ago the eminent role played by the Secretary-General of our Organization in seeking solutions to international problems.\n130.\tFor the delegation of Gabon\u2014we wish to believe this is true of all delegations present here\u2014the United Nations remains the ideal framework for the major dialogue that is indispensable among nations and necessary to lessen inequalities and tensions born of selfishness, which generate misunderstandings among nations. The role that we accord to the United Nations is made specific by the adoption of resolutions sometimes followed by conferences. This is the case with the development of international co-operation which is the goal of the North-South dialogue; the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea; and, quite recently the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries; and similarly the fourth regular session of UNCTAD, whose resolution 93 (IV), on the Integrated Programme of Commodities, aroused the greatest hopes among the States members of the Group of 77, to mention only a few.\n131.\tOne of the burning questions that arise for developing countries is that of the search for a just economic balance and, something that has been the subject of repeated efforts by the United Nations for a number of years: the drafting of a new law of the sea.\n132.\tIn actively participating in the drafting of an international convention on the law of the sea, the countries of the third world, so long exploited, have submitted constructive proposals so that the resources of the sea-bed, which have been declared the common heritage of mankind in accordance with resolution 2749 (XXV), should be used for the benefit of the international community as a whole.\n133.\tThroughout the sessions of that Conference, however, it has nevertheless appeared that all proposals from developing countries systematically come up against the hurdle of opposition from the great Powers, particularly in regard to the transfer of technology, the training of staff for the enterprise, the single system for the exploitation of the sea-bed, and so on.\n134.\tWe deplore this all the more because we remain convinced that it is in the interests of. none to create situations of conflict. Accordingly, we energetically denounce any manoeuvre intended to permit unilateral appropriation of the resources of the sea-bed through the adoption of national legislation.\n135.\tThat is why we appeal to the conscience and the goodwill of certain major and medium-sized Powers if they really wish to contribute to the well-being of the \\\"have- nots\\\". By going against the just and legitimate aspirations of more than three fourths of mankind we undoubtedly run the risk of a conflict.\n136.\tAs regards the North-South dialogue we simply wish to recall that an improvement in the economic situation of the developing countries includes the settlement of the problem of the deterioration in the terms of trade of countries exporters of raw materials and the instability of the currency used for international payments, not forgetting that of the growing indebtedness of the developing countries, which today amounts to close to $250 billion, not including debt servicing, which represents 25 per cent of that amount. In this respect, we must pay a tribute to the \\\"have\\\" countries which decided to cancel the debts of certain developing countries. We can never sufficiently encourage the other wealthy countries to envisage similar measures or others for the partial reduction of the external debt of all the poor countries\u2014this within the framework of the agreement between debtors and creditors as decided in Geneva in the month of March last [see A/33115, part two, annex I].\n137.\tAs regards the fourth session of UNCTAD and particularly resolution 93 (IV), which I have already mentioned, unfortunately, two years later, we are bound to express regret that, in respect both of indebtedness and of the common fund, and also in respect of economic co-operation among developing countries and the transfer of technology, no substantial progress has been registered in the implementation of that resolution, which has nevertheless been recognized as the corner-stone of the new international economic order\u2014this being due to the absence of political will on the part of most of the industrialized countries.\n138.\tSo my country once again makes an appeal to the international conscience that the self-centredness of some may yield to the solidarity of the peoples of the entire world. In this connexion, we are pleased that the question of the insufficiency of trade relations among developing countries and the outward direction of the economies of those countries was at the core of the discussions at the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries at Buenos Aires.\n139.\tTo those who tend to look upon the conclusions of that important Conference as a failure we would simply reply that it would have been Utopian to try to settle in two weeks of negotiations a situation born of several decades, indeed several centuries, of economic alienation.\n140.\tNevertheless, we remain fully convinced that the countries engaged in nation building, aware that they owe it to themselves to be first and foremost the promoters and moving force of their own development, will, within a comparatively short time, find the means to overcome the many obstacles slowing their development and thus avoid their progressive pauperization.\n141.\tIt is on this note of optimism that I shall end my statement. But first of all I should like to recall to members the significance of our presence here. It proves \\\"that we retain our confidence in mankind, which can only flourish in peace and harmony among all men of all races.\\\"  That was what the President of the Gabonese Republic, His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, stated in his message to the special session of the General Assembly devoted to Namibia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff183.\tMr. President, in speaking for the first time before this Assembly I am happy first of all to extend, through you, Sir, the warmest congratulations of the delegation of Senegal to Mr. Lievano on his brilliant election to the post of President of this thirty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. This election is an eloquent tribute and testimony of the confidence he has always inspired in his peers. It is evidence of the high esteem in which they all hold him, and at the same time it is a deserved tribute to his country. I assure him that, as always, my delegation will make its full contribution to his exercise of his high functions.\n184.\tMay I be permitted on behalf of my country to extend congratulations also to all the Vice-Presidents of this Assembly.\n185.\tMy delegation likewise addresses its sincere thanks to the outgoing President, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, whose talents as a diplomat and statesman made possible the successful conduct of the work of the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly and the special sessions devoted to Lebanon, Namibia and disarmament.\n186.\tOn behalf of my country and its President, I also congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, whose experience, wisdom and excellent knowledge of international relations have on more than one occasion and for many years made it possible for the United Nations to avoid so many of the reefs and shoals that dot the course of international life at the present time.\n\n187.\tMankind\u2014and this has been emphasized on a number of occasions in this hall\u2014is going through a crucial stage in its existence and is agonizingly questioning itself about its own destiny. Scientific, technical and technological progress, which may have, and should have, contributed to its liberation, are, on the contrary, unfortunately threatening to put a final end to the human adventure itself. As a result of the progress made in means of communication of all kinds, this world has become truly one, while the mastery of the atom and the unprecedented accumulation of weapons of mass destruction may at any moment bring about the apocalypse.\n188.\tThe bitter truth is that the scientific, technical and technological progress, to which I referred a moment ago, is, unfortunately, not accompanied by any equivalent progress in the ethical field. Of course, today man is the master and owner of nature, but his intimate being\u2014that is, his psychology and mentality as well as his reflexes and appetites\u2014has remained fundamentally the same, and in this respect homo sapiens of today is little different from his most ancient forebears.\n189.\tEven so, there is no reason to plunge into pessimism and despair, for the responsibilities of statesmen, diplomats and scholars are rendered all the more real today because they make them more conscious of the efforts expected of them to provide mankind with salvation, to which all the peoples of the world today aspire. Indeed, the fate of mankind depends very largely upon them and also and especially upon the capacity of the United Nations to intervene successfully in the constant search for equitable\nsolutions to the grave economic and cultural problems our world is facing. This capacity to intervene in turn depends upon the will of States, and especially of the great Powers, which are, and let us never forget this, the very founders of our Organization, but whose positive action in favour of international peace and security is frequently hampered, slowed and compromised by great-Power selfishness and a narrow view of what their economic and military security should be, or, unfortunately and more seriously, by hegemonistic struggles for the conquest of new spheres of influence or the maintenance of earlier principles-in other words, in the final analysis, by a policy that is not especially oriented towards the continuing search for solutions to the numerous extremely painful economic and political problems of our time.\n190.\tThese unresolved problems in turn exacerbate the tensions between the great Powers and so, through the interplay of alliances, run the risk of delivering the whole of mankind to the demons of nuclear war in a holocaust.\n191.\tAmong these unresolved problems I should like on behalf of my country to refer to the situation in southern Africa and that prevailing in the Middle East and Cyprus, and I shall also, of course, be speaking of disarmament as well as the new international economic order.\n192.\tIn southern Africa, the situation in Namibia, in South Africa itself and in Zimbabwe continues to engage the full attention of the Government of Senegal.\n193.\tAs regards more specifically Namibia, the Government of Senegal has already had occasion at the last series of meetings of the Security Council devoted to that country to express its views19 concerning the way in which that problem was developing, without concealing in any way its concerns for the future.\n194.\tSenegal, as everyone is aware, welcomed at the time the Luanda Agreement, which was the result of long efforts aimed at putting an end to a situation that had been condemned on so many occasions by the whole of the international community at this very rostrum.\n195.\tWe understand and admit the imperfect nature of the Luanda Agreement - what man-made agreement is perfect? -- which was the result of a compromise; but that compromise, in our view, was meant to be a dynamic one leading to the total independence, without any territorial amputation, of Namibia. Today\u2014thanks to the five Western members of the United Nations contact group, whose spirit of initiative in getting the Namibian problem out of a rut I wish to salute-the initiative is With the United Nations, and that is a legitimate reason for hope. The United Nations must be aware of the fact that the credibility of the Organization is once again totally committed in the Namibian affair and that world opinion is carefully observing the outcome of the various decisions adopted by the Security Council on this important question.\n196.\tThe demands of SWAPO, which as far as we are concerned - and we wish to state this most solemnly - is the\nonly authentic representative of the Namibian people, are in conformity with common sense and the principle of territorial integrity, because, of course, Namibia deprived of Walvis Bay would not be viable\u2014and South Africa knows that full well\u2014and would, in spite of all the efforts of the international community, be a country that had gained its independence but was condemned to die of asphyxiation.\n197.\tBut, for the Namibian people to be able to express its point of view freely, it is essential that the necessary conditions of security exist. In this respect, as was recalled by our Special Representative at the last meeting of the Security Council devoted to the Namibian problem:\n\\\"The United Nations must demonstrate that it can discharge important and complex functions in helping Namibia to organize elections and accede to independence. However, free elections cannot take place where there is repression or under conditions of insecurity and intimidation. The international community must insist that all necessary steps be taken to ensure respect for law and order and guarantee general security throughout the Territory.\\\"\nIn this precise context we support the measures contemplated by our Organization to ensure that elections may be held democratically. It is for this reason that we solemnly condemn South Africa's decision to precipitate events by trying to organize so-called electoral consultations.\n198.\tAs regards South Africa itself, the United Nations has frequently confirmed the legitimacy of the struggle carried on by the overwhelming majority of the population of that country in order to found a society which will no longer be governed by the system of apartheid but will develop on the basis of the strict equality of all the citizens, in justice, peace, freedom and solidarity.\n199.\tThe World Conference for Action against Apartheid, held in Lagos, Nigeria, in August 1977, showed that the international community was unanimous in its unrelenting opposition to apartheid. In that context, the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [resolution 3068 (XXVIII), annex] took full effect shortly after the tragic events of Soweto and has been ratified by more than 40 States. In November 1977 the Security Council, by its unprecedented resolution 418 (1977), decreed an embargo on the supply of weapons to South Africa under the provisions of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. This is an opportunity for me to pay a lively tribute to the Special Committee against Apartheid for the paramount role that it has played in the international campaign against that scourge. Unfortunately, the South African Government, ignoring, or seeming to ignore, the repeated appeals of the international community, intends to continue its policy of establishing bantustans and generally intensifying repressive measures. The numerous arrests, detentions, acts of torture and trials of all kinds in these past few months are yet more evidence of the fact that the tensions and the conflicts would only continue to increase in that country unless the necessary measures were adopted by the international community\u2014 and this from solidarity with the overwhelming majority of\nthe people of South Africa. It is therefore urgent for all countries fully to implement fully all the relevant resolutions of the United Nations adopted here within the framework of the struggle against apartheid.\n200\u201e The United Nations Security Council, pursuant to its resolutions, must, as we see it, ensure that all forms of military co-operation with the racist Pretoria regime are ended. Pursuant to the decision adopted by the non-aligned movement at Belgrade [see A/33/206, annex I, para. 95], my country is hereby appealing to the Security Council for the effective application of concrete economic sanctions against South Africa. It will be recalled that at its thirty-second session the General Assembly adopted a resolution along those lines [resolution 32/105 F], which was strongly supported by my country, Senegal.\n201.\tThe World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination developed a Programme of Action [see A/33/262, sect. Ill] to promote justice, equity and human dignity in South Africa. We welcome the tangible results of that Conference. It is reasonable to expect that the Programme of Action which was adopted will lead to tangible progress in the struggle of the peoples which love justice and peace for the triumph of world peace and the freedom of the peoples.\n202.\tApartheid and racial discrimination are and will always be an insult to the human conscience and the dignity of all peoples; their elimination is indispensable to the establishment of international peace and security.\n203.\tIn the case of Zimbabwe, Senegal's position is identical to that expressed by free Africa at the last summit meeting in Khartoum, and was reaffirmed by the non-aligned movement at the Belgrade Conference. Thus, my country rejects and condemns vigorously and unequivocally the so-called Zimbabwe \\\"internal settlement\\\". The Salisbury agreement of 3 March is without doubt a desperate manoeuvre by the wayward racist regime of Ian Smith for the purpose of strengthening the military, economic and political power of a minority which wants thus to confer some credibility on the political status of the more or less representative elements which are parties to that agreement.\n204.\tMy country supports the inalienable and unquestionable right of the people of Zimbabwe to genuine independence and self-determination; and the legitimate struggle of the freedom fighters. We support that noble struggle because it is waged on behalf of man and the dignity of man. In this connexion I should like to recall that at the previous regular session my Government expressed the hope that in 1978 majority rule might be established in Zimbabwe.\n205.\tUnfortunately, it must be said today that that has not yet happened and we are still concerned by the growing and frequent violations of the sanctions decreed by the\nSecurity Council against the racist, minority and illegal Ian Smith regime. In this respect, a valuable report has just been published and undoubtedly constitutes a terrible indictment.\n206.\tWe appeal once again for the total application of rigorous sanctions by all States against the illegal regime of Salisbury.\n207.\tAs regards Western Sahara, Senegal reaffirms its adherence to the decision taken by the fifteenth session of the Assembly of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] providing for the establishment of an ad hoc committee consisting of five heads of State to examine all the data on this question in order to arrive at solutions which would be satisfactory to all the parties involved [see A[33/235 and Corr. l, annex II, AHG/Res. 92 (XV)]. My delegation considers that it would be both wise and timely to give the OAU the time necessary for the implementation of that decision.\n208.\tIn the Middle East, a dangerous situation continues to preoccupy us, and because it is dangerous we must encourage all initiatives of countries that love peace and justice and peoples who are trying to find a final and just solution to this problem.\n209.\tIt is indeed obvious that the intransigence and the. policy of settlement of occupied Arab lands by Israel continues to constitute today the principal obstacle to the resolving of the crisis. Moreover, we believe that as long as the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are not recognized, and as long as Israel persists in that policy, there will be no peace in that region of the world.\n210.\tI should like to pay a warm tribute here to the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. In spite of the difficulties of all kinds placed in its way, that Committee has been able to fulfil its mission with courage and selflessness.\n211.\tSenegal, like other members of the non-aligned movement, calls expressly for the convening of a special session of the General Assembly to be devoted to the Palestinian question, with a view to the adoption of the necessary measures to promote the implementation of United Nations resolutions relating to the evacuation of the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories and respect for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, particularly the right to a national homeland.\n212.\tFor its part, Senegal will always support every initiative capable of bringing peace and security to the Middle East, be the solutions found within the United Nations itself or at some other level, in a multilateral or bilateral framework, in order to ensure peace and security for all peoples and countries of the region. Nevertheless, we think that these can be no just and lasting peace without the effective participation of the Palestinian people, whose authentic representative is the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n213.\tRegarding Cyprus, my delegation is in favour of respect by all States for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-aligned policy of Cyprus. For that reason, Senegal is against any interference in the internal affairs of that country and hopes for the unconditional and immediate withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from the Republic of Cyprus and the adoption of emergency measures aimed at ensuring the return of all refugees to their homes in all security. We wish to emphasize the need for the resumption of intercommunal negotiations, based upon General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX), between the representatives of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. Those negotiations should be conducted freely, on a footing of equality and without any foreign interference, so that they might lead to the conclusion of an agreement that would be acceptable to the two communities.\n214.\tAs a non-aligned country, Senegal considers that the implementation of the proposal relating to the demilitarization and complete disarmament of the Republic of Cyprus could contribute positively to a lasting solution of the problem of Cyprus, the strengthening of international security and disarmament under the aegis of the United Nations.\n215.\tIn this period, marked by numerous armed conflicts, the holding of the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament was most timely. That session, in which my country took an active part, had the merit of making the world more aware of the risks run by mankind and especially of the need to divert part of the resources wasted on armaments to the economic and social development of our countries.\n216.\tThat is why President Leopold Sedar Senghor, our head of State, made before this Assembly certain concrete proposals, which I shall briefly recapitulate:\n.. after an in-depth but rapid study, the United Nations should declare certain countries and parts of the world non-nuclear zones. These would be developing countries which are relevant in terms of assistance to the third world. The whole of Africa would therefore be non-nuclear, including the South African Republic, which would be denuclearised because it possesses the secret of the atomic bomb and because, with its apartheid regime, it constitutes precisely a nuclear threat in itself.\\\"\n217.\tThe second proposal made from this rostrum by the President of Senegal concerned the control of nuclear activities. It related to the creation of a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for controlling the manufacture and stockpiling of weapons of all kinds, not only everywhere on our planet but also in outer space. That control would be carried out by. satellites and by all other technically feasible means.\n218.\tThe third and last proposal made here by President Senghor was for the adoption of a tax on armaments which would be applicable to all States without exception. Specifically, it would be a tax on war budgets and budgets\nfor equipment and operations, regardless of the name given to those budgets, so long as they related to the manufacture, purchase, utilization and dissemination of weapons. The tax would be 5 per cent of those budgets and would be paid to the United Nations solely for aid to developing countries. According to our calculations, this would amount to a sum of at least $US 20 billion per year.\n219.\tAlthough the proposal on control encountered practical difficulties, the other two did in principle meet with a favourable response. Therefore my country is happy at the decision to convene another special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations devoted to disarmament, and earnestly hopes that a still more favourable response may be given to all those proposals. Indeed, the holding of a special session devoted to disarmament constitutes an appreciable step forward in the pursuit of international peace and security.\n220.\tWith that in view, Article 2 of the United Nations Charter calls on Member States to \\\"refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state\\\", and also to settle their international disputes by peaceful means.\n221.\tIn spite of that provision, and in spite of its capital importance for the maintenance of international peace and security, that principle has never been respected by all States, which is regrettable. It has been reaffirmed on a number of occasions by the General Assembly, particularly in its Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)], its Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)], and its Definition of Aggression [resolution 3314 (XXIX)].\n222.\tPrompted by a constant desire to fulfil its obligations in this field, and willing to contribute more and more each day to the maintenance of peace and security in the world, Senegal firmly believes that the international community needs machinery capable of preventing and thereby capable of deterring any act of aggression that might bring about tension and war.\n223.\tMy country considers that a treaty on the non-use of force in international relations is an absolute necessity because not only would it strengthen the provisions of the Charter but also, and more importantly, would favour the progressive codification and development of international law in the field of the maintenance of peace.\n224.\tIn that spirit Senegal will welcome any international initiative designed to prohibit the use of force in international relations. It is our conviction, however, that an international treaty on the non-use of force would have to mention explicitly the right of peoples fighting for their independence to use, naturally, all means at their disposal, including armed force, as emerges from Article 51 of the Charter and article 6 of the Definition of Aggression.\n225.\tSuch a treaty would also have to prohibit, in no uncertain terms, interference in the internal affairs of States.\n226.\tThe quest for peace and justice implies also, and in the first instance, respect for human dignity. In the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the international community has, of course, the responsibility to proclaim and defend human rights and to consider this task as a permanent obligation.\n227.\tThus it is that since becoming a Member of the United Nations Senegal has proclaimed the importance it attaches to respect for human rights. As far as we are concerned, this respect is inseparable from peace and from peaceful and fruitful international co-operation. For that reason the Republic of Senegal has made the protection of human rights an essential element of its Constitution and has set up for that purpose a democratic system whereby several political parties and unions coexist and rival each other in mutual respect for the political and ideological options of the citizens of Senegal.\n228.\tOur people have ratified the two Covenants concerning human rights which have just come into force. The policy of the Republic of Senegal serves the humble person. It is the exercise of human rights and the recognition of human dignity which, in the last analysis, as we see it, give their true meaning to the efforts for political and economic co-operation which peoples and States must undertake. It is precisely in this spirit that the Government of the Republic of Senegal has always supported the establishment of a post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. It is, indeed, of the highest importance to have an international authority independent of all countries to supervise, on behalf of the world community, the protection of human rights in all parts of the world, with no other purpose than the defence of the rights of the individual and the fulfilment of the human person. It would therefore be desirable for all Member States to contribute to the implementation of this project, because today more than ever they should recognize the limits of the powers of the Commission on Human Rights and the dire need for more effective measures in this field. Indeed, every day the world witnesses serious violations of human rights, which are occurring only here and there in specific places in the world. The point is that human rights must be defended, regardless of this political ideology or the power of those who violate them. Among those rights, the legitimate demands of the population of the third world for economic equality and security must be considered with respect. The peoples of the third world are, indeed, the prime victims-the forgotten ones-in the development of the world economy and in the trade relations between North and South.\n229.\tThat is why, in the field of international cooperation, ray country wishes to reaffirm vigorously the need to promote a new international economic order, as defined at the sixth special session of the United Nations General Assembly in the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)], and in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)], and also as completed, developed and clarified subsequently at the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Colombo in 1977.\n230.\tMy country, Senegal, like other third-world countries, had placed great hopes in the work of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, known as the Committee of the Whole. But we have to note with justifiable disappointment that the first session of that Committee yielded no concrete results concerning substantive questions, essentially because of the absence on the part of the industrialized countries of a genuine political will to enter into serious, just and useful negotiations. The Committee is required, in our view, to identify the particular issues on which it must concentrate its efforts, in keeping with the strategic importance that they have for the necessary establishment of a new international economic order.\n231.\tStress is frequently laid upon the present-day reality that, so far as official assistance is concerned, not only the developed capitalist countries, but also developed countries with socialist tendencies, have yet to attain the goal of allocating 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for that purpose. Indeed, they continue to ignore that objective, despite their profuse generous and philanthropic declarations at international gatherings.\n232.\tWe believe it only fair to recognize, however, the contribution to the development of the countries of the third world of the rare few industrialized countries which have achieved the 0.7 per cent goal.\n233.\tMankind is truly at a cross-roads: it may move it along the road of rearmament and the exploitation of the third world\u2014a fatal course which would lead it one day into a catastrophe from which it would never recover. But mankind can, on the contrary, choose the way of peace. This is a more difficult course; it requires sacrifice more than generosity in a world dominated more and more by selfishness. It implies a new definition of the norms and usages of a certain kind of political science which is more interested in efficacy and method than in ethics. However, it can never be sufficiently emphasized that this way is the way of peace, the way of security and progress for all people. As between life and death, the overwhelming majority of humans have chosen life. May all men of goodwill today unite their efforts so that this choice may finally become a living reality.\n234.\tSenegal, my country, like other nations, works resolutely to promote this course for mankind. It has not lost the hope, and will never lose the hope, of seeing one day, probably in the near future, the majority of the nations of the world, among them those often considered the most powerful, support that choice, the choice of world peace and security, because it is in the interest of and will lead to the happiness of man and of mankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n1.\tMr. President, I wish to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the presidency of this Assembly. I trust that your judgement, skill and, even more, your renowned integrity in your country's political life and in international relations will facilitate the achievement of our objective of reaching the right decisions on most issues on our long agenda. My country enjoys excellent relations with your great country, Colombia. The bonds of friendship between our two nations and our common commitment to peace in the world and to the promotion of the universal well-being of mankind should assure you of the full co-operation of my delegation.\n2.\tMay I also take this opportunity to extend our congratulations to Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia, the President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly, for the excellent manner in which he handled the responsibilities of his high office. During his tenure of office the Assembly held a number of sessions at which important decisions were taken. We are all indebted to him for his inspiring leadership.\n3.\tOur Secretary-General continues to enjoy our admiration for his relentless search for a just, equal and hate-free world in which all States and peoples will live in peace and harmony on the basis of interdependence. Nigeria is encouraged by his dedication to the fulfilment of these hopes and aspirations in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations. We are convinced that he will continue to enrich the Organization in his leadership role.\n4.\tWe seize this opportunity to welcome among us the new of Solomon Islands. We congratulate the leaders of new State. We hope that the United Nations, and in particular its specialized agencies, will assist the new State and thus enable it to consolidate its independence.\n5.\tAt the same time, we regret that, almost 18 years after the overwhelming adoption by the General Assembly in its resolution 1514 (XV) of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, some States remain under colonial domination. All peoples of the world, regardless of race, colour or religion, should by now have been able to exorcise their inalienable right to self-determination, freedom and independence.\n6.\tThe General Assembly cannot justifiably claim that it has fulfilled the hopes and yearnings of the founding fathers of the Organization. We recall that they did \\\"reaffirm faith in... the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small\\\".\n7.\tWe are at a crossroads. The question is, Where do we go from here? The signposts are clear: to disaster and chaos; or to peace, security and co-operation.\n8.\tFortunately, the lessons of history are abundant and dynamic. The options have always been there. The choice should now have become clear. Mere hope is transient, while existing fears by a few appear precisely articulated. The divisive consequences of the extant concept of three worlds are real but they are redeemable. We can march together, like soldiers on parade, even though sometimes we are out of step one with another.\n9.\tEquality and equity should therefore be the dynamic instruments for change and direction. Our goals should be peace and prosperity for all based on universal and mutual confidence; their attainment demands an enlightened modification of self-perpetuating national goals and policies. These modifications will, no doubt, pose severe challenges to the dedication of all nations, large and small, weak and strong, to the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations.\n\n10.\tDuring the past year important strides have been taken. The General Assembly concluded three special sessions on major issues ranging from peace-keeping and decolonization to the attempt to achieve a new world without war. In addition, two global conferences were convened within the framework of the United Nations further to arouse the conscience of mankind against racism and racial discrimination. A third set out to mobilize the capacities of developing countries for collective self- reliance. Those gatherings were designed to steer humanity \ntowards a better world. The United Nations today continues to provide the flywheel for a forward movement in that direction. Our faith in the United Nations' ability to light the way so that we can see our path clearly is total and complete.\n11.\tMy delegation observes with concern the vicissitudes experienced in our efforts to establish a New International Economic Order. We in Nigeria fully appreciate the enormity of the real development problems facing developing countries. There is clear evidence that these problems are, in fact, getting worse and are threatening stability, order and good government in some countries.\n12.\tIt has been claimed that the countries of the world are making their best efforts within the bounds of existing national socio-economic constraints. But it is also true that there are now at hand the economic and technological means in the world to end the progressive and definitely controllable drift to chaos in international economic relations.\n13.\tThat suggests that abject poverty and its effects on the quality of life of the peoples in developing countries can and should be effectively attacked globally. It should become the priority issue requiring international action that is sufficiently responsive to the needs of the developing countries as determined by them on the basis of mutuality of interests.\n14.\tThe tragic paradox of unmitigated want in the midst of increasing affluence in developed countries has been recognized. It has even provided the motive force for the spontaneous expression of generalized goodwill concerning the establishment of the New International Economic Order. In the view of my delegation, that is not enough. Developing countries need more than mere commitments. They want a' fundamental change in the structure of international economic relations. They want effective participation in the decision-making processes, particularly as regards international economic negotiations on all issues bearing on the New International Economic Order. They reiterate that these negotiations should be conducted within the framework of the United Nations system. In short, they want a clear voice in the decisions that affect the management of the world economy.\n15.\tI have dwelt advisedly on the need for discussions and negotiations on the fundamental issues of the New International Economic Order because the alternative is confrontation, which is divisive and may not be results- oriented. Mere palliatives, along the traditional lines of donor and recipient, not only are peripheral to the structural economic problems of developing countries, but also inhibit their self-reliance and sustained growth. These negotiations, therefore, should not degenerate into seminar-type sessions inconclusive in nature and replete with frustrations.\n16.\tIt is in this context that my delegation feels gravely concerned at the apparent difficulties which have not allowed the Committee on the\\\" establishment of the New International Economic Order, the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, which was adopted unanimously, to settle down to its business of negotiating, through discussions, concrete action-oriented decisions on global issues to bring about an orderly improvement in the structure of the world economy.\n17.\tMy delegation feels that all the outstanding obstacles to the effective mobilization of the full potential of that Committee should be removed at this current session. Accordingly we urge all countries to co-operate in ensuring that agreement is reached when the matter is considered after the conclusion of the general debate. We fear that unless that is done the authority of the General Assembly could be severely eroded.\n18.\tIt seems that there were some silver linings mentioned in the statements of some delegations more directly involved in the development of international co-operation bearing on the New International Economic Order. I also hope that those expressions of intent will be translated into concrete proposals to promote negotiations on the establishment of the New International Economic Order. In relation to this question, we feel that the ongoing dialogue between the centrally planned and market economy countries in Europe will generate the necessary commitments of all parties to it in order to ensure the active participation of every industrialized country in Europe in major global negotiations bearing on developments and international economic co-operation in accordance with the Declaration and Programme of Action cm the New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)].\n19.\tWe note with regret that certain developed countries are contemplating unilateral legislation affecting the exploration and exploitation of the deep sea-bed beyond the national jurisdiction of Member States. That would certainly be a violation of United Nations General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV) in which this Assembly solemnly declared, inter alia: \\\"The sea-bed and ocean floor, and the subsoil... as well as the resources of the area, are the common heritage of mankind.\\\" We join the Group of 77 in appealing to those concerned to respect the wishes of the majority of mankind on that particular issue.\n20.\tThe first special session of the General Assembly on disarmament that was ever held marked a new stage in the efforts of the United Nations to save mankind from self-destruction. That session was convened because of the arms race and the development and deployment of new weapons of mass destruction.\n21.\tMilitary research and development in the nuclear- weapon States continue to consume vast human and financial resources. We' note the competing reaction among nuclear-weapon States in order to achieve nuclear parity. This locks up funds which otherwise would have been used for development. As stated in the Final Document of the special session [resolution S-10/2], disarmament has clearly become an imperative and most urgent task facing the international community. The United Nations, therefore, must be in vanguard of efforts towards general and complete disarmament.\n22.\tIn this regard we welcome the decision of the special session to establish the United Nations Disarmament Commission. We are happy that this new Commission will be a deliberative body and a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly, and will consider and make recommendations on various problems in the field of disarmament. We hope that it will provide viable follow-up machinery for the decisions and recommendations of the special session devoted to disarmament.\n23.\tMy delegation is also encouraged that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has now, in effect, been streamlined and democratized. We are glad that the institution of co-chairmanship that has in the past caused irritation has now, by unanimous decision, been discarded. I am happy that, like France, all other countries will now find the stage more propitious for participating in the new Committee on Disarmament. It is also our hope that the ambiguities in the language of the Final Document of the special session concerning the Committee on Disarmament will not create any problems and that the procedure of decision by consensus will not hamper the decision-making process and inhibit progress.\n24.\tIt is in this light that my delegation looks forward to the early implementation of the Programme of Action [resolution S-10/2, sect. Ill], so that the options presented and the enthusiasm generated by the special session will not be whittled away. It is our hope that an early conclusion of an agreement at the second series of the Strategic Arms limitation Talks would give impetus to the new disarmament programme.\n25.\tThe issue of the universal protection and enjoyment of human rights has become so emotive and embroiled in East-West confrontations as to becloud the real essence of the role of the United Nations in this regard.\n26.\tViewing the issue from this standpoint, the Nigerian delegation will neither seek nor participate in purely political interpretations of the concept of human rights. Rather, we shall actively join hands with other countries in arriving at a workable arrangement, whereby General Assembly resolution 32/130 would be accorded the central position it should occupy in all the deliberations on this issue in the Third Committee. We shall also continue to support new efforts to strengthen the United Nations' capacity for the promotion and protection of human rights at national and regional levels.\n27.\tIn the Middle East, despite all efforts and some new elements, real peace still eludes the region. The situation in the region, for a mixture of compelling reasons, vitally affects not only international peace and security, but the interests of the world community as a whole. There appears to be no respite from the mounting wave of the violence that has plagued the entire region for more than three decades.\n28.\tTurning to the Camp David accords,  my delegation welcomes all initiatives in the direction of peace. All the same, we must remember that what we have is a framework, and that the road to final peace is still both long and arduous. However, I wish to emphasize the fact that the\nUnited Nations over the years has established broad principles for a resolution of the Middle East problem. These include Israel's unconditional and total withdrawal from Arab lands occupied in the June 1967 war, in accordance with relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and, more particularly, resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973) of the Security Council. Any solution must also take into consideration the inalienable rights of all Palestinians\u2014I repeat, all Palestinians\u2014to self-determination and independence within recognized borders of their own.\n29.\tIn short, our goal will be to find a comprehensive solution that will obtain broad support from all peoples directly concerned so that, in the end, we do not merely exchange another Middle East war for a dangerous escalation in tension or, indeed, an increasingly violent situation of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" brought about by the failure of the international community to solve the Palestinian problem.\n30.\tThe major area of serious concern to my delegation is southern Africa. The situation in Zimbabwe is still very explosive. Since the thirty-second session, we have witnessed fresh steps taken by the rebel leader, Ian Smith, further to consolidate his illegal regime.\n31.\tEarly this year the rebels established a so-called multiracial transitional administration in preparation for majority rule. Yet the hardships and sufferings of the majority African population continue. Indeed, the brutal killing of defenceless Zimbabweans has not abated. Smith explains away these killings and other related atrocities by his notorious Selous Scouts as casualties resulting from \\\"cross-fire\\\" or breaches of curfew. At the same time, the acts of aggression against independent African States have been stepped up.\n32.\tWe state once again that no solution of the Rhodesian problem will bring lasting peace unless it has the support of all the principal parties to the conflict. They must include, in particular, the Patriotic Front, which has borne the brunt of the struggle for majority rule.\n33.\tAn arrangement that seeks to hand over power to black surrogates of white minority rule is doomed to fail. Only simpletons or people without any interest in genuine independence for Zimbabwe can give support to this fraud.\n34.\tWe support those who believe that an all-party conference holds out the last, best hope for securing a peaceful settlement. However, there is clear evidence of deliberate sabotage of such a conference by the illegal regime of Ian Smith. In the past few weeks, there has been an intensification of mass arrests and the disappearance of hundreds of the supporters of the Patriotic Front. The nationalist forces, however, continue to break the backbone of rebel resistance. Together with the front-line States, we have been working on borrowed time to ensure that the end-result will not be to divide the country into camps of victors and vanquished. We envisage a settlement acceptable to all the elements central to the issue. We remain convinced that an all-party conference could provide the best forum for resolving outstanding differences so as to pave the way to genuine democratic rule.\n35.\tIn this regard, it is a matter of grave concern to the Nigerian delegation that some members of the United\nStates Congress have thought it fit to invite the leader of the rebel regime to appear before the Congress on the issue of majority rule in Zimbabwe. It is well known that past Anglo-American attempts to convene an all-party conference have been frustrated by the recalcitrant attitude of Ian Smith and his clique. Unfortunately, this invitation will be used by Ian Smith and his supporters in Congress to promote the internal settlement and also to whip up sentiments both in Congress and among the American public for the possible lifting of the sanctions imposed by the United Nations on the rebel regime. It would be tragic if this invitation to Ian Smith should be the first in a chain of events that can lead only to the escalation of the conflict with the consequent tragic loss of lives.\n36.\tI now turn to Namibia. The international community is once again faced with the intransigence of the Pretoria regime, which continues to maintain its illegal presence in that Territory.\n37.\tAfter 18 months of intensive negotiations, we have taken decisive action, as is evident from the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 435 (1978). We congratulate the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPQJ for exercising restraint and for its co-operation. We hope the five Western Powers who initiated the plan for a settlement  will continue to give full support to the Secretary-General for the implementation of the settlement proposals in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and within the context of the norms of resolution 385 (1976) of the Security Council.\n38.\tThe fact that I have highlighted matters of concern to my delegation, mainly in the Middle East and southern Africa, should not be construed as showing a lack of sensitivity on our part in respect of other areas of tension in the world. In Cyprus, for example, we remain concerned that the presence of foreign troops, in violation of the territorial integrity of the country, still persists in spite of resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. We deplore all manoeuvres by outsiders to divide the country and we demand the unconditional withdrawal of all alien forces to permit genuine reconciliation between the two major communities on the island.\n39.\tSimilarly, we call on all peace-loving countries in the world, and especially those that have the requisite political leverage on Guatemala, to use their influence and persuade Guatemala to comply with resolution 31/50 of 1 December 1976 by allowing Belize to proceed to independence in security, with its territorial integrity intact.\n40.\tTo us in Nigeria, and I believe to all people of African descent and all freedom-loving nations of the world, the situation in the southern part of our continent, especially in South Africa, is a festering sore. It is a constant reminder of the indignity and inhumanity to which the black man has been subjected. It has its roots in colonialism. It is sustained by political and economic interests from outside the continent. It reflects the pervasive nature of racism in the world. The central theme of the problem of southern Africa is apartheid. The culprit is the racist regime in Pretoria.\n41.\tThe World Conference for Action Against Apartheid, held at Lagos in 1977, was a watershed in international action against apartheid. Its success resounded the world over. It instilled new hopes in the hearts of the oppressed. Yet barely one year later, at the World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination in Geneva, the international community failed to give the struggle greater dimensions. I must here express the dissatisfaction of my delegation at the outcome of the Geneva Conference. Indeed, its results seem a set-back to the accomplishment of the Lagos Conference. One would have thought that the Western countries  which pulled out of the Geneva Conference, would have appreciated the scope and importance of the broader issues of racism and racial discrimination and their grave consequences throughout the world, in particular in southern Africa. Their action cannot but give Pretoria solace. It allows an impression to be created that Pretoria has strong supporters.\n42.\tWe in Nigeria are convinced that the longer the racist regime in Pretoria exists, the more grave and bloody the racial conflagration will be. We believe that increased and continuous pressure must always be brought to bear on Pretoria, whether on the battlefield or in international forums. It is our belief, first, that South Africa should be further isolated in all\u2014and I stress \\\"all\\\"\u2014areas of international endeavour; secondly, that South Africa should be treated as a culprit and not as a partner in any negotiation aimed at resolving the problems of southern Africa; thirdly, that as a matter of extreme urgency the Security Council should impose, as a minimum, sanctions on new loans to and investments in South Africa, and thereafter impose full and mandatory economic sanctions; and fourthly, that the international community should step up assistance to the national liberation movement in South Africa.\n43.\tFor its part, Nigeria will be unrelenting in its support for the oppressed people of South Africa. We shall continue to give diplomatic, political, financial and material assistance to the national liberation movement. We shall continue to press for the isolation of South Africa and its allies and friends in all international forums. As for the people of Nigeria, their concern for the oppressed is reflected in their continued and generous donations to our national relief fund for southern Africa.\n44.\tIt would be difficult for me to conclude this statement without recalling some of the tragic events that took place on our continent during the past year. There were, to say the least, crude attempts by neo-colonialist forces at the recolonization of Africa, in the guise of humanitarianism. Those blatant attempt's led to considerable loss of life and - property and have demonstrated to a great extent the weakness inherent in individual African countries, which is being exploited to the limit by those who wish us no good.'\n45.\tI cannot reflect this better than by referring to a portion of the statement which my Head of State, Lieutenant General Olusegun Obasanjo, made at the fifteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] in Khartoum in July of this year:\n\\\"Let me at the outset reiterate Nigeria's position on the question of external intervention in the affairs of any\nsovereign nation. We condemn all such interventions without reservation.\n\\\"We are, however, of the view that we need to be quite clear about what we mean by external intervention in the context of contemporary political developments in Africa. Typical examples of the kind of foreign interference we have in mind and which I believe were foreseen by the OAU Charter were the criminal mercenary-led aggressions against the Republic of Guinea in 1970, the externally organized invasion of the Republic of Benin in January last year and the recent foreign mercenary take-over of the Government of the Comoro Islands. These were operations purposely mounted in order to protect foreign interests and to subvert the stability and sovereignty of specific African States. Unless we wish to indulge in self-deception by avoiding unpalatable truths, we should recognize the recent intervention by certain ex-colonial European Powers in Central Africa for what it really was. Simply put, it is a most naked and unashamed attempt to determine what Africa's true collective interests should be. We reject the notion that Africa's interests or collective security needs can be discussed or determined by the Western nations or anybody else for that matter without our consent or without consultation with delegations mandated by the OAU\\\".\nIt is my hope that those events will not be repeated in future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff95.\tSir, your election as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly and the confidence which the Assembly has placed in you have been noted with great pleasure by the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic. As we offer you our congratulations, we are confident that your political sagacity and your distinct qualities .will significantly contribute to a successful conclusion of the session. The delegation of Yemen assures you of its full co-operation in the discharge of your delicate task.\n96.\tMay I take this opportunity to express the deep gratitude and appreciation of my delegation for the outstanding role which your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, has performed with admirable wisdom and patience during his term as President of the thirty-second regular session and the three special sessions held this year. Our delegation also wishes to express its deep appreciation for the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the establishment of peace and the dispelling of the threat of war in areas of tension and hostilities.\n97.\tPermit me to extend our congratulations to the people and Government of Solomon Island on their admission to membership in the United Nations family. We welcome their active participation in our joint efforts, which are aimed at the realization of stability and happiness for mankind.\n98.\tThere is no doubt that the convening of three special sessions of the General Assembly within the span of one year represents a significant development in the history of the United Nations. This development reflects the conviction of the international community that contemporary problems cannot be resolve except through the collective will and co-operation of the peoples of the world. With such will and cooperation, a better atmosphere for coexistence and development will prevail for the well-being of their respective communities. Furthermore, the convening of those sessions has added a new dimension to the concept of democracy in the realm of international relations. It is therefore incumbent upon us today to reaffirm this new spirit which has begun to manifest itself in the United Nations approach to settling international problems and disputes. Today the world Organization is more responsive to these circumstances and changes.\n99.\tThe Government of the Yemen Arab Republic has followed with peat interest the issues on which discussions focused at the Bonn Economic Summit Conference held in Bonn during the month of June 1978 concerning trade relations between the industrialized countries and the developing nations. We expressed similar interest in their efforts to combat international terrorism. On the same grounds Yemen welcomes any measure aimed at protecting the security of the non-nuclear States. Hence, the Yemen delegation wishes success to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.\n100.\tAs one of the founders of the non-aligned movement, the Yemen Arab Republic appeals once again to the Government of the People's Republic of China to join this movement, with the aim of enhancing the movement's progressive role and of safeguarding it against any deviation from its fundamental principles that were laid down at the African-Asian Conference, held in Bandung in 1955.\n101.\tMy country follows with special interest the process of negotiation between representatives of the developed countries and of the developing countries\u2014or what \nbecome known as the North-South dialogue-which is a new method for restructuring international economic relations and co-operation on just and equitable bases.\n102.\tHowever, we note with disappointment the meagre progress which has been made. In fact, no progress has been achieved in matters relating to the purchasing power of the developing countries, the establishment of the common fund for commodities, or the external debt of the developing countries. Nevertheless, we view the North-South dialogue-and, for that matter, the whole issue of economic and technical co-operation between the industrialized and the developing countries-as a negotiable question which depends in the first place on the joint political will of both groups to overcome the difficulties to which they are now addressing themselves in the dialogue.\n\n103.\tIn the meantime, we observe that the industrialized countries are reluctant to engage in negotiations concerning fundamental issues within the mandate of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, known as the Committee of the Whole, on the establishment of the New International Economic Order. And this partly explains the recent failure of the Committee to fulfil its mandate in accordance with Assembly resolution 32/174. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that the New International Economic Order, as defined in the Declaration and the Programme of Action which were adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly of 1974, [resolution 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)f, remains the appropriate and only framework for reshaping international economic relations on the basis of justice and equity for the benefit of the international community as a whole.\n104.\tThe period which has elapsed since the thirty-second regular session of this Assembly is very short; yet, it has witnessed international changes and developments of great dimensions which by no means generate an atmosphere of optimism.\n105.\tThe recourse to cold war methods as evidenced in the creation of areas of conflict and confrontation in Africa and the Middle East, together with the escalation of nuclear and conventional armaments, has dampened all hopes. These developments reaffirm the ever-increasing importance of our Organization as an ideal framework for international understanding and co-operation.\n106.\tThe sheer desire to discuss our common problems and concerns in an open forum, and our meeting in this hall today for that purpose, should be considered as a positive step in the direction of seeking the most efficacious and sound solutions for these problems and concerns, with a view to achieving stability and welfare for our peoples. We believe, however, that there exists a far more important factor: there has to be a serious collective political will for the implementation of the agreements we reach in this Assembly. We have to seek inspiration and guidance from the principles and ideals of the charter, lest our debates and discussions never bear fruit.\n107.\tThe attempts to acquire spheres of influence, which we are witnessing today in the continent of Africa and in the southern accesses to the Red Sea, raise the most profound concern in the Yemen Arab Republic. Our Government has expressed in more than one international forum, and specifically at the two conferences of Foreign Ministers of the Islamic and non-aligned countries, its desire to maintain the Red Sea as a zone of peace far removed from international conflicts and big-Power rivalry. This is a goal which the brother Government of Algeria has been pursuing in regard to the Mediterranean and it also coincides with the position of other brotherly and friendly countries concerning the Indian Ocean, which has been declared by the General Assembly a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)].\n108.\tWe are aware of the differences which exist among the States of the region and which are attributable to political and historic factors inherited from the era of imperialism. Yet we consider foreign intervention in any form or magnitude to be the constant and major factor underlying the political problems and the military confrontation which befell the Horn of Africa early this year. The Government of the Yemen Arab Republic has emphasized its desire to disengage the region from the conflict of the major Powers, and has taken the initiative in offering its good offices for resolving the differences which exist among the States of the region. The Government of the Yemen Arab Republic has also followed a policy of restraint in the face of repeated provocations and plotting, including the stationing of foreign troops for aggressive purposes. The latest of these provocative acts was the tragic assassination of the late President Ahmed Hussein Al-Ghashmi. In exercising such restraint, Yemen has been aware of the foreign designs and dangers which might ensue from any further deterioration in this strategically important region.\n109.\tI should like, if I may, to address myself again to the issue of security and stability in an area not too far from the Horn of Africa, namely the Middle East. With the permission of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, allow me to quote the following remarks on the Middle East from his report on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"... the irony of the Middle East is that this historic region, which has given so much to our civilization and which is still a great and diverse reservoir of human talent, has also become a grave danger to the rest of the world. We must together find some means of liberating the Middle East and all humanity from a nightmare that has lasted far too long.\\\" [See A/33/1, sect. Ill]\n110.\tIsrael, which has carved out for itself a place in the Middle East through usurpation and aggression, is the very nightmare and the cancer which has afflicted the whole region and its peoples.\n111.\tSince the establishment of the Zionist entity in Palestine through terror and occupation, the Middle East region has never enjoyed peace or stability. Encouraged by the Zionist philosophy justifying terrorism and usurpation, Israel has waged five aggressive wars against the Arab States neighbouring Palestine. The most recent target of Israel's aggression has been southern Lebanon, where about 2,000 innocent civilians have been victimized and half a million people were displaced, in addition to the destruction and burning of all that the peace-loving Lebanese people had built in that area through their laborious toil and the sweat of their brows.\n112.\tThe world public opinion represented by the numerous resolutions of the United Nations and other international forums has condemned Israeli aggression against the Arab nation. The most recent condemnations came from both the Ninth Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers, held in Dakar from 24 to 28 April, and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, which was held in Belgrade in July of this year. Both Conferences further called for the restoration of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people and the withdrawal of the Israeli armed forces from all the occupied Arab territories. This was stressed also by the joint Soviet and American communiqu\u00e9 issued in October 1977 after the declaration of the European Economic Community in London issued on 29 June 1977.\n113.\tThe Arab peoples demand and affirm the necessity of implementing the resolutions of this Organization, which truly reflect the interests and concerns of the international community. Israel's defiance of the international consensus regarding the inadmissibility of the acquisition of the territory of others by force and the restoration of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people is the very factor which has weakened the United Nations and diverted it, as the Secretary-General has pointed out in his report to this session on the work of the Organization from its central goal of maintaining international peace and security.\n114.\tThe delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic shares with the Secretary-General the view that, irrespective of the developments which may ensue from the endeavours currently undertaken, in the final analysis all concerned parties must come together and search for a way which will lead to a permanent and just solution. Nobody rejects just peace and stability except Israel. Our delegation furthermore wishes to affirm its understanding of a just and lasting peace based on the following.\n115.\tFirst, a permanent and a just peace should include the total withdrawal of the enemy Israeli forces from all the occupied Arab territories, including the city of Jerusalem.\n116.\tSecondly, a permanent and a just peace means the restoration of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, and enabling it to exercise those rights, foremost among which is its right to self-determination and the establishment of its national authority in Palestine under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n117.\tThirdly, a permanent and a just peace must include the cessation of the establishment of Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab territories, and the dismantling of all the settlements established since the occupation, as those settlements are illegal and should not be the subject of negotiations or wasteful efforts.\n118.\tFourthly, a permanent and a just peace must mean the cessation of all excavation and construction work designed to change the demographic and historic features of the Arab Islamic monuments and holy places. Our delegation, therefore, reiterates its call for all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, to adhere to the international legitimacy and to enter into dialogue through the United Nations so as to enhance the peace efforts geared towards the genuine objectives which have been defined by the international community.\n119.\tWe wish to emphasize again that the intransigence of Israel and its policy of expansion, aggression, and the provocation of various troubles in the occupied Arab territories and in Lebanon have obstructed all international efforts aimed at the achievement of a just and a lasting peace and have also demonstrated the Fascist nature of the Israeli leaders.\n120.\tThe problems of imperialism in South Africa continue to constitute a grave threat which is not limited to the independent African nations and which may lead to a military confrontation the scope of which will not be confined to the African continent but will engulf other areas of the world. This prompts us to take a resolute stand on granting the people of Namibia their right to self-determination and full independence, on the elimination of the illegitimate racist regime in Southern Rhodesia, and on enabling the Zimbabwe people to express its aspirations to self-determination.\n121.\tBased on this perspective, the Yemen Arab Republic supports the efforts of the United Nations and the Secretary-General which are aimed at bringing to an end the occupation of Namibia by the racist Government of South Africa and which have repeatedly condemned the white minority Government in Rhodesia. The Government of the Yemen Arab Republic has welcomed in principle the proposals of the five Western Powers members of the Security Council regarding Namibia,  and has emphasized that Walvis Bay is an integral part of Namibia. Our Government also denounces the machinations contrived by the racist regime of Ian Smith under the guise of the so-called internal settlement, the purpose of which is to deprive the Zimbabwe people of their right to independence and majority rule. We wish to point out that the intransigent position of the Government of Pretoria with respect to granting independence to Namibia and the continuation of the illegal racist minority rule in Southern Rhodesia will be the direct cause underlying any eruption of violence and the continuation by the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe of the armed struggle for the realization of their freedom, national independence, and territorial integrity.\n122.\tThe Government of the Yemen Arab Republic therefore reaffirms the need to implement Security Council resolution 385 (1976) and to promote peace efforts within the framework of the United Nations for achieving the independence of Namibia and preserving its territorial integrity. Our delegation also appeals to the United Kingdom, in its capacity as the administering Power in Southern Rhodesia, to shoulder its full responsibility by putting an end to the illegal regime of Ian Smith and transferring authority to the legitimate representatives of the Zimbabwe people.\n123.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic supports the Secretary- General in his efforts to resolve the question of Cyprus in a manner that will ensure the security of the peoples of Cyprus and guarantee to the island its independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment. Such efforts should be based on the recognition of equal rights for both communitites, the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots.\n124.\tThe Yemen Arab Republic has participated in an active and positive manner in the various sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, and prior to that had participated in the preparatory activities for the Conference through its membership in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, for the purpose of concluding a just and acceptable international convention which would govern- everything pertaining to the seas in a way compatible with contemporary international developments.\n125.\tAt the end of its sixth session, held in New York between 23 May and 15 July 1977, the Conference prepared what has become known as the informal composite negotiating text.  Our delegation expressed at the time its dissatisfaction with some of the provisions of the text, particularly those relating to navigation through international straits, since those provisions infringe the sovereign rights of States whose straits are situated within their territorial waters. Despite that, we continued to participate in the Conference in the expectation of reaching agreement on balanced provisions which would protect the respective rights of the various parties.\n126.\tBefore the end of the seventh resumed session, which was concluded in New York last month, the Conference was dealt a severe blow which manifested itself in the desire of some industrialized countries to enact unilateral legislation aimed at starting the exploitation of the sea-bed resources in the international limits of the area. As a member of the Group of 77, Yemen fully supports the statement made by the Chairman of the Group during the plenary meeting of the Conference on 15 September 1978. We also reaffirm the need to abide by the Declaration of Principles contained in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV), which declared that the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction are the common heritage of mankind.\n127.\tAt the end of last November the first international economic Conference to discuss the five-year development plan of the Yemen Arab Republic was held in San'a. Our delegation wishes to express its thanks and gratitude to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary-General, and to the United Nations family for their participation and cooperation in making the Conference a success.\n128.\tIt is the view of our Government that development should have top priority. From the day stability was attained in 1970 after eight years of suffering and disturbances, all our efforts have been geared to the elimination of economic and social setbacks. With this goal in mind, all available human and material resources and potentials have been marshalled for development. In 1973 we decreed the three-year development programme as the starting-point for a new phase based on planning for future development. That programme resulted in an annual growth rate of 12.6 per cent in the gross national product;\n129.\tThe five-year plan, which involves an estimated 16.7 billion Yemen rials and to which President Ali Abdullah Saleh and the Government devote great attention, has the following objectives for achievement during its life plan: first, to build the national economy and direct the economy towards reliance on local resources for development; secondly, to develop an integrated system of education and training; and thirdly, to establish the necessary infrastructure in the sector of communication and roads.\n130.\tAt the political level our country is witnessing an important development in its constitutional life. Our political leadership is anxious to pursue the democratic experiment as represented in the People's Constituent Council and to promote that experiment for the fulfilment of the aspiration of our people to a true democratic life.\n131.\tIn the international arena the Yemen Arab Republic has cultivated amicable relations with all friendly and kindred States. Our established policy is characterized by temperance, responsibility and the attempt to settle our differences through genuine dialogue. However, our country opposes any intervention in its internal affairs and also adamantly rejects the encouragement of problems among other States.\n132.\tIn its efforts to achieve prosperity and stability for its people Yemen is aware of its commitments concerning the international issues which beset our planet. In true co-operation with brothers and friends it attempts to contain regional conflicts, which often generate tension and constitute a threat to international peace and security.\n133.\tIn dealing with these issues, Yemen is inspired by its faith in the principles of the Charter and its strong desire to ensure that the United Nations, by our common will, remains the appropriate body for . tackling the most complicated issues. This leads us to emphasize the need to enhance the role of the United Nations in supporting the struggle of the peoples for freedom, independence and self-determination in fulfilment of the aspiration of our generation to see justice, peace and .stability prevail throughout the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff90.\tMr. President, on behalf of my delegation I take great pleasure in extending to you our warmest congratulations on your well-deserved election to the office of President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. We are confident that under your wise direction the outcome of the present session will prove both fruitful and successful.\n91.\tI wish to express also to your predecessor, Ambassador Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia, our appreciation of the competence and dedication which he displayed in directing the work of the thirty-second session and the three special sessions of the General Assembly.\n92.\tI take this opportunity to extend to Solomon Islands our congratulations on their assumption of its rightful place in the community of nations as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of the United Nations. May I assure the Government of the new independent State of Solomon Islands our readiness to co-operate with it in ail fields for the benefit of our two peoples.\n93.\tThis thirty-third session has been convened at a time when world peace and security continue to be threatened by dangerous and persistent issues and problems which have remained for far too long on the agenda of the General Assembly. Our deep preoccupation with the Middle Fast question, with the intransigence of the racist regimes of southern Africa and with the lack of real progress towards nuclear disarmament has not diminished; and our sense of frustration continues to be exacerbated at the failure of the international community satisfactorily to resolve these seemingly intractable problems which pose a serious threat to international peace and security and hamper the pursuit of those goals and objectives to which we all aspire. The General Assembly has so far been unsuccessful in facing up to these challenges. This inadequacy may have prompted the Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the Organization, to call for the channelling of positive forces in the right direction and for the provision of a place where all can agree to work together for the solution of international problems.\n94.\tI shall venture to address myself to those problems, notable among which are those concerning the African eminent, since this year and the year ahead will undoubtedly prove to be crucial ones for Africa.\n95.\tThe Namibian people have undertaken great sacrifices in the struggle for the independence and freedom of their country. SWAPO has demonstrated in the negotiations and demarches of the past few months a sense of responsibility, maturity and restraint. The Secretary-General is to be congratulated for having exerted many efforts in fulfilling the United Nations mandate regarding Namibia in a responsible and dynamic manner. It is indeed unfortunate that the international effort to resolve the Namibian question by just and peaceful means, an effort which has been marked by extensive negotiations and consultations and which has brought about significant compromises, should have been so abruptly and brutally sabotaged at the last moment by the intransigence of the Pretoria regime.\n96.\tThe racist regime of South Africa should not be allowed to sabotage the long-drawn-out efforts of the international community at this crucial stage in the independence process. The modalities for independence which the Secretary-General has proposed are neither more nor less than the normal procedure required for accession to genuine independence. The Security Council has already approved the report of the Secretary-General  by resolution 435 (1978). We hope that the stipulations and provisions of this resolution will be heeded by all concerned. Should the Pretoria regime remain unresponsive to this call to reason and go ahead with its illegal unilateral action in defiance of world opinion it will bear sole responsibility for the untoward consequences which will no doubt result from its action.\n97.\tWith regard to Zimbabwe, it is now abundantly clear to everyone that an internal settlement which excludes the patriotic forces is doomed to failure. The selective nature of the internal arrangement stands in the way of the achievement of truly representative and broadly-based majority rule. Therefore my Government feels that its conviction that genuine independence cannot be achieved without the full participation in all arrangements for such independence of the Patriotic Front is vindicated.\n\n98.\tMy Government hopes that the world community will also maintain its solidarity with the people of South Africa who continue to intensify their liberation struggle. The spotlight of international condemnation must remain fixed on the uniquely inhuman policy of apartheid until that crime against humanity and that threat to international peace and security is eliminated. The racist regime's criminal violation of the human rights of the majority of the population and its aggression against the Territory and the people of Namibia and against neighbouring States call for further measures under Chapter VII of the Charter. We hope that the Security Council will take action to enforce more strictly its mandatory arms embargo and consider the imposition of other punitive measures against that regime.\n99.\tMy Government is deeply con-' Tied over the continuing danger to world peace posed by the volatile Middle- East situation. In our view, the issues here are clear-cut. Israel cannot continue to occupy the territory of others and pursue its expansionist aims at the expense of its neighbours and at the same time expect to have peace. Nor can it ask for acceptance in the Middle East when it arrogantly denies to the Palestinian people, whose land it has usurped, their right to self-determination and nationhood.\n100.\tOver the past three decades the United Nations has never tired in its search for a just peace in the Middle East on the basis of generally accepted principles of international law and in conformity with the just aspirations of the people of the area. Security Council- resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) call explicitly for the total withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territory acquired by force. No provision in those resolutions can in any way be understood to mean that Israel can determine which occupied territory it will keep and which it will return. Nor can any provision be interpreted to mean that Israel has the right to impose any military, political or social conditions on any of the occupied Arab territories, including Arab Jerusalem and the holy shrines.\n101.\tThe most recently expressed international consensus on the Middle East, contained in General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX), goes to the heart of the issue by reaffirming the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and national sovereignty. We believe that a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East question must make specific provision for the attainment of those rights. My Government hopes that the world community will continue to work for the full implementation of that resolution.\n102.\tOvershadowing the political conflicts which endanger regional and international peace and security is the larger threat posed by the arms race, particularly the arms race in nuclear-weapon systems.\n103.. The tenth special session, on disarmament, while falling short of our expectations, was an important beginning of the task of dealing with disarmament problems in a comprehensive and specific manner. My Government recognizes that certain achievements were registered at the special session in establishing disarmament priorities, reaching consensus on a programs of action and establishing machinery that reinforces the- central role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament. These are positive and desirable gains; but general and complete disarmament is possible only if the nuclear super-Powers are willing to act in good faith in giving practical expression to the desire of mankind for a nuclear-free world.\n104.\tWe hope that the Programme of Action on disarmament [resolution S-10/2-, sect. Ill] will not have the same fate as other internationally approved action programmes which have been widely accepted in principle but largely ignored in practice. No Government is unaware of the terrible implications of a failure of the international will concerning nuclear disarmament. Therefore it is the solemn responsibility of the nuclear Powers to respond positively to the principles and objectives stipulated in the Declaration [ibid., sect. II] and Programme of Action of the tenth special session, which accorded the highest priority to the implementation of effective measures of nuclear disarmament and the prevention of nuclear war.\n105.\tThe General Assembly has long called for the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty and for agreement by the nuclear super-Powers on a significant reduction of their nuclear missile systems and stockpiles. Prompt agreement on these measures would be welcome evidence that the nuclear Powers are. responsible to the will of the international community.\n106.\tThe super-Powers are actively engaged in expanding their military presence in the Indian Ocean. Their forces in the area are on the increase, while their military bases, installations and facilities there are being constantly strengthened and improved. Such activities are in direct violation of the United Nations Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] and pose a serious threat to world peace and security. The Somali Democratic Republic, as a littoral State, has a direct interest in the peace and security of the Indian Ocean and will support all measures leading to the full implementation of the United Nations Declaration.\n107.\tIn his inaugural address [ 1st meeting] the President of our Assembly made a realistic and edifying analysis of the international economic situation. The situation of the developing countries continues to deteriorate, while in all international forums there is unanimity on the need to replace the old economic order by a spectrum of more coherent and better organized relationships that effectively reflect the concerns of the large majority of mankind. The solutions advocated thus far remain inoperative because the wealthy countries continue to endeavour to safeguard their selfish interests by putting a brake on any attempt to speed up the establishment of a new, more equitable and hence more just international economic order.\n108.\tThere has been intensive activity and research has been undertaken in many areas, making it possible to identify possible areas for the development of the world in the next few years. The majority of the conclusions arrived at in those studies show an accentuation of the imbalances between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\". As long as this imbalance continues, peace,' unity and solidarity among peoples will not exist.\n109.\tAs quite rightly pointed out in the declaration by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 at the Headquarters of the United Nations on 29 September 1978, the lack of progress in negotiations for the restructuring of international economic relations [see A/331278, annex], particularly those in the main areas, such as the integrated programme, the common fund for commodities, multilateral trade negotiations, the transfer of resources, international monetary reform and the debt burden of the developing countries, to mention but a few, is a major set-back to the hopes of the third world for a just and equitable share in the international economic system. There are, of course, retrograde trends which run counter to the principles upon which a New International Economic Order must be established. One example of these trends is the withdrawal of the developed countries into a systematic policy of protectionism, which further undermines efforts to achieve the liberalization of world trading patterns. We hope that the technologically advanced countries will show willingness to accept the need for collective action to solve economic problems of global significance.\n110.\tThe United Nations Conference on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries, held recently in Buenos Aires, provided compelling evidence of the determination of the third world to play its part in formulating global strategies for the establishment of the new economic order. My Government, which has long placed national self-reliance at the centre of its development planning, fully supports the Plan of Action to achieve national and collective self-reliance drawn up by the Conference.  We welcome the decision to make UNDP the international focal-point for technical co-operation among developing countries. Technical co-operation among developing countries is of course the responsibility of the developing countries, but my Government hopes that the developed countries will actively support co-operation for development, the aim of which is to improve the quality of life of over 2 billion of the world's population.\n111.\tMy Government notes with concern that the failure of the principles of collectivity and interdependence of States, apparent in many areas in the search for a new world economic order, is a feature also of the negotiations for a treaty on the law of the sea.\n112.\tThe key problem of reaching agreement on arrangements for exploiting the riches of the sea-bed particularly illustrates the predominance of narrow and selfish interests.\n113.\tJust as the rich resources of the new world were plundered centuries ago on the basis of the superior military technology of the old world, so today the industrialized nations would use their technological expertise to secure for themselves a monopoly over the riches of the sea-bed, even though the United Nations, in a solemn declaration, has declared the sea-bed and its resources to be the \\\"common heritage of mankind\\\" [resolution 2749 (XXV), para. 1].\n114.\tWe call on all States to refrain from actions which would endanger the negotiations for an internationally approved regime and which would put obstacles in the way of the successful conclusion of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n115.\tI now turn to a matter which has serious implications for the peace and stability of the African continent and, indeed, for international peace and security. I refer to the current situation in the Horn of Africa, which remains highly tense and critical. The massive weaponry supplied by a super-Power and by Cuban mercenary troops are being used to perpetrate violence, havoc and destruction against innocent people and to suppress their legitimate aspirations for justice and self-determination. The deployment of mercenary troops with sophisticated armaments\u2014which of late have been supplied in alarming proportions\u2014has brought about inhuman tragedies, mass killings, torture and the loss of human lives and property. Despite the wave of violence which characterizes the situation in Western Somalia, the liberation struggle goes on and the people of Western Somalia are determined more than ever to fight for their freedom and human dignity. Having failed both at the fifteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, held at Khartoum and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non- Aligned Countries, held at Belgrade, to gain sympathy and support for their armed intervention, the super-Power involved and Cuba as its military arm are devising a devious tactical plan against Governments of neighbouring countries in fulfilment of imperialist designs and hegemonistic ambitions. The idea is to use Ethiopia as a staging-ground for aggression and subversion against Somalia and other neighbouring countries in an attempt to install subservient puppet regimes in those countries and thereby dominate the region. It is believed that the details of that imperialist plan had been worked out during the recent visit of Cuba's President Castro and high-level personalities of the superpower to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. The Somali Democratic Republic warns against the grave consequences of such an evil imperialist design, which poses a serious threat to the peace and stability of the region as well as to international peace and security.\n116.\tIt is necessary to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the fact that the people of Africa, who have only emerged in recent times from colonial rule, are being faced once again with the subversion of their independence through the demarcation of spheres of influence by outside Powers.\n117.\tIt is a matter of grave concern and profound disappointment to my Government that that super-Power, once the self-proclaimed champion of third-world causes, is now an active and prominent participant in the new scramble for Africa. The direct intervention of such a Power, with Cuba as its surrogate, in the affairs of the Horn of Africa is the most dangerous example of this recent trend.\n118.\tMy Government has no illusions about the nature of the driving force behind the recent foreign intervention in purely African conflicts. We believe it to be motivated by the desire for world hegemony and the Power concerned is blatantly using opportunist policies in pursuit of that end. This is the reality that underlies an apparent wish for detente and peaceful coexistence. The opportunism of the super-Power concerned was clearly illustrated by its intervention, in alliance with other countries, in the Horn of Africa, where those countries had been the very countries which had actively supported the liberation movement of Western Somalia before their abrupt withdrawal of support. The unleashing of a Cuban mercenary force, backed by a super-Power, against freedom fighters who had almost achieved victory in their struggle for self-determination was a treacherous betrayal of a just and legitimate liberation struggle.\n119.\tIn these circumstances, my Government cannot shirk its duty to sound a warning that, under the pretext of defending certain African interests, a super-Power with Cuba as its surrogate is turning the African continent into a new cold war arena. Neither African States nor the international community should view with equanimity the recent escalation and internationalization of limited African conflicts for the sake of the strategic or economic interests of foreign Powers.\n120.\tIn the context of the real threat to African independence posed by recent and current attempts to recolonize our continent, it is pertinent to recall the view of the Somali Government as explicitly stated by my President at the recent OAU Assembly at Khartoum. Commenting on foreign intervention in Africa, my President said:\n\\\"Foreign intervention in all its forms and manifestations is inconsistent with the legitimate aspirations of all Africa and the spirit of the OAU Charter, which upholds the inalienable right of all peoples to control their destiny.\\\"\n121.\tThe recent OAU Assembly held at Khartoum condemned attempts by outsiders to impose their own solutions of African problems, of which they had little understanding. Such attempts demonstrate their utter contempt for African aspirations and only serve to complicate difficult situations.\n122.\tIt is a sad task for me to express the disappointment and disillusionment felt by my Government over the large-scale foreign military intervention in African affairs.\n123.\tWe cannot be silent when policies of certain foreign Powers harmful to African interests are undermining the authority of its regional organization, when Cuba's shameful role as the military surrogate and mercenary of a super-Power makes a mockery of its avowed adherence to the principles of non-alignment, and when those countries deliberately frustrate the legitimate aspirations of the oppressed Western Somalia peoples.\n124.\tAs to the issues involved in the conflicts in the Horn of Africa, there should be no mistake about their nature. If the world community does not recognize the reality of these situations today, it will inevitably come to realize that the people of the region are engaged in just struggles for their inalienable right to self-determination and independence guaranteed under the United Nations Charter.\n125.\tInternational law has long established the pre-eminence of the right of peoples to self-determination and independence. Three decades of United Nations history have surely demonstrated that attempts to deny those rights to peoples dedicated to the cause of freedom will certainly engender regional and international tensions and conflicts. The circumstances leading to Abyssinian colonial occupation of Western Somalia and the ensuing long and heroic liberation struggle of the people of Western Somalia for self-determination and freedom are too well known and need no further elaboration.\n126.\tSuffice it to point out that the people of Western Somalia have a distinct history and geography, and that their ethnic, cultural and linguistic characteristics are completely different from those of Abyssinia. They were linked to Ethiopia only through armed conquest imposed at the height of the \\\"scramble for Africa\\\" with the collusion of the European colonialists. They have never accepted this colonial status.\n127.\tToday, the vast majority of the people who came under colonial rule at the same time as the people of Western Somalia have attained full independence through the process of self-determination. It would be a travesty of justice if the people of Western Somalia were denied the same right simply because their colonizers are not European.\n128.\tThe United Nations has time and again condemned colonialism as aggression and as a breach of international peace and security. There is no denying the fact that Ethiopia is an empire and that the people of Western Somalia are people under a colonial and alien regime, struggling for self-determination and decolonization. The people of Western Somalia are in fact victims of Ethiopian aggression and they are entitled to international support for the attainment of their legitimate aspirations.\n129.\tIn an attempt to confuse and disguise the basic issues at stake Ethiopia, assisted by the powerful propaganda machinery of a super-Power, has spared no effort to distort the case of Western Somalia. In support of its illegal colonial claims, Ethiopia had repeatedly accused Somalia of violating the principles of the OAU Charter and OAU resolutions,-referring in particular to principles of territorial integrity, non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and the resolutions on the inviolability of frontiers.\n130.\tThe import and application of those principles is clear and explicit. We believe that reference to OAU Charter principles and OAU resolutions on frontiers is completely out of place and irrelevant to the core issue at stake, which is one of decolonization and self-determination for the people of Western Somalia. The Somali Democratic Republic respects lawful boundaries and the principles of territorial integrity as it considers itself bound by the right of self-determination and by other relevant United Nations and OAU resolutions. Let it be emphasized, however, that the mere fact that Somalia is bound by the Charter provisions does not imply the validity of illegal colonial claims. It is a well-known fact that Ethiopia had gone so far as to attempt to use misleadingly OAU principles and decisions to legitimize the colonial injustices of peoples under its domination. The international community cannot be influenced by such a blatant distortion of well-known established principles.\n131.\tMuch has been said about the interest of the Somali Democratic Republic in championing the liberation struggle of the people of Western Somalia. Our policy towards the people of the area is the same as the policy we demonstrated clearly in the case of Djibouti. We were, naturally, in the forefront of the long political struggle in international forums to achieve self-determination for Djibouti. In addition, we openly supported the efforts of legitimate liberation movements to gain independence for that Territory. Our main concern was to ensure that the exercise of self-determination would take place without variation and under impartial international and regional observation. When we welcomed our brothers of Djibouti as fully- fledged members of the world community all the calumnies about our intentions towards the Territory were exposed. It became evident that the attacks against us were last-ditch efforts by colonial-minded special interests to prevent, the peaceful accession of Djibouti to independence.\n132.\tSimilar attempts have been made to disguise the issues in Western Somalia but it is the hope of my Government that the international community will come to have a better understanding of the aspirations of these peoples and will accord them the support and sympathy they deserve.\n133.\tSince the inception of the OAU the Somali Government has tried to seek a just and peaceful solution to the\nWestern Somalia question within the framework of the regional organization. Unfortunately, the various attempts made by the OAU to lend its good offices in the matter have been frustrated by Ethiopia's refusal to deal with the realities of the situation and to negotiate in good faith. It remains our conviction that the interests of the neighbouring countries of Ethiopia and the Somali Democratic Republic lie in solving their problems bilaterally or under the auspices of the OAU. However, since November 1977 when sophisticated weapons supplied by a super-Power and Cuban troops began to flow into Ethiopia, Ethiopian war planes have been mounting savage aerial attacks against urban areas inside Somali territory and heavy concentrations of Cuban and Ethiopian troops have been placed in strategic locations close to the Somali Democratic Republic.\n134.\tAs a result of the internationalization of the conflict in Western Somalia, there are now over half a million refugees in the Somali Democratic Republic. Their plight must be seen as a human tragedy of vast proportions. Our Government is trying to meet the basic needs of these people as best it can, but their presence in our country places a heavy burden on the Somali economy. In that connexion my delegation would like to register its profound appreciation to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for providing assistance to these needy people.\n135.\tWith regard to the threatening situation on its border the Somali Democratic Republic is prepared, of course, to defend its sovereignty against invasion from any quarter, but my Government is equally prepared to work for a durable, just and peaceful settlement. Such a settlement must of necessity include the withdrawal of all foreign and particularly extra-African troops from Western Somalia, the cessation of acts of aggression against the Somali Democratic Republic, guarantees that the population of Western Somalia will not be subjected to genocidal reprisals and the granting of their right to self-determination. My Government would welcome the start of negotiations between all the parties concerned on the basis of these principles.\n136.\tOf one thing we are certain. If the legitimate aspirations of the liberation movements of the Horn of Africa are not recognized this region will be added permanently to the list of areas where tension and conflict are endemic and constantly threaten international peace and security.\n137.\tThere is a temptation at this stage of the General Assembly session to dwell on the failure of the international community to take collective action under the Charter so that it can resolve the many serious problems that confront the world today. We could perhaps place greater emphasis on the ever-widening and increasingly effective network of valuable services to mankind that has been established under the United Nations umbrella. I believe, however, that our preoccupation with political and economic problems of global significance illustrates the continuing validity of the United Nations as an instrument for furthering international co-operation, for safeguarding peace and for strengthening international security. The nations of the world must continue to strengthen and enhance the unique and essential role of the Organization in\nworld affairs. If they did otherwise they would be undermining their own prospects for peace and progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are proud that a representative of our region is presiding over this session at such a challenging period in international relations. The eloquent statement which he made after being elected [1st meeting] attests to his grasp of and deep interest in the issues with which we are faced in this Assembly.\n326.\tI would also wish to pay a tribute to Mr. Lievano's predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, for the wisdom and skill with which he guided our work during the thirty-second session and the three special sessions.\n327.\tTo the Secretary-General of the United Nations we express our deep appreciation for his untiring efforts, often in the face of intimidating odds, to find solutions to those many critical issues which confront us all.\n328.\tI wish to add my welcome to Solomon Islands as the newest Member of this world body. The United Nations has taken one more step towards the desired goal of universality of membership. It is to be hoped that we shall soon be in a position to welcome as members of this world body, Territories in the Caribbean which earnestly aspire to attain their independence and to assume their international rights and responsibilities.\n329.\tIn the current state of international relations, there remain outstanding a number of major political and economic issues for which we desperately need to find solutions. At the same time we have to recognize that certain fundamental changes in the international system are increasingly necessary, if the world community as a whole is to survive and prosper in the years ahead.\n330.\tThe momentous changes brought about by the last phase of the decolonization process themselves mark a major turning-point in history. These developments have, moreover, occurred in a period marked by major advances in science and in technology, and in a rapid growth in the world economy. This has taken place against the background of intense political and ideological rivalry generated by the major alliance systems in the cold war era.\n331.\tDuring this period the world has also been shaken by new intellectual and moral forces. Against these trends we have seen countervailing forces as the old order seeks to resist the momentum of change.\n332.\tWe are, in short, at a critical period of world history. If we fail to turn with the forces of change we will write our own destruction. We can only move ahead if attain a new level of international co-operation.\n333.\tIn the field of human .rights, bold and imaginative initiatives have been taken. But an essential ingredient still remains to be established\u2014that is, accepted international machinery for implementing human rights. This requires that we overcome the cleavages between differing political and cultural systems, and differing states of economic development and under-development. It requires the unequivocal recognition and application of economic and social rights, together with other fundamental human liberties.\n334.\tAlthough these requirements should not prevent practical action in cases of obvious urgency, ad hoc responses are clearly no substitute for co-ordinated international action. Only concerted action will eliminate the agonizing and dangerous divergences over, for example, the whole question of terrorism.\n335.\tDuring the last regular session of the General Assembly, a clearly significant development took place, in that Member States conceded that the time had come for the United Nations to re-examine its own machinery and procedures dealing with issues concerning human rights. As some developed countries move away from the hitherto narrow and traditional definition of human rights, we feel that we have secured general acceptance of the fact that the two categories or concepts of human rights-one which places emphasis on civil and political rights, and the other on economic, social and cultural rights\u2014must be viewed as indivisible and interdependent.\n336.\tMy own Government is extremely proud of our internal and external policies, which are designed to ensure that all people enjoy the basic social and economic conditions which can make possible their fullest enjoyment of human rights.\n337.\tThe past year has been a period of particularly intensive activity in the field of economic and social affair ;. This level of activity was compelled by the very serious global problems which have become more complex and intractable. The dimensions of the problems facing us and the implications for subsequent generations transcend the man-made boundaries between the rich and the poor of our world. Central to our efforts to resolve these problems must be the unqualified objective of the establishment of world peace and economic growth. We cannot attain this objective without a common understanding of, and commitment to, the new world economic structures and relationships which must be established.\n338.\tThere has been in recent times a marked contrast between the amount of discussion on economic issues and the expressions of grave concern in all quarters on the one hand, and the very limited extent of real agreement and constructive action to deal with them on the other.\n339.\tThis situation is most evident where the dialogue and negotiations on the New International Economic Order are concerned. We have reached a point of near stagnation in these issues-a dangerous state of inaction which could have the most serious consequences for the international community. The record of all our .efforts over the past four years and the very United outcome of all the various discussions and negotiations indicate beyond a doubt that we have not yet come to the point of full and realistic negotiation.\n340.\tMy country has the highest confidence in the United Nations system; no other institution has its credibility or the capability to take and to implement decisions designed to achieve economic justice in the relations between all countries. It was this conviction which underlay our efforts at the last regular session to set up the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174. The Committee on the New International Economic Order was established against the background of the determination to place the dialogue on this issue firmly within the United Nations system and to fashion a forum which would be capable of ensuring effective discussion and negotiation.\n341.\tWe are deeply disappointed that that Committee has not been able to carry out its vital tasks. However, the recent meetings of the Committee may have demonstrated that we have come closer to facing the facts about the necessary process of meaningful discussion and the search for agreement on concrete issues. I believe that this is a view which is shared by virtually all who participated in those meetings. If this is so, we might indeed have achieved an important advance. It is well that this should be so, for none of us have any options in this matter. We must move forward and face the requirements and pressures which will inevitably be involved in the process of resolving issues, no matter how difficult. To fail to do so would be to precipitate a serious deterioration in international relations and to be guilty of gross neglect in the face of grave problems.\n342.\tFollowing the break down of those meetings, reactions throughout the capitals of the third world and within the industrialized countries for the most part have indicated concern for the future of the negotiations. This provides a basis for the hope that our efforts to establish a realistic framework within which we can proceed will be productive.\n343.\tRecent statements suggest a narrowing of the gap in regard to the function of the Committee. The issue, however, remains one of substance and not of procedure. This Assembly as the supreme decision-making body of the United Nations must now proceed to clear the air once and for all, so that the Committee can exercise unquestioned competence in the performance of its task.\n344.\tTi e serious state of the global economy and the requirements of international co-operation and equity call for urgent, specific and concrete action, particularly in respect of issues that have been the subject of discussion and that relate to the establishment of the New International Economic Order. Such action would begin to dispel the growing conviction on the part of developing countries of the determination of some industrialized countries to stand in the way of the movement towards the restructuring of the global economic system.\n345.\tIt would help to remove the feeling of helplessness that appears to have infected so many in the face of critical national and global economic difficulties. The opportunity for such action exists. The proposed resumption of the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities, in November this year, provides the opportunity for a major boost to the international community. In this context we note with satisfaction the efforts of the Secretary-General of UNCTAD in seeking to harmonize the position of the developing and developed countries on the objectives and structure of the common fund. The gravity of the problems relating to commodity trade is now clear to the international community, and there is growing recognition of the fact that urgent action needs to be taken to resolve them. This underscores the need for parallel movement on the Integrated Programme for Commodities. It is hoped, therefore, that agreement can now be reached on the common fund before the end of this year.\n346.\tThe problems of the indebtedness of the developing countries have serious implications for both developed and developing countries. It is our hope that the understandings reached on debt questions at the ministerial meeting of the Trade and Development Board last March will chart the way for progress in the negotiations. We welcome the actions which have been taken by a number of industrialized countries in cancelling official debts of the least developed and certain other developing countries. It is hoped that the further negotiations to be conducted in UNCTAD will conclude arrangements for alleviating the massive debt problems of developing countries. Such action would increase the capability of developing countries to deal with their problems of national development and international participation.\n347.\tAnother area calling for particular action that would have a dynamic effect in material terms is the transfer of resources.\n348.\tWe cannot at this General Assembly ignore the fact that, since our last meeting, official development assistance flows, which have remained well below the internationally established target, have actually declined in real terms as a percentage of the combined gross national product over the last 12 months.\n349.\tWe are convinced that means must be found of making the activities of the IMF and the World Bank accord more closely with our development needs as set out in the relevant provisions of the proposals for the New International Economic Order.\n350.\tAt the same time, it is right that the movement that has taken place in some areas should be acknowledged. The outcome of the recent United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held in Buenos Aires, has brought some much needed faith in the prospects of co-operation in the international economic sphere. But technical co-operation among developing countries is not a new phenomenon. It is not a new dimension in international co-operation for development, and it is not the breakthrough in North-South relations that some would like to suggest. Technical co-operation among developing countries is in essence an activity of the developing countries for the creation and development of their reliance on each other and for their national self- reliance. To be sure, it will need the enlightened support of the developed countries if it is going to realize its potential; and it becomes of interest to the developed countries in so far as the United Nations machinery is to be used as an integral part of the whole mechanism for making technical co-operation among developing countries operational, as indeed it must. The developed countries demonstrated in Buenos Aires a willingness to co-operate in these few areas.\n351.\tEnergy remains too important an issue in the .international development process for us to continue to\nignore it. As my delegation pointed out last year,  there is a need for effective conservation; there is a need to intensify the search for new conventional energy sources, as well as a need for intensive research into solar, wind and other renewable forms of energy. This must be done within a framework that will allow the benefits of such research to be accessible to the energy-deficient developing countries in order to finance the high-risk and high-cost investment necessary for energy exploration. It is in this context that my Government supports the initiatives that have been taken for an international conference on new and renewable sources of energy. I find it difficult to believe that a co-operative effort by ail participants in the United Nations system will not provide logical and effective solutions for the satisfaction of all these needs, bearing particularly in mind the crucial relationship that exists between energy and development.\n352.\tMy Government attaches the greatest significance to the negotiations being conducted in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. We see this Conference as an integral part of the challenge to the international community in the creation of the New International Economic Order. We are committed to the realization of the establishment of an international sea-bed authority that would regulate the exploration and exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction as the common heritage of mankind.\n353.\tThe declaration of principles adopted by the United Nations on 17 December 1970 [resolution 2749 (XXV)], consecrating this common heritage to be utilized taking into particular consideration the interests and needs of developing countries, cannot be allowed remain an idle dream. Considerable time and effort, at great expense and sacrifice to developing countries, have been devoted to this Conference, and it is generally recognized by participants in the negotiations that much of the difficult and intricate work for the completion of a comprehensive treaty, as mandated by the General Assembly, has already been accomplished.\n354.\tThe Jamaican Government therefore views with the greatest concern the taking of unilateral action for the exploitation of these resources in the midst of these negotiations. It must be clear that the consequences of any such action would seriously undermine the future conduct of the negotiations and prejudice their successful conclusion.\n355.\tMy Government therefore appeals to all those States which have proposed and are contemplating unilateral action to think again and to refrain from unilateral action, so that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea may have every chance of successfully concluding its work within a reasonable time.\n356.\tThere has been a gradual if somewhat reluctant acceptance in some quarters of the fact that the institutional machinery available to the international community is in important respects inadequate to serve its needs, and particularly the developmental needs of the developing countries.\n357.\tAction is now under way in the United Nations system to restructure its social and economic sectors along the lines agreed on at the last General Assembly [resolution 32(197]. My delegation views with satisfaction the appointment of the Director-General for Development and International Economic Co-operation, a position which we, along with other developing countries, see as most necessary. We trust that this office and the eminent official who heads it will be provided with the scope and the resources necessary to enable them to fulfil their crucial role.\n358.\tDuring the last regular session of the General Assembly many developing countries, including my own, played an active part and indicated in clear terms their view that the restructuring exercise had to be closely related to the establishment of the New International Economic Order. It is our belief that for the current restructuring to be judged effective it must enable the United Nations system to make a truly significant contribution to the achievement of the New International Economic Order. The primacy of the General Assembly, as the highest forum in which all matters of significance are finally deliberated upon, remains a crucial requirement.\n359.\tJamaica views with concern what appears to be renewed efforts by some major Powers to re-establish and to consolidate neo-colonial relationships in Africa. But what the history of the anti-colonial struggles in Africa, and particularly those of this decade has shown, is a profound intolerance of imperialist domination and the courage, the capacity and the resolve to act against such domination. This is a time for the greatest unity of all those forces committed to the political and economic emancipation of Africa.\n360.\tThe initiative of detente in Europe has been one of the few encouraging signs that the major Powers are inclined to co-operate to reduce tensions.\n361.\tYet such co-operation remains confined to Europe while the extra-European rivalries of those same Powers are constantly generating new tensions in other areas of the world, particularly in Africa.\n362.\tThe limited progress made in the field of disarmament, and the need to confront this problem with a determined sense of urgency was recognized in the holding of the tenth special session on disarmament. The intensive preparations and the high level of representation encouraged expectations that a real breakthrough would be achieved in a collective effort to halt and reverse the arms race. In several ways the results of the session did not match the hopes and expectations of most of us. In our view, a more concrete and substantive programme of action, especially with regard to nuclear disarmament, would have provided greater assurance of real progress. As it was, the studied ambiguity of some of the crucial paragraphs of the Programme of Action adopted [resolution S-10/2, sect. Ill] indicated the lack -of genuine compromise and the existence of limited commitment.\n363.\tWe feel, however, that the adoption of a consensus document was a real achievement. The issue now ;s whether the declared intentions contained in the Final Document will be translated into action. \n364.\tRemoving the threat of nuclear war should now begin by the termination of the testing of nuclear weapons as the first step towards nuclear disarmament and over-all progress towards the achievement of general and complete disarmament. The process should begin without delay.\n365.\tWe stress once again that the continuation of present trends in the escalation of the arms race jeopardizes peace and security and is wasteful of resources now urgently needed for development. In this regard we welcome the attention given to this area in the deliberations of the special session and look forward to the adoption of effective measures which would lead to the transfer of resources from the wasteful purpose of arms accumulation to the alleviation of poverty and the promotion of economic well-being.\n366.\tWhen the very existence of mankind is at stake only a determined application of political will can resolve seemingly intractable problems. The world has learned this from the recent experience in our own region, when mutual understanding and political will produced the Panama Canal Treaties. At the fifteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU in Khartoum and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries in Belgrade explosive issues were defused through an exemplary display of international goodwill.\n367.\tMy Government hopes that a similar situation of accommodation will emerge in the Middle East, where one of the longest-standing and most complex international problems still faces the world community. A durable settlement requires from the parties involved at the very least mutual recognition of and respect for each other's legitimate aspirations. This means above all recognition of the Palestinian people's right to their own homeland, Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories and recognition of the right of the State of Israel to exist.\n368.\tAlthough the basic requirements of a Middle East settlement are perfectly well known, some would still wish to believe that a settlement can be attained without all these issues being squarely faced. That cannot be done. Moreover, it is equally apparent that, despite courageous individual initiatives, no solution will be attained without the participation of all concerned parties in the negotiations, and the support of the international community as a whole.\n369.\tJamaica continues to regard Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) as providing the indispensable framework for a settlement of the dispute. Any agreement that does not accord with the principles in those resolutions cannot secure a lasting peace in the region.\n370.\tAnother area of concern is the continuing stalemate in Cyprus. The United Nations resolutions are still unheeded and foreign occupation continues. The situation in Cyprus is rapidly becoming a model of the failure of the international community to translate its decisions into positive action. Renewed efforts at meaningful dialogue are urgently required if the lines drawn within the country are not to become fixed in a permanent form.\n371.\tIt remains a matter of grave concern to us that despite the efforts of the international community, Belize has not been able to achieve its independence. It is intolerable that the people of that country should have for so long been denied the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination. The advance of Belize to a secure independence with full territorial integrity is long overdue.\n402. We deplore the external pressures and threats to which Belize has been subjected and which have constituted the principal obstacle to that country's early accession to independence. We urge the Members of this Organization, the colonial Power and the other parties involved, to seize the opportunity now to ensure that the resolutions adopted over the past years on the issue are speedily implemented.\n403.. There is no more indictable failure in the sphere of international co-operation than our inability to end that most odious system of human and racial degradation which is apartheid. The evil of racist oppression in South Africa is evident to every decent individual: only the brutish can deny the duty of the international community to eradicate it. But instead, co-operation between South Africa and certain major interests has contributed to intensifying the oppression of blacks in South Africa.\n404.\tLet those who have it in their power to change the system now recognize that only a concerted and uncompromising effort will remove the disgrace of racist oppression in South Africa.\n405.\tJamaica views the present situation in southern Africa as one of the utmost gravity. Encouraging signs that international co-operation was achieving some progress in Namibia and in Zimbabwe are fast disappearing.\n406.\tWe meet while the storm clouds gather even more menacingly, for what do we find? We find, after another year of diplomatic efforts on the part of some members of the international community, after assurances of the viability of the \\\"internal settlement\\\", after more than a decade of appeasement and compromise \u2014 after all this\u2014that the people of Zimbabwe are faced today not with the promise of a just and lasting peace but with the growing prospect of a terrible conflict.\n407.\tMy delegation joins in the call for a meeting of all interested political groupings. We are equally concerned at the long delay in arriving at a solution. In the meantime, the illegal minority regime continues to perpetrate aggression not only against the people of Zimbabwe, but also against neighbouring States. The recent attack on Mozambique is but one more incident in a long series of events in which the racist minority regime-has tried to intimidate its neighbours, to deter them from assisting their brothers in Zimbabwe and to widen the scope of the conflict.\n408.\tThe international community can delay no longer. It must, before it is too late, , find the moral and political courage necessary to bring to bear that kind of international pressure which the racist regimes cannot resist.\n409.\tIn the absence of concrete progress towards a solution, my country will continue to give its unqualified support to the armed struggle against racist tyranny. We wish to see a negotiated settlement, but we will not be fellow travellers with injustice., A just settlement in Zimbabwe must be Uncompromisingly based upon a complete and absolute end to minority tyranny and the full accession to power of the majority of the people of the Territory.\n410.\tAt the same time that our concern over the course of events in Rhodesia is growing by the day, we are faced with the calamitous developments in Namibia. We welcomed the holding of the ninth special session of the General Assembly on Namibia earlier this year, the acceptance by the Security Council of the Western plan and the despatch by the Secretary-General of his Special Representative to the troubled area. Now the despicable South African regime has once again shattered the hopes of those who had assumed that such a system could operate with integrity.\n411.\tThe United Nations has the mandate and the obligation to ensure the effective implementation of its- decisions on Namibia. Now, more than ever, an overriding responsibility rests with the major Powers to enforce full South African compliance with the United Nations plan for Namibian independence in such a way as to guarantee the rights of effective majority rule of the Namibian people. Their action on the side of justice can be decisive.\n412.\tThe announcement that the Pretoria regime will go ahead with its plans for an election in Namibia without United Nations supervision and control is one more instance of its brazen and calculated defiance of the United Nations. But, on reflection, why should not South Africa continue to hurl its defiance at the United Nations? For what has been the response of the United Nations, particularly the Security Council? Merely to administer the proverbial \\\"slap on the wrist\\\" to South Africa and to agree to meet again in the event of further acts of violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbours. What else does South Africa need to do for some of the permanent members of the Security Council to see the necessity of the imposition of sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter?\n413.\tMy delegation remains firmly convinced that the people of Namibia must be allowed to determine their own future; that free elections with the participation of SWAPO should be held under the supervision and control of the United Nations; that South African intimidation must be eliminated; and, above all, that Namibia must proceed to independence with its territorial integrity intact. All this and more is long overdue. The total isolation of the South African regime should be effectively pursued now.\n414.\tOne important step would be the early finalization of an international convention against apartheid in sports, in accordance with the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly.\n415.\tIn dealing with various issues, I have referred to the need to maintain peace and security in the world. Let me say now that, in our view, peace cannot be merely the absence of military conflict, nor can it be just an interlude between wars. Peace, to be real, must provide for the harmonious growth and development of peoples\u2014 politically, socially, culturally, economically\u2014and it must be universal and indivisible. It cannot be achieved in an atmosphere of either political or economic domination.\n416.\tThe issues facing this Assembly, in both the political and the economic sphere, have never been more grave or more threatening and the need to find solutions has never been more urgent. The key to those solutions is a greater commitment to international co-operation, economic justice and peace. Is it too much to hope that this thirty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations will help the world to find that key?\n\n"

I wish you every success in performing the task of this high office and assure you that my country's delegation will, as it has always done, take a positive and productive part in the work of the Assembly in order to achieve the aims it stands for.\n77.\tI am also pleased to express our appreciation of the efforts made by your predecessor, Mr. Mojsov, to bring to a successful conclusion the debate on many of the international issues dealt with by ? General Assembly during its last session.\n78.\tIn the name of my Government, the delegation of the Iraqi Republic is happy to welcome the State of Solomon Islands as a new Member of the United Nations. In extending our warmest congratulations to it on winning its freedom and -independence, we hope that it will contribute, together with the countries of the third world, to the laying down of foundations of security, peace and progress in the world.\n79.\tThe Iraqi people and the political leadership of the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party are following with great interest the development of world events and their impact on the aspirations of peoples to peace and security and the achievement of progress and well-being for all. I should like to review with the Assembly in all frankness our understanding in Iraq of the present international situation and our assessment of it, so that we may, with other honest people, shed light on the negative aspects which impede the maintenance of peace and democracy in the world, in the hope that we may also succeed in diagnosing their causes.\n80.\tWe are bitterly disappointed at seeing before us so many artificially created causes of the increase of international tension and conflict. These manifestations are among the most distinctive features that have, particularly in the past year, dominated international relations to such an extent that they have heightened tension among the centres of polarization, sharpened the aggressive intent of colonial forces and hardened their opposition to peoples' aspirations to freedom and progress, thus thwarting their hopes for security and stability throughout the world and frustrating their efforts to build a new order of international relations based on equality and ritual respect for sovereignty.\n81.\tDuring recent years the world has witnessed many cases of flagrant injustice, tyranny and the violation of justice by the imperialist forces, which have always pretended to be concerned with security and peace and claimed to have respect for the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations and the protection of human rights. However, events have proved that the pretentious calls of the imperialist forces are no more than hollow claims and meaningless words, as they have given no proof of their seriousness or sincerity. They have disregarded United Nations resolutions and never endeavoured to implement them or to rid international relations of manifestations of tyranny, subjugation and inequality. Historically, these manifestations have proved to be a product of the same imperialism, which views international issues in such a way as to secure its own ends, always at the expense of the poor and oppressed nations.\n82.\tWhat accentuates our feeling of disappointment is the fact that such cases of injustice do not actually seem to help to promote political consciousness among peoples or move them enough to support the legitimate struggle of others. The imperialist forces are doing their utmost to tame international public opinion so that ultimately their policies may be implicitly accepted, together with all their pretexts for domination, oppression, escalation of armaments and disruption of governments. All this is achieved through the material strength and powerful mass media at their disposal.\n83.\tWhereas it was hoped that the United Nations would become a deterrent for aggression, injustice and domination and an effective instrument responsive .o the hopes and aspirations of the peoples for peace and justice through the implementation of its resolutions, the world Organization has largely failed m performing its role and defending the principles of its Charter. It has also failed to implement most of its resolutions, particularly those which are of great importance and of direct bearing on the interests of nations. It has turned out to be a mere instrument for moral influence rather than an effective means of establishing a new order of world relations as it was originally conceived.\n84.\tExamples of flagrant violations of justice which mark international relations are numerous and fraught with danger for future peace and progress in the world. Undoubtedly, the most distinctive of these are the practices of racism and apartheid. The imperialists were the first to call for a \\\"divide and rule\\\" policy; they were the first to sow the seeds of racism. By that policy they guaranteed their superiority over the indigenous populations of the colonies and spread their economic domination. They used as pretexts the \\\"civilizing\\\" of backward peoples, the maintenance of balance of power, or the satisfaction of the requirements of world strategy, whichever was appropriate, all for the sake of actually preserving the laws and regulations which granted them a superior status, installed them as guardians of other peoples and gave them a free hand in the plunder of wealth and in the practice of exploitation as well as the perpetuation of colonization.\n85.\tWhile some of them pretend to have sympathy with the struggles of peoples against racism and apartheid, they do not hesitate to develop and strengthen their relations with racist regimes in various political, economic, diplomatic, military, informational and cultural spheres, as well as in the sphere of atomic collaboration and nuclear know-how. Furthermore, they refrain from acceding to such international instruments adopted under United Nations auspices, as the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [resolution 3068 (XXVIII)], and the International Covenant on Civil and\\\" Political Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI)], using for this purpose a variety of false \\\"legal\\\" arguments.\n86.\tThe imperialists are doing everything to justify their continued relations with the racist regimes and their huge economic investments in their countries.\n87.\tMany United Nations Members may recall that the United States Congress only recently considered lifting the economic embargo imposed on racist Rhodesia. It is a well-known fact that this ban was imposed in accordance with a binding resolution adopted by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter because of the continued imperialist and racist policy which was and still is pursued by Ian Smith's regime against the people of Zimbabwe, who struggle courageously to achieve freedom and independence and who make great sacrifices to that end. It is also a well-known fact that certain Western Powers which are permanent members of the Security Council have vetoed a suggestion that economic sanctions be imposed on the racist regime in South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter, because the monopolies and multinational corporations of those Powers oppose the ban and are, through racism, actively enhancing\\\" their interests and strengthening their investments which constitute the backbone of the economies of the racist regimes. There are some who confirm the existence of a connexion and co-operation between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Pretoria regime in a number of spheres.\n88.\tIt is deeply regrettable that the group of nine Western countries and a number of its supporters should have taken a negative stand in the world Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, which was held under United .Nations auspices in Geneva last August. That stand was taken because the Conference condemned the existing and developing relations between the Zionist entity and the racist regime in South Africa. The nine Western countries and some of their allies protested against this condemnation, declaring their non-compliance with the resultant decisions of the Conference, and withdrew from its closing meeting. Prior to that they had threatened to walk out if the final declaration contained any reference to the Palestinian people and to the tragedy whereby that people has been prevented from exercising its right to self- determination on its own soil, and whereby hundreds of thousands of its children have been uprooted, prevented from returning to their homeland and subjected to various practices of racial discrimination, with the result that they are denied their basic human rights.\n89.\tAt the level of international economic relations, a quick review of the figures used by the United Nations in this connexion will expose imperialist exploitation and its responsibility for the inhuman conditions in which the peoples of the third world are living. Seventy per cent of the world's population lives in the third world, yet the gross income of the third world (including that of the oil- producing countries) does not exceed 30 per cent of the world's income. In 1975 the industrial production of the third world did not exceed 10.3 per cent of the world's industrial production. Seven hundred and fifty million people in the third world are living below the subsistence level defined by the International Bank, that is with a per capita income of less than $75 a year. Half of the third-world's population has not received any education, while two thirds of its children can find no room in schools. In addition to those who are starving, more than 1 billion people are suffering from chronic under nourishment.\n90.\tThis situation is worsening from year to year. Thus, the third world's exports in 1960 represented 21.4 per cent of the world's over-all exports. Their decline continued until they represented only 18.1 per cent in 1973. The natural consequence of this is the continuous, and even increasing, deficit in the balance of payments of the developing countries, which hinders the development required.\n91.\tAll this is not a matter of bad luck. Backwardness and progress, riches and poverty are basic elements of the international economic structure, which was built by the European and American capitalists and which they try very hard to maintain. It is imperialism which has forced the third world to be a market for Western products and has imposed on it one single function, namely the exportation of raw materials.\n92  Therefore, it is not surprising that raw materials form the main part of the third world's exports: 81.5 per cent in 1961 and 75.4 per cent in 1972. In certain countries, especially those producing oil, that figure may rise to 100 per cent. This painful fact is linked to another one, namely, that 75.2 per cent of the West's industrial need for raw materials is met from the third world.\n93. Here, too, the inequity of the world's economic conditions is evident. The prices of raw materials are low and do not match the rise in the prices of manufactured goods imported by the developing countries from the industrialized West. The deterioration in terms of trade at the expense of the developing countries continued in the 1950s and the 1960s. In other words, with the fall of the old colonial system, the situation in the countries producing raw materials worsened more and more as neocolonialism tended basically to reduce the prices of raw materials and to deplete the natural wealth of developing countries. No one can deny any longer that the sources of many raw materials are liable to exhaustion by the end of this century if they continue to be drained at the present rate.\n94.\tThe capitalist Powers have persistently resisted raising the prices of raw materials. Moreover, demand in the world raw-materials market is dominated by a few multinational corporations of great economic experience. On the other hand, the developing countries enter the market individually and are unable to affect selling prices.\n95.\tIn addition, the capitalist industrialized countries do not hesitate to continue raising the prices of commodities produced in the West. The truth about inflation and its importation into the developing countries is common knowledge. United Nations figures reveal that from 1968 to June 1974 the rise in the prices of goods imported from the industrialized West by the developing world was about 224.4 per cent.\n96.\tPrinciples of justice demand that the imperialist Powers, more than any other, be bound to offer to the countries aspiring to development part of the national wealth that once belonged to them and was plundered when it was easily and readily available to satisfy the greed of foreign exploiters. We notice with surprise that the industrialized Powers have not complied with the General Assembly's resolution calling upon them to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for development aid [resolution 2626 (XX)]. For example, the United States cut down this percentage from 0.53 in 1960 to 0.49 in 1965, and then to 0.21 in 1974. It is quite obvious that a large part of this aid is designed to be used as an instrument for imposing particular stands on certain countries. Another part of this aid, needless to say, is of an aggressive military nature. It is sufficient in this connexion to recall that the largest share of this aid goes to the Zionist entity.\n97.\tThe reactionary circles in the industrialized West have launched a campaign against the States members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC], alleging that they are not contributing adequately towards the development of the third-world countries. Suffice it to mention here that the aid provided by the OPEC States in 1974 was 8.2 per cent of their gross national product and 12.1 per cent of their oil revenues. We are looking forward to making further contributions, so necessary for the distribution of development more evenly throughout the world.\n98.\tThis bleak picture of international economic relations cannot but forebode the gravest dangers, because these relations are neither just nor equal. It is the duty of the third-world States, the socialist States and the progressive forces in the capitalist West to struggle together to establish a new world economic order on foundations that are more balanced and just.\n99.\tIraq has adhered to a consistent policy with regard to the Palestinian question based-on the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter. The Zionist entity has been established in Palestine as a result of the collusion of world Zionist forces with Western imperialism for the fulfilment of the aim of Zionism-namely, the ingathering of the world's Jews and the building of their purely Jewish State. Though such action was incompatible with the inalienable rights of the Palestinian Arabs, the actual owners of the land of Palestine, Western imperialist forces ignored the existence of Arabs in Palestine and facilitated the plot of Zionist settlement colonialization in order to consolidate the imperialist presence in Arab countries, safeguard Western economic interests and plunder the national wealth of the Arab nation.\n100.\tThe whole Arab nation, and the Palestinian people in particular, have resisted the Zionist invasion of Palestine. To this end, the Palestinian people have made the biggest material and human sacrifices. In this connexion, I should like to mention the 1936 revolution, during which the Palestinians, who then numbered 1 million, had more than 5,000 killed and 15,000 injured.\n101.\tWith the recession of the imperialist influence in the General Assembly of the United Nations and with the understanding by world public opinion of the truth about the Palestinian question and what is being committed by Zionists and imperialist Powers in Palestine, the General Assembly was able in 1974 to adopt its well-known resolution 3236 (XXIX) recognizing the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and their right to self- determination on their land. Meanwhile, the Zionist entity has adopted a negative and hostile attitude towards the majority of United Nations resolutions. It has so far ignored more than 220 resolutions adopted by the United Nations and its agencies. It is worth mentioning here that the admission to United Nations membership of the Zionist entity was made conditional on its acceptance of resolution 194(111) of 1948, which provides in paragraph 11 for the return of the Palestinian refugees to their homeland. This was ignored by the Tel Aviv racist regime, which also refused to allow members of the United Nations Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories to fulfil their task.\n102.\tAs an idea, a movement and a State, Zionism has in actual practice embodied a racist, colonialist and expansionist model. Zionist thought, which calls for Jewish exclusivity and purity, stresses the necessity of dissociating Jews from any society they live in and rejects a Jew's loyalty to any but the Zionist State.\n103.\tTo establish this \\\"State\\\", Zionism has persisted in its endeavours to induce the Jews of the world to emigrate to Palestine and to empty that country of its Arab population, depriving them of their rights by a variety of methods which are a mixture of deception and terror. After the emergence of the \\\"State\\\", Zionism centred its racism and arrogance on Arab Palestinians, Christians and Moslems alike, enforcing a series of laws and measures aimed at driving them out, dispossessing them of their land and preventing their return. Witness, for example, the 1950 Law of Return, the Absentee Property Law and the Emergency Law. The Zionist repressive system ensures that Arab inhabitants will always be treated as third-class citizens.\n104.\tEstablishing itself as a \\\"State\\\", Zionism adopted an expansionist policy. It is remarkable that it is only in this Zionist \\\"State\\\" that basic laws do not draw any fixed border lines for the land, but leave that to the material and military capability of the Zionists. So in 1948 the area of the Zionist entity expanded by 50 per cent over that originally allocated to it by the United Nations partition resolution [resolution 181 (II)]. With the 1956 aggression against Egypt and, later, the 1967 aggression, the territories occupied by the Zionist entity became three times as large as those already occupied.\n105.\tUnited Nations resolution 3379 (XXX), condemning Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination, proves a fact that has been a source of suffering for the Palestinian people. The attempts made by certain Western and imperialist circles to contain that resolution reconfirm the alliance between racist Zionism and Western imperialism, which is of the same nature as the alliance between those circles and the racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia.\n106.\tWhen we Arabs express such fears regarding the Zionist entity and the Zionist movement, we do so as a result of long and bitter experience, which has convinced us that Zionism is an aggressive movement unable to content itself with a just and real peace. It is a movement that seeks to impose surrender on the peoples of the region by advanced military means. To maintain its military superiority, the Zionist entity began an over-all militarization of Zionist society and the development of the arms industry to such an extent that it has now become one of the few places in the world where arms production is in certain respects in excess of its own needs. Consequently, it exports arms to many countries. Besides, this entity gets from the United States, through various ways, all that it cannot afford to produce. American military aid to Tel Aviv for this year is estimated at $1 billion, in addition to financial aid of $785 million through the external aid programme. It is now an open secret that Tel Aviv is trying to possess an arsenal of nuclear weapons. The refusal of the Zionist entity to sign the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is but a confirmation of this fact. May I in this connexion refer to the study submitted by our delegation during the special session on disarmament. \n107.\tEver since 1973 the world has been hearing of diplomatic efforts made by American and other circles for bringing about a so-called \\\"peace settlement of the Middle East crisis\\\". Now, five years later, a pause for critical contemplation is in order. -\n108.\tFirst, I should like to emphasize that our people, having suffered from social and. economic backwardness for centuries, badly needs a real peace that will avail it of the opportunities for construction and progress. Before Zionist aggression was forced upon us, our people, with all its various communities and minorities, used to live in perfect peace and harmony.\n109.\tAny settlement which fails to deal with the crux of the question, which is precisely the right of the Palestinian people to return to its homeland and to exercise its inalienable rights, including the right to self-determination on its national soil, will remain completely unrealistic, and the chances of success will be very slim indeed.\n110.\tThe political developments of the attempts at the so-called comprehensive settlement seem to form a negative graph which is steadily getting further away from the heart of the problem. This may be explained by the fact that\nSO\nSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967) has been adopted as a basis for settlement. But after a careful consideration we note that this resolution is actually silent on the Palestinian people and its inalienable national rights.\n111.\tWhen some of the circles concerned acclaimed Washington's so-called shift towards recognizing the Palestinian element as one of the main elements in the Middle East question, we found' that the United States actual concept of the Palestinian role did not in practice mean enabling it to exercise its right to self-determination.\n112.\tMoreover, to the United States administration the fate of the occupied Palestinian territories in the event of an Israeli withdrawal is no longer a Palestinian concern, let alone an Arab one. It will be a matter subject to Israeli approval. Furthermore, to Washington, an Israeli withdrawal no longer means a complete withdrawal in accordance with the principle of the inadmissibility of acquisition of territories by force. In keeping with the Israeli position, the American attitude has gone so far as to deprive the Palestinians of the right to choose their own representatives. Whatever rights are left to the Palestinians have also been parcelled into periods over a long number of years during which-nay, even after which-Zionist occupation would be allowed to continue.\n113.\tIn return for the concessions made at the expense of the Palestinians and their just cause, Zionist intransigence is mounting and the Arab area is being driven into more political disruption and chaos. The Zionist entity has even allowed itself to embark on military intervention in Lebanon, thus obstructing the implementation of further United Nations resolutions and threatening the existence of a united and independent Lebanon.\n114.\tAny settlement based on the aforesaid grounds is in fact a call for the liquidation of Palestinian existence. The results of the Camp David meetings confirmed this trend, and went even further by calling for a separate settlement between the racist regime of Tel Aviv and the Sadat regime. On the Palestinian level, the conference ignored the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including its right to self-determination as set forth in United Nations General Assembly resolutions.\nUS. The Camp David accords denied the Palestinians unity and sovereignty over their territory, and divided them into inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza, on the one hand, and refugees, on the other.\n116.\tThe inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza were accorded only so-called self-rule, with elements alien to the Palestinians. Furthermore, the Zionist entity would maintain permanent forces of occupation in the area and all the affairs of the area would be subject to Zionist governmental approval. The rest of the Palestinian people, who number almost 2 million, were, according to the conference, mere refugees, and their future was left to be decided later by Begin and Sadat, in contravention of their right to return to their land. In addition, the conference remained silent on the future of occupied Arab Jerusalem and the Golan.\n117.\tThe Camp David agreements constitute the framework for a humiliating capitulation treaty, to which no people could agree. Iraq, as a part of the Arab nation, emphatically rejects it. In our statements before this Assembly we have already stressed a number of principles and measures which we still regard as indispensable for a discussion of the question of Palestine and the Middle East situation.\t\n118.\tFirst, the Zionist entity occupied territories belonging to three Arab States in violation of all international rules and customs and of many United Nations resolutions, the most important of them being that on the inadmissibility of the acquisition' of territories by invasion of force. Consequently, the United Nations and its Members should assume their responsibility and bring about the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of Zionist forces from all the occupied territories without giving the occupying Power any political advantage, as otherwise it would be rewarding the aggressor for its aggression.\n119.\tSecondly, the United Nations constitutes the natural and proper framework for the discussion of the Palestinian question in the presence of the representatives of the Palestinian people, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX). The attempt made by certain parties to frustrate the resolution of the world Organization and to settle the issue unilaterally through conferences will not help the search for a just and lasting peace.\n120.\tThirdly, any material and, in particular, military support to Tel Aviv's racist regime would certainly increase the tension and prolong the conflict in the Arab region, which in turn would constitute a threat to international peace und security. The danger of the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East is no longer just imaginary. Various kinds of available evidence and information confirm Tel Aviv's intention to acquire and use those weapons. It is also necessary to take speedy and serious steps to stop the increasing military and nuclear collaboration between Tel Aviv and Pretoria. The draft resolution on military and nuclear co-operation between Tel Aviv and Pretoria submitted to the special session on disarmament  would be suitable as a basis for a resolution to be adopted by the\n' General Assembly at its current session.\n121.\tFourthly, the occupied Arab territories are subject to a series of military, economic and social measures aimed at consolidating Zionist existence and creating a demographic reality which paves the way for the annexation of those territories. We call upon the United Nations and its specialized agencies to pay full attention to these dangerous manifestations and to prevent their escalation by drawing up economic, cultural and -health programmes that would support the Arab population in their occupied territories. In this regard we stress the necessity of enabling UNRWA to perform its task without curtailing its obligations.\n122.\tFifthly, the other aspect of Zionist practices in the occupied Arab territories is embodied in the continuance of Zionist immigration. Encouragement of immigration into Palestine by world Zionism and the latter's activities in that regard carry within them a twofold danger: the need for more land and consequently more expansion, which would lead to further wars, and the perpetuation of the displacement of the Palestinian people. We believe that the General Assembly should take the initiative in discussing this issue and adopting the necessary deterrent measures.\n123.\tWe call for the following action at the international level: first, the condemnation of all operations and the use or threat of force by the big Powers against third-world countries which nationalize foreign monopolies or which try to achieve fairer prices for their raw materials, and affirmation of the right of every State to nationalize foreign companies which extract or invest in its raw materials; secondly, the establishment of producer unions for every kind of raw material or group of similar raw materials extracted by third-world countries similar to OPEC, which, by ignoring the existing economic and social policies of its members, has emphasized the possibility of the necessary unity among third-world countries and consequently achieved for the first time relatively just prices; thirdly, the drawing up of practical formulas to link the prices of raw materials exported by third-world countries to those of the industrialized or manufactured products of the capitalist West; fourthly, the achievement of serious progress in the North-South dialogue on the basis of the resolutions of the sixth special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the development of raw materials and other General Assembly resolutions, in particular those of the sixth and seventh special sessions; fifthly, affirmation of the need to support the armed struggle of the militant peoples and consolidate the legitimacy of their struggle and to provide material and moral support to the liberation movements of the world, in this connexion calling for the implementation of United Nations resolutions relating to decolonization, the eradication of racial discrimination and the exercise by peoples of their right to self-determination; sixthly, strict control of the military embargo against racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia and prevention of the supply to them of weapons, ammunition and military expertise, particularly nuclear expertise, and the elimination of the danger of the use of mercenaries and support for the reactionary regimes; seventhly, affirmation of the need for participation by all United Nations States Members in all international agreements aimed at eradicating racial discrimination and segregation and for the application of the numerous resolutions adopted throughout the years to ensure the liquidation of those evils.\n"

We express our best wishes for his success as he presides over this important session.\n133.\tI also wish to compliment his predecessor, Ambassador Mojsov of Yugoslavia, on his record-breaking performance.\n134 The people of Malta welcome the admission of Solomon Islands and were glad to become a sponsor of the draft resolution by which another fellow developing-island country and member of the Commonwealth joined this world body.\n135.\tI respectfully pay homage to the many leading statesmen, spiritual and temporal, who were called away from the world's stage in the course of this year. Hundreds of millions mourn their memory, as also the memory of those who lost their lives in conflict or in natural disasters.\n136.\tIn some of the statements made so far, new proposals have been advanced. My delegation will express its considered reaction to those proposals when they are discussed in Committee; but in principle we can say that we favour those which have prospects of beneficial practical application, as well as those designed to reach the hearts and minds of men in the eternal quest for peace.\n137.\tI should like to compliment our indefatigable Secretary-General for the thoughtful analysis contained in his latest annual report, which clearly calls for detailed study. My delegation agrees with his observations and enthusiastically supports his conclusion that:\n\\\"We can, and must, develop a sense of human solidarity, finding practical expression in a strong family of international institutions, if our major international problems are to be contained and ultimately solved.\\\" [See A/33/1, sect. I.]\nThere is much food for thought in that objective. It stands the test of time, since it was the dream that inspired our founding fathers when they drew up the Charter. But are we now any nearer to reaching that elusive goal, and are we using the institutions we have available, and our collective resources, to the utmost of their potential?\n138.\tIn the view of my delegation, on the basis of the accumulated evidence of 33 years of experience, the answer to both these questions is negative. I must quite frankly say that, measured against what needs to be done, the performance rating of this Organization is poor. Its institutions are misused, at worst paralysed by inaction, at best dealing only marginally with the serious issues that face us.\n139.\tIt is true that this forum provides the opportunity for an essential dialogue of immense value in itself. It constitutes a reflection of present international opinion, and provides a portent of future events. It has produced countless recommendations on every single issue and repeated them often enough. The strenuous effort and escalating expenditure that go into the making of these recommendations, however, cannot indefinitely satisfy the hunger for tangible progress. Stated objectives must at some point actually be achieved in practice, instead of remaining, as our experience shows, illusory, theoretical and only capable of giving rise to endless debate; otherwise frustration and cynicism will eventually and inevitably erode our confidence The rumblings of discontent are becoming more and more insistent with each passing year. Neither this Organization nor the imperatives of peace can afford to ignore these messages much longer.\n140.\tA number of factors have contributed to this evident lack of progress; without doubt, the primary cause has been the inability of the major Powers, backed by their respective allies, to settle their differences, to lessen then- mutual suspicion or to abandon their inflexible competition in the pursuit of their conflicting objectives. As a result our Organization, which was predicated at the end of the Second World War on the notion of a mutuality of interests among the victorious Powers, so far has not been able to function as was foreseen.\n141.\tThat has been the visible pattern of the past. Why else would it have taken our Organization so long merely to acknowledge that the question of Palestine was one of the core issues in the Middle East problem, and why, as the Prime Minister of Jamaica reminded us so eloquently yesterday [30th meeting], should the shameful racialist policies in the southern part of Africa have existed for so long before the need for moral pressure and concerted political action was contemplated? Why should it have needed years of marathon discussion before the relatively simple question of a sufficiently representative platform to discuss disarmament issues was finally settled? And why has the accent of the past remained so much on division, when the trend towards unity has never been so manifest? These are only a few of the many questions that can be raised, questions to which our Organization, unfortunately, has not provided an adequate answer. On the contrary, the clouds of division and strife continue to hover menacingly over every single crisis area in which the interests of the major Powers are diametrically opposed-Cyprus, Lebanon, the Middle East, Korea and southern Africa in particular.\n142.\tOn the basis of this accumulated evidence, to expect change to come from the super-Powers themselves is not merely unrealistic; change from that quarter is a demonstrated improbability. The impetus for change is more likely to succeed if it comes from outside those Power blocs. This role fits the non-alignment movement. Practical results will require much time and strenuous and sustained effort; but ingrained attitudes have to be changed, and new initiatives pursued, if we wish to move forward.\n143.\tIt is now recognized that the problems we face in today's interdependent world have become of vital concern to the international community as a whole. They cannot remain perpetually unresolved, through a mere continuation of the negative attitudes of the past. These problems lend themselves much more readily to a solution when independent and objective recommendations are made which would not be detrimental to the interests of either one of the major Powers but would, on the contrary, at least attract their tacit acquiescence, preferably even their co-operation.\n144.\tHowever, the co-operation of the strong, when it is forthcoming, cannot be based on narrow, outdated conceptions of national interest or on the preservation of a status quo that denies fundamental rights and dignity to others. The strong must be prepared, in co-operation with the weak, at least to play a constructive role in the shaping of a new world order of peace, co-operation, social and economic progress, justice for the disadvantaged. This demands that collectively we also apply at vie international level the principles that professedly guide our internal policies. It requires that we strive, as an objective, to overcome, in broad terms, the political polarization between East and West, and to prevent the economic polarization between North and South.\n145.\tAdmittedly, this is a difficult, long-term process, which demands as a corollary deliberate planning and adequate resource allocation. However, in the final analysis we have no rational alternative, because with today's weapon systems, unless we are masters of change, we run a serious risk of falling victims to chance.\n146.\tMy own Government sees no future in a world recklessly squandering its scanty resources in a revolting race for lethal weapons, which could destroy civilization, when at the same time 40 per cent of the world's population leads a miserable existence with lower than acceptable levels of nutrition, sanitation and education. The prevalent, overriding concern in the world today is for peaceful social and economic progress; any contrary activities will not in the long run attract public support in democratic societies.\n147.\tIf, gradually but surely, our present attitudes can be sublimated and oriented in a more positive direction, what then will be needed is a reordering of our priorities, a deliberate, planned reallocation of scarce intellectual and material resources. This can be done in the political sphere if we take pragmatic and parallel action by concentrating also on what unites us rather than constantly labouring and being paralysed by what divides us.\n148.\tThe record of performance in connexion with the traditional problems of economic development is also indifferent. My delegation is concerned not only at the slow pace of progress but also at the direction that it seems to be taking. One common element stands out with remarkable clarity: the reluctance of the major developed countries to embark enthusiastically on a sincere appraisal of the imperatives for the new economic order. Whatever limited progress is achieved is constrained by the inhibitions of an obsolete and outdated order: partial and isolated arrangements, donor-recipient relationships and glaring institutional deficiencies. The failure to reach agreement even on the functions of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, usually referred to as the Committee of the Whole, is a fundamental indication of the absence of a political will in the developed countries to face up to the enormous dimensions of what is required.\n149.\tThe Maltese delegation has actively involved itself in the dialogue. Our deep conviction of the primary role of the United Nations in international economic and social issues is of long standing. We have been foremost among those seeking to ensure that the system is adequately equipped, financially and institutionally, to undertake its responsibilities in these sectors. Our participation in the restructuring negotiations was motivated by this objective. There is still much that needs to be done even in this administrative approach, certainly on such matters as the streamlining of bodies and institutions, the avoidance of overlapping activities and the elimination of unnecessary expenditure, but also, which is of more importance, on such matters as the need for the various secretariats within the system - particularly here at Headquarters to be more attuned to the needs and objectives of the developing countries.\n150.\tIn recent years we have also taken direct initiatives in chosen sectors of special concern to us. As a developing island country lacking in natural resources, Malta has piloted various resolutions, both in UNCTAD and in the General Assembly, calling attention \\\"to  the particular problems of this category of developing country, and recommendations have emerged whose application we shall pursue. On social affairs, we have raised the question of the elderly and the aged in society, a phenomenon of increasing importance in modern population trends and one with regard to which we have developed new models of treatment at home.\n151.\tIn all modesty, let me not only say but also prove to the Assembly that, parallel with our active participation in this forum to resolve enduring problems inherited from the past and as we became increasingly conscious of the difficulties of securing a sufficient rate of progress, Malta did not content itself with merely pointing out the need for changes in our attitude and joining in the passage of countless resolutions.\n152.\tWe felt that much more was required, that the time and opportunity for change had arrived and that they should be seized before they were lost. We felt that it was within our individual and collective capability to envisage new horizons. We felt that the more formidable the obstacles the more strenuous and persistent were the efforts required at the global, regional and national levels. And so we looked into the future, to a new arena of human endeavour on our planet and to emerging perspectives in Malta's own region. We fitted our own national policy to and concentrated our energy and resources on the pursuit of those approaches, almost revolutionary in concept but entirely just and peaceful in application. We put forward concrete proposals which have been translated into specific action.\n153.\tIn 1967 we felt that a start could at least be made, with better prospects of success, in deciding on a course of action over an area of activity that at that time was only a future possibility. Consequently, after months of quiet but intensive research, the Maltese delegation placed before this Assembly a detailed projection for a new concept of international co-operation in the area of this planet beyond national jurisdiction,  which up to that time had been protected from man's rapacity by the superjacent marine environment. We signalled in advance the potential\u2014either for partnership or for conflict\u2014that new technology would soon make possible, within our lifetime, in the militarization of the ocean floor and the exploitation of its mineral resources.\n154.\tThe result of that initiative has not yet crystallized into a permanent convention and institution, despite a decade of intensive negotiations. Already, however, much has been accomplished, and the end is in sight. The concept of the demilitarization of the ocean floor is already embodied in a treaty [resolution 2660 (XXV)], subject to improvement though it may be. A certain amount of co-ordination among previously independent institutions and haphazard activities has been secured. A new legal concept of the common heritage of mankind has been accepted and its provisions elaborated. Contributions by dedicated scientists, such as Cousteau and Heyderdahl in their admirable peaceful research, have dramatically opened our eyes to the beauty and fragility of the marine ecology and environment, and their scientific expertise has been devoted to preservation rather than to destruction. Other resources and intellectual efforts have also been expended on this worth-while attempt to introduce order and equity in a new field of human endeavour, instead of possible anarchy and the continued injustice of the strong to the detriment of the weak. This constitutes a practical example of cumulative concerted effort and concentration of resources by this Organization for the common good. It will pay enormous dividends in the years to come and could provide a new spirit of partnership in the relations between developed and developing countries, which Malta has long advocated.\n155.\tWith success within the grasp of the international community acting in concert it would be deplorable if economic interests in one or more industrially-advanced nations were to be given unilateral legal sanction to embark on exploitation activity before a convention was negotiated. This element of power-play would deal a psychological blow to the delicate negotiating process. My country has expended much energy on this initiative, and as a token of our faith in eventual success the Government of Malta continues to keep available valuable land and building sites for the proposed international sea-bed authority, which we hope will be established, with its headquarters in Malta in recognition of our historic and timely initiative.\n156.\tIn our own region we have stressed the need for greater concentration on the potential for unity and have derived encouragement from the evident trends towards regional integration. Consequently no opportunity has been lost to point out the significance of new perspectives in Euro-Mediterranean co-operation. Despite psychological and historical obstacles, at times even derision, popular movements for understanding and co-operation are reaching out to each other among Mediterranean countries even as new clouds of confrontation are unfortunately looming in other parts of the world. We have nourished these popular peaceful movements, and many meetings have been held in Malta over the past few years in which wider co-operation has been discussed-and given new impetus.\n157.\tFrom our own contacts and from the strength of these popular movements we sense that Europe as a whole is slowly awakening to a fuller realization of the political, strategic and economic significance of the countries on the opposite shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Malta is strenuously engaged at the governmental level in promoting the advancement of the muted dialogue that has been initiated so as to transform it into a permanent platform of political consultation. We believe that such consultation, recognizing mutuality of interest and conducted in a constructive spirit of equality, could lead to the gradual disappearance of past division; it could forge the links of a new partnership capable of keeping peace in our own region, without outside interference, while restoring to the region a new spirit and an independent, respected role in the council of international relations.\n158.\tEven as I speak today, on my country's initiative representatives from all the Mediterranean countries are meeting in Malta to establish a regional centre for the practical utilization of renewable energy sources\u2014wind, solar and biomass energy. This is future-oriented planning, on a regional basis, but we are not neglecting the global aspect. We therefore support the proposal for the holding of an international conference in 1981, and have in fact offered to act as host to that meeting. A few years ago, also on Malta's initiative, decisive action was finally taken through the co-operative action of all concerned to prevent and halt pollution in the Mediterranean, which was threatening to turn that beautiful sea into a lifeless sewer.\n159.\tAt the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe we insisted that a declaration that did justice to the importance of the Mediterranean should form an integral part of the Final Act signed three years ago at Helsinki. Subsequently, at the first review session in Belgrade in 1977, while pointing out deficiencies in implementation, we secured agreement to a meeting of experts on the Mediterranean to discuss specific avenues of co-operation\u2014 the only new and practical outcome after the promise of progress raised by the Helsinki Agreement. That meeting will be held in Malta in February next year. It will, we hope, constitute a watershed in the history of our region. It is the first meeting of its kind, and we are dedicated to making it a success. Preparations are already under way, and consultations will soon be initiated, to smooth the way for the substantive discussions that should lead to several recommendations for specific areas of co-operation. Malta's objective is to turn the Mediterranean area into a hive of friendly co-operation, throbbing with peaceful activities so demanding in time and resources that none will be left for military confrontation, and the tensions of the past will eventually be relegated to our history books, so that we shall truly have transformed the Mediterranean into a zone of peace, through common endeavours.\n160.\tThe February meeting will hardly have ended before we pass another important milestone in our chequered history. It will herald a new era for Malta, because we do not preach in the abstract; what we propose regionally and globally we apply rigorously at home. Accordingly, in March 1979 the existing military bases in Malta will be closed down for good. This will be a major turning-point for which we had deliberately planned a phased approach in advance. As a first step, my Government in 1971, on the basis of its popular mandate, told the people of Malta and the world at large that it had set itself a target date, by agreement with the United Kingdom, for the dismantling of the military bases on the island.\n161.\tThe second phase was a search with our European and Arab friends for a formula for a political status that would permit Malta to give its fullest contribution to peace and security and continue to serve European interests in a peaceful way in future, in stark contrast to the tremendous sacrifices in blood and tears that Malta made in the past when it served Europe militarily. In historical perspective, that past period in our history covers several centuries, but particularly in living memory it is represented by the darkest days of the 1940s, when Malta, constitutionally not even authorized to take its own decisions, was inextricably caught in the European fratricide. The people of Malta at that time suffered the world's most concentrated bombing and came within a few days of outright starvation, and the island incurred enormous physical damage.\n162.\tSubsequently, when sanity was restored, despite Malta's valiant contribution to the cause of democracy and despite the strivings of its political leaders, we were denied contributions in financial aid compatible with our needs, even though our economic infrastructure had been damaged beyond repair. One pretext after another was advanced against our just claims, and the little effort made to diversify the economy had hardly any effect on the island's heavy dependence\u2014almost 50 per cent-on income generated from the military bases. The real needs of the island's security were also subordinated to military considerations, as seen, not by Maltese leaders, but by outsiders.\n163.\tThis was the formidable problem that Malta faced in 1971, at the time the momentous decision to do away with all military entanglements was taken. This decision implied a radical change in the structure of the entire economy within a relatively short period, necessitating the transformation of all activities and a transfer from war-related services to the new industries of peace. Ever since the decision was taken, therefore, the Government and people of Malta have been strenuously endeavouring to build the necessary political and economic infrastructure that would permit a truly independent Malta to pursue its natural yearning\u2014to serve as a haven and catalyst for peace in our troubled region and to erase our old image as an island- fort IOSS for the dominant foreigner.\n164.\tIn these endeavours we have felt it both necessary and legitimate to turn to our partners and neighbours for understanding, assistance and support. Many countries have responded tangibly and enthusiastically. To our regret we have found those sources that are the best equipped, and from which we had expected the greatest measure of assistance and co-operation, consistently failing to give us the necessity response, which could have created the basis for mutually satisfactory arrangements. European countries that we contacted in a search for political and economic support to guarantee our neutrality only gave responses that were, and continue to be, vague and vacillating.\n165.\tThis we find difficult to understand, because it is clear to us that a peaceful island in the centre of the Mediterranean will contribute to the stability of the region, which is in the best interests of Malta's immediate neighbours and even of distant Powers. Why, then, should there be hesitation, given these convergent interests, about taking effective action when the opportunity presents itself? Is it considered unnatural or eccentric these days for a small, defenceless country to seek to promote stability and security within its region?\n166.\tBy contrast, Malta's objectives and aspirations were quickly understood and endorsed by the non-aligned countries, near and far. They have all decided to extend moral, economic and political support, for which we express great appreciation. It is only in Europe that difficulties persist, despite our affinities in all other respects. My Prime Minister recently took the occasion of a Council of Europe, meeting forthrightly- to explain our aspirations, and to ensure that they were well understood and evaluated.\n167.\tBut time is running out. Even as we continue to search for this understanding, the transition-period we had allowed ourselves is nearing its end. Undeterred by obstacles, Malta plans to move ahead, serenely to meet its moment of destiny, to honour its undertaking. In good faith, with pride and dedication, Mr. President, we bring before you and this Assembly at least on? example in today's turbulent world of a country turning away from militaristic confrontation and -transferring all its energies and resources to peaceful endeavours, backed by the courage of its convictions, by the determination of its own people, and by the. sympathetic understanding and tangible support of many countries, starting with some of our most immediate neighbours-particularly Algeria and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. In this connexion I wish to thank the Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya for publicly confirming here his country's unquestioning and timely support for Malta's peaceful strivings [28th meeting].\n168.\tWe are convinced that one day the community of nations will have cause to appreciate the initiatives, the energy and the foresight of small countries in their disinterested pursuit of promoting change from policies of almost instinctive military confrontation to a more peaceful, just and co-operative society.\n169.\tIn terms of all that is needed before universal peace is secured, Malta's contribution, coming as it does from a small island, cannot but be modest; set against what the island can contribute on its own, it represents our maximum potential. We appreciate that mankind's final objective can be attained only by all nations acting in concert, and that many have a far bigger contribution to make.\n170.\tThis body is the receptacle of mankind's most cherished aspirations. The message from my country that I bring to you remains one of determination and hope. I want to let you know that before we next meet, in the spring of next year, the guns of Malta's famed fortifications will officially have fallen silent; the beacon that now illuminates the ramparts is the torch of labour, for peace and economic and social justice in the years ahead.\n171.\tIt is against this background and in the spirit of this philosophy, in pursuit of our peaceful but activist role in international relations, that for the first time we are seeking to serve on the Security Council. In accordance with the democratic principles of this Organization, and on the basis of geographic rotation, we hope that our candidacy will obtain the support of the group to which we belong and of this Organization in which we are proud to serve. We will seek to bridge the psychological gap that at this critical period seems persistently to separate the Western European countries from the non-aligned. We confidently rely on your verdict, on the basis of our motives and our record in this Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff33.\tIt gives me great pleasure to express to you, Sir, on behalf of the Government and the people of Kuwait, heartfelt congratulations on you/ election as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. Your unanimous election is a tribute to the high status you enjoy in international circles as a statesman of wide experience and recognition of your country's role in international affairs, especially in the Latin American hemisphere. I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, for the manner in which he conducted the work of the thirty- second regular session of the General Assembly and that 6. the eighth, ninth and tenth special sessions, which was marked by great efficiency and impartiality.\n34.\tI wish also to commend the efforts of the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who worked hard to strengthen the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security and to express appreciation of his consent with problems of the developing countries,\n35.\tI want to welcome Solomon Islands, the new Member of the United Nations. Kuwait staunchly supports the principle of universality within the United Nations and is gratified that this principle is now within our reach,\n36.\tThe international climate has been precarious since the end of the last regular session. It has been characterized as uneasy detente, which avoids extreme political tension and military confrontation without actually succeeding in expanding co-operation between States with differing economic and social systems. Detente should be a positive element in present-day international relations; it should be instrumental in creating a better international political order which respects the sovereignty and political independence of all States, large or small. We oppose the policy of the search for spheres of influence by super-Powers in the developing countries. If detente should endure, it must be universal and not confined to one continent. The .decrease in tension between the major Powers should slacken the pace of the arms race and gradually contribute to disarmament.\n37.\tThe tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, was a step in the right direction. We did not expect it to create general and complete disarmament overnight. Yet we expected it to serve as a historic opportunity for announcing agreement on outstanding issues, such as a new agreement reached at the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Though our expectations were not fulfilled on substantive issues, the special session created many institutional changes in the machinery and procedures of disarmament which would ensure greater participation by all nuclear Powers, as well as all -Members of the United Nations. We hope that this will augur well for expediting disarmament negotiations and finalizing long-awaited disarmament agreements.\n38.\tTwentieth-century technology has revolutionized the nature of warfare. It has vastly enlarged the potential for destruction, and has moved war from the battlefront to everyone's back yard.\n39.\tOf all the weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons are still the most formidable. Each of the super-Powers has a force of these weapons sufficient to destroy the other many times over. There is no defence, no shield, against nuclear weapons. Damage from the combined effects of the nuclear blasts, fall-out and firestorms that would result from a full nuclear exchange would destroy all life not only in the warring nations but in the rest of the world as well. Our primary aim, therefore, should be cessation, of nuclear-weapon tests in all atmospheres, banning production of nuclear weapons and destroying their stockpiles.\n40.\tThe Government of Kuwait would like to comment on\\\" the initiative of the Soviet Union in presenting a draft international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States [A/33/241, annex, addendum]. Such a draft convention may prevent the wider proliferation of nuclear weapons by assuring non-nuclear-weapon States against the use of the threat of use of nuclear weapons against them. We have already heard solemn pronouncements by some nuclear Powers that they will not use nuclear weapons against those States which refuse to manufacture or acquire such weapons and do not have them in their territories. As the international convention is still the main instrument of international legislation, we believe that creating mutual binding obligations between nuclear and non-nuclear-weapon States, within an international convention, may prove to be a constructive step. The format which such a convention may take is a matter which requires careful study and negotiation.\n41.\tOne of the major issues to which Kuwait attaches great importance is the establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. Kuwait has from the outset rallied to the call to declare the Indian Ocean a zone of peace from which great-Power military bases and nuclear weapons would be excluded. We are looking forward to a conference which will serve as a negotiating forum for the great Powers and the littoral States of the Indian Ocean, with a view to halting further escalation and expansion of great-Power military presence in the Indian Ocean and eliminating from the Ocean all bases, military installations and logistic supply facilities, nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction and any manifestation of great-Power military presence conceived in the context of great-Power rivalry or areas of influence.\n42.\tToday peace is indispensable not only for the social, material, scientific and technical progress of mankind but also to safeguard the sovereign rights of peoples and States. Disarmament and a cut in military spending are major conditions for the full use of vast scientific and technical knowledge for the development of productive forces in the interests of transforming the material, cultural and everyday life of peoples and their vital living conditions and combating hunger, poverty and disease.\n43.\tAware of its responsibility as a member of the Security Council, Kuwait has acted in the spirit and letter of United Nations Charter and its resolutions. Kuwait attaches special importance to uprooting the causes of insecurity and finding equitable solutions for world problems. The Security Council has demonstrated on more than one occasion this year that it can act in an effective and decisive manner whenever there is agreement among the permanent members. The Council has so far been more successful in adopting resolutions than in securing their implementation. The Council should not be reluctant to take action under Chapter VII of the Charter to ensure compliance with its resolutions and respect for its authority. There is no indication, however, that some permanent members are willing to make possible the application of sanctions by the Council.\n44.\tApartheid and racial discrimination are still the major ailments that afflict international society. It is not surprising that the Security Council is usually convened to deal with the intransigence of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia and Israel.\n45.\tApartheid is not only repugnant and indefensible but is also a crime against mankind, as the General Assembly has declared on many occasions. Apartheid is a particular form of economic and social organization deriving from settler colonialism in countries of the third world. It institutionalises the most extreme kinds of quality in every possible sphere. South Africa has denied the most elementary human rights to the vast majority of its citizens.\n46.\tBoth South Africa and Southern Rhodesia have converted themselves into garrison States and have accumulated arsenals in order to maintain the status quo and prevent the emancipation of the majority'. The two have concluded a sinister alliance whose ostensible aim is to persist in wanton suppression, to intensify measures of oppression and repression on the basis of racial supremacy and to dehumanize the non-white people and coerce them into submission so that they will accept a state of perpetual bondage,\n47.\tIt is ironic that, by concluding the Salisbury agreement of 3 March 1978, the illegal Smith regime was desperately attempting to give itself a semblance of legality. However, the nature of the illegal regime has not changed, in spite of its deceptive mask and its abuse of the concept of majority rule. In this respect I should like to stress the importance of observing the provisions of Security Council resolution 253 (1968) on sanctions against Southern Rhodesia and of resolution 418(1977) on the arms embargo against South Africa. The violation of sanctions is inadmissible, not only because it is in contravention of those resolutions, but even more because it gives an additional lease of life to the illegal regime in Rhodesia and encourages the intransigence of South Africa,\n48.\tAs history has taught us, man will not indefinitely accept humiliation, exploitation and tyranny. If conflicts are not resolved in a peaceful and orderly manner in accordance with the dictates of right and justice, armed struggle will prove to be the only alternative if the oppressed are to escape from the odious shackles imposed upon them.\n49.\tThe situation in the Middle East remains\u2014as it has been for many years\u2014explosive, precarious and fraught with dangers for international peace and security. The danger is more acute now with the deepening division among the Arabs, who continue to be victims of power politics because of their strategic, economic and political import. Nowadays our region is witnessing a resurgence of outmoded alliances that are contrary to the interests of the peoples of the area, yet are pursued in order to promote interests that serve foreign Powers. There is an attempt in major-Power politics to return to the .Middle East in the aftermath of the dramatic events that took place recently at Camp David. The Government of Kuwait follows such developments with grave concern since they are. bound to have a serious effect on the genuine independence of the States in the region.\n50.\tThe changeable nature of politics in the Middle East will continue because the fundamental problems the solution of which would bring stability and. tranquillity are not seriously confronted. Without that necessary solution of age-old, chronic problems, peace and stability will remain as elusive as ever. The international community deserves to see real peace in the Middle East, a peace based on justice and conforming to the United Nations Charter and its principles and purposes, especially since that community has made such strenuous efforts for the achievement of a genuine and durable solution of the Middle East problem, Yet we are still seized of that problem, the solution of which lies in the implementation of the numerous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council, the provisions of which are based on the United Nations Charter.\n51.\tThe delegation of Kuwait states every year to this body that the key to the solution of the Middle East problem is the question of Palestine.\n52.\tI should like to state unequivocally that Kuwait fully supports the struggle of the Palestinian people for self- determination and statehood for Palestine. The people of Palestine\u2014talented, creative and determined as it is\u2014is no less entitled to statehood in, its land than is any other nation represented here. That people has all the attributes of statehood and its determination to obtain it in its ancestral land is unquestionable. The principle of self- determination for the people of Palestine, as well as for others, is inherently recognized in the United Nations Charter.\n53.\tThe General Assembly endorsed in its resolution 3236 (XXIX) the aspirations and the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine to return to their homes and property, to self-determination and to statehood. Those rights and the right of Palestinians to exercise them are as valid today as they were at the time of the adoption of resolution 3236 (XXIX). The right of the displaced Palestinians, whether they were displaced in 1948 or in 1967, to return to their homes and land is as sacred as ever. The General Assembly should continue to emphasize its resolution 194(111) on the return of the Palestinian refugees and should also reaffirm Security Council resolution 237 (1967) and relevant General Assembly resolutions on the persons displaced in 1967. These people cannot forgo their rights, regardless of recent events. All Palestinian refugees, whose determination to go back to their home is as strong as ever, should be supported by the General Assembly, which, I am sure, cannot condone the attempt to abrogate their rights and put an end to their aspirations.\n54.\tThe Government of Kuwait is bound by the decisions of the Conference of Arab Heads of State or Government, held in Rabat in 1974, which conferred on the PLO the responsibility for the future of the West Bank and Gaza and recognized the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the people of Palestine. It is our duty to support and enhance the position of the PLO, which is fighting on behalf of the people of Palestine to recover their legitimate rights, inhere are no persons outside the PLO who can claim any legitimacy in representing the people of Palestine.\n55.\tThe only real spokesman of the people of Palestine is the PLO and any attempt to bypass it will mean that the genuine voice of the people of Palestine is not heard. Therefore the solution of the Palestine question must be worked out with the PLO and any attempt to forge any agreement behind its back is bound to create more problems than solutions.\n56.\tThere will never be peace in the Middle East without the active, real and genuine participation of the people of Palestine, whose representatives have repeatedly stated in the General Assembly that they seek self-determination and statehood for the Palestinians. Those sacred rights, which are embodied in the United Nations Charter, cannot be tampered with if a genuine and real solution to the Middle East problem is seriously contemplated.\n57.\tThe Middle East will see peace if the following conditions are fulfilled: Israeli troops withdraw from all the Arab territories occupied by Israel, including the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem; genuine self-determination is given for the people of Palestine in accordance with General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX), which calls for respect for the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine in their country, including the right to statehood; Jerusalem is returned to Arab sovereignty, for Jerusalem is a city holy to Jews, Christians and Moslems, and to the Moslems, it is the city from which the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven; Israeli settlements are removed from the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights, for those settlements, established in violation of international law, are signs of the creeping annexation which Israel, started in 1967 and their continuance is a promise of future wars; the Palestinian refugees of 1948 return to their homes and properties and compensation for those who freely choose not to go back.\n58.\tThe future of refugees is a crucial issue because Israel wants them, contrary to United Nations resolutions, to be settled in host countries, against their will and in total disregard of the ability and the wishes of the host countries. The people of Palestine cannot be expected to accept a fate of living in Diaspora in different countries, with no bright future. They yearn for self-determination statehood and a return to their land. They want .to put an end to their agonizing alienation.\n59.\tWithout the achievement of those elements, peace will never reign in the Middle East. There may be a truce, the absence of an active war, but peace will remain a mirage. Without a solution to the Palestine problem there will never be peace and without self-determination for the Palestinians there will never be a solution of their problem.\n60.\tThe Government of Kuwait, issued on 21 September the following statement:\n/\n\\\"The Cabinet studied the agreements concluded at Camp David and their repercussions on the decisions of the Arab Summit Conference, as well as the United Nations resolutions pertaining to total Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and the inalienable rights of the people - of Palestine, including its right to self-determination.\n\\\"The Cabinet reaffirmed the previous position of Kuwait, which is committed to Arab Summit Conference decisions, especially those decisions taken at the Rabat Conference, and its conviction that a just and durable\\\" peace in the region requires total Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territory, including Jerusalem, and the restoration to the people of Palestine, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, of its inalienable rights.\\\"\n61.\tIt is the duty of the world, now more than ever, to lend its support more generously to the people of Palestine in their determined struggle to achieve their just and legitimate rights in accordance with the United Nations resolution,? and the purposes and goals of the United Nations Charter.\n62.\tI am positive that Palestine, whose land is a land of peace, will see that desire fulfilled if the conditions I have cited are implemented.\n63.\tThe Government of Kuwait note with concern the reference in the documents of the Camp David meetings to the role of the Security Council in endorsing such documents, although the Council had not been consulted about the provisions. It is unfair to the Council that a deal struck between three Members of the United Nations after negotiations shrouded in unprecedented secrecy should be brought before the Security Council for the Council to endorse and for the Council to be expected to play a role in its implementation, while the United Nations was totally ignored. That gives the impression that the Security Council is subordinate to the wishes of a few privileged States, which assume that the Council will automatically act in accordance with their wishes. Kuwait, as a member of the Security Council, cannot endorse that approach.\n64.\tAny solution to the problem of Namibia should be based on the free exercise of the right of self-determination and should lead to genuine independence. We reject the endeavour of South Africa to conduct elections under its supervision, without adequate United Nations presence such as is described in the Secretary-General's report which was adopted by the Council last Friday, 29 September, in its resolution 435 (1978).\n65.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is one of the major events in world history. Its specific task is to devise a regime for the oceans, which constitute 60 per cent of the area of this globe. The issues involved are of great complexity and the vital interests of all States are clearly involved. The achievement of an agreed final text is something that will be welcomed by the international community.\n66.\tThe post-war economic structure and the relationship between developing primary producers and developed industrial producers have been a major obstacle to balanced world economic growth and international political stability. The backwardness of the developing countries has been due mainly to the low return on their raw material exports which are still the major source of their livelihood and development. The New International Economic Order has been devised as a major measure to create new opportunities for the developing countries and to launch them on the path of self-sustained growth. Though the industrial countries have grudgingly accepted the new order in theory, they have done little to make it a reality in practice. The latest development was the setting up of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, also known as the Committee of the Whole, which has been entrusted with the task of implementing the New International Economic Order. I should like to take this opportunity to express my Government's support for the work of the Committee and solidarity with its aims and its mandate, as defined in this resolution. We prefer to see the continuance of the dialogue within the framework of the\nUnited Nations. What is needed in this context is the emergence of the political will on the part of the industrial countries to secure a break-through in the suspended dialogue between the developing and developed countries.\n67.\tThe United Nations Conference on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries was convened at a critical time in the evolution of relations among the developing countries themselves and between them and the developed countries. The successful adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action is a striking example of the determination of the developing countries to co-operate among themselves for the enhancement of their national and collective self-reliance. We view technical co-operation among developing countries as an additional input in the process of economic development and not as a substitute for the already-existing technical co-operation. We hope that the implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action will increase the quantum and enhance the quality of international technical co-operation and improve the effectiveness of the resources devoted to it.\n68.\tThe most recent example in our region of technical co-operation among developing countries was the Kuwait regional conference, which adopted a convention on cooperation among the Gulf States for the protection and development of the marine environment. Instead of making the usual appeal for further research and technical assistance, the plan of action puts emphasis on applying knowledge and skills already available in the region to tackle environmental problems. The plan of action, furthermore, calls for a comprehensive survey of the national capabilities.\n69.\tThere is a wide gap at United Nations meetings between words and deeds, preaching and practice, theory and application. Conferences are becoming so frequent that Governments must strain their resources to cover them adequately. There is rarely any follow-up. Resolutions are allowed to languish without having any tangible effect on the course of future events.\n70.\tIt is a cause of great satisfaction that the Secretary- General adverted to this problem in his recent report on the work of the Organization when he said:\n\\\"There is widespread criticism that we are long on oratory and documentation, but short on performance, spontaneous debate and practical action.\n.. What disturbs me is that our procedures may have the effect of overloading the absorptive capacity of Governments, numbing public interest in vital subjects and substituting formal and, sometimes, rhetorical exchanges for action. If international institutions are to increase in influence and in effectiveness and if they ate to be taken seriously by the public at large, this is a problem which we must face with the same seriousness that we face political and economic problems.\\\" \n71.\tHuman institutions are a response to the needs of the societies which they serve. The prerequisite for flourishing international institutions is a well-developed international society, and yet that is still only in the making. The hard fact is that the United Nations, with its acknowledged limitations, is probably all that the world is at present ready for. Side by side, therefore, with the endeavour to improve the United Nations and its organs, a major effort is required to develop a greater sense of interdependence and community among nations,\n72.\tTo strengthen the United Nations, Member States should work to improve it as an object worth while in itself. The present tendency is to take it as it is, lament its short-comings with more or less cynicism and use it for the furtherance of national policies. There is also the challenging task of educating peoples throughout the world to appreciate the need for international organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff53.\tMr. President, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you warmly on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-third regular session of the General Assembly. This is undoubtedly a tribute to your country, Colombia, and to Latin America.\n54.\tI should also like to congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who successfully guided the deliberations of the previous regular session as well as those of the three special sessions.\n55.\tMay I also warmly welcome Solomon Islands, the newest Member of the United Nations.\n56.\tThis month our people celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the glorious revolution of 14 October. That armed revolution demolished the pillars of colonialism and Sultanate entities in the southern part of our homeland and achieved victory after victory in consolidating our national independence and sovereignty. In this context, our resources are utilized in the interest of the masses of the Yemeni people under a people's democratic system led by the United Political Organization, \\\"the National Front\\\".\n57.\tIt also gives us great pleasure that this fifteenth anniversary of our revolution coincide with an important stage in the history of our Yemeni people. For this month the first conference to establish the Yemeni vanguard party\u2014the party of the workers, peasants and all toiling Yemeni people\u2014will be held. This party will convene under the slogan: \\\"To defend the Yemeni revolution, implement the' five-year development plan and unite the Yemeni homeland\\\". Yemeni unity has always been the goal nearest to the hearts of our people. Our people has always struggled to achieve Yemeni unity, undeterred by great sacrifices, both before and after the 26 September 1962 revolution in the north, as well as under the British colonial presence in the south. Today we pay a tribute to all the martyrs of the Yemeni revolution in Sana and Aden and on all Yemeni soil.\n58.\tHowever, with each victory our Yemeni people achieve the imperialist and reactionary forces rally against our people's legitimate wishes and aspirations to obstruct our march towards progress and unity. Those forces sometimes resort to internal sabotage and subversion, while on other occasions they launch foreign aggression, underestimating our people's moral and material capabilities and their heroic history of repulsion of foreign aggression and liquidation of conspiracies and conspirators wherever they exist.\n59.\tOur Yemeni people are a peace-loving people relentlessly working for stability and progress and endeavouring to avoid any resort to war, with its devastating effects. It has always been a firm principle of our national policy to strengthen love of peace and to encourage all efforts for peace not only in our own area but the world over. Our people are conscious of this purpose, but they are also on the alert and are capable of defending our country and its independence, national sovereignty and progressive achievements.\n60.\tMy Government has repeatedly affirmed its desire to establish normal and cordial relations with 'he peoples and States of the area, based on mutual respect, non-interference in the internal affairs of others and reciprocal co-operation. We believe that the right way to settle all differences between the States of the area is by peaceful means and non-violence, by democratic dialogue and peaceful negotiations.\n61.\tWe are fully aware that the struggle of our people for progress and unity is an integral part of the struggle of the Arab masses and their steadfast national Governments, which firmly resist all Zionist and reactionary designs in the region. In a wider context, it is also part of the national and international struggle against imperialism and its local allies. It is of great significance, in this regard, to witness the convergence of true revolutions extending from Cuba to Angola and from Viet Nam to Ethiopia, together with those of other progressive countries, which in their struggle stand united with the socialist countries, in particular the friendly Soviet Union.\n62.\tAlthough today the picture of the situation in the Arab homeland and other parts of the world looks gloomy, we are confident that the close alliance between the Arab and international revolutionary forces will change the balance of power in favour of freedom, socialism and peace in our area.\n63.\tThirty years have elapsed since the usurpation of Palestine and the expulsion of its people. Moreover, the racist Zionist entity, directly supported by the United States of America, launched its aggression against the Arab people in 1967 and, consequently, occupied Arab territory. Today Zionism and international imperialism reap the fruit of their aggression in the Camp David capitulationist accords. Democratic Yemen, together with the other parties of the National Front for Steadfastness and Confrontation, reaffirmed in the conclusions of its third summit conference held in Damascus, Syria, from 20 to 23 September, their condemnation of those accords because they violate all resolutions of the General Assembly, of the non-aligned movement and of the OAU and they ignore the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of its independent State. They also attempt to obliterate the Palestinian identity and to isolate the Palestinian people internally and externally from the true leadership of the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n64.\tThe Camp David accords were reached under the direction and supervision of the United States of America, which is a principal party to the conflict in the Middle East because of its material and military support to the Zionist entity. It is this continued support that encouraged and enabled the Zionist entity to commit aggression and continue its occupation. The Camp David accords represent a deviation from the resolutions of the Arab Summit Conferences of Algiers'2 and Rabat'3 and would only split Arab solidarity, which is based on anti-Zionist struggle and support of the Palestinian people. Moreover, they aim to form an alliance between Israel and the Sadat regime to serve the interests of international imperialism. In the final analysis, the accords amount to a final capitulation to the Zionist enemy and subservience to its expansionist and racist ambitions inside and outside of Palestine. Although they claim to form a framework for a comprehensive peaceful solution, they ignore the other parties to the conflict and impose upon them conditions and commitments that violate their right of national sovereignty and the liberation of their occupied territories. Consequently, these agreements can in no way achieve just peace in the area.\n65.\tAfter it had exhausted all means of direct aggression and the use of force, imperialism in Camp David resorted to a new device in an attempt to consolidate and continue its exploitation and control over the people and the resources of the region.\n66.\tThe Israeli intervention in Lebanon poses a threat to peace and security in the region. Israeli troops yesterday shelled Beirut from the sea. This once again reaffirmed the aggressive expansionist Israeli policy which nowadays takes cover behind the Camp David agreements. We condemn that intervention and affirm the unity and Arabism of Lebanon. The internal disturbance in Lebanon is the responsibility of the rightist secessionist forces which work for the maintenance of continued fighting in Lebanon, instigated and encouraged by Israel and its allies. The Syrian forces in Lebanon are part of the Arab deterrent forces which are present there to end fighting and to achieve stability in Lebanon.\n67.\tIt is no accident that these attempts coincide with the acceleration of armed peoples' resistance against the colonial and racist regimes in other parts of the world. National liberation is indivisible and liberation movements, whether in Palestine, Zimbabwe or southern Africa, are equally confronted by imperialism.\n68.\tWithout the active material, military and moral support of the capitalist States, the racist regimes can never survive. They have both an intertwined mutual interest in the suppression of peoples and the exploitation of their resources. The only way to liquidate the colonial racist regimes in Africa is through the acceleration of the armed struggle until the peoples attain their desired sovereignty and independence. This poses a challenge to the international community which should firmly stand by the just struggle of the African peoples and extend to them all material and moral support. We strongly condemn the latest position of the racist regime in South Africa in respect of Namibia and call for an end to this regime's disregard of the United Nations and its resolutions.\n69.\tWe also salute the struggle of the nationalists in Namibia and Zimbabwe and extend our full support to the legitimate representatives of their peoples, SWAPO and the Patriotic Front. Moreover, we welcome the latest decision adopted by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries to accept SWAPO as a full- fledged member within its ranks.\n70.\tAs for Cyprus, we call for the total and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops and the liquidation of the military bases whose presence represents a violation of the island's non-aligned status. We call for full respect for its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence. Likewise, we call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and support the just stand taken by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its endeavours to achieve unification of Korea through peaceful means.\n71.\tWe have always called for the right to self-determination of the peoples of Western Sahara and Puerto Rico. We also salute the heroic struggle of the peoples of Nicaragua and Chile against the dictatorships there. And we support the struggle of the friendly Cuban people for its territorial integrity and call for the liquidation of the Guantanamo base of aggression.\n72.\tWe fully subscribe to the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)J, and support the initiative for holding a conference to that end. We believe that the decision adopted by the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian\nOcean to hold a preparatory conference of the littoral and hinterland States in the second half of next year [see A/33/29, para. 28] will constitute, after its adoption by the General Assembly, a positive step towards the preparation for the world conference on the subject. As a littoral State, Democratic Yemen views the Red Sea as a natural extension to the Indian Ocean. We have always attached great importance to maintaining the Red Sea as a zone of peace and security, with particular emphasis on preserving the territorial sovereignty of its littoral States and the utilization of its resources to the benefit of their peoples.\n73.\tBeing well aware of the great importance of the strait of Bab el Mandeb to all peoples and States of Wit- world as an international waterway which has long been used for international navigation, and of its important strategic location as a link between the international traffic lines, and believing 'in the importance of keeping international navigation through this vital strait free for the benefit of the peoples and States of the area in particular and the international community in general, Democratic Yemen affirms its respect for the freedom of maritime and air navigation of ships and aircraft of all States without prejudice to the sovereignty, integrity, security and independence of the Republic.\n74.\tHowever, the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace cannot be achieved without the liquidation of the foreign military bases in the territories of the littoral and hinterland States themselves, as well as in the islands such as Diego Garcia and Masira in Oman, whose people, under the leadership of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman, struggle to achieve national sovereignty and independence and rid themselves of all foreign military forces. Moreover, the security of the area is endangered not only by the expansionist ambitions of certain States and their military intervention in the affairs of smaller States but also by aggressive military pacts.\n75.\tThe peoples of the world have a common goal, the maintenance and promotion of world peace and security. They will not be deterred by the attempts of imperialism from pursuing their cherished goals and aspirations. We support the call for a cessation of all nuclear tests and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and of weapons of mass destructive capability, as well as an end to the arms race, so that the enormous amounts wasted for this purpose may be diverted to developing and improving the peoples' standard of living.\n76.\tIn this respect, we support the new Soviet proposal for the conclusion of an international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States [A/33/241]. The outcome of the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, has demonstrated the concern of the international community regarding the arms race. Moreover, in spite of the obstacles, it has also shown that concrete and positive results could be reached in this respect in the future.\n77.\tThis year has witnessed an increasing number of activities on the international scene. A number of meetings and conferences have taken place in addition to the special session devoted to disarmament. These include two other special sessions, the seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference of the Law of the Sea, the World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries and the Conference .of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries. Similar activities and international conferences are scheduled to take place next year, in particular the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries to be convened in Havana. We are confident that the success of all these activities will positively enhance the role and status of the United Nations and firmly consolidate international co-operation and world peace as a whole.\n78.\tThe new international political order was established by the will of the people of the world yearning for freedom, progress and peace. However, not very long ago, it became amply clear that this system would have to be complemented and strengthened by a New International Economic Order that would eliminate all forms of dependence, domination and exploitation, and through which the developing countries would achieve their economic independence, without which political independence is devoid of social content and true essence.\n79.\tYet, from the very inception of efforts for the establishment of the New International Economic Order, the developing countries, as a\\\" result of their painful experience in the political sphere, have known that this will not be an easy task or one to be accomplished without sacrifice. For in restructuring world economic relations, developing their own national economies through individual and collective self-reliance, and attaining complete sovereignty over their natural resources they will be faced with hurdles and obstacles set up by the capitalist States that control the world economy, and their transnational corporations that have a vested interest in maximizing their profits at the expense of the millions of people in the developing countries.\n80.\tToday, after four years of consultations, negotiations and various important international conferences, the so- called North-South dialogue has reached a stalemate. We believe this is a result of the lack of political will on the part of most capitalist States, in particular the United States of America, to respond positively to the legitimate aspirations of the developing countries. A striking case in point is the latest session of the Committee Established under General Assembly resolution 32/174, otherwise known as the Committee of the Whole. This Committee is not an end in itself but merely an instrument for effecting the radical changes necessary for the process of real and over-all development. These changes cannot take place smoothly unless some States abandon their manoeuvres and overwhelming concern for their short-term narrow interests, and unless they shoulder their responsibilities in the establishment of the New International Economic Order. The economic situation in the developing countries, and particularly in the least developed and non-oil-producing developing countries, requires urgent and radical solutions, including the provision of material, technical and moral support without any kind of pressure or economic blackmail and without the imposition of conditions that might harm their sovereignty and independence.\n81.\tUnfortunately, many of the problems of the developing countries are a result of the negative aspects of the economic policies of the capitalist countries. The developing countries should consolidate their ties and co-operation and strengthen their relations with the socialist countries to bring about the New International Economic Order. However, we have to reaffirm that the United Nations system, since it is the most representative framework, is the only one in which all negotiations of a global nature relating to the establishment of the New International Economic Order should take place. Only in this context can we reach just solutions that may lead us to world peace and stability.\n82.\tIn conclusion, 1 have pleasure in expressing our gratitude and appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his untiring efforts to strengthen the United Nations so that it can play its full role in achieving the noble goals, objectives and principles enshrined in its Charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff154.\tI should like first of all, through you Sir, to congratulate Mr. Lievano on his election to the high office of the presidency of the General Assembly. His election is not only a recognition by the Assembly of his great knowledge and experience in international relations but also a tribute to the prominent role played by his country in world affairs.\n155.\tI should also like to extend my gratitude to Mr. Lazar Mojsov, the outgoing President of the General Assembly, for the effective manner in which he guided the Assembly during its regular and special sessions of the past 12 months. The Iranian delegation was gratified to have enjoyed with Mr. Mojsov, with whose country Iran enjoys friendly relations, the closest co-operation during his tenure of office.\n156.\tI wish also once again to express our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his dedication and untiring devotion to finding solutions for the various problems facing the United Nations. I should also like to note that we enjoyed having the Secretary- General in Iran during the early part of this year, when he had constructive and useful discussions with him.\n157.\tI welcome into the community of nations the State of Solomon Islands, which has taken its rightful place among the - Members of the United Nations. We are confident that the membership of Solomon Islands will add a new dimension to the universal character of this Organization.\n158.\tThe current session of the General Assembly is being held a short time after the convening of the eighth, ninth and tenth special sessions. It also follows the second session of the recently created Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, known as the Committee of the Whole, which is entrusted with the task of reviewing the implementation of decisions and agreements leached on the establishment of the New International Economic Order.\n159.\tMany of the issues on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly were considered in those previous sessions, but they still remain unresolved. This lack of progress, coupled with rising expectations and frustrations, as well as the increasingly frequent recourse to violence, urgently calls for a new effort for the solution of these problems. I wish therefore to address myself briefly to some of these issues before us.\n160.\tThe question of the Middle East remains uppermost in our mind. The suffering with which the people of the area have long been afflicted has given rise to a situation which is naturally of great concern to us. We have accordingly followed with great interest the recent developments which have taken place with regard to the Arab- Israeli conflict. If the long-cherished hopes and aspirations for a comprehensive peace with justice are to be realized, Israel must withdraw from all the territories it has occupied in compliance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973), as well as other relevant United Nations resolutions, in particular those dealing with the Holy City of Jerusalem, to which the whole Islamic world attaches the utmost importance. Similarly, no lasting peace could be established without taking fully into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. We earnestly hope that a comprehensive peace with justice on a durable basis will soon prevail in the Middle East.\n161.\tAnother disquieting problem is the situation in Cyprus and the persistent tension which continues to frustrate international efforts aimed at bringing peace and tranquillity to that country. We still believe that a just and long-lasting solution of this problem can and must be achieved by negotiations between the two ethnic communities of Cyprus, with a view to preserving the territorial integrity and the independence of the country, taking into account the legitimate interests of the two communities.\n162.\tThe Indian Ocean is another area of particular concern to us. The United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean is continuing its task with a view to ensuring that that area will be established as a zone of peace. As a bordering State, Iran will continue its efforts within and outside the United Nations system to contribute to the achievement of that objective and will assist in keeping the zone free from great-Power rivalry. The Persian Gulf, which extends through the narrow straits of Hormuz into the Indian Ocean is of vital importance to Iran. In fact, all the States bordering the Persian Gulf attach singular importance to its security. As this strategic waterway represents a major lifeline to the area it is imperative that responsibility for the maintenance of its security remain solely with those States. It is most fortunate that the Persian Gulf States are bound together not only by this important common interest but also by bonds of fraternity, which have been formed and cemented through centuries of cultural, religious and historical ties.\n163.\tThe universal aspiration to free the world from the fear of war and the terror of nuclear weapons is the foundation on which the United Nations was established and has impelled us to search for a means to achieve a climate of peace and security through disarmament. With the holding of the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, a special effort, involving participation by all the Members, was made to bring us closer to the objectives of disarmament.\n164.\tUnfortunately the results of the special session fell far short of the hopes and expectations that had been aroused. Nor did they reflect the monumental efforts and preparations which had preceded its convening. However, our immediate disappointment must be tempered by an appreciation of some positive steps. A major thrust of the session was to stimulate thought and interest in vital and principal areas of disarmament. The Final Document of the session [resolution S-10/2], adopted by consensus, reflects a fair measure of achievement in that and other important areas. Agreement has been reached on setting up new machinery for deliberations and negotiations on disarmament. We now seem to possess the essential elements of a new international strategy for disarmament which we hope can be made a reality through collective efforts, goodwill and perseverance.\n165.\tThe fears and anxieties as well as the hopes and expectations which led to the convening of the special session are still with us. The world still lives under the ominous shadow of enormous stockpiles of the ultimate weapon. The factors and forces that help perpetuate the arms race are still at work.\n166.\tIf we are to save present and future generations from extinction, the universal message is loud and clear: in the disarmament process obviously first things should come first and disarmament should start with the halting and reversing of the nuclear arms race.\n167.\tMy country and, may I say, the majority of States Members of the United Nations have held all along that nuclear Powers, in particular the super-Powers, have primary and particular responsibility for the-promotion of genuine disarmament. Those States can and should break the self-perpetuating cycle of the arms race by adopting concrete and tangible measures, so that other States can feel more secure and encouraged to follow the road to the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament.\n168.\tAnother problem which is a source of serious concern to the international community is the spread of international terrorism. It is our firm belief that resort to acts of violence, which is causing the loss of innocent lives, jeopardizing fundamental human rights, and threatening the very fabric of organized societies, must be brought to an end. Here I should like to stress once more that my Government has always been in favour of international co-operation against terrorism. In that context, we have also noted with satisfaction the decision of the recent Bonn Economic Summit Conference on the campaign against terrorism and hijacking.  We stand ready to lend our full support to any international effort in this field.\n169.\tConcerning southern Africa, some positive developments have taken place during the past few months. The convening by the General Assembly of the ninth special session on Namibia and the endorsement by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978) of an independence plan for that Territory represent a step forward in the direction of the transfer of sovereign power to the people of Namibia. In that connexion, I must reaffirm that the territorial integrity of Namibia should be protected in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.\n170.\tMy Government has remained steadfastly opposed to apartheid, a policy under which the people of South Africa continue to languish. We have joined with others to condemn policies of apartheid, which troubles the conscience of man by its indignity and violation of human rights. The Government of Iran, in pursuance of its policy towards apartheid, has decided, in accordance with the relevant decisions of the General Assembly, to carry out appropriate measures, including dissemination of information, in observance of International Anti-Apartheid Year. Thus once again we wish to demonstrate by word as well as by deed our solidarity with the oppressed people of South Africa.\n171.\tIn Zimbabwe, unfortunately, the confrontation between the illegal minority regime and the freedom fighters continues to cause heavy loss of life. We hope that the accord on Namibia will assure a brighter prospect for a peaceful settlement of the Rhodesian problem and the early transfer of sovereign power to the majority in Zimbabwe.\n172.\tIn the field of development and international economic co-operation, we believe that the world economy is still prey to the same fundamental difficulties as those that confronted it a year ago, when we last reviewed the situation in this Assembly, and that the persisting uncertainties surrounding the economies of both developed and developing countries continue to frustrate the attempts aimed at resolving divergent views and policies on those issues. The policy framework adopted by the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly for the establishment of a New International Economic Order is still far from materializing.\n173.\tThe dialogue commenced at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation and followed up in other forums has fallen short of the needs and aspirations of the developing countries. Moreover, the prospects for the ongoing negotiations are not entirely bright. It is indeed discouraging that the developing countries as a whole are now realizing a rate of growth in total output less than the rate they achieved in the early days of the 1970s; that the rate of growth in their agricultural products is still little over half the target rate of 4 per cent set forth in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]; that the growth of their industrial production has been noticeably slackening; and that the imposition of import restrictions and other protectionist measures in certain developed countries has considerably hampered the development of even a modest industrial base, which represents a major source of export earnings for a number of developing countries.\n174.\tThe slow-down trends have affected the developing oil-exporting countries more than others. For them, the decline in the growth of export earnings has been accompanied by a continued erosion of their purchasing power.\n175.\tThe decline in the value of export earnings has affected other developing countries also. In spite of some increase in their export earnings as a whole and an improvement in their balance of payments during the past two years, the long-term prospects for their sustained upward movement are still dim. A number of those countries are still suffering from deteriorating terms of trade. The servicing of external debts is also weakening their economies.\n176.\tThe present trends, if unchecked, are bound to have a disruptive effect on the growth and prosperity of the developing countries, with all the consequences that would attend such disruption; therefore there is an urgent need for closer co-operation between the developed and developing countries. As long as the world is divided into a house of fortune and a house of need, global development is not genuine and cannot last long. Indices of growth or improvement are essentially meaningless.\n177.\tIn the field of human rights, a particularly interesting and positive development may be discerned today within the international community. On the one hand, there is increasingly unanimous agreement to condemn categorically the most flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms of the individual. On the other hand, it is recognized that massive violations of human rights affect not only individuals but also entire peoples, as in the case of those suffering from apartheid, colonialism and foreign domination.\n178.\tThe realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for everyone is a long process, a long road filled with pitfalls but one which my country, despite recent and unfortunate events, is determined to continue to travel unrelentingly. Under the guidance of my enlightened sovereign, we have started a chapter in our history in which measures are being taken to ensure full protection of freedom of expression within the Constitution and the law of the land.\n179.\tIn the international arena, Iran will continue with unflagging determination to support all sincere efforts to promote and ensure fundamental freedoms.\n180.\tIn conclusion, I should like to reiterate our basic position that peace and security, at both the international and the national level, can be obtained primarily through\nthe promotion of freedom and the dignity of man. Our national efforts through the years have already yielded significant results. With the grace of God Almighty, and the implementation of policies and programmes designed to bring about social justice, we hope we shall succeed in creating the conditions necessary for peace and security.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n2.\tMr. President, I welcome this opportunity to congratulate you in person on your election to the responsible post which will mean your presiding in the weeks to come over the work of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. The honour thus accorded to you and, through you, to your country and to Latin America as a whole is fully justified, and I am convinced that under your enlightened leadership our Organization will make the progress we all desire.\n3.\tHaving said that, I hasten to emphasize the important contribution made by your predecessor, Mr. Mojsov, to the achievement of the aims and ideals of our Organization. The skill with which he presided over the work of the thirty-second session and then three special sessions of the General Assembly merits not just our unreserved admiration but indeed our profound gratitude.\n4.\tOnly those who have, like myself-as you have just indicated, Sir-presided over the work of this Assembly can fully appreciate the honour and the difficulties of the presidential responsibility.\n5.\tI wish also to address a few words to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, that tireless worker -for the noble cause of the defence of the Charter. It might seem\nsuperfluous to renew our confidence in him every year at this rostrum, but I can assure him of the confidence that my Government has in him, and I confirm with conviction Luxembourg's support in this difficult but noble task.\n6.\tLastly, I should like to say how very pleased we were to see Solomon Islands admitted as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of our Organization. I assure that young State of our sincere desire to co-operate with it in order that we may together achieve our common goals.\n7.\tA year ago, when we had just begun the work of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly and as the world situation was under review, I found myself voicing feelings of I would even say profound pessimism. Throughout the world, the already existing hotbeds of tension had been joined by others, so that the picture presented by our world at that time was anything but reassuring. Today, at the beginning of this thirty-third session, I am happy to be able to discern, if only faintly, certain bright spots in that picture. The results of the Camp David meetings are certainly of fundamental importance for the settlement of the Middle East conflict. Last year, the courageous initiative of the President of Egypt, Mr. Anwar El-Sadat, breathed new prospects and new life into the peace efforts. Now what might be called the persistence and the diplomatic skill of the President of the United States, Mr. Jimmy Carter, have made it possible to enter a new stage, or so at least it is hoped. At this rostrum I wish to voice my admiration at the considerable task which President Carter has carried out with infinite courage and patience-admiration which I feel also for President El-Sadat and the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Menachem Begin, who have shown the breadth of mind required by the circumstances.\n8.\tThat does not mean that everything has been settled-far from it. However, a framework has been, if not actually traced out, at least sketched. Now it must be given substance as soon as possible. I am nevertheless optimistic, despite critical, even hostile, reactions, and I express the fervent hope that all the States and parties directly involved in the conflict will eventually arrive at as objective a judgement as possible on the step that has been taken and will agree to proceed from that basis towards the over-all, just and lasting settlement of the conflict which the world has been awaiting for so long. Whatever the reservations concerning the long and certainly abstruse texts issued at Camp David,1 the cause of peace requires that we consider carefully and without undue haste all the potentialities they may contain.\n\n\n9.\tI wish to make one final comment on this matter. The member countries of the European Community have frequently stated their position on the situation in the Middle East, It is thus with some satisfaction that 1 note that the concessions made at Camp David by the parties, in comparison with their earlier positions, are very much along the lines of the ideas advocated by the European Community over the years. It is important to continue along that path. As my colleague and friend, the current President of the Community, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, said this morning, our Community is more willing than ever to contribute to all efforts to bring about a solution.\n10.\tThere has also been a tenth special session of the General Assembly on the crucial problem of disarmament. With some hindsight one can now say that noteworthy results were attained on that occasion. Of course, those results fell far short of our hopes, but, all things considered, and taking into account the interests and the differences involved, we can confirm that the final result, and particularly the prospects for the future, exceeded our pessimistic expectations.\n11.\tThere was also the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. This is a highly important problem. It seems to me that many people do not fully grasp its scope and 1 believe we shall often have to talk about this in the future.\n12.\tThose are three complex fields, if ever there were complex fields, in which decisive progress has proved possible. Happily, there are other questions which were resolved thanks to the untiring work of the committees and other bodies of this Organization and to' the unflagging and constant sense of commitment of the Secretary-General and his associates.\n13.\tThe Middle East, disarmament and the law of the sea are three fields of primary importance for our peoples, because they involve peace, security and economic prosperity.\n14.\tWhat does one see in these three spheres to which I have just referred? Wisdom, moderation, co-operation and the desire to understand each other's problems\u2014in a word, negotiation and fraternal dialogue\u2014have prevailed during this year.\n15.\tOnce the parties involved decided to leave aside vehement speech-making, sterile polemics and ideological speeches too often doomed in advance to failure, concrete results soon followed.\n16.\tCan we at last learn a lesson from these facts? Can we have the courage, the restraint and the far-sightedness to seize the opportunities which have now so clearly come to light and which have yet again provided evidence of their efficacy?\n17.\tI would hesitate to make myself an advocate of the Charter yet again here, because I feel I should be preaching to the converted, to those already convinced. Nevertheless, I feel it was a good idea to remind the Assembly of certain primary truths which, even though they are self-evident, gain validity from being repeated.\n18.\tWith 150 independent countries, each having its own kite rests, aspirations and distinct political and even economic ideologies, one can hardly expect the whole Assembly suddenly to endorse all initiatives and to find each of them the best.\n19.\tSince perfection does not belong to this world, I think it is and will for a long time continue to be for us to seek perfection in its most human, most just and most equitable dimensions.\n20.\tIf a new departure has been made in the field of disarmament I think we owe this to a small group of people, whom I would not hesitate to describe as fanatics, for such a complete commitment as that of the President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly, of Mr. Ortiz de Rozas and of my colleague and friend Garcia Robles can only be understood and appreciated on its merits if one has become fully aware of the feeling of commitment of the non-aligned countries and of our Latin-American friends in this very complex and difficult sphere.\n21.\tAnother Sisyphean task is that of the Conference on the Law of the Sea. Slowly but surely that Conference is now moving through negotiation to the establishment of rules and regulation for the oceans, the exploitation of their wealth, their peaceful utilization and the safeguarding of their environment.\n22.\tMy friend and successor, Mr. Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka has devoted a great part of his career to this gigantic task. His dynamism, undoubtedly carried along by unshakeable conviction, has meant that that Conference has not sunk into oblivion and failure. He ought to be publicly thanked from this rostrum.\n23.\tGenerally speaking, the picture presented by today's world is not a pretty one, as we all know. Whether it be the problems of southern Africa, with the policy of apartheid, or the stagnation of the Cyprus negotiations, we see that time does not heal the wounds. On the contrary, the lack of progress towards mutually acceptable solutions only poisons relations between the parties so that a new armed conflict could break out at any time.\n24.\tIn southern Africa, Anglo-American efforts towards a solution of the problem of Rhodesia continue to be valid and Pretoria can no longer disregard international pressure. Rather than engage complacently in vehement speech-making. which has never ameliorated the condition of those suffering from the atrocity apartheid, let us give our support to those who have provided proof that patient, tenacious negotiation has not gone out of fashion as a way of achieving positive results. I would go even further and say that our full support would give to the mission of those who are devoted to the quest for solutions in South Africa all the weight needed, indeed indispensable, for rapid progress.\n25.\tIs there or is there not, the prospect of a settlement of the painful problem of Namibia? That is a question we are all asking ourselves. We had thought that such a settlement had been virtually achieved when South Africa and the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] both accepted this five-Power plan [S/12636]. Now, its acceptance appears to be called in question by South Africa on the vague pretext that United Nations soldiers and observers would be acting as an army of occupation. Trying to keep at bay the inevitable outcome, South Africa is at the same time incurring responsibility for future dangers. We hope that common sense will eventually prevail, and the Assembly must bring its full weight to bear so that reason will prevail.\n26.\tIt is with consternation that I find myself unfortunately obliged each year to take up the case of Cyprus. If on both sides, instead of virtually rejecting a priori the proposals of the other side, some effort were made to take more account of the aspirations of the ordinary citizens of the two communities, that would lead us and the two parties more rapidly to make workable and therefore valid proposals. The Secretary-General has given adequate proof that he is fully prepared to help in such an effort.\n27.\tIn a world in which focal points of discord are not in short supply, we have to note that it is taking a long time for the world economy to recover and that disorders in the monetary sphere only augment the disarray which is afflicting both industrialized and third world countries.\n28.\tHappily, the dialogue which has now been established is continuing to make progress that is sure but too slow towards a new world economic order, which can only come about through permanent co-operation. We must ensure that it is not the product of confrontation.\n29.\tThe Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, also known as the Committee of the Whole, has done an extremely useful job. It suspended its work two weeks ago with the observation that, given the divergences of views concerning the mandate, it considered that the Assembly should continue the debate in order to get it out of what it calls a procedural rut. I wish to emphasize that despite certain flagrant shortcomings throughout the whole of these very hard and difficult negotiations the will to compromise has never been lacking. In the near future a new session of UMCTAD will perhaps make it possible to find, through negotiations, solutions to the remaining problems.\n30.\tPersonally, I have always spoken in favour of interdependence and the need for closer co-operation among all countries, both the industrialized and the developing countries. Federal Vice-Chancellor Genscher, the current President of the European Communities, has described the efforts which the nine members of the Community have been making with a view to such co-operation. I can only emphasize what he said and invite all the developed countries to follow the example of the European Community.\n31.\tIf some prefer to remain aloof from this major endeavour of solidarity and to limit their contribution to purely verbal assurances of support, they are assuming a very grave responsibility. If the few so-called rich nations were today to prove incapable of contributing to the development of the great number of poor countries, these industrialized countries would thereby be affirming their inability to ensure the lasting nature of their own well-being. That is what the law of interdependence means.\n32.\tSolidarity in the international community must also be expressed on behalf of all innocent persons who are victims of acts of terrorism, the taking of hostages or the hijacking of aircraft. Blind acts of violence are cowardly means of action which discredit those who carry them out, those who applaud them and the causes they are supposed to serve. We therefore energetically support all the efforts of this Assembly and of Member States to combat international terrorism. My Government holds the same views as the seven major States which, at the Bonn Economic Summit Conference in July, expressed their intention of energetically combating the hijacking of aircraft.\n33.\tI have been speaking before the Assembly for 10 years now, long enough, permit me to say, to yield occasionally to some impatience. But my experience in this field is too long not to view problems with moderation.\n34.\tExperience shows us that patience is worth more than passion, that negotiation always works better than bloody confrontation, and that those who have wanted to have everything right away have more often received very little, and that sometimes very late.\n35.\tMy country maintains its faith in this Organization and will continue to support it without reservation until we all discover that what politicians 33 years ago only dared to dream of and to desire ardently is and remains within our grasp. Then we shall become, I hope, truly united nations.\n36.\tMy country, at the crossroads of Europe, has often found out at first hand that the results of bloody confrontation are nothing but poverty, destruction and misery, which in turn engender new confrontations. The arrogant conquerors and those they humiliate by conquest are equally dangerous for harmony among peoples. Those who must today negotiate peace should remember that the greatest virtue of the conqueror is generosity. It will be as it always has been the best cement for lasting peace.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff120.\tMy delegation is pleased to participate in this session of the General Assembly. To us,\nthis is an occasion for serious reflection on the numerous problems which confront our imperfect globe. It is for this reason, among others, that the United Nations as an international institution was born. My statement will concentrate unavoidably on some of these issues which continue to tax our foreign relations, in particular, the crisis in southern Africa.\n121.\tBefore delving into the substance of my contribution, Mr. President, I wish on behalf of the Zambian delegation to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-third regular session. Your election is also a mark of honour to your country, Colombia, with which we are linked in the current struggle of the third world for justice and equity in the economic, political and social spheres. My delegation pledges co-operation' with you.\n122.\tMr. President, this is the opportune moment for me to pay a particular tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia, who ably presided over the thirty- second regular session as well as three important special sessions of this Assembly, held this year.\n123.\tI also wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his tireless efforts in the promotion of the objectives of the United Nations and for his lucid and comprehensive report to this session.\n124.\tZambia welcomes the admission of Solomon Islands to the membership of this family of nations. The admission of a new Member is an occasion for rejoicing and reflection, in the knowledge of the difficulty of the process of decolonization.. Colonial masters never give up easily. Zambia also hopes and expects to welcome independent Zimbabwe and Namibia to membership in the United Nations in the very near future. We also congratulate Tuvalu on the attainment of independence and we look forward to its admission to the United Nations.\n125.\tMr. President, in your important opening statement, you gave a vivid and impressive account of the pattern of pervasive poverty and increasing inequalities which continue to characterize existing international economic relations and to subvert international peace and security. My delegation fully shares the sense of disappointment with the continuing deterioration of the international economic situation. In particular, we associate ourselves with the numerous expressions of grave concern regarding the worsening condition and grim prospects of developing countries.\n126.\tThe North-South dialogue, which was initiated some four years ago on the basis of a hard-won consensus, remains in serious jeopardy. The hopes which were aroused by the successful outcome of the seventh special session of the General Assembly in 1975 have yet to be fulfilled in any meaningful manner. The implementation of the Programme of Action on the Establishment of the New International Economic Order (resolution 3202 (S-VI)j depends on the undertaking of structural changes and the adoption of appropriate policy decisions in conformity with the reality of interdependence and the mutuality of interest among nations. It does not rest, nor should it be permitted to rest on the fulfilment of traditional concepts of aid, charity or philanthropy\u2014lofty as these notions may be.\n127.\tOn that premise, I wish to submit that the picture which has emerged from negotiations on major issues- notably those on the Integrated Programme for Commodities,' 2 the common fund, multilateral trade negotiations, the transfer of resources in real terms, the reform of the international monetary system, industrialization, the conversion of UNIDO into a specialized agency and the code of conduct for the transfer of technology to developing countries\u2014is indeed a sombre one, and does not provide any consolation.\n128.\tIt is the sincere hope of my delegation that Member States, in particular the developed countries, will exert maximum efforts in appropriate forums to transform the current stalemate into concrete success. We reaffirm our conviction that the ongoing dialogue can be sustained and rendered meaningful only through concrete discernible results which reflect the structural character of the mandate given. We cannot as yet confidently point to any such accomplishment. The outcome is decisively dependent on the measure of commitment to negotiate in good faith and of political will on the part of the industrialized countries.\n129.\tZambia welcomes recent announcements by a few industrialized countries of their intention to increase financial assistance and to cancel official debts in respect of the poorest among the developing countries. In addition, we would urge donor countries to accord serious attention to those land-locked, island, developing and middle-income countries which have not so far benefited from meaningful special measures, in. spite of the formidable economic difficulties which continue to confront them.\n130.\tMy delegation remains convinced that existing economic criteria which accord undue weight to per capita gross national product, useful as they are in determining eligibility for special attention, have increasingly tended to conceal more than they reveal. The criteria employed by the United Nations development system, including UNDP, and by such international institutions as IBRD do not reflect peculiar circumstances such as disadvantageous geographical location, lengthy and costly transportation lines, and specific geo-political situations, which impose major constraints on the development efforts of certain countries, such as my own. We trust that the question of criteria will receive serious and urgent consideration from the relevant United Nations bodies and specialized agencies, financial and technical assistance institutions and creditor and donor countries.\n131.\tIn this connexion, Zambia continues to make immense sacrifices in its effective implementation of the United Nations policy of sanctions against the rebel British colony of Southern Rhodesia, particularly following Zambia's closure of its border with rebel Rhodesia. Today, the cost to Zambia of its application of United Nations sanctions exceeds SI billion. Our full and effective implementation of such United Nations decisions, especially with regard to the transportation of essential commodities, is consequently being gravely jeopardized by the absence of sustained commitment on the part of certain Member States, as well as by the lack of commensurate assistance to countries such as my own which continue to be adversely affected by the implementation of important United Nations decisions. In this regard, Zambia will soon have no alternative but to transport \\\"by the southern route more than 100,000 tons of badly-needed fertilizer before the onset of the rains.\n132.\tThe procedural stalemate currently facing the. Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, known as the Committee of the Whole, is a source of grave concern to my delegation. The problem of the procedural impasse must be resolved at this session in order that this important Committee may be able to proceed with its substantive work without further delay.\n133.\tEfforts to reform the international environment so that developing countries are given equal opportunity to participate equitably in the sustained progress of mankind are dialectically linked to efforts aimed at forging all forms of co-operation among the developing countries themselves. Those two sets of endeavours are not mutually exclusive. They reinforce and complement each other.\n134.\tIn this connexion, it is Zambia's belief that the significance of the recent United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held at Buenos Aires, essentially resides in its potential contribution to enhancing endogenous development on the basis of self-reliance and the optimum utilization of resources within and among developing countries, thereby facilitating the establishment of the New International Economic Order.\n135.\tMy delegation would like here again to stress the dialectical and complementary character of existing North- South forms of co-operation on the one hand and the new South-to-South forms of co-operation on the other hand. Zambia is confident that the Plan of Action adopted at the Conference  will be given serious consideration by the international community with a view to ensuring its successful implementation.\n136.\tFor Zambia's part, our authorities will continue to accord high priority to implementing viable programmes and projects to realize self-reliant development and to forging co-operation with other developing countries in various fields of common interest, including the critical areas of trade, transport and communications.\n137 I should also mention that my country was recently privileged to-act as host to a meeting of some 17 countries at the conclusion of which a declaration of intent was signed for the creation of a preferential free trade area for eastern, central and southern Africa. I need not state that this was a most significant step towards the establishment of an economic community, thus giving effect to our common desire to promote co-operation among developing countries.\n\n138.\tIn brief, it has become imperative to preach the sermon according to the New International Economic Order in order to convert constituents of public opinion and sections of national interest to the cause of structural change and a new world order.\n139.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea constitutes an essential element in the struggle to establish the New International Economic Order. An international legal regime of the seas, based on justice and equity, will be an important constituent of an equitable world order. In this regard, Zambia attaches much importance to the conclusion of an international convention on the law of the sea, which must of necessity cater for the legitimate interests of both the coastal and the land-locked States and of the developed and developing States. It is our fervent hope that in the interim nations will refrain from taking unilateral measures to grab the resources of the sea and the sea-bed.\n140.\tFor generations the Middle East has been characterized by incessant conflict and warfare. The situation in the area remains complex and continues to threaten international peace and security. Unless and until the underlying causes of the' conflict are removed, the durable solution to the question of the Middle East which we all desire will continue to elude us. In recognition of that fact, my Government has repeatedly called upon Israel to withdraw from all occupied Arab territories and to allow the Palestinian people to exercise freely their inalienable right to self-determination, including their right to the establishment of a sovereign and independent State. We shall continue to do so, as this position ,is consistent with numerous United Nations resolutions and constitutes the only realistic basis for a just and permanent solution to the problem of the Middle East.\n141.\tWithin the context of the situation in the Middle East I cannot fail to refer to the tragedy in Lebanon. We cannot turn a blind eye to the strife that has taken a very high toll of human life and has almost torn that country asunder. It must be halted and a political solution should be found that will allow the Lebanese people to enjoy peace and tranquillity.\n142.\tThe situation in Cyprus remains a matter of concern to Zambia. Once, again we must note the lack of progress in the negotiations aimed at resolving the critical questions that continue to threaten the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus. The negotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-General must go forward. We urge the two Cypriot communities to co-operate fully with the Secretary-General. We also reiterate our call for the withdrawal of all foreign military forces which are in Cyprus in defiance of the United Nations.\n143.\tWith regard to Korea, Zambia continues to support the efforts for the reunification of that country on the basis of the North-South joint communiqu\u00e9.  We hope that the aspirations of the Korean people for reunification will soon be realized.\n144.\tOne of the major preoccupations of the . 'United Nations since its founding has been the promotion of the inalienable right of peoples under colonial and alien domination to self-determination and independence. Southern Africa remains a major blot on the otherwise good record of the United Nations in the field of decolonization. In that part of the world the black majority of more than 30 million continues to languish under brutal and exploitative white racist minority regimes. The General Assembly, the Security Council and other United Nations organs have adopted numerous resolutions in support of the right of the oppressed peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa to freedom and independence. Each and every one of those resolutions has met the same fate of contemptuous rejection by the intransigent racist minority regimes.\n145.\tAs in all colonial cases, the preference of the oppressed people of southern Africa was to attain their freedom and- national independence by peaceful means. Before resorting to armed struggle and other violent means for their liberation, they exhausted, to no avail, all possible avenues. Even as they wage armed struggle, they remain ready and willing to negotiate the modalities for the transfer of power to them, if reason and sheer common- sense should at any time find entry into the minds of the die-hard white racists who oppose them.\n146.\tThe problems of southern Africa continue to preoccupy us in Zambia. The white racist minority regimes which are oppressing the African people in the region happen to be our neighbours. They are our neighbours, not by choice, but by the designs of imperialism.\n147.\tPresident Kaunda of Zambia has for over a decade now consistently speculated about, and drawn the attention of the world community to, the potentially explosive nature of the situation there. The movement towards that potential holocaust is gaining greater momentum. A calamity of immense proportions is dawning in southern Africa. The United Nations and the international community have a duty not only to deliberate on the problem but also to prescribe solutions to it and thereby avert the imminent catastrophe. Crisis-management and brinkmanship are required of all those who are concerned with the situation. Rigidity, cynicism, duplicity, trickery, bigotry, dogmatism, intransigence and their correlates have no place in resolving the grave situation in southern Africa. The situation is no longer a tragicomedy, but a real human tragedy.\n148.\tMore than enough blood has been shed in southern Africa since the advent of racist colonizers in that region over 300 years ago. Undoubtedly the attempts to exterminate the African people have increased in recent years as their resistance to occupation and exploitation has intensified. If the problem is not resolved quickly more innocent lives of both blacks and whites will be lost and we shall witness the beginning of an all-out war.\n149.\tWhat, then, is the root-cause of this problem in southern Africa? Unless we can diagnose an ailment it is almost impossible to prescribe the appropriate remedy. It is important to stress that the root-cause of the problem in southern Africa is the very existence of the decadent racist and Fascist minority regimes. Those Fascists are intent on clinging desperately to power as colonial masters under the pretext of racial superiority. Furthermore, those racist regimes in Pretoria and Salisbury have embarked on expansionist policies and aggressive actions against Angola, Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia, which support the right of peoples to self-determination and independence. Surely it would be folly to expect those of us who have fought for our own independence to remain apathetic in the face of the plight of the oppressed peoples.\n150.\tIf all Member States represented here were agreed on these fundamental principles the task of resolving the problem of southern Africa would be much easier. But, while many profess to support the cause of self-determination verbally, their overt or covert actions in support of those racist regimes negate their purported good intentions. Is the time not opportune for the high councils of the United Nations to act as one on all matters pertaining to southern Africa?\n151.\tIt is important for States Members of this Organization, especially those with leverage and vested interests in southern Africa, to desist from engaging in duplicity and deceitful manoeuvres.\n152.\tThe situation in Southern Rhodesia, the Zimbabwe to be, is pregnant with ominous consequences. The actions of the Smith regime in Salisbury show all the signs of neurosis. Southern Rhodesia is on the brink of exploding. History will not pardon all those who failed to act decisively while there was time. My Government holds the view that time to avert a chaotic situation in the British colony of Southern Rhodesia is quickly slipping away from the international community.\n153.\tThe so-called \\\"internal settlement\\\" which was concocted in Salisbury earlier this year has resolved nothing. Even its proponents now admit, albeit reluctantly, that the so-called agreement has failed lamentably to achieve a cease-fire or any resolution to end the conflict. Smith Is in fact not even prepared to hand over nominal power to his dear friends, the co-signatories of the so-called agreement. The issue in Zimbabwe is not\u2014I repeat, not\u2014whether the so-called internal settlement will succeed or fail. It has failed, and it is therefore no longer a bone of contention. The real, substantive issue is how to stop the bloodshed in order to bring about genuine independence in a country which is torn by civil strife as a result of the war situation.\n154.\tThe present state of insecurity inside Zimbabwe is so serious that neither whites nor blacks can claim to be secure. The Smith regime is unable to guarantee the safety of the people it purports to rule. Civil order has crumbled.\n155.\tThe fighting forces of the Patriotic Fund have extended the theatre of the war against the recalcitrant regime to embrace the entire country. The guerrillas from the .countryside have encircled the cities. Battles between the Rhodesian army and the Patriotic Front are common occurrences in the urban areas of Zimbabwe, including the capital, Salisbury. Surely no one can doubt the resolve of the fighting forces to liberate their motherland at any price.\n156.\tThe chief protagonists, therefore, are the rebel forces and the armed forces of the Patriotic Front. While the Zimbabwe liberation forces are fighting a war of liberation against a system of oppression, there are bands of armed men who are killing and exterminating hundreds of persons in Zimbabwe every week. These include the Rhodesian army and deserters from that army, and its specialized murder squads such as the Selous Scouts, the Grey Scouts and thousands of mercenaries drawn from South Africa, some European countries and the Americas.\n157.\tThe Smith regime has also helped to organize armed gangs for the three African cosignatories of the so-called Salisbury agreement. These groups are used against whomever they define as their enemy. As a result, one group is set against the other. Fighting between and within the internal parties has become a common occurrence.\n158.\tIn a desperate, indeed frantic, effort to exacerbate the civil war in Zimbabwe, the regime announced recently that Africans will be conscripted into the rebel army and that so-called martial law will be extended in many parts of that country, as if Africans had not suffered enough already.\n159.\tWhat we have to contend with in Zimbabwe, therefore, is a situation in which a desperate settler regime is fomenting a civil war among Zimbabweans both inside and outside the country. In the process, Smith deludes himself with his hopes that he can benefit from the chaotic situation which he has masterminded.\n160.\tThe other strategy which the Salisbury regime continues to pursue is that of seeking to externalize the conflict further to engulf front-line States, in particular, and other members of the, international community. By this strategy, Smith and his henchmen are hoping that should the front-line countries call upon their friends for assistance, the Western countries will come to their rescue. Smith is intent on provoking on East-West confrontation. We are already aware that the Fascist racist regime in Pretoria has resumed its massive support for the Smith regime.\n161.\tThe response of the members of the world community to all these problems has varied. Those who assume primary legal responsibility for Southern Rhodesia are both equivocating and prevaricating. In this context it was amazing to hear the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom state in his address before this Assembly on 27 September 1978 that \\\"The United Kingdom has never administered Rhodesia\\\" [10th meeting, para. 140], and that the United Kingdom has never been a metropolitan Power. The truth of the matter is that Britain colonized Southern Rhodesia. It does not matter-indeed it is irrelevant\u2014whether a colonial Power exercises its authority directly or through an agent. It amounts to one and the same thing. As far as the international community is concerned, there is no way in which Britain can evade its legal and colonial responsibility over Rhodesia. We therefore call upon the British Government to be decisive in dealing with the Rhodesian situation.\n162.\tFurthermore, I want to make it abundantly clear that in the aftermath of the publication of the Bingham report on British violations of the sanctions on the supply of oil to Rhodesia, Zambia will vigorously pursue, both in the\ncourts and here at the United Nations, its strong case against the British and other oil companies involved in this conspiracy since the unilateral declaration of independence.\n163.\tThe view of the Zambian Government is that the Rhodesian problem bleeds and yearns for a solution. If any talks are to be held, let them be convened now. Time is fast running out. Very soon it will be too late to find anyone to talk to, because the situation will have been overtaken by events.\n164.\tIt is within that context that we must view the impending visit of Ian Smith to the United States. It is with regret and great disappointment that we see that, at this crucial stage of the illegal Smith regime's apparent collapse, certain conservative members of the establishment have adopted strong-arm tactics of exerting pressure on the Administration to allow rebel leader Smith and his henchmen to enter the United States. In our view, the visit of Ian Smith to the United States not only compromises the position of the United States as a broker in the negotiations, but also seriously jeopardizes any renewed efforts at convening a genuine and meaningful all party conference.\n165.\tWe are aware that Ian Smith is visiting the United States not in order to discuss the modalities of the transfer of power to the majority, but to win support for his crumbling so-called internal settlement and the breach of United Nations sanctions against Rhodesia. Smith will no doubt use his visit to undermine the position of the United States Administration on the Anglo-American proposals by misinforming American public opinion and playing up to the sentiments of conservative elements in Congress. By succumbing to pressure, the United States Administration may well have tied its hands in regard to the pursuance of the Anglo-American proposals.\n166.\tSouth Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia continues to represent a major challenge to the authority and prestige of the United Nations. At its ninth special session this Assembly exhaustively analysed the question of Namibia and made important decisions imperative for the accession of Namibia to genuine independence [resolution S-9/2]. Only last week renewed efforts to seek South African withdrawal from\\\" Namibia and the transfer of power to the people of Namibia were undertaken in the Security Council. Hence, the collective will and determination of the international community to put an end to the continued illegal South African occupation of Namibia has been reaffirmed by both the General Assembly and the Security Council.\n167.\tThe action of the Security Council last week, particularly, offers. South Africa a sensible international framework for terminating its illegal occupation of Namibia in grace-if indeed there be any in the Pretoria racist regime. This is a unique and historic opportunity to solve the problem of Namibia peacefully. The South African regime must co-operate with the Security Council and, indeed, with the Secretary-General, whose unenviable task it is to superintend the United Nations Transition Assistance Group set up under the authority of the Security Council by its resolution 435 (1978).\n168.\tSouth Africa's characteristic intransigence, defiance and utter contempt of the United Nations must no longer be tolerated. Today we have a situation where South Africa is seeking to throw overboard and circumvent a proposal for the settlement of the question of Namibia which is the brainchild of its traditional supporters and allies. In our view, the five Western countries concerned have an obligation to ensure South African compliance with the proposal. Their inability to do so would raise serious questions about their sincerity in the exercise and would, indeed, have a bearing on their credibility with regard to the whole question of southern Africa.\n169.\tIf South Africa persists in its defiance of the United Nations and proceeds to hold sham elections intended to install its puppets in power in Namibia, we do not see any option but for the Security Council to impose mandatory sanctions against it under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charier. Those who have shielded it in the past cannot, surely, find further pretexts for doing so. We hope and expect that they will gather sufficient political will to support action by the Security Council against\tSouth Africa, and to join with the rest of the international community in totally ostracizing the Pretoria Fascists.\n170.\tThe ninth special session of this Assembly served the useful purpose of clarifying the various aspects of the question of Namibia. Zambia remains totally committed to the Declaration and Programme of Action on Namibia adopted at the special session [resolution S-9/2J. Let me in particular emphasize that we support the territorial integrity of Namibia, of which Walvis Bay is an integral part. We are also resolutely committed to continued support for the South West Africa People's Organization, the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people. Indeed, we commend that Organization for its heroic armed struggle, its statesmanship and diplomatic skill, which were the decisive factors in the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the proposal of the five Western members of the Security Council. \n171.\tSouth Africa, the citadel of institutionalized racist oppression and exploitation, continues to present a challenge to the United Nations and to all civilized mankind. More than ever before the world is confronted with a militarily strong, intransigent regime with expansionist aggressive designs in Africa. The Pretoria racist regime continues to perfect its already massive oppressive apparatus for use against the black people who are the majority in that country.\n172.\tThe obnoxious and illogical policy of bantustanization is still in force. In addition to the so-called Transkei, bogus independence has been given to the so-called Bophuthatswana homeland, while plans are afoot to grant similar independence to the unfortunate inhabitants of the Venda area.\n173.\tThe system of apartheid, which denies the humanity of people who are not white, subjects the Africans to mass killings, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention and to all other forms of inhuman treatment. Yet, the world this year is observing the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n174.\tIn addition, 1978 has been declared by the United Nations to be International Anti-Apartheid Year, for the purpose of focusing exclusively on strategies for combating the evil policies of South Africa. The United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid has done commendable work already in awakening the conscience of mankind to the plight of Africans in South Africa, including that of the political prisoners on Robben Island. But how much have the majority of States represented here done to focus on this important Year? In particular, how much have those who arm and trade with South Africa done even to ameliorate the conditions of the victims? Alas, most of these countries pay only lip service to our goals in this respect. They prefer to reap profits by all means at their disposal. Appeals by the General Assembly for disinvestment and a ban on arms trade with Pretoria continue to be ignored.\n175.\tIt would be folly to be taken in by illusions concerning stability in Pretoria, because South Africa is a powder keg. The events in Soweto and other acts of African revolt should serve as timely warnings. The oppressed people of South Africa will undoubtedly change the system. Let the South African Fascists know that they are sitting on a time-bomb which is bound to explode at any moment. Rather than deterring them, the savage oppression and repression of which the black majority of South Africa are daily victims will only increase their resolve to overthrow the apartheid system and liberate themselves. South Africa's military might and policy of creating bantustan enclaves cannot and will not be the solution. The African people of South Africa will surely triumph over the modern Nazis who oppress them.\n176.\tWe in Zambia are well aware that a change from Vorster to Botha is only cosmetic. After all, this confirms what we already know about the Afrikaner larger mentality of selecting the so-called leaders from the Verkrampte party clique. Moreover, Vorster has merely promoted himself to the post of President; yet this has not raised an uproar in the Western democracies We are watching the situation closely.\n177.\tI wish to reiterate here Zambia's total and unequivocal support for the liberation movement in the struggle for the emancipation of southern Africa from the racist and colonial yoke. I also take this opportunity to commend the liberation movements in Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa for the heroic struggles they are waging against the racist, Fascist and exploitative white minority racist regimes which have usurped their land and humiliated their people. We pay a tribute to the non-aligned, socialist and Nordic countries, and the progressive international community, which continue to render material and diplomatic support to the oppressed masses and their liberation movements. We urge them to continue to do so until final victory is achieved.\n178.\tI have delved rather deeply into the situation in southern Africa because, in the view of my Government, it is vitally important that there should be no illusions in the international community as to its gravity and ominous consequences. That situation defies the very central purpose of the United Nations. When the explosion comes, there is no way that this Organization or any of its Member States can afford to remain aloof.\n179. The Preamble to the Charter eloquently speaks about the determination of the peoples of the United Nations to \\\"save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\". Let it not be said that his aspiration was frustrated by some of the Governments that comprise the membership of the United Nations. Zambia has faith in the potential of the United Nations to fulfil the expectations of the peoples of the world and those of its founding fathers. We hope its Member States will not be guilty of having failed to demonstrate the necessary political will.\n \n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\t \n  \n\n1.\tPermit me first, Mr. President, to extend to you the most sincere congratulations of my delegation upon your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly. There can be no doubt that entrusting to you this lofty and extremely important responsibility is a well-deserved tribute both to your distinguished statesmanlike qualities and to your country, whose efforts for peace are known to us all.\n2.\tI should also like to extend my congratulations to the Vice-Presidents and the Rapporteur of this Assembly.\n3.\tPermit me also, Mr. President, to say to your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, how grateful we are for the competence and remarkable devotion that he demonstrated in the thirty-second session.\n4.\tIt is a particular pleasure for me to express to the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our gratitude for his invaluable efforts for peace, security and progress in the world.\n5.\tI should also like to take this opportunity to welcome most warmly Solomon Islands to membership in the United Nations. Let us hope that this new Member, whose arrival has enriched our Assembly, will have our sympathy and support.\nThis session is being held at a difficult moment in our history. Passions, covetousness, hatred and extreme selfishness are evident. Throughout the planet, hotbeds of war are becoming ever more frequent\u2014and particularly, unfortunately, on the African continent. In spite of an equally great proliferation of declarations replete with expressions of generosity and good intentions, the future of the whole of mankind seems to be in serious jeopardy. It is time for wisdom to gain the upper hand once again. Over and above doctrines, special interests and interests of all kinds, our major concern should be that mankind may flourish in a restored peace.\n7.\tBefore I set forth my delegation's position on the major problems that concern us, I should like to say something in parenthesis. These parenthetical remarks are made necessary by the absence of information following the events that occurred in our country quite recently and by the use that was made of it. It is for me not so much to justify what happened as to try to offer for your assessment an objective account of the facts.\n8.\tOver the past three years the Comoros have been going through an experience that I hope will never befall any other country. Apart from its destructive effect on our political, economic and social plans, this experience had a traumatic effect on the population at large.\n9.\tAt the political level, there was a reign of violence and excesses of all kinds. The country fell into the grip of a single man, under whose dictatorship the citizen was muzzled and terrorized and had to submit or be massacred. The country became a vast laboratory for one of the most controversial doctrines, which, according to its adherents, was to serve as an example to the world. The archives, registry office records and documents of inestimable value were destroyed in an immense bonfire, which was to mark the dawn of a new era. The public service was dissolved and power was put in the hands of young schoolchildren.\n10.\tWith nobody knows what designs in mind, all the resources of the Comoros were mobilized for the purchase of weapons and the maintenance of a very large army. Because of a lack of means to pay the thousands of workers who were working on the show-places that were being built here and there, most \\\"salaries-were suspended and forced labour was instituted. Arbitrary rule became the order of the day, and religion was the subject of derision and its followers were persecuted. This process, which had the most incomprehensible roots, led the country into an enormous economic morass. The country was on the brink of bankruptcy and the national identity of the Comoros was all but destroyed.\n11.\tFaced with such cold-blooded and deliberate devastation, with fierce repression, with people informing on each other, with corruption elevated to the level of a system, our citizens lived in terror and fear for the morrow. Many, risking their lives on fragile canoes, tried to flee that hell. Most of them will never return. They died at sea, shot down by machine-guns. Others died in their villages, also machine-gunned; as they sat in the sun in the public square, for example, at Anjouan, Grande-Comore and Moheli. These crazy massacres were everyday events, and diplomats \nat their posts in the Comoros or passing through were able to look into them and assess the cold cynicism behind them.\n12.\tOver the years of suffering and humiliation each of us tried to maintain our hope. We Comorians inside the country and those living outside, patiently combined our efforts to put an end to that yoke of oppression. It is necessary to have lived as we have through moments of painful distress to understand the relief of the entire Comorian people, its explosion of joy, on recovering its freedom, and its spontaneous acceptance of the changes which occurred on 13 May 1978.\n13.\tImmediately after that historic date we decided, to turn a new page, to devote ourselves to the restoration of democratic institutions and the strengthening of peace in the area of the Indian Ocean. Thus, internally, a federal- type constitution was prepared and submitted to a vote of all the people and approved by practically the entire Comorian people. This Constitution guarantees to all those living on our territory the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charters of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity [OAU]; it also founded a liberal society, one of the pillars of which is Islam\u2014Islam, which is the generator of progress and the source of fraternity among people.\n14.\tThe approval of that Constitution by the people is the first step, to which everyone aspired, that will bring us very rapidly to the establishment of all the usual institutions of State whose principles are based on freedom, justice and democracy: that is to say, the choice of a president, then a federal assembly elected by universal suffrage and, consequently, the establishment of all the structures of the State. This resolutely democratic process, which takes account of the rights and freedoms of each citizen, contributes-if there is any need for this-to dispelling any misunderstanding about the intentions of the team installed after the events of 13 May last.\n15.\tWe take this opportunity to declare solemnly once again that the Federal and Islamic Republic of the Comoros has every intention of respecting and abiding by all the conventions signed and international commitments undertaken by the former regime.\n16.\tExternally, on the basis of reciprocal respect for national sovereignty and the political choices freely made by their peoples, we hold out a hand of friendship to all States which love justice and peace.\n17.\tI stressed, at the beginning of my statement the concern my delegation feels with regard to relations among States. Indeed, they are becoming more and more marked by relations of force buttressed by ideological antagonism. Violence is being unleashed everywhere and, with it, its chain of despair, horror and desolation. We must acknowledge that, in spite of the progress, which is certainly appreciable, achieved in certain sectors, a great deal of ground remains to be covered if we are to attain the objectives we have set ourselves.\n18.\tHowever, we must not give way to pessimism or discouragement, because the cause is a grand one: it is on the level of creation itself. It derives from ourselves, from the unfathomable depths of our collective conscience. We must not allow an act prompted by fear, hatred or despair to unleash the apocalypse and nullify the great human endeavour. That is why peace remains our primary objective; but peace in its noblest sense, in harmony with our deepest aspirations, is still an abstraction incompatible with the degree of self-abnegation and humility of mankind today.\n19.\tLet us therefore speak more simply of putting an end to violence, that blind violence which has broken out in so many parts of our world, particularly in Africa. No effort likely to yield concrete results, however minute, should be neglected.\n20.\tLet me begin with Namibia, where the evolution of the situation is giving rise to the most profound concern. Indeed, the South African Government, basing itself on completely fallacious arguments, has no hesitation in flouting international public opinion and rejecting as incompatible with the initial plan the report of the Secretary-General.  That report, however, is the practical reflection of the plan prepared by the five Western Powers members of the Security Council.  Such an attitude on the part of the South African Government is liable to open the door to all kinds of adventures. For our part, we wish to reaffirm our firm support for the fighters of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], the only authentic representatives of the Namibian people, and venture to hope that the international community will discharge its responsibility for restoring the security conditions necessary for the attainment of independence by Namibia within the framework of its territorial integrity.\n21.\tWith regard to Zimbabwe, we strenuously condemn the delaying tactics and treacherous manoeuvres of the rebel Ian Smith, the head of the illegal Salisbury Government, who indeed, is making every effort to sow confusion and discord in the ranks of the freedom fighters in order to delay the advent of majority rule. It is clear that any solution that does not include the nationalist forces outside the country, particularly the Patriotic Front, is irrevocably doomed to failure. Those forces are indeed waging a heroic and legitimate struggle which compels our admiration, because it is moving with the current of history and is in keeping with human dignity.\n22.\tIt is urgent for the international community to take practical and effective measures to put an end to the criminal activities of the racist Salisbury regime and to create favourable conditions for self-determination in conditions of dignity and freedom.\n23.\tTurning to South Africa, we are filled with consternation that there should still exist in our day and age a regime whose very foundations, because they are so. unspeakably barbaric and uncivilized, are an affront to all mankind.\n24.\tThe Government and people of the Comoros resolutely condemn the humiliating policy of discrimination,\nconstant frustration and racial segregation practised by the South African authorities, who persist in turning their backs on the tide of history. They continue to defy with impunity the international community on the strength of the political, economic and financial support provided to them by certain States in spite of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the OAU.\n25.\tWe believe that the strict implementation of a general embargo on goods destined for South Africa, as well as increased assistance to the liberation movements, would constitute an important step towards the conquest of freedom by the oppressed people of South Africa.\n26.\tMy delegation reaffirms its firm opposition to the bantustan policy pursued by Pretoria. That policy is in fact nothing but a perverted means of perpetuating domination by the racist minority. We would consider as null and void any travesty of independence granted within this framework.\n27.\tOn the issue of Western Sahara, the Government of the Comoros approves the decision made at the most recent session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU to entrust the settlement of this question to a \\\"committee of wise men\\\" within the framework of the principles laid down by its Charter and the resolutions adopted on this subject at its various sessions [see Aj33/235 and Corr. l, annex II, resolution AHG/ Res.92 (XV)J. My delegation very much hopes that that committee will meet as soon as possible, and that the wisdom of the parties concerned, supported by law and equity, will prevail over all other considerations.\n28.\tWith regard to the Middle East, we believe that this matter deserves particular attention at this session, because of the threat posed to international peace and security and the risks of a generalized confrontation.\n29.\tWe can no longer remain insensitive to the sufferings endured for the past 30 years by Arabs and Palestinians in their attempts to liberate their territories. Nor can we remain indifferent to the tragedy of the Lebanese people, who have been dragged into a holocaust for the satisfaction of base interests.\n30.\tOur Organization condemns the annexation of territory by force, just as it recognizes the right of peoples to self-determination. Israel deliberately ignores these principles and, by its bellicose attitude, is blocking all peace efforts. This is a challenge to the whole international community and seriously undermines the credibility of our Organization. It is the duty of us all to put an end to it.\n31.\tWe welcome the efforts made by all men of goodwill to establish peace in the area, and similarly we reaffirm our support for the Palestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organization in their legitimate struggle to recover their rights.\n32.\tWe believe that any just and lasting solution in the Middle East necessarily entails, inter alia: first, recognition of the inalienable and indefeasible rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence; and, secondly, the evacuation of the Arab territories occupied since 1967.\n33.\tWe have every hope that our Organization will be unstinting in its efforts to achieve these objectives.\n34.\tMy Government is concerned at the evolution of the situation in Cyprus. The prolongation of the crisis though foreign intervention, requires urgent measures by the international community. Those measures should lay stress on the withdrawal of foreign troops and on the resumption of the dialogue between the two communities so that within the framework of territorial integrity and non- alignment it may lead to peaceful and harmonious coexistence.\n35.\tSimilarly, my delegation very much hopes that our work will contribute to the establishment and strengthening of peace in the zone of the Indian Ocean, in acc0rd3i.ce with General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI).\n36.\tWithin this context we support the convening of a regional conference on the demilitarization of that zone, so that ways and means of making such demilitarization possible can be rapidly worked out. For our part, the Government and people of the Comoros are ready to contribute to the achievement of this objective and we declare our determination to pursue a policy of friendship and sincere co-operation on the basis of mutual respect.\n37.\tThis question of peace in the Indian Ocean leads me, albeit briefly, to dwell on just a few aspects of the grave problem of disarmament. Indeed, at the present time the arms race has assumed alarming proportions. The destructive capacity of existing stockpiles is mind-boggling because, if we are to believe what we are told, there is enough destructive power available to destroy the planet a thousand times over. When we think of the scandalous disproportion that exists between military budgets and the sums of money devoted to development and survival of peoples in distress, we cannot help asking ourselves many questions about the nature of the human race and doubting the validity of the cultural and moral values governing humanity today. That is why my delegation is in favour, first, of the denuclearization of certain zones, particularly in Africa; and secondly, of stricter control over stockpiles and the manufacture of armaments under the aegis of the United Nations. What we must do ultimately is to bring about general, progressive and controlled disarmament which will guarantee international peace and security.\n38.\tI shall now turn to the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte. In this regard I should like to pay a tribute to the United Nations and to the OAU for their ceaseless efforts since 1975 to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of the Comoros. I shall not revert to the circumstances which gave rise to the question of Mayotte. Members are familiar with them since they supported the Government and people of the Comoros in their legitimate claims. As we have already confirmed, we intend to turn a new page and to dispel any misunderstandings which might have existed in our relations with certain States.\n39.\tThat is why, immediately after 13 May, we demonstrated our will to renew with France the dialogue which had been interrupted in recent years, thus complying with General Assembly resolution 32/7. To this end a Comorian delegation went to Paris to explain to the French authorities our views on. this question, that is to say, our advocacy of the reaffirmation of the Comorian character of the island of Mayotte, and the reintegration of the Comorian island of Mayotte in the archipelago.\n40.\tThose are conditions which can be subject to no concessions. The Comoros have always formed a single entity and in the colonial period that fact was endorsed by their constitution into a single whole, embracing the islands of Grande-Comore, Anjouan, Moheli and Mayotte. Their decolonization therefore could not take place in a state of dismemberment.\n41.\tHowever, in order to take account of the specific features of each island, we decided, as I have already said, to set up a federation which would include the four islands and would give each of them a certain measure of autonomy, in accordance with the aspirations of its inhabitants. The Constitution setting up this federation was approved on the basis of universal suffrage on 1 October last.\n42.\tWe believe that this attitude, which testifies to our goodwill, will contribute to the creation of conditions propitious for a just and equitable settlement. We await a response from the French Government and we count on the understanding and support of all friendly countries so that together we can put an end to this dispute which has lasted all too long.\n43.\tThe peace we want to see, peace in the noblest sense of the word, as I have just been saying, is difficult to achieve. But in spite of everything, we must do everything in our power to build such a peace because it is nothing more nor less than the primary precondition of life itself. If we want to be sincere with ourselves we must recognize that we are far from this goal. Nothing tangible in my view can be done without a radical review of relations, particularly economic relations, which prevail in our society at the present time.\n44.\tOn the one hand, for a very small number of people, there is wealth, exploitation of all kinds and an extravagant use of the products of the planet; on the other hand there are the countless masses of the third world who languish in poverty, disease and ignorance. Because of the scandalous injustice underlying even the very definition of the terms of trade, because of the inflation which with every day is becoming more acute and more widespread, to the detriment of the poor countries the gulf is widening and the threat of irreversible disequilibrium with incalculable consequences is becoming ever clearer.\n45.\tThat is why my country welcomed with interest and hope the proposals of our Organization to promote a new economic order which would be more just and more human. On that occasion, which should have proved to be one of the most important opportunities for the normalization of relations between the industrialized and the developing countries we applauded that initiative. We have not yet lost hope, in spite of the less-than-satisfactory results of the preliminary actions which were undertaken.\nHowever, we would like to welcome here the regrouping of the countries that produce primary commodities. Their awareness of their essential role and of their contribution to the expansion of the world economy, should make it possible, without any doubt, to eliminate the imbalance between production and the marketing of finished products.\n46.\tThe creation by developing countries of vast yet viable economic groupings in this regard, should be a priority in our development strategy. In fact, apart from the fact that it permits the formation of entities capable of becoming valid partners, it contributes also to the strengthening of co-operation among developing countries. This attitude will also be in keeping with the resolutions adopted last September in Buenos Aires at the end of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries. \n47.\tThe second observation, which incidentally arises out of the previous one, concerns basic commodities because of the essential role that they play in our economies and the threat of a paralysis or regression posed in regard to those commodities by any fluctuation in world rates or any natural disaster.\n48.\tThe setting up of a fund, recommended by the Paris Conference,  whim would make possible the financing of stockpiles of these primary commodities and would guarantee earnings from exports according to modalities at once flexible and effective seems to us to be one of the most appropriate solutions making it possible to avoid a repetition of the crisis, the consequences of which would be pernicious for the whole of the community.\n49.\tThe same applies to the transfer of technology, without which any action undertaken cannot be effective. Certainly we do not intend to call for this highly developed technology, as the lack of competent, skilled specialists, and the absence of appropriate structures, would make it impossible for us to use it properly at the present time. We are simply asking for access to this know-how which will help us to begin or reinforce our economic take-off. This point is particularly important because it will permit the developing countries to benefit better from their own resources.\n50.\tAnother question-and this will be the last-that holds the attention of my delegation is that relating to the new regime which should be established for the sea.\n51.\tWe agreed, at sessions held in Caracas, New York and other capitals, on the creation of an exclusive economic zone extending over a distance of 200 miles, without prejudice to the interests of other States in regard to international communications.\n52.\tWe also agreed to consider the resources of the ocean as lying outside national jurisdiction, because these resources constitute a common heritage of mankind.\n53.\tIn this search for a new regime more in keeping with the aspirations of the world community because it will be based upon more equitable and more moral bases, we should give priority to the creation of a supranational institution with the task of exploiting the resources of the ocean. The differences in development between States still, of course, prevent the conclusion of an agreement. But the exhaustion of most of our resources, which is going to take place sooner or later, condemns us to the necessity of having to achieve as rapidly as possible the elaboration of a policy statement which will take account of the interests of all parties.\n54.\tWe have defined this decade as being that of development. The establishment of a more just economic order has been the keystone to this because it would be the starting-point of all the actions to be taken to promote the rapid, continuous and harmonious growth of our States.\n55.\tThe work is tremendous and most difficult, but it is an exalting task. It is the basic task, and on the response that we give to this challenge will depend our relations in the future.\n56.\tMy delegation very much hopes that confrontations which are harmful to all of us will give way to sincere, equitable co-operation based on an exalted notion of the destiny of man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We consider the admission of this young State to be another step towards the realization of the principle of the universality of the world body as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and we wish to assure its delegation of our full co-operation.\n5.\tThe Vice-Premier and Minister for Foreign Affairs and leader of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to the tenth special session of the General Assembly on disarmament, Comrade Hafizullah Amin, had the occasion to speak from this rostrum  and to brief representatives on the background of the Great Revolution of 27 April 1978, when members of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, including our valiant and patriotic officers and soldiers of the armed forces, under the complete leadership of the Party and with the staunch and unreserved support of our noble people, triumphantly downed the towers of tyranny and despotism and crushed the last remnants of a decayed monarchy which vainly endeavoured to perpetuate its own selfish interests under the guise of a republican order. Before the day's end the banner of the new democratic order appeared on the horizon of Afghanistan triumphantly proclaiming an end to an anachronistic system of feudalism and aristocracy and heralding a new era dedicated to the principles of social 2nd economic progress and building a society free of poverty, corruption and exploitation of man by man.\n6.\tBarely six months have elapsed since our victorious revolution, and during this short span of time the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, the only true representative of our working and industrious people and the custodian of their sacred rights and interests, has striven unrelentingly to create conditions favourable to the attainment of their social, economic and political aspirations, and to consolidate the gains of the revolution by eliminating all reactionary and imperialistic plots and elements that vainly endeavour to thwart or impede this historic trend. We shoulder a heavy responsibility, but derive sustenance and courage from the knowledge that the forces of history, which have undeniably proven that the oppressed will triumph over the oppressor and the exploited over the exploiter, are with us, and that the will of the Afghan people is not to be taken for granted.\n7.\tIn the short span of time since the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan has been entrusted with the power of administering the State machinery great strides have been made in adopting the implementing measures geared to the social and economic development of our country, with the active and constructive participation of our people. Concrete steps have been taken to pave the way for a \\\"democratic agrarian reform; a five-year development plan is currently under preparation which envisages programmes in other sectors that will ensure the effective utilization of our natural resources, which for centuries were monopolized to serve the interests of a selected privileged minority.\n8.\tWe are confident that our efforts will not be in vain, and that, in fulfilling our historic mission and overcoming the under-development bequeathed to us by former regimes, we shall receive the unconditional assistance and support of all peace-loving nations free of any political or exploitative purpose.\n9.\tIn our external relations our declared policy of independence, peaceful coexistence, positive and active non- alignment and free judgement of international issues based on their own merit emanates from the profound aspirations of our people, who cherish peace and liberty and hold in contempt any ambitious designs of aggression or expansionism. We wish to maintain and develop relations of friendship and sincere co-operation with all peace-loving countries that support our April revolution, on the basis of mutual respect for the principles of equality, independence, non-interference in the internal affairs of others, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n10.\tIn this respect our relations with our immediate neighbour, the Soviet Union, are exemplary. This record of friendly and sincere co-operation and good neighbourliness established between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union is honoured by our respective people and all peace-loving people of the world. It is a shining example of peaceful coexistence that should be followed by all neighbouring countries.\n11.\tFriendly relations between the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the great nation of India are expanding and we expect similar relations with our two historical friends and neighbours, Iran and China.\n12.\tWe are equally hopeful that, in the interest of friendly relations and greater co-operation between our two countries, a just and amicable solution can be found through friendly and sincere dialogue for the only political difference existing between us and Pakistan, that concerning the question of the national issue of the Pakhtun and Baluchi peoples based on the national and historical background.\n13.\tWe have formally declared that adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights constitute the corner-stones of our foreign policy, and our reaffirmation of faith in those principles here today is not to be interpreted as the performance of a mere ritual, for it stems from our firm belief in principles which v hold to be self-evident and from our dedication to an Organization which has played - an important role in the fields of colonialism, racial discrimination and international development. But to be truly effective the world body must become an evolutionary and progressive instrument responsive to the dynamic changes which characterized our times, thus successfully fulfilling its mandate to create a world based on justice and equity and to promote international peace and security in all regions of the world in conformity with the wishes and aspirations of the majority of its Members. However, this objective has so far been frustrated by the short-sightedness and selfishness of a small minority in disregarding or flouting its resolutions, but ..'e believe that the Organization will rise to the challenge and point the way to mankind's more positive and nobler goals.\n14.\tAs we have repeatedly said, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan will support every measure aimed at the promotion of world peace and security and the enhancement of international understanding. In this connexion my delegation regards the draft proposal of the Polish People's Republic, namely, the draft declaration on the preparation of societies for life in peace, contained in the annex to document A/C. 1/33/2, as an important proposal which merits the favourable consideration of all peace-loving forces.\n15.\tMost of us gathered in this Assembly hall last met two months ago in Belgrade as members of the non-aligned movement to exchange views on matters of common interest and pressing political and economic issues that demand the urgent attention of the world community. The movement successfully demonstrated the ability to preserve its unity and solidarity against reactionary forces, and adopted decisions of far-reaching importance on questions of international peace and security, the evils of colonialism and imperialism, aggression and alien domination, racial discrimination and apartheid and the defence of the liberation of peoples and their right to self-determination [see A/331206]. We believe that these decisions, as well as programmes of action for economic development, can serve as useful and constructive guidelines in the course of our present deliberations.\n16.\tAnnual sessions of the General Assembly provide an opportunity to scan the international panorama in depth and realistically to evaluate achievements or setbacks in areas affecting world peace and progress. It is indeed distressing to observe that the situation in most of the problem areas is either kept stagnating or allowed to deteriorate and that even the process of detente has been threatened with tendencies which might revive manifestations of the cold W3'. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan strongly believes that such tendencies must be arrested and that the process of detente must be deepened and broadened to encompass all regions of the world, and transformed into a positive force geared to serve a new and more equitable system of international relations.\n17.\tWe should like to see that process of detente also extended to the military sphere. -No one can deny that the arms race has assumed unprecedented dimensions and that countless hundreds of billions now spent on armaments could well serve nobler purposes. The notion that military strength deters aggression has hardly any credibility in an interdependent world, and it behoves all States\u2014nuclear and non-nuclear, great and small, developed and developing to combine their efforts to arrest the spiralling race to increase nuclear stockpiles and sophisticated instruments of mass destruction, such as the neutron bomb.\n18.\tThe qualitative and quantitative increase in the production of conventional weapons is also of grave concern to all progressive and peace-loving nations, for these weapons serve as instruments of suppression in areas where peoples are struggling for the attainment of their legitimate rights against colonialism and alien domination, and help to perpetuate and expand areas of conflict.\n19.\tAccordingly, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan considers the effective implementation of resolutions adopted during the recent tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament to the vital importance and whole-heartedly supports the convening of a world disarmament conference with the participation of all States and of the United Nations Conference on Prohibitions or Restrictions of Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, scheduled to be held some time next year.\n20.\tThe delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan fully supports the initiative of the Soviet Union proposed by Andrei Gromyko, Minister for Foreign Affairs and head of the delegation of the Soviet Union to this Assembly, for the conclusion of an international convention on strengthening guarantees of security to non-nuclear States.\n21.\tWe also supported the inclusion of this proposal as an item on the agenda of this thirty-third regular session of the General Assembly as an important and urgent question.\n22.\tWe consider this initiative to be in the interest of world peace for it would promote trust and confidence among non-nuclear States with regard to their security.\n23.\tWhen discussing disarmament within the context of international peace and security, my delegation cannot refrain from expressing its views on aggressive foreign military bases on alien soil, which it sees as but an extension of the arms race and one of the main causes of world tension and complications in the region in which those bases are installed.\n24.\tIt is in this conviction that in our own immediate region we favour the adoption of the concept of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, and of putting an end to the military rivalries of big Powers in the Indian Ocean through the immediate dismantling of military bases and installations in that ocean, including those on Diego Garcia. All foreign forces should be withdrawn from the southern part of Korea. We view the presence of such bases as not only weakening the forces of peace and progress, but hindering the consolidation of the political and economic independence of the countries of the region.\n25.\tThe movement of the nations and countries of the world against imperialism, colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination has scored- an increasing number of victories in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and we are firmly convinced that the eleventh hour is striking for the last pockets of colonialism and alien domination in southern Africa. The national liberation movements of the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe and Azania are growing in scope and attest to the fact that the will of the oppressed people in southern Africa to resist the tyranny of racial discrimination and minority rule cannot be suppressed.\n26.\tConfronted with prospects of a complete collapse, the racist regimes have been compelled to resort to shameful manoeuvres in their final attempt to safeguard their economic and strategic interests, aided by their imperialistic allies, which, in defiance of world public opinion and United Nations resolutions, continue their political, military and economic collaboration, and extend such assistance even to the nuclear field. Yet they and their protectors will have us believe that they have resigned themselves to the inevitability of the process of liberation and that they are trying to adapt to it. But we have learned to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and are confident that delaying tactics and pacifying moves cannot deprive the African peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia from the inevitable attainment of their goals.\n27.\tHowever, to facilitate this process and prevent further bloodshed, the world community has laid down conditions for the process of self-determination in Namibia, and it is the earnest hope of the Afghan delegation that the United Nations will not relent in its determination to ensure their implementation. In the meantime the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the only authentic representative of the Namibian people, must be given all necessary support to continue its struggle against the atrocities and genocide committed by the South African minority regime. Similarly, in Zimbabwe the terms of any settlement must be dictated by the warriors of the Patriotic Front. We are convinced that the circle obsessed by the ideology of racial superiority will not be able to prevent the people of Zimbabwe from the exercise of their rights for much longer.\n28.\tAfghanistan, which had to wage an arduous struggle against colonialism and .imperialism and to safeguard its independence, feels deep solidarity with peoples resolved to ensure their self-determination, and thus hails the courageous decision taken by Mozambique, Angola and other front-line States to apply the sanctions decreed by the United Nations against the minority regimes of southern Africa, thereby rendering themselves victims of incessant threats and armed incursions by the white racist rebels. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan expresses sympathy and solidarity with the progressive regimes of Angola and Mozambique and other front-line States, and strongly condemns any acts of aggression against them. We consider such acts as threats to their respective endeavours to consolidate their independence and assist their African brothers in the realization of their rights to self-determination.\n29.\tWe are confident that, through their own efforts and with the assistance of other peace-loving nations, the genuine representatives of Zimbabwe and Namibia will soon join us in this Assembly hall.\n30.\tIn addressing itself to problems that afflict the great African continent the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, as a member of the non-aligned movement, cannot but express its views on the situation prevailing in the Horn of Africa, where parties to the conflict are members of that great movement. We believe that the parties concerned should settle their differences through peaceful negotiations and understanding in conformity with the principles of the non-aligned movement and the United Nations Charter, and we regard any intervention in that area as an attempt by imperialistic and reactionary forces to dominate the African continent. The delegation of Afghanistan fully supports the heroic struggle of the people of Ethiopia in defence of their independence and territorial integrity, and believes that any assistance received from friendly countries for that purpose is fully justified.\n31.\tThe question of the Middle East essentially revolves around the problem of Palestine a complex problem with regard to which this Organization bears a great responsibility. The question has been the origin of four successive wars in the region, and it has become Increasingly evident that until the Palestinian and other Arab peoples of the region recover their legitimate rights there will be neither peace nor stability in the Middle East.\n32.\tThe condition for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East is the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination, as confirmed in General Assembly resolution 323b (XXIX) including their right to establish a national State of their own, and the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories.\n33.\tTo this end, my delegation is of the opinion that the convening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, with the full and active participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole representative of the Palestinian people, will constitute an important and crucial step towards paving the way to a just settlement of the Palestinian problem and putting an end to the instability and insecurity that have characterized the Middle East region for over 30 years.\n34.\tAgents of imperialism and enemies of peace have not confined their activities to the immediate region of Palestine, but have expanded their activities to neighbouring peace-loving countries. The bloody clashes which are taking place in Lebanon are but a result of the critical situation in the Middle East. While the Arabs have been struggling to recover their occupied territories, forces hostile to the Arabs have concerted their efforts in Lebanon. We have followed the events of this fratricidal war and have been frustrated to see that the ray of hope that the contending armed factions would be reconciled has faded.\n35.\tThe delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan sincerely hopes that the conspiracies against Lebanon, the Palestinian cause and the Arab nation will be defeated and that all necessary support and assistance will be given for the restoration of stability in Lebanon and for the preservation of the country's territorial integrity and the national unity of its people.\n36.\tMoving from the Middle East region\u2014which encompasses the eastern Mediterranean\u2014to an island situated in an equally strategic region to the north, the Aegean Sea, and fast becoming an area of potential threat to international peace and security, namely the island of Cyprus, I am confident that I express the views of the majority of my colleagues when I state that the solution of this complex and dangerous problem requires that the territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence and non-alignment of Cyprus be ensured and that its internal problems be resolved by the Cypriote themselves in a settlement that would ensure the rights of both the Greek Cypriot and the Cypriot communities within the framework of a mutually acceptable agreement.\n37. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan strongly believes that this objective can be realized only when all foreign forces are withdrawn from the island and their military presence and installations are removed,\n38.\tTurning to the great continent to which we in Afghanistan belong, my delegation cannot pass over in silence the disturbing problem of the divided Korean people and the increase in the tension prevailing in that part of the world,\n39.\tMy delegation reaffirms its support for the relevant United Nations resolutions for the peaceful reunification of Korea free from foreign interference and considers the withdrawal of all foreign forces, including the dismantling of all military installations in the southern part of Korea, to be essential prerequisites.\n40.\tLast but not least, when reviewing the international political situation the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan cannot but turn to another great continent and express its indignation at the intensified determination and efforts of certain Powers to undermine the independence of Latin American and Caribbean States by creating such regimes- as would further their interests. We deplore the unabated violation of human rights and liberties in several Latin American countries where such regimes rule.\n41.\tPrevious speakers have dealt with the economic disparity between the developed and the developing countries. I should like to add that such disparity has not resulted from some inherent disability arising from their respective capabilities or resources but has its roots in the historical heritage from the era of colonialism and an unbalanced economic structure geared to serving and perpetuating the exploitative and unscrupulous interests of a minority group of countries that have piled up wealth at the expense of the developing countries to the detriment of two thirds of humanity. The stubborn resistance of the developed countries to the practical implementation of the goals and principles of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order, [resolution\n3201\t(S-VI)], the Programme of Action [resolution\n3202\t(S-VI)] designed to implement the Declaration and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)] testifies to their vain endeavours to preserve their selfish interests and inherited privileges.\n42.\tSuch resistance and reluctance to negotiate on substantive issues can only be interpreted as a determination on their part to foil efforts aimed at the development of a sound strategy which would ensure the balanced and realistic development of the developing countries free of colonialistic and exploitative purposes. Such resistance or lack of political will has also manifested itself in their failure to achieve the required target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for allocation as official development assistance to developing countries within the framework of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], In certain cases where such assistance has been available attempts have been made to infringe upon the sovereign right of recipient countries by imposing priorities inconsistent with their national development programmes.\n43.\tWe strongly condemn any aid or assistant programme that is dispensed on implied conditions of has exploitative purposes, be it within the framework of sluggish official development assistance transfers or bilateral assistance, for the bitter experience of the developing countries has demonstrated that reliance on such assistance is Witless,\n44.\tMention of the need to devise special measures to alleviate the debt burdens of developing countries also falls on deaf ears, Most of those debts invariably flow from what Is given those countries as aid at exorbitant interest rates and thus the purpose for which such aid was requested is defeated.\n45.\tThe current economic order based on relations of economic domination, exploitation and dependence is untenable in a world seeking justice and equity and an orderly utilization of world resources for the benefit of present and future generations. We of the developing world do not consider the present disparity solely as a matter of economics but as a moral question to which developed countries of the West must seriously address themselves by considering the justice of an economic system which over centuries enabled them to reach their present heights of affluence while condemning millions in Asia, Africa and Latin America to poverty, misery and pestilence. Let them consider whether trade dealings are left untarnished by aspects of exploitation and whether the trade deficits of the developing countries are not the direct outcome of such exploitation; whether the constant disturbances witnessed by the world monetary system, for which responsibility rests with them, are not a source of imbalance in trade and an addition to the huge burdens borne by the economies of developing countries; and whether crises in their economies and their increasing recourse to protectionist policies have not affected the developing countries' development efforts to overcome backwardness and to achieve social and economic progress for their toiling peoples.\n46.\tUnless the inherent bias of existing institutions is removed and unless the massive economic power of the rich countries is counterbalanced, the gap between the developed and the developing nations will continue to expand. The lack of foresight and the self-interested delays which pervade the treatment of major political issues must not be allowed to be extended to the economic field. Just as man's best hope for political peace and security lies in replacing the old power politics with a democratized international system, so his best hope for economic peace and security rests in an economic order based on justice and equity. Poverty and affluence cannot coexist indefinitely.\n47.\tIn this respect, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan would like to express its sincere appreciation to socialist countries and other progressive forces which have proved themselves the natural and active partners of developing countries by unfailingly supporting their demands for an equitable share in the world's resources and for the creation of favourable conditions conducive to their rapid social and economic development.\n48.\tAnother matter the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan regards as inseparably linked to the New International Economic Order is the plight of the least developed land-locked countries, which deserves special care and attention. The extremely high costs of transport weigh heavily on their export earrings and greatly swell the cost of transit for them. These countries are entitled to certain rights which we regard as natural, namely, the right of free access to and from the sea, including the right of free transit. We hope that when the new international strategy is formulated special consideration will be given to the specific problems and requirements of this group of countries and that transit countries will demonstrate the political will to respect and ensure those rights.\n49.\tIn closing, I should like to return briefly to a theme that I developed earlier. As we participate in this highly representative forum, the attention of the world is focused on us, and the peoples of the world have good reason to expect that this Organization will make positive contributions towards translating into reality the ideals of peace, democracy and social progress. We believe that the world body can rise to that challenge only if we, its Members, demonstrate a sense of realism and belief in human solidarity by responding to the call of humanity for co-operation, not confrontation, and ensuring that all actual and potential changes are directed to benefiting mankind as a whole.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff70.\tI should like to express my great pleasure at having the opportunity once again to address this gathering of representatives of the members of our world community.\n71.\tPermit me to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to this high office. To do so gives me particular satisfaction since your election not only represents a well-deserved tribute to you personally, but also does honour to Colombia, as well as to our Latin American region, of which you are one of the most outstanding spokesmen. In this connexion, my delegation is particularly pleased with the ever-increasing cordial and warm relations Suriname has with your great country.\n72.\tI should also like to express my delegation's deep-felt gratitude for the sincere endeavours of your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, and for his remarkable leadership not only of the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly but also of the three special sessions of the General Assembly held in the course of this year.\n73.\tThe independence of Solomon Islands and its subsequent admission as a Member of the United Nations constitutes yet another stage in the rapid liquidation of colonialism. We extend our warm welcome to this new and friendly nation and express to the United Kingdom our appreciation of its having brought Solomon Islands to independence.\n74.\tThe thirty-third session of the General Assembly opens against the grim background of increasing political and economic tensions and deepening crises which leave little room for optimism and which could aggravate already existing feelings of frustration, if not desperation. The most important and fundamental issues of war and peace and the establishment of a New International Economic Order remain far from settled. The nuclear and conventional arms race continues unabated. The rumblings of war are once again being heard in the South-East Asian region, where many had real hope for a lasting peace after the ending of the Viet \\\"n war. The Africans; already burdened with the scourge of apartheid and the problems of Zimbabwe and Namibia, are now being threatened by an extension of external conflicting interests and pressure in other parts of their continent.\n75.\tAgainst the background of increasing turmoil my delegation deems it necessary to say a few words about the general principles of our external policy.\n76.\tSuriname is a country which attained its independence only a few years ago. Its foreign policy is based, first of all, on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. As a developing country we are deeply committed to the ideals of the developing world aimed at attaining economic justice as between the developing and the developed nations. As a country of the Latin American continent and a member of the Organization of American States, we pursue an active policy aimed at strengthening our relations with sister countries of the Latin American continent and in the Caribbean.. My country was therefore happy to sign treaties\nof friendship and co-operation, as well as agreements on trade and on cultural and other matters, with Brazil and Venezuela and we are in the process of establishing an embassy in the Caribbean area as one of the steps towards cementing our traditional links with sister countries in that area.\n77.\tIn July of this year Suriname signed the Amazon Pact, together with Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru and Venezuela, to promote the harmonious development of the Amazon region. Also, the constitutional procedures in connexion with our entry to the Latin American Economic System have already been initiated. In doing this Suriname is giving form and substance to its policy with regard to Latin American integration.\n78.\tOn disarmament, since the Second World War, which, like the First World War was considered to be the war to end all wars, we have witnessed a mind-boggling nuclear and conventional arms build-up, a steady increase in regular armed forces and the greatest boom in the history of conventional arms sales.\n79.\tAccording to the highly respected Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, world military expenditures since 1963 have increased in real terms by about 40 per cent to reach the current figure of about $US400 billion a year, while in the past 15 years the world's armed forces have increased by nearly 30 per cent to about 26 million persons. Since 1963 the trade in major weapons, aircraft, missiles, armoured vehicles and ships has increased more than fivefold. It is a matter of deep distress and concern that the bulk of those weapons were sold to third-world countries.\n80.\tNeedless to say, my Government welcomed the initiative of the non-aligned countries in calling for a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We, together with most countries, regarded that session as being of vital importance for devising new approaches to arms limitation and, if possible, to actual disarmament, in order to put an end to the race of death in which mankind is now involved. In evaluating the results of the tenth-special session of the General Assembly one can take either an optimistic or a pessimistic view depending on one's expectations. As disarmament problems are politically as well as technically highly complex and the special session, after all, was not a conference designed to negotiate a world disarmament treaty, we would like to opt for a more positive appraisal, since we did not expect a major breakthrough.\n81. However, we agree with the President of the tenth special session, Mr, Lazar Mojsov, who in his closing remarks at the session said: \\\"If we have not lived up to the most optimistic expectations... this should not be taken as a reason for disillusionment or disappointment.\\\"\n82. Though it is true that no movement has been achieved in major areas such as the prohibition of nuclear and chemical weapons, a nuclear test-ban treaty and the question of linking disarmament and development, the\nspecial session nevertheless produced a generally valid Final Document [resolution S-10/2]. We should have preferred more far-reaching and explicit decisions, but, taking into account the magnitude of its tasks and the relatively short period of time the session lasted, the results are certainly encouraging.\n83.\tThe delegation of Suriname accepts, as a basis for further work, the three major elements of the Final Document of the special session, namely, the Declaration, the Programme of Action and the decision regarding the machinery for deliberations, consisting of the First Committee of the General Assembly and the Disarmament Commission, as well as the decision on a more democratic Conference of the Committee on Disarmament more closely linked to the United Nations.\n84.\tIt is our sincere hope that the discussions in the First Committee of the General Assembly will focus on the most pressing problems of disarmament and in particular on the question of a systematic and eventually total elimination and prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, without, however, underestimating the problems of other weapons systems.\n85.\tThe delegation of Suriname, furthermore, expresses its sincere hope that a deterioration in the international atmosphere will not have an adverse effect on the ongoing negotiations to achieve an agreement at the second series of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and a comprehensive test-ban treaty.\n86.\tAs signatories of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America, better known as the Treaty of Tlatelolco, we are highly satisfied with the accession of the Soviet Union to Additional Protocol II of the Treaty and with the fact that France has entered into contact with the authorities constituted by the Treaty for the purpose of examining the conditions under which its signature to Additional Protocol I might be effected.\n87.\tWe are also very pleased that the Government of Argentina has initiated the procedures necessary for the ratification of the Treaty.\n88.\tThe Government of Suriname would welcome the accession to the Treaty of Tlateolco of countries in our region that have as yet failed to seek such accession, as it is a treaty that affects all sister States of our continent.\n89.\tMy delegation also attaches great importance to possible regional extension of the ' Declaration of Ayacucho on the limitation of conventional weapons which was signed in 1974 by several Latin American sister countries, following the initiative of Venezuela.\n90.\tMy Government participated in a recent informal meeting in Mexico City, called to explore the possibilities of limiting conventional weapons in our region. The meeting dealt with the intensification and organization of regional efforts to achieve an ever greater and more extensive Latin American co-operation in this field. We are of the opinion that, as in the case of the Treaty of\nllatelolco, a regional agreement on the limitation of conventional weapons could serve as an example for the adoption of similar actions in other regions of the world.\n91.\tWith regard to human rights, one of the main purposes of the United Nations as formulated in Article 1, paragraph 3, of the Charter, is:\n\\\"To achieve international co-operation... in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion\\\".\nIt is therefore imperative that our Organization direct its actions against all forms of oppression and that it make its voice heard whenever and wherever those rights are violated. The Charter leaves no room whatsoever for selective indignation. A discriminatory attitude of the world body or its organs or on the part of its affiliated organizations in combating such actions would have a hollow ring and could rapidly stain and seriously diminish their credibility or effectiveness.\n92.\tThe apartheid policy of the Republic of South Africa is in direct and open conflict with the purpose of our Organization. It is a system of a sui generis nature, in that it is legalized by South African laws and enforced by the South African police forces. The killing, maiming and imprisonment of numerous victims are therefore not primarily acts of individual savagery but the logical outcome of the implementation of a system.\n93.\tThus it was not a haphazard incident that the forty-fourth detainee to do so since 1963 recently died while in the hands of South African policemen.\n94.\tWhat can we, as a Member of the United Nations, do while the South African time bomb is ticking away and martyrs such as Nelson Mandela are withering away in the dungeons of South Africa?\n95.\tWe believe that we should actively support the forces within the South African population that are fighting for the abolition of the repugnant apartheid policy. Those forces ~ are steadily growing in strength and numbers notwithstanding the rigorous organization of the South African State.\n96.\tThe delegation of Suriname, furthermore, is of the considered opinion that the arms embargo against South Africa is far from sufficient. The Security Council should now impose full economic sanctions. We are aware of the existence of two schools of thought on this matter. The opponents of the imposition of sanctions, many of whom can be considered to be sincere, argue that this would victimize the black population most heavily. In our opinion, however, they tend to overlook the basic fact that continuing foreign investments and trade are strengthening the economic and military position of South Africa and are thus contributing to the maintenance of the oppressive system.\n97.\tIn this connexion it should be pointed out that the seemingly more flexible attitude of the South African authorities with regard to the question of Namibia is not a\nsudden awakening of their consciences. The recent appearance of numerous newspaper and magazine analyses of how South Africa can \\\"beat sanctions\\\" speak for themselves.\n98.\tConsequently, Suriname voted in favour of a resolution, adopted on 25 May 1978 in Vienna by the United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations, calling for the termination by the transnational corporations of their collaboration with the racist minority regimes in southern Africa, a resolution which was subsequently adopted by the Economic and Social Council on 4 August\n1978.\n99.\tThe International Anti-Apartheid Year was officially launched on 21 March 1978. My delegation sincerely hopes that in the course of this year we shall witness real progress in the struggle for the liberation of the black population of South Africa.\n100.\tIn observing the International Anti-Apartheid Year it seems only fitting to announce that my Government has decided to sign within the very near future the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid adopted by the General Assembly on 30 November 1973 [resolution 3068 (XXVIII)].\n101.\tAs regards Namibia, my delegation fully supports the Declaration and Programme of Action adopted on 3 May 1978 by the ninth special session of the General Assembly on the question of Namibia [resolution S-9/2], as well as Security Council resolutions passed on Namibia on 27 July\n1978.12\tThe adoption of those resolutions, and in particular that on the principle of a negotiated settlement, is a tribute to the wisdom of the leadership of SWAPO, as well as to the strenuous efforts of the five Western countries, members of the Security Council, and last but not least to the statesmanship of the front-line States.\n102.\tWe are very much concerned about the question of Walvis Bay, as we consider that area an integral part of Namibia. It is an area which, since it includes Namibia's only deep-water port, is essential to the viability of the new nation. Namibia, if deprived of this outlet to the sea, would be at the mercy of South Africa.\n103.\tDuring the transition process the United Nations, bearing the primary and crucial responsibility, will no doubt be confronted with many thorny questions which, given the history of the many promises broken by South Africa, are surely to be expected.\n104.\tA successful outcome of the process, set in motion by the adoption by the Security Council, of the Western plan for a settlement of the Namibian situation, ultimately depends on whether the political will of the people of Namibia will eventually prevail through independent and free elections. It is our sincere hope that such will be the case.\n105.\tAs regards Southern Rhodesia, a successful result in the Namibian settlement may also influence the solution of the problem of Zimbabwe, an area in which we are faced with an equally dangerous situation. We fully agree with the Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, Ambassador Salim, that the so-called \\\"internal settlement\\\" is no settlement at all, but has, on the contrary, caused the conflict to escalate. One should bear in mind that the settlement, while appearing to transfer power to the black majority, essentially leaves all the instruments of domination in the hands of the white minority. Since its inception the war in Southern Rhodesia has increased in violence and intensity.\n106.\tThe hope for the convening of a conference to bring together all the parties directly involved seems rather dim at the moment. However, such an all-party conference based on the Anglo-American proposals submitted on 1 September 197714 is the only alternative to an escalation of the war into a prolonged and gruesome civil war. In the meantime, my delegation is of the opinion that the international community should continue its pressure In order to bring about a settlement of the conflict. Needless to say, therefore, my delegation will resist any effort aimed at lifting the existing sanctions against the Territory.\n107.\tThe situation in the Middle East is complex. The delegation of Suriname maintains the position that a peace settlement must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which contain the principles that all States in the area, including Israel, are entitled to exist within secure and recognized borders; that the Palestinian people is entitled to chart its own course and has the right to establish its own homeland; and that the acquisition of territory by force is against the rules of international law.\n108.\tMy delegation cherishes the sincere hope that the recent diplomatic events which resulted in the acceptance by the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel of certain formulas may eventually lead to a comprehensive and peaceful solution of the Middle East problem. In the light of the current situation we would appreciate the General Assembly's acting in such a way that existing, though understandable, feelings are not further inflamed.\n109.\tWe should like to restate our well-known position in respect of the Korean conflict, that we will support all efforts aimed at the resumption of direct negotiations between North and South Korea which could lead to a peaceful reunification of the peninsula. The efforts to reach a peaceful settlement will not be furthered by a fruitless debate in the General Assembly.\n110.\tMy Government will continue to contribute to and participate in future conferences on the law of the sea which deal with the interests of all nations on an equitable basis. My delegation is therefore deeply concerned at the planned unilateral action in the sea-bed, which will be counter-productive taking into account the progress that\nhas so far been made in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. In the light of that undesirable action concerning the sea-bed, my Government expresses the hope that the opposing views that have been expressed during the past seven sessions will be reconciled at the forthcoming session of the Conference in Geneva.\n111.\tA number of issues central to the establishment of a New International Economic Order were the subject of negotiations within the framework of UNCTAD; they were, inter alia, the establishment of a common fund, a code of conduct on the transfer of technology and the debt and debt problems of developing countries.\n112.\tWhen one takes into consideration that the concept of the New International Economic Order inherently accepts the mutuality of benefits from trade and foreign investments and that it proposes structural reforms to underwrite a more favourable division of the gains to the developing world, it is regrettable that those negotiations have so far not come to a successful conclusion. We are of the opinion that those negotiations between the developing and the developed world should no longer be reduced to global bargaining in which the industrialized countries make commitments only in return for concessions obtained from the developing countries. It is our view that mutual interest should be the only valid basis for future co-operation.\n113.\tWe welcome the creation of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, known as the Committee of the Whole, which is charged with overseeing and monitoring the implementation of agreements reached in our Organization on the establishment of a New International Economic Order and with facilitating negotiations on global economic problems within the United Nations. It is our view that the Committee must function in such a way as to have a positive effect on efforts to find acceptable forms of international cooperation for development and that the Committee must not pre-empt or duplicate the functions of other organizations.\n114.\tThe United Nations Conference on the Establishment of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization as a Specialized Agency, held in the first part of this year, failed to reach agreement on the draft constitution submitted for its' consideration. We regret the lack of the adequate political will on the part of some countries which participated in the Conference to reach an agreement. We hope, however, that during this Assembly this matter will be considered in such a manner that an acceptable solution can be found. In our opinion, UNIDO as an autonomous body could better deal with the comprehensive effects and aspects of industrial development.\n115.\tAs is known, we have endorsed the Buenos Aires Plan of Action adopted by the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held recently in Argentina. My Government will participate fully, in the activities to be undertaken at the national, subregional, regional, interregional and global levels.\n\n116. According to the Secretariat's latest world economic\nsurvey, the economic outlook for the developed world\nmarket economies in 1978 is one of slow growth. The latest\nworld development report of the World Bank seems to\ncontain the same pessimistic view. The economic difficulties\nof the industrialized countries and the prevailing\natmosphere of uncertainty about the growth of international\ntrade as well as the future movements of capital\nsuggest that it will be more difficult for the developing\ncountries to expand their economies in the coming decades\nthan it has been in the past 25 years. Even to maintain their\npresent rates of progress developing countries will need\nlarger' inflows of foreign capital while opposing vigorous\nand increasing efforts in the industrialized countries to\nestablish protectionist barriers.\n\n117. Seen in the context of the great diversity of\nconditions and multiplicity of factors, the prospects for the\ndeveloping world remain uncertain. However, it is a fact\nthat the economic repercussions around the world have had\na different impact on different countries, thereby greatly\nincreasing the disparities in development performance. All\nthis has led to a new challenge which the developing and\ndeveloped world in their mutual interest will have to face\nduring the coming years.\n118. The process of economic development in our region\nis characterized by imbalances and short-comings. However,\ndespite the economic difficulties of the world, a certain\nprogress has been achieved in such fields as production\ngrowth, increased per capita income and reduced balance of \npayments deficits. Nevertheless, the relatively more\nadvanced among the developing countries also continue to\nhave economic and social problems, such as income\ninequity and poverty, as well as high rates of inflation.\n. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the institutions of the\nUnited Nations and their relevant bodies will continue to\npay attention to these facts.\n119. As far as the general social and economic policy of\nmy country is concerned, I should like to quote from a\nstatement I made in our Parliament on 15 March 1978:\n\n\n\\\"The prime objective of the Government of Suriname is\nthe achievement of national economic independence. The\ndevelopment policy, which is attuned to this objective,\nwill be aimed at achieving prosperity as the basis for an\nequitable welfare policy. My Government holds the view\nthat the process, already started, for the realization of the\nnational goals of an increase in the economic strength of\nthe nation, an. increase in the availability of employment,\nthe improvement of the living conditions of the entire\npopulation and the regional distribution of development\nactivities must be intensified through the mobilization\nand participation of the entire population.\\\"\n120. World developments in the political, social and\neconomic fields make it imperative that we formulate and\nexpress an opinion such as that I have just presented to the\nAssembly. The Government of the Republic of Suriname does not purport to act as a reformer of the world, but we\nare of the opinion that the developing countries should play\na more significant role in determining international politics\nif they are to make an essential contribution towards their\nown political, social and economic development and progress.\n121. We express our views on, inter alia, human rights and\nfreedoms, disarmament, the establishment of a New International\nEconomic Order, the situation in. the Middle East,\nthe Korean conflict, the problems of Zimbabwe and\nNamibia and the apartheid policy of South Africa in full\nawareness that we may not and cannot live in isolation.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\n1.\tFirst of all may I congratulate you, Sir, as a representative of Latin America and Colombia, a country of noble traditions and respect for the rule of law and international understanding, on your unanimous election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. We are sure that you will be as successful in directing our work as you were at the head of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of your country.\n2.\tTo the outgoing President, Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia, we express our congratulations and gratitude.\n3.\tThe sad news .from Vatican City this morning, which has caused such deep consternation, impels me to make, use of my presence at this rostrum to extend our deepest condolences to the Holy See through Archbishop Giovanni Cheli, its Permanent Observer to the United Nations, on the death of His Holiness John Paul I.\n4.\tToday we welcome with satisfaction the admission of Solomon Islands as a new Member of the United Nations.\n5.\tUruguay is aware of its position and responsibilities in the international arena. We know that the world is undergoing a period of transition and a crisis of values, an age in which the acceleration and diversification of every relationship, be it cultural, political, economic, or technical, make our planet a one-way circuit, where no one can ignore anyone else's fate.\n6.\tInterdependence and, consequently, solidarity, which, after all, are the only valid answers, have ceased to be an option and have become a necessity and an imperative need. Therefore, and although it could be argued that the world's fate and the solution of its great political problems depend partly on an agreement and the goodwill of the world Powers, we must be concerned with everything that happens for we have not only the right but the duty to put forward our opinion and contribute with our thoughts to the search for rational solutions.\n7.\tThe change from an age characterized by the existence of a plurality, of States and centres of Power living in relative isolation, where the framework of political, economic and legal options covered a wide range of possibilities, to an age of increasing interdependence and unavoidable solidarity is not carried out without conflicts and pain.\n8.\tWe should always bear in mind when we think and when we act that respect for national individuality should run parallel to the fundamental notion of equal participation by all peoples and regions in the production and enjoyment of our planet's resources.\n9.\tUruguay considers that in this complex labyrinth of conflict, aspirations and claims, the rule of law is the landmark and the essential requirement for any progress as such;, namely, that which ensures and promotes the reign of civilization and peace and a full and dignified life for all individuals, peoples and nations.\n10.\tUruguay respects the rule of law including, naturally, human rights, and has a long and deep tradition in our laws and practices that constitutes an essential and indispensable part of our profile as a national community. That is why at this session of the General Assembly, which commemorates the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the delegation of Uruguay emphatically reaffirms its respect for and adherence and obedience to norms that undoubtedly constitute a fundamental stage in the long march of mankind towards the realization of its aspirations, takes part in the celebration of the anniversary with full conviction, and sincerely desires that human rights become an authentic and living reality the world over.\n11.\tMy country has given special attention to the question of disarmament. This is a question that must engage very specially the efforts of our Organization. That is why at the tenth special session of the General Assembly our delegation joined its efforts with those of other delegations which, like ours, sincerely desire the., achievement of satisfactory solutions. The results obtained thus far should be encouraging for they augur well for a future agreement, the importance of which cannot be ignored.\n12.\tWhile one of the primary goals of international law is the maintenance of peace, its fundamental requirement is obviously general and complete disarmament. The staggering figures involved in armament transactions in themselves show with sufficient eloquence the gravity of the armaments problem and remind us of a reality which is sad and depressing, for it constitutes a negation of the noble and still theoretical goal of disarmament.\n13.\tWe cannot but refer to international terrorism, that ruthless form of violence that threatens the right to life, freedom and tranquillity of all citizens, especially in those countries which enjoy a free and liberal legal regime. It must be stressed that terrorism implies the most brutal trampling underfoot of human rights and that no terrorist can ever shield himself behind such rights in order to justify his actions.\n14.\tUruguay has undergone a tragic experience in confronting terrorism and subversion, against which it had to defend itself energetically. The country has learned a hard lesson and will not accept a repetition of the situation under the pretext of respect for the human rights of those who ignore any right, to the detriment, precisely, of the prerogatives, attributes and dignity of those law-abiding citizens who cherish liberty and freedom and scrupulously respect the juridical order as the supreme guarantor of peaceful coexistence.\n15.\tFurthermore, it cannot be accepted that human rights can be invoked for political ends, transforming the so-called defence of those rights into an instrument of aggression and intervention, especially when this is promoted by those countries with a record of intolerant and authoritarian international behaviour.\n16.\tThe United Nations has tried year after year to find appropriate means of combating international terrorism. Uruguay is a member of the Committee appointed by this Assembly to find solutions to this question  and we should like to stress, once again, our disenchantment with the lack of specific results. My delegation would like to insist once again on the adoption of collective measures against terrorism, trusting that such measures will cover all its excesses and aberrations, a subject to which there was very fittingly special .reference in the report of the Secretary- General on the work of the Organization.\n17.\tFurthermore, we have publicly expressed our support for the recent statement adopted at the Bonn Economic Summit Conference, which we consider as a serious attempt to combat some very important aspects of international violence.  Similarly, we shall continue to provide assistance in the work of this Assembly aimed at drafting a convention on the taking of hostages.\n18.\tOur country favours the adoption of comprehensive and far-reaching measures to combat terrorism and to this end has presented concrete proposals, being acutely conscious of the difficulties and obstructionism in this connexion caused by certain sectors of the international community.\n19.\tUruguay attaches special significance to the next session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, to be convened during 1979, at which the decision-making stage will have to be reached.\n20.\tUnfortunately, this year the work of the Conference was influenced by the crisis surrounding the presidency. We repeat on this occasion the reservations of a legal and political nature expressed at the time by the delegation of Uruguay with reference to the decision adopted by the\nConference, which ignored the terms of the rules of procedure and the general principle of international negotiation according to which a diplomatic conference made up of the representatives of States cannot be presided over by someone acting in a personal capacity, or, in other words, without a mandate and not representing one of the participating Governments.\n21.\tThe expectations of all the peoples and Governments of the world concerning the development of the negotiations on the law of the sea, which have already lasted five years, cannot be indefinitely postponed. The feeling of frustration that this would create would be most harmful to the attainment of the vital goal of establishing a new legal order that would be an authentic guarantee of peaceful coexistence with regard to the seas, mutual respect for the sovereignty of all, full recognition of the rights and obligations of all States, the protection of the marine environment, the rational exploitation of its resources and effective administration of the common heritage of mankind.\n22.\tWe are now reaching the final stage of informal negotiations.\n23.\tFinally, the Conference should concentrate its efforts on the attainment of compromise formulas conducive to the settlement of those important questions which are still pending, and avoid the insistent and stubborn presentation of amendments to those parts of the informal composite negotiating texts which was so long and arduously discussed and so carefully balanced, and which reflects a generally acceptable basis for agreement.\n24.\tWe particularly emphasize that any text not originating in the concept of a status sui generis for the exclusive economic zone has no possibility of success. The juridical sui generis nature of the exclusive economic zone-that is, as a part neither of the territorial sea nor of the high seas\u2014represents the true balance of all legitimate rights and interests involved and expresses the true characteristics of an institution already in the realm of international common law.\n25.\tWe also consider that the establishment of the outer limit of the continental shelf in those cases where this extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the base line from which the width of the territorial sea is measured >s one of the most important questions among those that are pending, and that in this respect the formula advanced by Ireland  and supported by a large majority of States participating in the Conference represents an acceptable compromise, since it has a scientific basis and offers a juridically viable and politically realistic solution.\n26.\tWe should like also to reaffirm the applicability of the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor, and the Subsoil Thereof, beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction, contained in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV), and especially the principle that the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national\njurisdiction are the common heritage of mankind, thus constituting one of the bed-rocks of the new law of the sea as well as its main corollary, the international legal regime governing the sea-bed.\n27.\tWe also reaffirm the applicability of resolution 2574 D (XXIV) concerning a moratorium on the exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed, strict compliance with which is a necessary condition, from the ethical and juridical points of view, of any honest negotiation on the establishment of the international regime, including the international authority for the sea-bed. Therefore Uruguay is deeply concerned at the attitude of certain States which seek the unilateral adoption of national legislation to govern the exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed beyond national jurisdiction. That legislation and the actions initiated under its protection violate the above-mentioned General Assembly resolutions and, therefore, are contrary to international law and devoid of any legal value.\n28.\tFaced with these threatening prospects and the difficulties still confronting the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, Uruguay expresses the earnest hope that in the end common sense and the spirit of international co-operation will prevail. In this spirit, my country reiterates its sincere readiness to help to establish among all States and peoples on earth a true order of justice, peace and mutual and fruitful co-operation in the seas.\n29.\tTogether with these major issues of a general nature to which we have referred and which affect international politics as a whole, there are several concrete problems of specific significance because of the principles involved and their obvious or latent danger to peace. Because of their importance they should be faced in the most fair, equitable and restrained manner possible, for only in this way will we be able to arrive at a more efficient pattern of action.\n30.\tOne of the oldest and most bitter problems is that of the Middle East. Its origins go back to the-earliest days of the United Nations and the partition of the territory of Palestine.\n31.\tThe delegation of Uruguay has argued, and still argues, that all conflict can and should be resolved through dialogue and negotiation, in the light of the principles of justice and the precepts of the Charter.\n32.\tWe consider that Israel, born as a State through a resolution of our Organization, is an irreversible reality and that its right to exist as such demands the recognition of safe and secure borders.\n33.\tMy delegation also considers,- in accordance with the principles guiding the thought and philosophy of Uruguay, \u201e that the Palestinian people have a right to self-determination, namely, to the recognition of their individuality and autonomy in the international arena, and consequently\nto form a free and sovereign State.\n34.\tIt is because of all the foregoing that Uruguay views with satisfaction the steps taken and the ones being taken in this direction and enthusiastically supports the efforts being made in the international arena to bring the parties\ninvolved closer to a fruitful understanding which will put an end to this situation.\n35.\tIn the specific case of Namibia, our delegation considers that the Namibian people can and must accede to independence, and that there should not be any kind of foreign pressures involved.\n36.\tThe last great problem of a general political nature that we should like to mention here is that of racism, and specifically apartheid.\n37.\tThe policy of Uruguay on this question is too well known to require a detailed explanation. My country has been and is against all forms of racial discrimination and will support those measures adopted by the United Nations to combat this remnant of colonial barbarity as long as the means to do so are compatible with the legal principles of the Charter.\n38.\tDiscrimination has become historically untenable, and we see no reason why an understandable but misplaced impatience should encourage resort to blind and indiscriminate violence that will make it impossible in the future for the different groups to coexist peacefully and harmoniously.\n39.\tOn another subject, the environment crisis, with the dangerous deterioration of ecosystems, the accelerated extinction of animal species, the rapid exhaustion of natural resources, the insurmountable advance of desertification and the extremely disquieting pollution of all the living environment, is not an accident unconnected with the general crisis we are experiencing. The key to the success of our efforts lies in achieving the adjustment and adaptability that can reconcile man with nature.\n40.\tAs regards this question, my delegation supports the report of-'the Governing Council of UNEP, whose detailed study [Aj33/25] we shall present to this Assembly. We consider that this is a high-priority item and trust that the implementation of the projected programme will not be subjected to delays and difficulties of any kind.\n41.\tWe consider that the adoption of measures aimed at stopping the process of soil erosion is especially urgent. The gravity of this problem was stressed by the United Nations Conference on Desertification, held in Nairobi in August of last year.10\n42.\tThese questions are, furthermore, very closely related to the food problem, which is one of the most distressing problems confronting the world today.\n43.\tUruguay must express its special concern at the situation of the world economy, and especially the position of the developing countries, which are most seriously affected by this crisis. All the achievements of this institution would be seriously challenged if the increasing needs of the developing countries were not to be met.\n44.\tThe industrialized countries must realize that world economic interdependence is not a one-way affair. If the needs of the developing countries are not met, the acquisition of wealth could easily be jeopardized. The prosperity of the industrialized countries depends on the efficient use of production factors. If that use is perverted by the adoption of protectionist measures against manufactures and similar measures against food products coming from the developing countries, the ones to suffer in the long run will be the industrialized countries, especially their consumers, who will have to pay unrealistic prices for products which their own countries cannot produce at comparable prices.\n45.\t' We should face courageously the problems of structure and circumstance that beset us: the increase of protectionist trends in the developed countries, the slowing down of the North-South dialogue and the existing world inflationary situation.\n46.\tMy country is deeply preoccupied with the increase of protectionism on the part of the industrialized countries, since the prejudicial effects of this affect us directly. It is evident that this type of protectionist measure constitutes the greatest obstacle to a healthy development of international trade and a rational mobility of production factors, and is also a grave impediment to progress towards a new international economic order.\n47.\tFor this reason we cannot but stress the serious repercussions in the international field of the barring of beef imports by the European Economic Community, a measure which, although applied in the middle of 1974, following the new rules adopted by the Community, has since 1 April 1977 had serious practical consequences.\n48.\tFurthermore, my country, which is not a producer of oil, was seriously affected by the oil crisis, not only directly because of the increase in price, but also indirectly because the nations more seriously affected, such as Uruguay, were also barred from exporting those commodities which traditionally carry the most weight with industrialized buyers, since the recession they were suffering served as a pretext to strengthen their protectionist barriers. All this was aggravated by competition from other markets because of the subsidies policies applied by the developed countries, which has led to a drop in price's and consequently affected our ability to compete.\n49.\tAttention should be especially drawn to the so-called \\\"voluntary agreements\\\" through which quantitative restrictions are placed on imports, disregarding the clear decisions contained in international trade agreements to benefit developing countries. This is why we look forward to the neutralization of these tendencies through the fruitful results of the multilateral trade negotiations, as well as UNCTAD's Integrated Programme of Commodities.\n50.\tThe slowing down of the North-South dialogue discourages us, a feeling which is increased by the limited implementation of the resolutions of the sixth and seventh special sessions and the suspension of the work of the Committee of the Whole'2 oil economic questions.\n51.\tOne of the fundamental tasks of this Assembly will be to define clearly the terms of reference of the Committee, so as to make it the central co-ordinating organ of the over-all United Nations system dealing with economic questions. Through this organ the North-South dialogue could be channelled and promoted within the United Nations.\n52.\tIn order to function as it should, that Committee must negotiate guidelines on problems of general policy, as well as agreements on pending problems that have been fundamentally related to international economic co-operation. The results of these negotiations will take the form of action-oriented conclusions and will provide a framework for this to be initiated by the competent bodies.\n53.\tThe inflation affecting the main international currency has a serious impact on the developing countries, and makes it essential to find solutions to this financial problem.\n54.\tThe erratic fluctuation of exchange rates is one of the inhibiting factors in international trade. If we have to face factors limiting trade it will be difficult to recover from the present recession.\n55.\tThe consequent uncertainty about export prices is something which discourages investment, and if any two things are closely connected they are the rate of investment and the rate of growth of the gross national product.\n56.\tUncertainty about exchange rates is an inflationary factor in itself. The producers and exporters try to protect themselves against losses by marking up their stock of products.\n57.\tMonetary uncertainty also affects the long-term or slow-yield investments such as investments in major industrial plants.\n58.\tThe developing countries are doubly affected by the drop in value of the dollar. In the first place they import inflation and in the second place the value of their exports in terms of a stable currency is also affected, increasing the cost of inputs they must import.\n59.\tMy country views with satisfaction the constructive results of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, recently concluded in Buenos Aires with the adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action being submitted for consideration by this Assembly.\n60.\tWe look forward to the approval and rapid implementation of this Plan of Action within the United Nations economic system. We also look forward to the prompt implementation by all States here of the undertakings entered into in Buenos Aires, which introduce into international economic relations the fruitful concept of cooperation among developing countries. We are convinced that these commitments constitute an important instrument for the establishment of a new international economic order and also open the door to better understanding among all the peoples on earth.\n61.\tWe should not like to close this statement without making reference to the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization [A]33/1]. We must admit to being greatly impressed by its frankness, objectivity and outstanding precision in its treatment of the various topics it discusses. It likewise brings out clearly the enormous task faced by the services in charge of the functioning of this Organization. We therefore wish to congratulate the Secretary-General and, through him, the United Nations staff members.\nIn conclusion, we should like to express our faith, virtually religious faith, in the final advent of peace to the world, in the eradication of poverty and in the development of a solid and efficient United Nations system which enjoys the trust and support of its Member nations and wins respect for the wise and good principles of the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n\n38.\tMr. President, for Latin America your election as President of the General Assembly is an event of singular importance. That is because we consider you a distinguished exponent of Latin-American thought, to which you have made an invaluable contribution as a writer, researcher, historian, and perspicacious analyst of social and economic problems in the area, and because you are a staunch defender of the interests of the third world. You have come to preside over this session of the General Assembly at a complex period of history, a period reflected in a body of difficult topics which, because they are well known to you, will not stand in the way of your wise\ndirection of our proceedings as we try to pave the way to positive solutions.\n39.\tOn behalf of my country, I wish to offer an expression of sincere congratulations to the distinguished statesman of Yugoslavia, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, for the extraordinary contribution he made to the ideals and purposes of the United Nations as President of the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly and of the eighth, ninth and tenth special sessions, devoted to the questions of Lebanon, Namibia and world disarmament, respectively.\n40.\tPanama shares the joy of the international community at seeing Solomon Islands enter the United Nations. That is a memorable event, not only because Solomon Islands is a country worthy of respect and admiration, but also because now that there are ISO States in the General Assembly our Organization has taken impressive strides towards the ideal of universality.\n41.\tIn addition, my country deems it a good omen that the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries was held eight weeks ago in Belgrade to consider progress in the policy of non-alignment in ail areas of the world and we note the undeniable importance of the co-ordinated action of the non-aligned countries in the work of this Assembly. This is a fitting occasion, then, to stress the fact that the Conference paid a tribute to the invaluable contribution of President T o of Yugoslavia to the strengthening of the policy of non-alignment and its progressive consolidation as a factor and independent force in the building of a new system of international relations chat will be more equitable and just, to the opinion of my country\u2014which held one of the vice-presidencies of the Conference held at Belgrade and presided over the working group in charge of the drafting of the section containing the political declaration on Latin-American subjects the importance of the work of that gathering will be demonstrated in the deliberations on the items on the agenda of this session of the Assembly. The effectiveness of the non-aligned movement lies in the co-ordinated action of the developing countries which make it up and which also make up two-thirds of mankind. Their weight cannot be underestimated in the process of rebuilding the political and economic structure of today's world.\n42.\tIn the political realm, the non-aligned counties have the major responsibility of maintaining the real spirit and genuine identity of the movement as an alternative to the dictates of the super-Powers. The unity of the non-aligned countries consequently represents the necessary basis for action to prevent rivalries among blocs and military pacts in their struggle to achieve spheres of influence and to pursue die arms race, the most serious consequences of which must be borne by the developing countries. There can be for them no prospect or other alternative but a regime based on peace and mutual respect among States which have different social systems, but which guarantee to each people its right to determine for itself everything that affects its destiny.\n43.\tThe fact that the Heads of State and Government of fifty non-aligned countries will meet in Latin America for the first time at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or\nGovernment of Non-Aligned Countries, to bi. held between 3 and 7 September 1079 in Havana, offers new hopes for the developing countries. That Conference at the highest level will be a magnificent forum for the nations of the third world which are anxious to study, analyse and take action to solve the major political, economic and social problems of our time within the balanced framework of non-alignment. There is every reason for us to hope that the summit Conference in Havana, will represent a magnificent contribution to peace, security and justice in today's world.\n44.\tDuring the general debate which took place in the Assembly last year, the Chairman of the delegation of Panama brought to the attention of participating delegations that on 7 September 1977 the Panama Canal Treaty3 and the Treaty concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal4 were signed in Washington. Today I take great pleasure in announcing that both treaties were approved by the Panamanian people in a national plebiscite which was held in accordance with our constitutional procedures. That plebiscite was carried out in the presence of United Nations observers appointed by the Secretary-General, who bore witness to the due and democratic nature of that\\\" consultation of the people.\n45.\tSubsequently the United States Senate, in accordance with the Constitution of the United States, approved both Canal Treaties, with certain amendments, conditions, reservations and understandings. As a consequence of the foregoing, on 16 June 1978 the Head of Government of the Republic of Panama, General Omar Torrijos Herrera, and President Jimmy Carter of the United States, exercising their respective constitutional powers, met in the city of Panama to exchange respective instruments of ratification and to sign the protocol on the exchange of instruments of ratification. In accordance with a rule established by the United States Senate, the exchange of instruments of ratification would be considered to take effect on 1 April 1979.\n46.\tThe Treaties will enter into effect simultaneously after six calendar months, starting with the date of the exchange of instruments of ratification and their entry into force, which will be 1 October 1979.\n47.\tThe execution of the Canal Treaties requires that Panama reformulate its development strategy, which will make it possible to make the maximum use of new sources of resources, placing under its sovereignty the political and economic aspects of part of its territory which for more than 70 years had been removed from the full exercise of its sovereignty.\n48.\tThe people and the Government of Panama are grateful to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the General Assembly of the Organization of American States /OAS],. and the movement of non-aligned countries for the support: which Panama's demands had always received,\n49.\tMy country is well aware that this Assembly of nations, when commemorating the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Amphictyonic Congress, which met in Panama at the request of Bolivar in 1826, decided to adopt on 17 December 1976 resolution 31/142, paragraph 4 of which formulates the wish for a successful outcome of the negotiations for the conclusion of s new treaty on the Panama Canal, which would eliminate the causes of conflict between Panama and the United States of America, determine the speedy return to Panama of the Panamanian territory of which the Panama Canal is a part and stipulate that the Republic of Panama would assume total responsibility for the operation of the inter-oceanic Canal upon the termination of the treaty.\n50.\tMy country was particularly pleased that the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries decided to include in its final Declaration the statement that\n\\\"The Conference greet:, the conclusion and ratification by Panama and the United States of the Panama Canal Treaties of 1977 as an important step towards restoring Panama's territorial integrity and effective sovereignty throughout its national territory, including the strip of land where the canal is situated, which has contributed to the decolonization of Latin America.... The non-aligned countries will continue to extend support to Panama in securing the full and consistent implementation of these treaties. The Ministers take note that Panama and the United States have agreed to open the Protocol of the Treaty on the Permanent Neutrality of the Canal to the accession of all countries, and therefore the Ministers decided to call upon all States of the world to accede to the Protocol, to respect the permanent neutrality of the Canal and to strictly observe the principle of non-intervention in Panamanian affairs. \n51.\tImmediately before the Belgrade Declaration on permanent neutrality, on 14 July 1978, the Foreign Ministers of Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama and Venezuela signed in the city of Panama a joint declaration on questions of common interest, both for the well-being of their respective peoples and for the unity and integration of Latin America. In that declaration the Foreign Ministers of Colombia, Costa Rica and Venezuela expressed the intention of their Governments to sign the Protocol to the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal.\n52.\tAs the Protocol will be open to accession by all the States of the world, on the entry into force of the Treaty on the neutrality of the inter-oceanic waterway, the Foreign Ministers of Colombia, Costa Rica, and Venezuela asked the Governments of the other Latin-American countries to adhere to the Protocol to the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal whereby access to the Canal by the ships of all nations on a basis of complete equality would be assured at all times.\n53.\tMy Government believes that accession to the Protocol to the Treaty on the neutrality of the Panama Canal will contribute to the strengthening of international security and to the promotion of peaceful co-operation in accordance with the United Nations Charter. We are\nconvinced that this is a measure which will contribute to peace, friendship and international co-operation. We therefore invite all States Members of the United Nations and other members of the international community to accede to the Protocol.\n54.\tSince on 10 December next the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights will be celebrated, we believe that is a fitting occasion for all Member States to combine special efforts to promote international understanding, co-operation, peace and universal and effective respect for human rights in harmony with the appeal in this sens0, made by the Commission on Human Rights.\n55.\tPanama, as a signatory of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Optional Protocol to the latter, which entered into force on 3 January 1976, is interested in both the entry into force of, and strict compliance with, those instruments. We have placed our trust in the effectiveness of the Committee on Human Rights, made up of 18 recently elected members. At the regional level, Panama supports the establishment of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and for that purpose we have signed and ratified the constituent instrument of that body.\n56.\tPanama shares the position of those States that recognize the universal value of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and we ascribe priority importance to respect for, and the effectiveness of, human rights of an economic and social nature. In our opinion, hunger, poverty, unemployment and economic weakness are negative factors which work against the dignity of human beings.\n57.\tIn line with these preoccupations, we must admit that we are not encouraged by the progress which has been made thus far in various bodies of the United Nations system in establishing a new international economic order. The creation of the Committee established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, or the Committee of the Whole, has not fulfilled our hopes and expectations, particularly because of inadequate co-operation on the part of the industrialized and highly developed countries, which so far have questioned the terms of reference of the Committee, thus detracting from its fundamental characteristic as a forum for negotiations.\n58.\tThere has been a tendency to abandon negotiations and understanding and take a unilateral course of action. That seems to be the attitude that one of the super-Powers has taken recently. One of its governmental bodies has shown a tendency to allow its enterprises to exploit the sea-bed beyond its national jurisdiction.\n59.\tThe Chairman of the Group of 77 made a statement at the last plenary meeting of the seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Seas objecting to this unilateral procedure because it runs\ncounter to the will of the international community, which has deemed that the sea-bed is the common heritage of mankind. That interpretation of the matter was in keeping with the views of the third world and a number of important States of the industrialized world.\n60.\tIt is Panama's hope that the attempt by the State to which we have been referring to impose unilateral legislation will be reconsidered and corrected so that the strenuous efforts being made to conclude next year an all-inclusive convention on the law of the sea within the United Nations system will not be undermined.\n61.\tIn view of the imminence of the fifth session of UNCTAD, which is only eight months away, and in view of the proximity of the special session which is scheduled to take place in 1980 to adopt the new international development strategy for the decade of the 1080s, it is imperative that both the developed and the developing countries find new ways of coming together so that the work of the Committee of the Whole may he more fruitful and positive. Therefore we are pleased that both the General Committee and the Assembly in its plenary meetings have, as a result of an initiative of the Group of 77 agreed to introduce the item on development and international co-operation as a priority matter on the agenda of the present session and to begin consideration of the matter in plenary meetings as soon as the general debate is completed.\n62.\tIn the Declaration on Namibia and Programme of Action in Support of Self-Determination and National Independence for Namibia, contained in General Assembly resolution S-9/2 adopted at the ninth special session, not only is it reaffirmed that the people of Namibia have an inalienable right to \\\"self-determination, freedom and national independence in a united Namibia1\\\", but also the international community is urged to take final action to ensure the complete and unconditional withdrawal of South Africa from Namibian territory and thereby eliminate the serious threat to international peace and security created by South Africa. In this process due consideration ii given to the roles that should be played by the United Nations Council for Namibia and SWAPO.\n63.\tWe believe that the freedom of Namibia represents a commitment the United Nations cannot shirk. Hence the Government of Panama attaches major importance to the report of the Secretary-General submitted to the Security Council on 29 August 1978 which contains the outline of a plan for the speedy achievement of independence for Namibia by means of free elections to be held under the supervision and control of the United Nations m accordance with the plan proposed for this purpose by the five Western members of the Security Council. Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, United Kingdom and the United States [S/12636] relating to a settlement of the situation in Namibia, a plan already endorsed by the Council in its resolution.\n64.\tThe international community has followed with deep concern deliberations and consultations engaged in by the Secretary-General, the President of the Security Council, SWAPO, the five Western members of the Council who have sponsored the independence plan, the front-line African countries and the spokesmen of the group of African States as a whole.\n65 That concern has been increased by the unexpected objections of the Vorster regime just when it seemed that a harmonious solution of the question of Namibia under the auspices of the United Nations was under way. We share the Secretary-General's hope that good sense will prevail and that further efforts will be made with the co-operation of all parties concerned to meet the just expectations of the people of Namibia, who are hoping for liberation and independence.\n66.\tThe Government of Panama wishes to repeat that it is prepared to co-operate in the general effort all must make and to stand behind the ideals and aspirations of the brotherly African countries. To that end, through the Secretary-General, my Government has already offered a contingent of Panamanian soldiers in case their presence could be useful in the process of leading Namibia to independence, by facilitating the peaceful transition of that nation towards effective sovereignty and full jurisdiction over its national territory, including Walvis Bay.\n67.\tMy delegation cannot fail to refer also to the question of the Middle East, where there is a conflict that most directly threatens peace and international security and that, consequently, must be resolved by respecting the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, and in particular Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973).\n68.\tPanama believes that a just and lasting solution must comprise the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories, respect for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination and to its own independence\tand the right of Israel and the States and peoples of the region to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.\n69.\tThe Government of Panama participated in the consensus that the United Nations Security Council reached on 11 November 1976,7 with the consent of its permanent members, China, France, the USSR, the United Kingdom and the United States, whereby it was decided, inter alia, that all measures taken by Israel with the aim of changing the status of Jerusalem are null and void and must remain without effect. Panama, like the Vatican, does not recognize the annexation of Jerusalem and will insist on the internationalization of the Holy Places.\n70.\tAll the efforts being made to produce the solutions that have been mentioned by peaceful means such as negotiation, mediation, conciliation and other harmonious approaches, must be greeted with sympathy and enthusiasm by the international community.\n71.\tIn this respect my country welcomes the peace initiative sponsored by President Jimmy Carter of the\nUnited States, who brought together at Camp David the President of Egypt, Anwar El-Sadat, and the Prime Minister of Israel, Menachem Begin. Without prejudging the substance of the agreements reached, which cover matters that arc extremely difficult and arouse deep emotions in the peoples of the area, it is our hope that the peace initiative of President Carter and the spirit of Camp David will help to create the climate of calm and understanding needed to move through successive stages towards a just and constructive settlement of the conflict.\n72.\t(t is a truism that, just as human rights and the fundamental freedoms of the individual and of peoples, are inalienable, so is personal freedom inseparable from the right of human beings to satisfy their economic needs with dignity.\n73.\tThe Government of Panama will make a special effort to meet the health, housing, food, recreation, employment and recreation needs of all the inhabitants of our country without any discrimination or limitation based on origin, sex, belief or nationality.\n74.\tOn the basis of those principles, which are fundamental to Panama's policies, in the Commission on Human Rights, of which we are a member, we supported resolution 4 (XXXIII), 8 paragraph 4, of which recommends to the Economic and Social Council to invite the Secretary-General, in co-operation with UNESCO, to present to the Commission on Human Rights at its thirty-fifth session a study on the international dimensions of the right to development as a human right, together with other rights based on international co-operation, including the right to peace, taking into account the requirements of the New International Economic Order and fundamental human needs\n75.\tI do not wish to conclude my comments on human rights without stressing most emphatically our historic commitment, together with countries of Africa, to the struggle of our African brothers against insolent and oppressive racism. From the very beginning, we endorsed the anti-racist cause in the United Nations, perhaps because we had had bitter experiences with that evil in our own country. At the opening recently of the World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination in Geneva, the head of the Government of Panama, General Omar Torrijos, sent to the Chairman of that Conference a warm message, the final paragraph of which stated:\n\\\"On behalf of the Government and the people of Panama, we hope that this Conference in Geneva will be successful, so that the men and women from all parts assembled there will set in motion the final offensive to eradicate once and for all the racist cancer which is the scourge of mankind and begin a new effort to promote peace and human dignify and the values of the human person on the basis of the equality of human rights of men and women in all areas of the world.\\\"\n76.\tWe believe that to the extent that every country respects the dignity of human beings and their fundamental\n8 See Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, Sixty-second Session, Supplement No. 6, chap. XXI.\nrights, affording them the necessary well-being for their fulfilment, the essential conditions for peace and development and friendly relations and co-operation among States will be established.\n77.\tThe Government of Panama cannot remain indifferent to the bloodshed that has been taking place for many months now in Nicaragua, which has caused a great loss of life and which in recent days has reached alarming proportions. To measure the impact of these tragic events on the public opinion in my country, 1 need only mention that the National Assembly of District Representatives, the highest body representing the popular will and one of the constitutional governmental bodies, unanimously adopted a resolution in which it condemned the genocide committed against the people of Nicaragua.\n78.\tPanama had defended and will continue to defend at all times the right of people to self-determination and the principle of non-intervention, which are essential elements in the peaceful coexistence of the peoples of the Central American isthmus.\n79.\tThe exercise of these rights is organically linked to the obligation of the leaders to resolve domestic conflicts and international disputes by peaceful means without endangering peace, international security or justice.\n80.\tFor that reason when in a neighbouring country, for political reasons, there if a breach of the peace and collective unrest leading to the widespread loss of human lives, that situation must inevitably be of major concern to the other Governments and peoples of the area. It is a visible danger that in an act of desperation large groups of people may promote extreme solutions when they are denied by violent means the right to take part in their national destiny. Panama is well aware what would be the significance of a totalitarian extremist Government in the area, and we shall never lend ourselves to Governments of that kind. We hope that our governmental leaders will act sensibly in accordance with the national will and avoid upheavals which could only serve as a breeding ground for extremist solutions, to which countries resort only when they are driven to the limits of desperation.\n81.\tIt is only logical that our concern should be aroused when the armed forces of a State which should preserve order and guarantee the lives and property of the citizens of that country in carrying out their duties use weapons of war indiscriminately against the civilian population. As a result of suffering and mourning, intense feelings of condemnation, hatred and public revenge are aroused against others in the country.\nfy2. The respect which civilized Governments have for the principle of self-determination of peoples and non-intervention, as well as their rejection of the use of force, precludes any possible condoning of acts which are at variance with the ethical values and feelings of the Latin-American peoples. It was dismaying that thousands of non-combatant civilians were fired on in the cities of Matagalpa, Masaya, Leon, Chinandega and Estelf and other smaller less populated communities with consequent large-scale destruction. We were painfully dismayed also by the material damage and the damage caused to social, human and cultural values in the country of Rub6n Dario, who is a symbol for Latin America and is respected throughout the cultural world for his great contribution to Spanish literature.\nThis climate of tension can reach explosive proportions when the frontiers and sovereignty of friendly countries that are traditionally attached to peace and order are violated in the most inexplicable circumstances.\n84.\tWhen such reprehensible acts multiply it is logical to hope that countries in harmony with the aspirations of peoples that have a common heritage of freedom, morality and justice should call upon international bodies at the regional and national levels to take action to combat these evils. In the face of acts of such gravity, as stated in the Charter of the United Nations, the means of legitimate self-defence are available, both individual and collective, against the transgressors of peace, morality, justice and national culture. In these circumstances, the competent bodies of the United Nations must also take action which is appropriate so that bloodshed and barbaric violations of human rights against the Nicaraguan people will not remain unpunished or will not be repeated and so that those responsible will be called to account for their criminal conduct.\n85.\tThis deplorable situation, which is rooted in social, economic and political causes, is today taking on the character of a crisis in Central America, which could become explosive throughout the continent. The flood of Nicaraguan refugees into Costa Rica and Honduras contributes to the crisis and could also have unpredictable consequences on the relations between Honduras and El Salvador and the conflict existing between those two countries.\n86.\tMy delegation believes that it is therefore appropriate to stress the importance to the area of the fact that the dispute between Honduras and El Salvador must be settled as soon as possible It is our hope that the negotiations presently being pursued between those two countries will lead to a just settlement which we all desire, as well as to harmonious coexistence between their two peoples.\n87.\tThe urgent need for a peaceful settlement and the need to prevent new lamentable situations cannot be exaggerated. The Government of Panama has received reliable information to the effect that international arms peddlers, merchants of crime and ruin, dealers in suffering and desolation, have been trying by every means available to them to stimulate the conflict between El Salvador and Honduras in order to distract world public attention from the crisis in Nicaragua. It is for that reason that my delegation believes that the United Nations peace-keeping machinery and the machinery to ensure international security must not fail to function in this Central-American crisis, which is a source of concern today throughout the entire continent, and indeed throughout the entire world.\n88.\tI should like to conclude by expressing our renewed trust in the efforts which the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, has been making to promote the purposes and principles of the United Nations for the benefit of the inhabitants of our planet in every latitude.\n89.\tMr. President, we believe that it is indeed extremely fortunate that a statesman of your distinguished standing is conducting our proceedings and endeavouring to resolve burning issues for mankind, and we can assure you that you will enjoy the resolute and enthusiastic co-operation of the delegation of Panama.\n"

His election is a tribute to and a just acknowledgement of his high personal qualities, his experience of world affairs and the constructive part his country plays in the international arena. We welcome the fact that he represents a country with which Greece is linked by traditional friendship and by a common cultural heritage which goes back to the roots of the Greco-Roman world.\n259.\tI am pleased also to take this opportunity of expressing; to our Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, our gratitude and deep appreciation for the high-mindedness and the great competence with which he carries out his important task.\n260.\tWe welcome with joy also the admission to the United Nations of Solomon Islands, which yet again confirms the principle of universality of our Organization, and we wish to convey to that new Member our sincere congratulations and warmest wishes for the happiness and prosperity of its people.\n261.\tThe Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization, which is most clear and lucid, deserves all our attention. The analysis made by the Secretary-General of the world situation and the present state of progress in the solution of international problems does not, I regret to say, differ very much from the comments and observations which we ourselves have had occasion to make over the last few years. Indeed, the increase in the number of situations of conflict throughout the world and the marked tendency among States to avoid bringing their disputes before international bodies or even seeking the protection of the Security Council, which is entrusted with the responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, is sufficient proof that we are still a long way from achieving the ideals of the Charter, and in particular from devising an effective system of security and a world order which would enable peoples to live without fear and to devote their efforts to their own development and welfare.\n262.\tThe causes of this disquieting situation are unfortunately familiar. Do we have to say again that the resurgence of unhealthy nationalism, violence and the use of force against the weakest and the disregard of the principles of the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations are in flagrant conflict with an international society as contemplated after the Second World War?\n263.\tIn these circumstances it can come as no surprise that, despite every effort made in the past year, solutions to the major international problems, and in particular those of the Middle East, southern Africa and Cyprus, mentioned expressly by the Secretary-General in his report, continue to elude us. I hasten to add that this discouraging situation can scarcely be attributed to the Charter, which has never had the chance of being applied in toto, and even less can it be attributed to the Organization itself.\n264.\tAs the Prime Minister of my country said during the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, it is only within the framework of an international community which is inspired by the lofty principles of the Charter, and which applies them, that we\nshall be able to safeguard peace and give the United Nations the means to see that its resolutions and decisions are respected. In that context we might also give thought to a gradual reduction of military expenditure, which would enable those countries now groaning under the overwhelming burden of armaments to devote the major part of their resources to their own economic .and cultural development. States Members will therefore have to show political will in order to strengthen the role and effectiveness of the Organization and make it capable of carrying out the mission entrusted to it under the Charter.\n265.\tThe period just before this session of the General Assembly was a period of the greatest activity at the world level and one of the most rich in international meetings.\n266.\tI shall not go through the results of all such meetings, which are quite recent. Rather, I should like to take the opportunity to give my Government's views and to express its position on some problems of particular concern to us.\n267.\tMay I first assure the Assembly that my country's foreign policy is based entirely on the principles of the United Nations Charter, on international law, on the principles of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference, on the non-use of force, or the threat of force, and on the settlement of disputes between States by peaceful means, and on the desire for a relationship of co-operation and friendship with all countries, particularly those closest to m.\n268.\tHaving supported the policy of detente, Greece has contributed energetically, by taking specific initiatives, to the promotion of that policy, and intends to continue to do so. At the same time, Greece has regard to its national security and is determined to defend itself against any pressure or threat.\n269.\tWith reference to the crucial problem of disarmament, we consider that the tenth special session of the General Assembly broadly accomplished its mission, thanks to the efforts of all the participating countries. It gave a new impetus to the cause of disarmament, drafted a Programme of Action [resolution S-10/2, sect. Ill] at the world level aimed at general and complete disarmament under strict international control, in the sphere of both conventional weapons and nuclear devices, and gave the international community machinery that could help to check the senseless arms race. Those are encouraging results which we can welcome, and which in our view justify hope for real progress, to which the convening of a new session of the General Assembly at a later stage could give new momentum.\n270.\tA world conference on disarmament could also help if it were properly prepared. It goes without saying that the nuclear Powers will have a particularly important role to play in this respect.\n271.\tIn this context, should we stress the importance of the accession of all countries to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons? Greece hopes so. But it also wishes to stress the need to provide for the non-nuclear States which have accepted these obligations the scientific and technological means to enable them to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\n272.\tIn view of its vital importance, we hope to see as soon as possible the conclusion of an agreement between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics during the second series of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. It is also important to speed up the conclusion of a treaty on the complete prohibition of nuclear tests. Finally, Greece, convinced that negotiations on a reduction of arms and forces in central Europe will help the cause of detente, hopes that these negotiations Will begin in the near future. Of course, such an outcome must not weaken the security of participating States, including-and this is a point which we wish particularly to stress\u2014the security of those countries on the flanks of Europe.\n273.\tThe position of Greece on the problem of the Middle East and the problem of southern Africa derives from the immutable principles of the Charter. As we have repeatedly said in this Assembly, Greece is opposed to the acquisition of territory by force. It is in favour of a negotiated settlement of the problem of the Middle East based on the resolutions of this Assembly and of the Security Council.\n274.\tThose resolutions provide for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Arab- territories which have been occupied since 1967, respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of all countries in the region, and recognition of the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including their aspiration to a national home.\n275.\tThe Camp David meetings and the agreements reached there may be a step in the right direction, in so far as they seek to apply the principles that I have just mentioned. But we must not lose sight of the fact that our aim is a comprehensive solution, a settlement which, in order to secure the agreement of all concerned, must be seen as just and equitable by all the parties concerned, including the Arab people of Palestine. From this point of view there is still a long and arduous road ahead of us.\n276.\tWe cannot speak of the problem of the Middle East without thinking of the tragedy that our friends in Lebanon are suffering. We hope with all our heart that peace will return to that tormented country. For the immediate future, we advocate the strict application of Security Council resolutions 425(1978) and 426(1978) and the restoration of sovereignty and the effective authority of the Government of Lebanon throughout its territory, particularly in the south.\n277.\tGreece was among the first countries to apply strictly and faithfully the principle of the self-determination of peoples during the historic process of decolonization. Consequently, Greece has from the beginning supported the implementation of resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly on the exercise of the inalienable right of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence. We believe that the proposals put forward by the five Western States members of the Security Council are still the best way to achieve a negotiated settlement in accordance with Security Council resolution 385 (1976). Therefore we cannot but deplore the fact that those proposals were rejected by the South African Government. We should like to express the deep concern with which we should view any possible failure of the present efforts. Such a failure would be disastrous for peace and stability in the region.\n278.\tThe same considerations guide us with regard to Southern Rhodesia. On the basis of the principle of majority rule, we do not believe that it is possible to find a peaceful solution without taking into account the views of all the interested parties and the freely expressed will of the people of Zimbabwe.\n279.\tAs for South Africa, we regret that, as the Secretary-General points out in his report, \\\"there is little or no indication that its Government is moving away from its basic policy of institutionalized racial discrimination\\\" [see A/3311, sect. III]. I take this opportunity to repeat that Greece most emphatically condemns apartheid and any form of racial discrimination. We shall unfailingly give our support to international efforts to ensure respect for human dignity, the. principle of equality, and the security and progress of all peoples in the region, without discrimination on grounds of race, colour or religion. More generally, we wish to stress the importance of respect for the independence, sovereignty, inviolability of frontiers and territorial integrity of all the African States, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and the decisions of the OAU. It also seems to us to be essential that the introduction of elements of unrest of any kind into those countries be most carefully avoided.\n280.\tI wish not to draw attention to three important subjects\u2014namely, human rights, the North-South dialogue and the law of the sea.\n281.\tWith reference to human rights, we too note, if not general improvement in the real conditions prevailing in different parts of the world, at least a greater mobilization of the competent bodies of the United Nations, and in particular of world public opinion, with a view to the implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and respect for the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Charter. Greece, which is firmly committed to the struggle against violations of human rights and against every form of racial discrimination, has taken certain initiatives on the specific question of torture and other inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment. It is our intention to continue our action as vigorously as possible within the United Nations framework.\n282.\tWe cannot derive the same satisfaction from the results of the North-South dialogue. We do not conceal our disappointment that the: recent session of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 has made no progress. We are troubled by that failure, in view of the seriousness of the world economic situation, the effects of which are painfully felt by the developing countries. As we have said in the past, we consider it urgent to carry out a restructuring of international society on the basis of a more equitable distribution of resources in order to achieve our aim, which is the establishment of a new economic order. In today's world, which is characterized by the interdependence of peoples, we cannot hope that fruitful co-operation can be established among nations before these unacceptable disparities and miseries have disappeared from all regions of the world.\n283.\tAs for the law of the sea, we are following with the greatest interest the progress of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, whose last session has\njust concluded in New York. We venture to hope that the Conference on the Law of the Sea will lead to a new international convention regulating all aspects of this vast problem. Of course, it is indispensable that the final text should contain precise regulations which are absolutely unambiguous, and that binding international machinery should be provided for the settlement of disputes between States, by peaceful means and on the basis of international law and its practice.\n284.\tI have left the matter of Cyprus for the end of my statement. Once again we must note that the Secretary-General, in his report, deplores the absence of progress towards a settlement of the Cyprus problem. Indeed, the Secretary-General, to whom we owe all our gratitude for his untiring efforts in carrying out his mandate on the problem of Cyprus, affirms that the outcome of the efforts made to settle this problem is extremely discouraging, since it has been impossible to establish a basis for the positive resumption of the intercommunal talks, and that the situation in the island continues to pose a threat to stability and friendly relations in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n285.\tNone the less, four years have elapsed since this Assembly adopted resolution 3212 (XXIX), ratified by Security Council resolution 365 (1974). These have been four years of suffering and pain for the 200,000 Greek Cypriot refugees driven from their homes\u2014four years of refusal by the party in possession to make reasonable proposals that would open the way towards constructive and fruitful dialogue; four years, too, of persistent efforts to impose faits accomplis which the conscience of this Assembly, representing, in the final analysis, the world conscience, resolutely rejects. These circumstances demonstrate a singular contempt for the principles of the Charter and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n286.\tI wish to declare on behalf of my Government that we favour a just and lasting settlement of the Cyprus problem within the framework of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions and that we shall lend all our assistance to assist the Secretary-General in carrying out his mandate of good offices with a view to settling this problem through negotiations between the two communities. To this end it would suffice for the proposals of the Turkish side to derive, however slightly, from the substance and spirit of our Organization's resolutions.\n287.\tWe know that the Government of Cyprus shares this same desire, and we will give full support to that Government in the hope that the Secretary-General's efforts will lead, with the assistance of other peace-loving and justice-loving Governments, to a resumption of the negotiating process in serious and positive conditions.\n"

The Yugoslav delegation, and I personally, are gratified to be able to address our congratulations to you, an outstanding statesman and diplomat and a prominent representative of friendly Colombia, with which Yugoslavia has fruitful and close co-operation.\n91.\tI am happy to be able to welcome in our midst the representatives of this new Member State, Solomon Islands, by whose admission our Organization has taken one more step closer to the realization of the principle of universality embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.\n92.\tIt is a cause of satisfaction to my country that full credit has been given to the representative of Yugoslavia, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, for the way in which he presided over the General Assembly at a significant period of its activity, with one regular session and three special sessions devoted to very important questions of international life.\n93.\tThe agenda of the current session of our Assembly includes important problems affecting international peace and security, as well as issues concerning long-term questions of the development of the world in which we live. Regular sessions provide us with an opportunity 'o give additional stimulus to our joint efforts to work more resolutely for the solution of the problems facing us.\n94. This is all the more important since our session is taking place at a time of further deepening of the general crisis in the existing system of international political and economic relations; at a time of stagnation in the process of relaxation of tensions; at the time of an unabated arms race, an aggravation of existing crises and the strengthening of attempts to impose new forms of domination and interference in the internal affairs of independent States.\n95: Our hope and our firm belief that the difficulties of our time can be successfully overcome are based on the tremendously increased determination of peoples and countries to fight for their independence and free development and to contribute to the establishment of a new system of international relations founded on freedom, equality, interdependence and justice. Guided by these noble aspirations, the non-aligned countries, which represent the greater part of the membership of the world Organization, gathered this summer at their ministerial Conference in Belgrade,  the capital of my country, in order to make their voice still stronger and to render their actions for the achievement of these objectives still more determined.\n96.\tThe Belgrade Conference attracted the attention of the world public precisely because it strengthened and further elaborated all the basic principles and the role and orientation of the policy of non-alignment as an independent, non-bloc world factor actively involved in the struggle for new international relations.\n97.\tHaving this in mind, the Conference adopted positions on all the important and burning issues of contemporary international relations. It underlined the importance of the actions of non-aligned countries within the United Nations and their readiness to co-operate, particularly with the other\\\" developing countries and with all those favouring the general application of the principles of active and peaceful coexistence.\n98.\tThe Conference also firmly rejected all attempts to divide the non-aligned countries on political, ideological and other grounds. It also adopted specific recommendations for the peaceful settlement of disputes between non-aligned countries. It charted the political course for the preparation of the forthcoming important meetings of non-aligned countries, including their summit conferences. The final acts of the Conference have been circulated as a document of the General Assembly [A/33/206], and we believe that they will be studied with due attention.\n99.\tOpening the Conference, President Tito emphasized that:\n\\\"World stability has been discussed for years now as wholly dependent on a balance of power and fear, and bloc accommodation. At the same time, however, we have been witness to persisting instability, as the end result of precisely these premises.\\\" \n100.\tThis has impelled us to seek and construct another approach, based on a different logic, towards the realities of our world, and this has been embodied in the policy of non-alignment. This policy has asserted itself with such moral and political force that it \\\"has imparted positive elements of stability to an anxious and disturbed world\\\" [ibid,]. Precisely for this reason it was able to assert itself as a real and in fact the only possible alternative to the existing systems of privileges, monopolies and dependence.\n101.\tThis was even more strongly underlined in the stand taken at the Belgrade Conference that the struggle against the old and the new evils of our world, against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and racism, against all forms of foreign domination and interference, and the fight against political and economic hegemonism and all forms of subjugation, must be waged at the same time as the struggle for the realization of a different vision of the world in which the system of life will not be based on bloc divisions, even if it were possible to achieve a so-called balance of bloc forces and interests.\n102.\tThis applies primarily to our concept of the character and substance of detente, that is, of the process of relaxation of tensions in the world, to which we attach such great importance.\n103.\tDetente is today in a state of serious stagnation, particularly with regard to relations among the great Powers, and it is also plagued with some new cold war elements. We must see how to set in motion again its positive trends, since without detente there are no real prerequisites for a more effective elimination of the main hotbeds of crisis in the world.\n\n104.\tOf course, we must be aware of the fact that, no matter how important relations among the great Powers may be, detente must not be directed solely towards mutual accommodation among blocs and their mutual coexistence. Detente must become universal. It must encompass all regions and all aspects of international life. It must not amount to a conservation of existing conditions of dependence and the status quo, but must be a means of promoting movement towards peace, independence and social progress with the active and equal participation and responsibility of all the members of the world community. Our Organization, by its efforts and deliberations, can greatly stimulate such a direction of detente.\n105.\tWithin the context of the weighty subjects on the agenda of our session, my delegation considers that we should at present devote particular attention to action for the final liquidation of colonialism in all parts of the world. Colonialism is an anachronism of the past which is desperately maintaining itself owing to the continued existence of bloc-motivated strategic needs and the interests of international monopolies which are tied to the remaining regimes in southern Africa.\n106.\tThe racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia are aware of this situation. That is why they take advantage so widely of the insufficient effectiveness of the world\nOrganization in adopting necessary decisions and its lack of determination in implementing the existing ones.\n107.\tThe ease of Namibia provides all of us with an instructive example. As a result of the liberation struggle of the people of Namibia and the solidarity of the international community developments took a positive turn. Precisely when this could lead to a genuine solution, the South African racist Government raised new obstructions, with the intention of turning the clock back.\n108.\tMy delegation wishes to call the attention of this Assembly to the fact that such obstruction, accompanied by the perpetration of brutal crimes and genocide against the African population and the undertaking of aggressive actions against sovereign African States, particularly the front-line States, by the racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia will continue as long as the world community and our Organization do not apply the necessary measures against those regimes more consistently and resolutely.\n109.\tRacism and apartheid have been condemned by the United Nations as a crime against humanity and a threat to peace and security in the world, and yet the embargo on the supply of arms to South Africa, and economic and other sanctions against Rhodesia are, regrettably, not being consistently implemented by all.\n110.\tWe should once again reaffirm our clearly defined policy and pledge our full support and assistance to peoples fighting for the elimination of those racist regimes and for their national liberation. We must lend full support to and recognize all the legitimate rights of the liberation movements of SWAPO in Namibia and the Patriotic Front in Zimbabwe. There can be no genuine and lasting achievement of independence and transfer of power to the African majority without the participation of SWAPO and the Patriotic Front.\n111.\tWe believe, in particular, that the plan envisaged for Namibia, including the sending of peacekeeping forces of the United Nations to ensure a peaceful and just process for the gaining of independence, should be brought to completion resolutely and without delay. My Government is prepared to lend its full support to this, deeply convinced that it is a positive step towards the final liquidation of racism and apartheid. in South Africa and Rhodesia, the attainment of independence by the people of Zimbabwe and the securing of stability and peace in that sensitive area\nof the African continent.\n\n112.\tIn the tolerance shown of the insolent challenges and manoeuvres of the racist regimes the African countries rightly see new neo-colonial aspirations and tendencies towards the recolonization of certain African regions. We, the United Nations, must not close our eyes to this fact.\n113.\tThe failure to settle these and other crises in Africa will result in new grave disturbances in international relations and will open new areas for the rivalry and conflicts of foreign interests and confrontations. Precisely for that reason, we consider the role played by the OAU in African affairs to be very important. For this the OAU deserves the full support of the United Nations.\n114.\tThe Middle East crisis is also one of the most dangerous focal points of a possible world conflict. This is primarily a consequence of the , stubborn persistence of Israel in pursuing an aggressive policy against neighbouring Arab countries, its denial of the national rights of the Palestinian people and its refusal to implement the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.\n115.\tAware of the gravity of the problem with which we ire confronted there, as well as of the need to do everything to prevent a further deterioration of the dangerous state of crisis and find ways conducive to a just and peaceful solution, we wish to welcome and support all efforts that genuinely tend towards achieving those aims.\n116.\tWe must also be quite realistic, however, in assessing all the elements of the existing crisis and carefully appraise which steps bring us closer to and which possibly take us further away from a just and lasting solution. We are deeply convinced that all peace initiatives must keep that in mind and must be evaluated precisely from that standpoint.\n117.\tAs a consequent concept of the spirit and letter of the resolutions adopted by the United Nations as well as positions determined at a number of conferences of the non-aligned countries, a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the Middle East crisis must embody three fundamental principles: first, the complete withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war; secondly, the exercise by the Palestinian people of its inalienable national right to self-determination and the establishment of its own independent State and recognition of the Palestine liberation Organization as the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people; and thirdly, the right of all countries and peoples of the region to security and independent development.\n118.\tWe believe that only the steps taken in accordance with the aforementioned principles and aimed at their full implementation will be likely to lead to a comprehensive, lasting and peaceful settlement of the crisis and ensure peace and stability in that region.\n119.\tNow I should like to refer to our thinking and positions on the Cyprus crisis and the question of Korea. The prolongation of the Cyprus crisis, which deprives an independent country of its right to full sovereignty, alerts us also to the existence of a constant threat to peace in that part of the world. We are convinced that a way out can be found only through a consistent and comprehensive implementation of General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX), which contains all the necessary elements and measures for the settlement of this crisis. We think that this should be achieved by refraining from actions amounting to interference and pressure from outside, by constructive dialogue between the two communities and, r particular, by the United Nations playing a more active role in implementing its resolutions.\n120.\tWe should not forget for a single moment that the continued maintenance of the division of Korea is one of the potential sources of a wider international conflict. We must, therefore, lend clear and constant support to the Vast aspirations of the people of Korea for peaceful reunification, without outside interference, and welcome in that sense the concrete and constructive steps of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea towards that goal.\n121.\tOne of the most important questions in the life of the world community is the problem of disarmament. It was debated at length at the recent tenth special session of the General Assembly, which was convened on the initiative of the non-aligned countries.\n122.\tAlthough the results of that session do not give us cause for excessive optimism, we are nevertheless convinced that it is quite realistic to say that that session was important as it expressed the definite resolve of our Organization to deal with this question directly and actively in the future as well. What we adopted there constitutes a good starting-point for our future efforts in this domain. That applies in the first place to the general principles involving the primary responsibility and central role of the United Nations.\n123.\tThe decision to reaffirm the inalienable right of all States, without discrimination, to develop, acquire, and use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes with a view to promoting their own economic and social development [see resolution S-10/2, para. 36], is of great significance. This decision is all the more important as tendencies to maintain the existing nuclear monopoly are still very much present. Reconciling ourselves to the strengthening of such monopoly would lead to a widening of the already dangerous gap between the developing and the developed countries, which would strengthen technological colonialism, create new grounds for instability in the world and engender new dangerous tensions in international relations. It is important now to implement as effectively as possible the decisions we have taken and to ensure that the organs we have formed should start functioning as soon as possible.\n124.\tThe tenth special session failed to find positive solutions to some key problems, such as the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons or the giving of guarantees to countries which have renounced those weapons that , such weapons will not be used against them. We consider that without this commitment the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons cannot fulfil the purpose for which it was intended.\n125.\tThe outstanding questions of the liquidation of foreign military bases and the concrete establishment of zones of peace and co-operation in various parts of the world have also remained unresolved. And, most important, it seems to us that the efforts of the world Organization in this sphere should be aimed at overcoming the present trend towards negotiations concerned with balancing armaments and at finally setting in motion the genuine process of disarmament.\n126.\tBecause of existing resistance, motivated by bloc interests, it has not been possible to adopt more than provisions of principle on the subject of zones of peace and co-operation. To our mind, these provisions of principle should apply wholly to the region of the Mediterranean. That has been endorsed by the majority of Mediterranean countries. These provisions must provide a basis for the future efforts of Mediterranean countries and their determination to ensure, in the spirit of the decisions of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, stable peace, security and progress in the Mediterranean through the co-operation of all the countries of the region on a basis of equality.\n127.\tWithin the framework of our efforts to strengthen security in the world we attach great importance to the promotion of confidence among peoples and States. Confidence can be promoted in various ways, inter alia through the establishment of zones of peace and co-operation and nuclear-weapon-free zones; by refraining from military manoeuvres along borders and their use to exert pressure on other countries; by the outlawing of terrorist organizations and their activities against other States; and by refraining from hostile propaganda.\n128.\tTerrorism is a form of international crime which is deliberately directed against the independence and free and peaceful life of peoples and countries. It is a form of indirect aggression and an instrument of destabilization of the internal systems of sovereign States with a view to imposing alien ideological and political systems on them and destroying the independence of those countries.\n129.\tWe are convinced that all the members of the world community must bear equal responsibility for an energetic and constant struggle against this crime.\n130.\tWe wish to draw attention, in particular, to the danger arising out of the existence of double standards in the approach to terrorism, according to which one type of terrorism is treated as a crime and another as a form of political opposition, and to the attempts made to discredit as terrorism national liberation struggles against foreign domination. It is clear that purely ideological criteria and remnants of cold war concepts about two worlds, or endeavours to maintain colonial relations, lie behind such attitudes.\n131.\tJust because of the existence of such double standards regarding terrorist groups, we wish to call the Assembly's attention to the fact that the draft international convention against the taking of hostages, which is before the General Assembly [item 120], should be construed as indicating a readiness to apply the same criteria to all kinds of acts of international terrorism, and to combat them resolutely and in the same way.\n132.\tPermit me to refer to an important question for the world community, that of human rights, which has given rise to deep controversies and, regrettably, has become the object of frequent manipulations inspired by various ideological concepts, and to draw attention to the positions adopted by the conference of Minister of Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned countries, held recently in Belgrade.\n133.\tProceeding from the principles of the United Nations, the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Conference pointed out that the issue of human rights cannot be isolated from its national, economic and social context. This position is inspired by the conviction that the freedom of the individual is inseparable from the freedom of the people, and that the human rights and the\nfundamental freedoms of the individual and of the people are inseparable.\n134.\tOnly thus can the rights of the individual and of the people and their free and all-round development be genuinely promoted. This should be a component part of the political and economic emancipation of peoples and of the struggle for the democratization of international relations.\n135.\tMy country, profoundly convinced that political systems must serve the human person, and not vice versa, accords a very high priority to the question of human rights. Therefore, we wish to draw attention once again to the importance of the initiative of the non-aligned countries concerning the elaboration and adoption of an integral and comprehensive approach to human rights.\n136.\tIn this connexion we also devote particular attention to the provision in the Declaration of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries concerning the need for strict respect for the rights of ethnic and religious minorities [see Aj33/206, annex I, para. 156]. We believe that the nation that constitutes the - majority is responsible for the realization of the rights of the national minority, as it is difficult to imagine a majority enjoying genuine freedom if it has not ensured the same freedom to the national minority.\n137.\tFor my country, this is a very important principle, both because of the federal and multinational character of our. community, in which all nations and all nationalities  enjoy optimal and equal conditions for their free national development, and because of our strong belief that national minorities, provided they enjoy all the necessary rights, can\nbe one of the most valuable links between countries and peoples, and can foster confidence between them.\n138.\tI am convinced that there is no particular need to demonstrate the uncertainties that are engendered by attempts to maintain old relations of inequality, privilege and exploitation in international economic relations. This system of relations is in a state of absolute crisis, and we witness, at the same time, a complete standstill in negotiations on problems whose solution would bring about a radical and indispensable change in international economic relations.\n139.\tIt seems to us that, owing to selfishness and a lack of readiness to grasp the core of the problem, no. real dialogue has yet been established between the most developed and the developing countries, as a result of which no progress has been achieved with regard to the solution of a single substantive question. Owing to such obstruction, the first year's work of the Committee on the new international economic order  has ended in complete failure. It is not possible to endorse the thesis that this was due to differences of interpretation concerning the character and scope of its mandate.\n140.\tThe least we should do, confronted as we are by this critical situation, is to create by joint efforts, at this session,\nconditions for the normal functioning of the Committee on the new international economic order within the framework of its mandate.\n141.\tWe believe that the Committee will be able to continue its work by the beginning of next year and that it will be in a position to make its concrete contribution to negotiations on the most important issues which are under way, and thus ensure a favourable political atmosphere for preparations for the new international development strategy and the successful outcome of the fifth session of UNCTAD and of the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development.\n142.\tThe establishment of the new international economic order has become the primary task of the international community. Closing our eyes to this reality not only would exacerbate the existing crisis in economic relations, but would inject new and dangerous disruptions and crises into political relations in the world and, in the final analysis, jeopardize international peace and security.\n143.\tOur vision of new international political and economic relations and their realization calls for a decisive role to be played by the United Nations. The non-aligned countries have always considered that the strengthening of the effectiveness of the United Nations is one of the essential tasks of the international community. For their part, they have made a key contribution to the realization of this process, particularly with respect to the elaboration of universally acceptable platforms for the solving of crises and the elimination of sources of conflict, the establishment of the new international economic order, the elaboration of a programme of general and complete disarmament and the removal of the danger of armed conflicts.\n144.\tWe must firmly oppose the growing tendency to withdraw substantive problems from our Organization and to by-pass the United Nations in solving them, and to work for the most effective implementation of its decisions and resolutions.\n145.\tWe still live in conditions characterized by contradictions and bloc divisions that are tearing our world apart and pushing it into new confrontations; but, on the other hand, we live in an epoch of ever-greater interdependence that compels us to co-operate in the struggle for peace, equal rights, security and progress in the world.\n146.\tImbued with a sense of the greatest responsibility towards our own peoples and towards mankind as a whole, we can ensure that this thirty-third session of the General Assembly will prove to be a successful step on the long road leading us to the realization of the noble principles and purposes enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. It is precisely in this light that we view the great commitment of all of us, the great responsibility and important role of our Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n220.\tMr. President, I am happy to join my colleagues in congratulating you on your election as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I am confident that your experience and wisdom will enable you to give this Assembly the leadership that it needs if it is to meet expectations.\n221.\tWith the most welcome addition of Solomon Islands, the membership of the United Nations has now reached 150. This is a remarkable growth since, 33 years ago, some 50 nations started building this Organization on the ruins of mankind's most terrible war. Through the dissolution of the system of imperialism, almost 100 new, free and independent States have emerged and become a powerful element in contemporary history. And let us never forget that there are more to come.\n222.\tThose tongues are ever numerous which deplore and attack the United Nations, and in particular this Assembly, as a political slow of overrated significance, long on words but short on deeds. Although not unaware of our shortcomings, we must answer such criticism not only by describing numerous achievements of the United Nations, but also by pointing out that 30 years is a very short time in the lives of international organizations. \\\"Rome was not built in a day\\\" is a saying in many Western languages. Was there ever a great culture, was there ever a major religion, that established itself and realized its potential in anything less than several generations? Why, then, should we demand instant fulfilment of the greatest dream in human history, the United Nations?\n223.\tWe may say for the United Nations that childhood is behind us. We are now suffering the growing pains of adolescence. Before us stretches a long time in which we shall really come to grips with life and solve its problems with ever-growing strength and maturity. Such is the future of the United Nations as I see it. if I may quote the late Adlai Stevenson: \\\"Let none of us mock its weakness for, when we do, we are mocking ourselves.\\\" Let us rather devote our strength faithfully to realizing the aspirations embodied in the Charter as truly united nations.\n\n224.\tThe people of Iceland are an island race much dependent upon the sea. For this reason I hope it will be\nunderstood why we attach more importance to the Conference on the Law of the Sea than to any other activity of the United Nations with the exception of the maintenance of peace and security.\n225.\tThe oceans cover two-thirds of the surface of the earth. In spite of the fact that large areas will be within the national jurisdiction of coastal States, there remains an immense area of sea-bed and ocean floor which, it is hoped, will be affirmed to be the common heritage of mankind, as foreseen in the first resolutions of the General Assembly setting out the terms of reference of the Conference. I have no doubt, unfortunately, that the founding fathers of this grand design have been disappointed, even though much has been achieved and there is still a strong likelihood that a comprehensive law of the sea will be agreed upon.\n226.\tYet the slow pace the Conference and the complex disputes which have repeatedly delayed its success give us serious cause for worry. Considering what is at stake-the rule of law over two-thirds of the globe I find that the matter should be raised to the highest political level in order to secure positive results from the long work already performed by ambassadors and experts, great as their achievement has been. Anarchy on the oceans would cause innumerable conflicts and immense damage, not least to the poorer nations. The successful conclusion of the Conference next year is vital and should most certainly be given the highest priority.\n227.\tMany phases of the work of the Conference have already been successfully concluded. The consensus reached on important matters has already brought about widespread practice which is unchallenged, in spite bf the lack of an agreed and ratified comprehensive treaty. In this category we can place most points concerning national maritime limits, which a large number of States have affirmed in their national legislation\n228.\tThe vital interests of Iceland have throughout the last 30 years dictated that my country should be in the forefront in this field. Our next step will be comprehensive national legislation confirming the 200-mile economic zone, extending the breadth of the territorial sea from 4 to 12 miles, establishing measures for the preservation of the marine environment, and dealing with other related subjects. Such legislation will be discussed in the Government and Parliament of Iceland in the near future.\n229 Permit me to return to the relatively short history of the United Nations by calling attention to the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights before the end of this Assembly session.\n230.\tThis Declaration, coming so soon after the Charter itself, is one of the milestones in the work of the United Nations. Like the Ten Commandments of the Christian religion it has been and still is an inspirational guide to many; it has also caused fear and worry to those who trespass against it, but I am sorry to say it has been ignored and unrespected by far too many.\n231.\tThe fight for human rights has been gaining momentum, and at the same time it has increased our awareness of the formidable work that remains undone in this field. We\nall know that torture is practised more or less in scores of countries belonging to this Organization, and we must not rest until that blemish on mankind is erased. We know that thousands of people have been imprisoned for political reasons, for trade union activity or religious beliefs in a number of countries, and they are kept behind bars or in concentration camps, often without trial. This in the long run is an intolerable state of affairs. We know that racism and racial discrimination are not only practised widely, but are in some countries an official policy. In the fight against this, Assembly resolutions have been abundant but results are so far altogether too meagre. We know that other human rights, civil and political, economic, social and cultural, are widely abused.\n232.\tWe must, on the occasion of the coming anniversary of the Declaration, rededicate ourselves and renew our efforts. Without the basic human rights there can be no individual freedom-and without individual freedom we shall never realize the central goals of the United Nations Charter.\n233.\tTalk of human rights directs our attention to the southernmost part of Africa, where racism, inequality and injustice are the very basis of social structures in which relatively small minorities oppress large majorities among the population. The pressure of the United Nations in this area must be increased and directed towards fair solutions and national freedom, without which this region might well plunge into armed conflict on a large scale.\n234.\tWe must continue to condemn the policy of apartheid practised in South Africa and all that goes with that ominous system of suppression and inequity. International pressure in various forms must be increased in order to bring to an end this system and send that country on the way towards a just and equal society serving all its races.\n235.\tWe trust that developments in Namibia will, in spite of temporary setbacks, continue and lead that country towards independence and majority rule in the near future. We hope that free elections under United Nations auspices will ensure equal opportunity to all groupings, certainly including SWAPO. This must be followed by substantial economic aid for build-up and development. The vital port of Walvis Bay must certainly be an integral part of Namibia.\n236.\tThe swift movement of events in Zimbabwe has again taken a turn for the worse and caused disappointment to all those who hope for majority rule in that country. Renewed efforts to bring all parties to agreement on a peaceful transition must be made, but in the meantime present sanctions must be effectively maintained.\n237.\tThe people of Iceland have in their past a long history under colonial rule. We know from our experience that freedom and independence do not of themselves bring a sudden reversal of conditions, and they do not instantly abolish poverty. But we certainly know that independence does kindle a national spirit and give nations new and further unknown strength for progress. But one ruling class must not be replaced by another, one kind of inequality and injustice must never replace another. Only with self-restraint, humanity and education can a suppressed\nnation rise to anew age and advance to a new future.\n\n238.\tThis we have experienced-and this many other newly independent nations have learned, each in its own way. Quickly acquired material prosperity, even with a high level of education, can bring with it serious difficulties and dangers of losing again the self-determination so precious to us all. Multinational corporations, moneylenders and even powerful international institutions can-if we do not watch out-stealthily replace the more obvious colonial masters of the past. Individual nations must in this modern age exercise internally moderation and self-discipline if they hope to find those same qualities in the international community. Salvation must, as always, begin at home.\n239.\tIt is obvious that history has favoured some nations more than others, whatever the causes. Some have education, knowledge, technology, industry and abundance, while the fate of others has been overpopulation, poverty, disease and a widespread lack of education. In the highly developed countries we all share, to a differing degree, the opinion that the prosperous must give up a considerable share of their wealth to aid those who are poorer or less fortunate\n240.\tWe ar6 yet to see this same philosophy firmly enough established in the relationships of nations. We must continue on this path and we must soon obtain much greater results than we have so far. It is not for me to say what are the right methods; direct aid, rising prices of raw materials or whatever. Let me only remind the Assembly that giving a starving man a fish you give him a meal; but teach him how to fish, and you have given him a livelihood.\n241.\tIt does not befit the delegation of a small, unarmed nation like Iceland to venture to give to others advice on technical military matters, but I must voice our deep concern over the lack of progress made in the field of disarmament, especially as regards the monstrosities of mass destruction, poised and pointed at population centres with their infinite over-kill capacity. We are also disappointed at the slow progress of talks on mutual force reductions in the field of conventional arms\n242.\tTwo aspects of this question I must mention with emphasis. First, it is downright tragic to see developing nations use vast amounts of money out of their limited resources for the purchase of arms, thus keeping the military industrial complex both pleased and prosperous. This, most obviously, is taking bread from the hungry and medicine from the sick; that is one of the most disconcerting aspects of the armaments race.\n243.\tThe second point concerns again the vast ocean. There is in progress an immense and growing arms race in the naval, commercial shipping, fishing and research fields, all for military purposes. Showing the flag in every port around the globe, as the super-Powers do, is only one indication of a new form of imperialism. It is tragic indeed when submarines loaded with nuclear rockets are constantly creeping over ancient fishing banks and the trawler-men can expect to catch electronic devices in their nets. All of this most certainly counteracts the good work being done by the Conference on the Law of the Sea, where there has been manifested a great desire for preserving the marine environment, protecting living resources for maximum allowable yields to feed mankind, protecting commerce, and increasing human knowledge for peaceful ends.\n244.\tOnce again we are faced with the acute and highly dangerous situation in the Middle East. We have supported the efforts of the United Nations to establish just, equitable and lasting peace in the area. The latest developments, which culminated in the discussions at Camp David, are to my mind a step in the right direction. I want to thank all those involved and express admiration for the statesmanship and courage shown. I hope that this effort will enhance the work of the United Nations, and I again pledge the support of the Icelandic delegation.\n245.\tThere are a great many more problems on the agenda of this Assembly and pending in the chancelleries of the world, although I shall not take time to discuss them. I have kept mostly to the subjects that primarily concern the Icelandic people and on which we are, perhaps, capable of making useful contributions. But we shall listen with care to those who are more competent on other matters before we decide how to use our valuable vote in this Assembly.\n246.\tLet us remember that most of our problems are man-made and can be solved by man, given the necessary goodwill. Let us in these halls attempt preventive diplomacy, finding and settling potential disputes before they become acute problems. Let us to this end engage in candid debate without recrimination. Let us ever remember that we are not only solving the problems of our own age; we are here making the future.\n247.\tThe people of Iceland believe in peace with freedom, justice and equality for nations and individuals.\n248.\tThe United Nations journey of a thousand leagues started with a single step, but we are under way, distant though the goals may seem.\nThe delegation of Iceland wishes the United Nations continued and growing success under its able Secretary-General. We wish for a successful session of the General Assembly under the President's distinguished and able leadership.\n"

May I assure you that the Hungarian delegation will do its best to promote the successful work of the General Assembly under your guidance.\n66.\tOn behalf of the delegation of the Hungarian People's Republic I welcome the delegation of Solomon Islands and wish this new State Member of the United Nations every success in its activity.\n67.\tThe events which have occurred since the thirty- second session of the General Assembly have given clear proof once again that mankind has no task more important and more urgent than that of defending peace and ensuring the normal international conditions necessary for creative pursuits. Those conditions can be guaranteed only by peaceful coexistence and the deepening of detente. That is, indeed, in the common interest of all peoples and of mankind as a whole. It is by no mere chance, therefore, that the process of detente is playing a fundamental role in international politics.\n68.\tThe beneficial effects of the advance of peaceful coexistence and of the extension of detente are particularly perceptible in Europe. In our part of the world, political consultations between representatives of countries with different social systems have become regular, with trade relations expanding and co-operation programmes and cultural exchanges broadening in scope.\n69.\tYet, we also witness intensified efforts and counterattacks to halt the launching of that positive process by those who cash in on the arms race, by the forces opposed to the relaxation of tension, which try to justify their intentions with false arguments such as the non-existent Soviet military threat and the alleged military supremacy of the Warsaw Treaty Organization. But nothing can be invoked to justify actions against peace and security and international understanding, or attempts to start a new spiral of the arms race or the decision of the North Atlantic Council, meeting at the level of Heads of State and Government in Washington on 30 and 31 May, to launch a long-term programme of armaments.\n70.\tThere can be no doubt that, by reason of sabotage by the forces acting against peaceful coexistence and detente, recent times have seen a slowdown, a check, in the momentum of the process of detente which may be observed in relation to a number of world affairs.\n71.\tStill, we look with optimism to the future, mainly because we hold that detente is a necessity ensuing from the international balance of power. We are convinced that, if the advocates of peaceful coexistence and of detente join forces and act with resolve, they will succeed in surmounting the obstacles now in the way of the process of detente, in sustaining the results achieved thus far and, above all, in strengthening and deepening the process of detente by extending it to the military field. We note with satisfaction that a number of realistically-minded politicians in the Western countries similarly come out in favour of detente and of wider relations between socialist and capitalist countries. We regard it as being of great importance that the non-aligned countries are taking a stand against the use of force, armaments and intervention in the\n\\\"internal affairs of other countries, as well as for peace and security.\n72.\tThe position of the Hungarian People's Republic on this decisive issue is well known. We struggle for lasting peace and stable security and we spare no effort to prevent the genie of the \\\"cold war\\\" from getting out of the bottle of the past. We come out consistently in favour of the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, of wider international co-operation, of preventing the arms race and of placing peace and security on even firmer foundations.\n73.\tThe most pressing task in international life is to promote the cause of disarmament, first of all nuclear disarmament. The strength of the process of detente is evidenced by the fact that the various disarmament forums continue with their work despite the unfavourable changes in the international situation. Moreover, the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament is added proof that collective efforts tend to impart a fresh impetus to talks seeking to advance effective disarmament. The special session made it possible for more countries to join in the disarmament talks and confirmed the correctness of applying the principle of consensus to questions related to disarmament and international security.\n74.\tIn our judgement the proposal presented by the Soviet Government at the special session concerning practical measures for ending the arms race 0 is of particular relevance to the promotion of disarmament. The great number of other documents submitted there provides an additional pool of useful ideas that deserve further study. It is our common task to work for the implementation of the constructive proposals made on disarmament. By so doing we can make a large contribution to the proper preparation of a world disarmament conference.\n75.\tThe Hungarian Government follows with great attention the tripartite negotiations on the complete prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. The conclusion of a treaty on that subject would be a major step towards reducing the danger of nuclear war. From the point of view of the successful outcome of those negotiations I should like to commend the useful work of the Ad Hoc Group of Scientific Experts to Consider International Co-operative Measures to Detect and to Identify Seismic Events, set up to consider international co-operative measures to detect and identify seismic events, a group in which my country's representative is also taking an active part.\n76.\tThe Hungarian People's Republic warmly welcomes and considers as a highly significant step the new proposal of the Soviet Government that at this session the Assembly should discuss a draft international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States [AI33I241J. A similar proposal was submitted by the Soviet Union as early as 1966,  but it did not meet with sufficient response at that time. We feel that now real possibilities exist for concluding such a convention.\n77.\tThe Hungarian delegation likewise pins great hopes on the work of the Special Committee on Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Principle of Non-Use of Force in International Relations and strongly supports the efforts to draw up an international treaty, as proposed by the Soviet Union. The conclusion of such a treaty could form an integral part of the disarmament process.\n78.\tThe extension of the prohibition against certain weapons to chemical weapons is becoming a matter of increasing urgency. We hope that the long years of talks thereon will be crowned with success.\n79.\tWe continue to demand that the production and deployment of the neutron bomb should be abandoned once and for all.\n80.\tThe disquieting prospect of the development and manufacture of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction only underlines the timeliness of the proposal to ban those weapons. The last advances of science and technology should be prevented from being used for the development of new devices of mass destruction. We are firmly convinced that it is easier to agree on banning weapons of mass destruction in the design stage than at the time of series production.\n81.\tThe outcome of the ongoing talks on disarmament issues depends to a great extent on the results of the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America concerning the limitation of offensive strategic weapons. Precisely for that reason, we attach exceptionally great importance to the Soviet-American talks to reach agreement at the second series of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALTII], which it is hoped will be concluded m the near future. The SALT II agreement would greatly promote the disarmament talks going on in other forums, would substantially improve the international climate and would advance the process of detente.\n82.\tThe Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe have made little headway despite the serious efforts exerted by the socialist countries of Europe. In June of this year the socialist countries submitted a new proposal which, with the aim of promoting an agreement, took into account several important elements of the position of the countries members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We hope that our Western negotiating partners will be acting in the same spirit and will open the way to an agreement by proceeding on the basis of the principle of equal security. It is our earnest desire to see Helsinki followed up by Vienna entering world politics as a synonym of international understanding and co-operation. Following the path taken at the Helsinki Conference,  Europe could well set another example in Vienna. In our view, an agreement on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe would lay the basis for additional arms limitations; what is more, it could in the longer run facilitate accords on arms reduction in a broader area than that covered by the talks currently under way.\n83.\tThe results achieved so far by the implementation of the Final Act of 1 August 1975 adopted at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe similarly react favourably on the process of detente. In our opinion, the Belgrade meeting concluded its work with basically positive results, despite; the well-known difficulties it had to face. It reaffirmed the commitment of States to the continued implementation of the recommendations of the Helsinki Final Act and determined the directions of developing co-operation in Europe. The work of that meeting has given further proof that great effort is still needed for the settlement of questions related to the elaboration of different forms of co-operation and to the promotion of political and military detente and economic and cultural co-operation. It is encouraging to note that the Bonn Economic Summit Conference in July, one of those envisaged at Belgrade, concluded its work successfully on the subject of the \\\"Scientific Forum\\\". Serious efforts are being made to prepare additional meetings of experts in a constructive spirit and to carry out the proposals for the implementation of the Final Act by laying the basis for the Madrid meeting scheduled for 1980.\n84.\tThe Government of the Hungarian People's Republic will, as heretofore, strive for the consistent implementation of the recommendations of the Final Act, thereby contributing to the improvement of the international climate and to the expansion of Hungary's relations with the countries of Western Europe and North America.\n85.\tThere have been clear indications even before now of Israel's quest for a separate peace with the Arab Republic of Egypt as a means of bringing the other Arab States to their knees and of asserting its own annexationist interests in the Middle East. The Camp David agreements are a reflection of such endeavours.\n86.\tIt is understandable that the representatives of the genuine interests of the Arab peoples should dissociate themselves from those agreements and should have decided to take measures in defence of their interests. The\nGovernments of several Arab countries have condemned those accords, which are harmful to the Arab peoples, and have dissociated themselves from them.\n87.\tIn our View, the peoples of the Arab countries will never accept these humiliating agreements, which ignore their interests. We repeat what We have already said time and again, namely, that a Middle Hast agreement that is made without the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, cannot result in a lasting peace.\n88.\tWe hold that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East can be achieved only if account is taken of the well-known principles that should govern a settlement and of the relevant decisions and resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, as well as of the right of tire Arab people of Palestine to set up its own State, and if the framework of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East is revived.\n89.\tTire worsening situation in the Middle East is being further complicated by Israel's repeated armed provocation against Lebanon. The territorial integrity of Lebanon has been directly threatened. One of the most pressing tasks in the region is to curb the Israeli aggressors.\n90.\tThe situation on the African continent is characterized by new successes that have been scored in the struggle by the patriotic forces and the adherents of social progress to win the independence of their countries, preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity and defend their progressive social systems.\n91.\tIt was with great hopes that public opinion in Hungary greeted the decision of the Security Council on the question of Namibia. We believe that the United Nations should do its utmost to ensure that the proposed settlement will not result in a sham independence for Namibia designed as a screen for the prolongation of foreign domination. Such a \\\"solution\\\" would only lead to the emergence of a broader conflict. The South African racists' refusal to accept the report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and their scheme to stage an electoral farce in order to present the world with a fait accompli amount to outright defiance of our world Organization.\n92.\tIt is evident now that the \\\"internal settlement\\\" in Southern Rhodesia has failed. One must be prepared for the illegal Smith regimens attempting new provocations against its neighbours. We regret to state that certain Governments fail to regard this highly important matter with due seriousness and, in defiance of the Security Council resolutions, stall maintain commercial contacts with the Salisbury regime.\n93.\tThe Hungarian people is convinced that no manoeuvring wall be able to prevent the victory of SWAPO, the legitimate Representative of the Namibian people, and Of the Patriotic: Front struggling For the genuine interests of the Zimbabwean people, as in the past, we will continue to assist \\\"the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe in their struggle for complete and final liberation from colonial bondage and from the domination of the white minority.\n94.\tDisquieting news continues to reach us from South-East Asia. Tensions in that part of the world have been aggravated by the big-Power and hegemonistic policy of the Chinese leaders, by their gross pressure on and constant provocations against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. This is now the greatest obstacle to peace and security in that region. Hungary pledges its solidarity with the fraternal Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, which has won its right to a life in peace and independence through long years of arduous struggle and sacrifices.\t\n95.\tWe still hold it necessary for the United Nations and the specialized international organizations to assist the people of Viet Nam in healing the wounds of war as soon as possible.\n96.\tThere is still no progress in the settlement of the Korean question. My Government lends continuing support to the endeavours of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on behalf of the peaceful unification of the country.\n97.\tThis year's session has to face again the unresolved situation in Cyprus. The Hungarian Government unswervingly maintains that a lasting settlement can be achieved only through respect for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-aligned policy of the Republic of Cyprus and by guaranteeing the equality and mutual interests of both communities.\n98.\tGiven its natural and economic conditions, my country has a very great interest in establishing a pattern of international economic co-operation that is free from any discrimination and factors that stand in the way of building broader ties.\n99.\tMy Government supports the restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis, in accordance with the principles embodied in the resolutions of the sixth special session of the United Nations General Assembly [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)J and in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States /resolution 3281 (XXIX)].\n100.\tThe Hungarian People's Republic attaches great importance to social problems and human rights issues. We think \\\"that discussion of these questions in the United Nations would enable us to take further steps towards the final elimination of the different forms of colonial and racial oppression, of social injustice and of hunger and misery which still beset a number of countries across the world.\n101.\tWe favour the consideration by the present session of the role played by the equitable distribution of national income in the promotion of economic and social progress. It is our conviction that national income should be devoted essentially to peaceful economic construction, to the creation of conditions for the practical implementation of the right to work, and to the improvement of material, medical, social and cultural services for the broad masses of the people. The products created by working people should be used, first of all, to raise their standard of living. Only this will make it possible to realize the principle of social justice as enshrined in the Charier and to achieve the fullest observance of human rights.\n102.\tIt is in the spirit of the United Nations Charter and in accordance with the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act that Hungary for its part wishes to participate in international co-operation aimed at effective respect for human rights, and it expects other countries to do likewise. Therefore, my Government rejects any attempt at interference in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of other States under the pretext of defending human rights. Justified international action to ensure respect for human rights should also in the future be distinguished from political campaigns seeking the revival of \\\"cold war\\\" confrontation.\n103.\tThe Hungarian Government considers that the United Nations system of institutions concerned with human rights is satisfactory and sufficient. Precisely for this reason we \\\"are against the creation of additional human rights bodies, since their functioning would raise considerable difficulties for the related activity of our Organization and might lead to a deterioration of relations between Member States.\n104.\tThe Hungarian delegation avails itself of this opportunity to condemn once again the terror prevalent in Chile and to demand the cessation of brutality and the restoration of human rights and democracy. Our people supports the Chilean patriots in their struggle for a democratic revival of their country. We similarly condemn all forms of racial oppression and demand that an end be put to the apartheid policy of the Pretoria regime.\n105.\tMy Government believes that it is absolutely essential to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations, and therefore we follow attentively the work of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. We note with satisfaction the Committee's growing awareness of the fact that any step forward in this direction can result only from complete consensus of opinion. The role of the United Nations can be strengthened and its effectiveness increased primarily through greater observance of the Charter, which has stood the test of time.\n106.\tWhile recognizing the useful activities of the United Nations, I should like to voice the concern of the Hungarian delegation about certain concepts for the restructuring and developing of the Organization, including the Secretariat. The Hungarian delegation is naturally not opposed to carrying out the necessary restructuring, but it holds it essential that such efforts should be. made with great caution and with a clear definition of the areas of activity and competence.\nIt is along these lines that I have wished to sum up the position of my Government concerning some questions on the agenda of this thirty-third session of the General Assembly. I hope that the session will also perform useful work and will contribute to strengthening co-operation and understanding among nations and to consolidating peace and security.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff191.\tAs the representative of a deeply Catholic country I wish to express here before the world community our astonishment and our grief at the death of His Holiness Pope John Paul I. His goodness and generosity of heart had assured us of a pontificate devoted to the humble people of this world, who clamour for their social and human redemption.\n192.\tMr. President, Venezuela, a country which admires you, joins all Latin Americans in expressing our justifiable satisfaction at seeing you presiding over our debates. As one of the best biographers of Simon Bolivar and a great historian of the struggles of our people, you will, we know, lend a sympathetic ear to the utterances of the spokesmen of the third world, since we have in you, as President of the General Assembly, someone who understands us, pays heed to us and shares our ideas and concerns. You are an honour to your country, Colombia; you are an honour to Latin America; you are an honour to the General Assembly.\n193.\tThe bleak picture of risks and dangers presented by the world scene a year ago, far from fading, has acquired even more disquieting features since the holding of the last regular session of the General Assembly. By and large, the minimum indispensable conditions which, through tangible advances in matters of common interest, would have enabled us to arrive at encouraging conclusions in relation to the present international situation have not been forthcoming.\n194.\tThe military and economic Powers have not shown the necessary readiness to undertake the important changes which would ensure harmonious coexistence among peoples. Their policies of domination and exploitation, which persistently hinder progress towards more heartening prospects of a better world for the whole of mankind, remain unchanged.\n195.\tThe disappointing results of meetings held in the past year on a number of topics have cast a shadow of gloom over political and economic relations between industrialized and developing countries. Nor can it be said that there has been any improvement in the confidence between North and South.\n196.\tAs political and ideological disputes between the great Powers have become more acute; new hotbeds of armed conflict have emerged in other regions of the world. Contrary to the aspiration of peoples to a world order in which nations, weak and powerful alike, govern their relations, and tackle common problems with the full participation of all, the competition between the great Powers for spheres of influence continues unabated.\n197.\tIn the light of all these facts, which cause us disappointment and anguish, the principles and purposes of the United Nations, which inspire the third world's resolute and unyielding struggle to establish an order of peace and justice -in the international community, acquire greater significance. Venezuela has faith in the United Nations. That faith was reaffirmed by President Carlos Andres Perez's presence in the General Assembly hall in 1976, when he said:\n\\\"Latin America, within the third world, understands and accepts that it is in this Organization ... that the weak countries, the small countries, the countries without a history of colonialism and those freed from colonialism can fulfil themselves, give up the passive contemplation of world problems, in the determination to take part in the decisions that now and in the future will determine the course of international justice.\\\" \n198.\tWe believe that we can, within our Organization and under its auspices, bring extreme positions closer together and resolve those conflicts which hinder the attainment of peace and justice. Despite the lack of understanding and the intransigence of a few, we should be able to develop a sense of human solidarity. With tenacity and perseverance we could achieve all of these aims through concerted action in the political, social and economic spheres.\n199.\tThe Secretary-General rightly points out in his report on the work of the Organization that when we consider current world events we see that the United Nations, however imperfect or at times ineffective it may be, has become an increasingly imperative necessity, and that:\n\\\"Used properly ... the United Nations can be the instrument for overcoming much of the sense of mistrust and insecurity which makes so many international problems insoluble\\\". [See A/33/1, sect. I.]\n200.\tIt seems to me that as we begin our deliberations this year we should keep in mind one fundamental point. If we transfer our attention for one moment from the realm of contemporary politics to the field of history we shall see that, over and beyond immediate conflicts and problems of greater or lesser gravity, the times we live in are imbued with a sense of renewal and progress. Broadly speaking, since 1945 the world has presented features and. trends comparable to those which characterized Western and central Europe from the end of the fifteenth to the eighteenth century. Like that period in history, ours is an era of transition. Today, as then, man's productive capacity and his mastery over nature are growing at a staggering pace and rapidly changing man's vision of the universe and of his own destiny.\n201.\tToday, as at the dawn of the modem European era, emerging nations are asserting their sovereignty and opposing traditional imperialist ambitions. New generations, on the strength of intelligence and ability, rise up from the core of the people and challenge the traditional elites founded on inherited privilege. Though initially extreme and dogmatic, innovative ideologies gradually adjust to new realities and coexist constructively with many other schools of thought. Despite many negative reactions, the action of history as a whole creates a world of greater justice and freedom for nations and individuals alike.\n202.\tVenezuela, as an emerging nation, is basically optimistic, and we believe that the difficulties, struggles and sufferings of the present should be viewed within the optimistic concept of mankind's history.\n203.\tIt is in that spirit that the Government of President Perez has oriented its international policy and has given Venezuela's resolute support to all efforts and actions designed to change the present international order and establish bases for genuine co-operation among all States.\n204.\tThis policy, which reflects an irrevocable determination to fight for international justice, is characterized by Venezuela's militant solidarity with the other countries of the Group of 77, with whose aims and objectives we fully identify ourselves. We are convinced of the effectiveness of and the need for joint action in this age of stubborn opposition to domination and exploitation. Only through solidarity will the countries of the third world achieve their common aspirations of justice and equity.\n205.\tOurs is a real and effective solidarity, consistent with the deep-rooted democratic feelings of all Venezuelans. We have strengthened that solidarity by our participation in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, an important negotiating instrument which should serve as a stimulus to the developing world to create similar organizations to ensure the legitimate protection of their resources.\n206.. We have used the financial revenues produced by our petroleum\u2014a non-renewable resource squandered for many years by the large consumer societies\u2014to promote Venezuela's development and to endow our economy with a sound and firm basis.' But at the same time,.-we have contributed, to the extent of our abilities, to the development of other third-world countries, either through international financial institutions or through different kinds of multilateral and bilateral co-operation programmes. That sincere and open co-operation has had no other purpose than that of expressing our sense of solidarity with those countries.\n207.\tOur foreign policy is indissolubly linked to our domestic policy. The effective exercise of representative democracy has injected vigour and dynamism into our international policy, which, in turn, has been based on the same principles of justice which have guided and inspired the present Government's actions to ensure, full and sovereign enjoyment of our resources, while promoting the integral development of our country and our people's well-being.\n208.\tWe are, however, well aware of the fact that our countries cannot advance their development programmes until the bases for a new international economic order are established. That new order should enhance the value of our raw materials and our labour, placing them on a footing of equality with the labour, the manufactured goods and the technology of the industrialized countries. It is at the level of international relations that the real battle for our right to development is being waged.\n209.\tThe world economic situation, however, and the state of North-South negotiations are very disquieting. Signs of deterioration have appeared in both fields. As in the case of North-South relations, there is reason to fear that the world economy, rather than overcoming the' present difficulties, may well deteriorate still further. It is illusory to think that merely by recourse to short-term measures the problems besetting the world today can be overcome and the uncertainties and malaise, which are growing constantly more acute, can be dispelled.\n210.\tWhat is. happening in the exchange market with the main reserve currency is the most revealing symptom of the profound ills afflicting the world economy. It is no longer a question of identifying the causes of the steadily worsening monetary instability of the last 10 years. What we must do is act with a sense of urgency and tackle the problem at its roots. Attempts have, in fact, been made, by exporting inflation and unemployment, to solve the crisis through a process of adjustments behind the backs and at the expense of the developing countries.\n211.\tThis is happening at a time when there is a growing awareness of the fact that action designed effectively to resolve the problems of the third-world countries, by providing them with greater external purchasing power, is the best way to stimulate demand and, therefore, employment in the industrialized countries. This is also the way to give positive and deliberate impetus to the interdependence which clearly conditions economic relations between States. Until such time as we act in conformity with these postulates, we shall not have begun to break out of the present stagnation.\n212.\tTo achieve this, we must be paid a fair price for our raw materials, and our products should be given better access to the industrialized countries' markets, thus clearing the Way for our own industrialization process, which should benefit from the transfer of technology on reasonable terms. In this connexion, the resumption of the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities and the conferences on technology are of particular significance.\n213.\tNotwithstanding the fact that the great majority of Governments of the industrialized countries concur in this analysis of the situation, the North-South dialogue is at a standstill in the main forums. At the beginning of this month of September, the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, was compelled to adjourn its work owing to the refusal of at least one important industrialized country to negotiate in a constructive spirit.\n214.\tDialogue for the sake of dialogue is as harmful and frustrating as no dialogue at all. The solidarity evinced by the developing countries in the Committee demonstrated quite clearly that dialogue has a raison d'etre only in so far as real negotiations are carried out and concrete results are achieved. In short, to us dialogue is synonymous with negotiation, and only thus can we organize the interdependence of nations on a just and rational basis. This historic objective, which should be the logical aspiration of all, appears to be belied by the short-term measures that are being taken.\n215.\tThe continuation of this inconsistency can only lead to chaos. We cannot continue to take as a pretext for not changing existing structures the fact that the economic situation is unfavourable. Would it be sensible to think that the developing countries will stand idly by and let the industrialized countries settle as they wish the problems that affect us as much as they affect them? Or has the world economic situation deteriorated to such a point that a concerted solution by the international community is no longer possible and each country must fend for itself? It is reasonable to believe that we have reached such a point.\n216.\tNor can we allow ourselves to be carried away by futuristic speculations made by the most sophisticated computers. The creativity of the human mind has not been used in a complete and consistent manner. We need proof of leadership, that is to say, of vision and courage. We need full participation by all interests within countries and among countries.\n217.\tOn balance, there has been no progress towards the goals of the new international economic order. Sometimes we have the impression that there still prevails among some Governments the idea that the old order is favourable to the industrialized countries while the new order would be detrimental to them. In truth, the old order cannot be salvaged, nor is it possible to build .a new order that is not based on the interests of every one of the countries belonging to the international community. Furthermore, it would appear to be only natural that it should be those who are most injured by the existing situation that should derive the most advantages from a change to a new order and therefore should most strongly advocate its coming into being.\n218.\tThe Government of Venezuela has always followed with the greatest interest the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and has done everything it could to contribute to the success of the deliberations of that Conference.\n219.\tWe believe that progress has been made in the furtherance of the mandate given to the Conference by the General Assembly. Indeed, many of the articles of the integrated informal negotiating text  have the support of a large majority. However, there still remain some areas of disagreement which have been and should continue to be the subject of negotiation.\n220.\tWe view with the utmost concern the intention of the United States and other industrialized States to take unilateral measures with respect to the international zone of the sea-bed and its resources. We believe that we have moved forward in our \u2022 negotiations and that unilateral measures would definitely affect any future understanding.\n221.\tIt is obvious that that Conference has entered a very delicate phase of its work and that there must be careful planning of its future work so as to prevent stagnation, which might be discouraging and even jeopardize the results achieved so far. Accordingly we have supported the recommendation that the goal of the next session of the Conference, which will be its eighth, to be held in March and April 1979, should be the conclusion of informal negotiations and the revision and formal adoption of a text to be used as an official draft convention; and that, if that is done, another session should be held next year so as to consider, in accordance with the rules of procedure, this draft convention and any formal amendments which may be submitted by States participating in the Conference. If these objectives are attained, the Conference could meet in Caracas to conclude its work on an appropriate date in 1980.\n222.\tThe tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, was of particular importance because it was the first session exclusively devoted to that subject. However, it was not free from contradictions and paradoxes such as have characterized all meetings on disarmament. The compromise Final Document [resolution S-10/2] which was adopted after arduous consultations, and in regard to which several countries made reservations, does not reflect the aspirations of the vast majority of States. Once again there was clear evidence of the reluctance of the nuclear Powers to give even an indication of their readiness to pronounce themselves without reservation in favour of specific and effective disarmament measures in the nuclear field. Clearly, the great Powers, which are permanently in dispute because of strategic rivalries and competition for domination, united on that occasion, as they always do in disarmament forums, to torpedo any initiative which might even remotely imply a commitment to act resolutely in favour of nuclear disarmament.\n223.\tOn the other hand, while the General Assembly was meeting in New York, in Washington the leaders of States members of a military alliance were meeting with the intention of strengthening their armed forces in Europe because another alliance had weapon superiority there. Later we witnessed a parade of those same leaders in the United Nations speaking about \\\"disarmament\\\" in the general debate. Situations such as these created an atmosphere which further diminished any hope of making progress in the Assembly's efforts.\n224.\tAlthough disarmament may seem to be a quixotic undertaking, we cannot permit ourselves to be overcome by scepticism and discouragement. We would not wish to abandon the hope that, before it is tragically too late, common sense and good judgement will prevail among the nuclear Powers and that they will correct the course they have been irrationally following so far. Here I wish to reiterate Venezuela's willingness to participate actively in every multilateral forum where disarmament matters are discussed, it is in this spirit and with this determination that we shall act in the new disarmament negotiating body.\n225.\tAs a developing country of the third world, we are also concerned over the proliferation of conventional weapons, which unjustifiably diverts vital resources from development and removes opportunities for people to live lives of dignity in keeping with their right to economic and social well-being. This has been a major concern of my Government, and we have advocated the adoption of measures to achieve an arms limitation in Latin America.\n226.\tWe must strive to attain that objective, not only in order to devote more resources to the development of our peoples, but also to put an end to the lucrative profits extracted by arms dealers, who do not hesitate to foster conflicts and disputes among nations.\n227.\tOn the initiative of Venezuela, the Foreign Ministers of eight Latin American countries ratified the Declaration of Ayacucho on 22 June this year.'3 We reaffirmed the principles of the Declaration regarding arms limitations and the need to redouble our efforts to bring about conditions conducive to the effective limitation of weapons in Latin America. A few weeks ago 20 countries, including my own, attended an informal meeting on conventional weapons in Mexico. A significant aspect of that meeting was the general recognition of the desirability of establishing a system of consultation among the Latin American countries to co-ordinate initiatives which might facilitate the achievement of tangible results in arms limitation. We shall continue to explore the best way of carrying out ideas such as this one. It is to be hoped that all the Latin American countries will participate in such a dialogue, since only the assistance and effective support of all can ensure effective results. We hope that similar initiatives will be taken also in other regions of the world.\n228.\tOne of the outstanding characteristics of our time is the defence and promotion of human rights, their recognition and their full exercise. The United Nations came into being among the embers of the world struggle against Nazi fascism and all it represented: the violation of political freedoms and economic and social rights, racism, intolerance and incitement to hatred among peoples. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man were adopted 30 years ago. We cannot believe that those texts are a dead letter. The basis of Venezuela's international policy is the total defence of human rights. Our policy is not one of mere convenience; nor is it a fantasy. Our policy is a reflection of our deep convictions, which we do not apply with discrimination or to serve ulterior purposes.\n229.\tWe resolutely support the peoples of Africa who are struggling for their independence and who for over 500 years have been denied their most elementary rights. We are in favour of a rational solution for Zimbabwe, without any conditions imposed by the racist minority, and we are resolutely in favour of the independence of Namibia and shall accordingly support all United Nations initiatives in that country.\n230.\tThe resistance of South Africa, the centre for every policy of racial discrimination and violence in Africa, and its refusal to implement Security Council resolutions cause us grave concern.\n231.\tLatin America is now confronted by a serious dilemma: namely, whether or not to remain indifferent in the face of an unprecedented tragic event in its history.\n232.\tThe Nicaraguan drama began to unfold almost half a century ago when Augusto Cesar Sandino died at the hands of the first Somoza. Repression torture and death have for the following 45 years filled the pages of the history of that country, where one Somoza succeeds and inherits from another Somoza.\n233.\tBeginning with the assassination of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, a scholar and politician, every inch of Nicaraguan soil has been covered in blood. We in Latin America have never seen anything like it before. The Archbishop of Managua has implored the world to prevent somehow the massacre of his people, to stop the annihilation and genocide of one of the bravest, most admirable and resolute people in Latin America.\n234.\tAn anguished cry for help reaches us from the ruins of the devastated cities of Matagalpa, Leon, Rivas, Esteli, Chinandega and Masaya.\n235.\tUnited states television has offered us the most tragic testimony of that civil strife. It has shown us how Catholic churches were destroyed and how old and sacred images were machine-gunned; the press tells us how the dead are buried in the streets or the corpses incinerated and thrown into common graves. And United States television has revealed another no less tragic aspect of those events - the recruitment of mercenaries in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to go and fight in Nicaragua. The fury of destruction unleashed against the defenceless civilian Nicaraguan population, which has taken no part in the fighting or the rebellion, cannot under any circumstances be the work of Nicaraguans. An operation of annihilation is being carried out in Nicaragua and in the name of the Venezuelan people I speak out before this Assembly against those tragic events.\n236.\tThe Venezuelan people have taken the obvious stand, a position of denunciation and close solidarity with the great people of Nicaragua.\n237.\tAs was stated before this Assembly by President Rodrigo Carazo of Costa Rica filth meeting], peace in the region has been and continues to be threatened. While there may be a regional body that could or would decide to look On with indifference, the international community cannot do so. We must help the people of Nicaragua; we must respond to the anguished cries of mothers searching in vain for their sons buried or incinerated where they were shot down. Thousands of Nicaraguans are emigrating from their country to escape death. More than 25,000 have sought asylum in neighbouring countries. We believe that the United Nations has a commitment to those people.\n238.\tThat is the tragedy that has shaken our part of the world. Indifference would make us all liable to condemnation.\n239.\tThe Heads of State of Colombia and Venezuela have addressed themselves, to you, Sir, as President of the General Assembly, denouncing this serious situation. Although the text of their communication is already an official document of this Assembly, I shall conclude my statement by reading out one of its paragraphs:\n\\\"In denouncing the tragic and dramatic situation of vast segments of the population of Nicaragua, whose essential rights are being violated, we respect the principle of non-intervention, which is by no means incompatible with the task of internationally safeguarding human rights which the United Nations is required to perform, as is the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, there being no objection to simultaneous action by these two bodies since the United Nations is not required consider the political case submitted to the jurisdiction of the regional organization but to take action in defence of human rights which, as we understand it, is an inescapable obligation of the agencies responsible for ensuring full respect for those rights.\\\" [See A/33/275, annex].\n \n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff162.\tOn behalf of my delegation I am happy to discharge the pleasant duty of congratulating the President most warmly on his brilliant election to preside over the thirty-third regular session' of the United Nations General Assembly. By a happy combination of circumstances the presidency of our Assembly has successively been entrusted to members of the Group of 77, who all face the same difficulties of existence and are thus part of a movement of collective solidarity in the face of common challenges. My delegation is convinced that under Mr. Lievano's presidency we will do constructive work to overcome the present difficult world situation. This conviction is based on his brilliant personal qualities and his experienced statesmanship.\n163.\tWe likewise congratulate Mr. Lievano's colleagues on the General Committee, whose contribution will no doubt be indispensable in the discharge of his heavy and serious duties.\n164.\tMy delegation is pleased with the excellent report on the work of the Organization [A/33/1J submitted to this Assembly by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who has once again proved his qualities as a tireless pilgrim of peace. The relevance of the proposals contained in that report, like the courage with which they are presented, constitute confirmation of the judiciousness of the choice of our Organization in renewing his mandate two years ago by an overwhelming majority.\n165.\tI wish to pay a more than deserved tribute to Mr. Mojsov, the President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly, who, during a year filled with work for the Organization, discharged his duty with honour to his country, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and to the entire family of non-aligned countries by competently and authoritatively guiding the destiny of our Organization.\n166.\tToday, as in the past, Zaire continues to place its confidence in the United Nations because we consider it to be an irreplaceable instrument for the quest for peace in the world. Our Organization is a melting-pot in which a universal conscience is defined and affirmed at the same time as the major principles of co-operation among nations. If all States displayed genuine political will, there is no doubt that the means of action of our Organization in the full assumption of its responsibilities would be markedly increased. But in order to improve the output and increase the effectiveness of our Organization perhaps some of our working methods should be changed. The present practice of holding an annual session with an annual general debate followed by a vote on draft resolutions is certainly constructive. First of all it gives us the opportunity and the privilege to meet and to exchange ideas. But in some ways it looks like a huge tourist operation. Moreover, if we examine things closely we see that since the problems are often the same, our speeches and resolutions remain the same too. Sometimes, even, statements are made before an almost empty hall. Even so, we are satisfied to produce an impressive number of resolutions, three fourths of which, certainly, are not implemented. This sometimes has a depressing effect. That being so, should we not reduce the number of meetings, and set up a committee to monitor the implementation of resolutions in order to avoid their being repeated? Finally, would it not be desirable to reduce the number of items submitted to us for consideration? These are some thoughts my delegation submits to the Assembly for its consideration.\n167.\tSince it came into being the United Nations has often faced arduous problems the solution of which has necessarily entailed the goodwill and assistance of all States. Regrettably we must note that, while there are rays of light here and there, complete success in seeking peace and fruitful co-operation requires increased vigilance by our Organization.\n168.\tAt present the United Nations is reaching the end of a decade in which we ambitiously set ourselves some important goals in various fields which can all be grouped as one, namely that of development. In this field we are bound to note that results have fallen short of our expectations and ambitions.\n169.\tIn a world characterized by interdependence peace and security become common treasures and constitute indispensable factors for sincere and fruitful co-operation in respect for the sovereignty of one's partners whatever the socio-economic regime to which they belong, and whatever their prestige or level of development.\n170.\tHowever, this world in which we live is daily threatened by cataclysms of all kinds and by the unbridled super-arms race which absorbs important resources that could be allocated to development. It is also threatened by the aggravation of inequalities which tends to become systematic-in brief, by the dehumanization that runs the risk of bringing our planet to total ruin.\n171.\tAt its tenth special session the General Assembly devoted more than a month, to a question of vital importance in our time: disarmament. It is 17 years since the non-aligned countries expressed the desire of having our Organization assume more direct responsibility in regard to disarmament. All mankind places great hopes in this prospect, given the problem of the escalation of the violence to which the world is now subjected and the production of increasingly sophisticated arms the destructive capacity of which grows alarmingly.\n172.\tThe tenth special session of the General Assembly aroused great hopes, but they have not been fulfilled-far from it. The results of that session were, it must be realized, very scant. The international community still wants to arrive at results such as those enumerated by the President of the French Republic, Mr. Valery Giscard d'Estaing,1 8 so that it can propose elements for a solution or a system for de-escalation and a return to calm.\n173.\tThere have been various reactions to the proposals of the French President. But we think that they should be considered a positive contribution to increasing mankind's awareness of the apocalyptic danger represented by the excessive armaments that in our day nations that can indulge in the. luxury of such military enterprises allow themselves. Yet it may be observed that both in real and in relative terms the gross national product of the majority of\nthe States Members of our Organization clearly reveals a state of decided poverty.\n174.\tOf course the arms race and the constant improvement of these more and more sophisticated weapons are the consequence, the corollary, of a persistent climate of insecurity created by fear of the future: fear first of all of being the victim of a holocaust and fear also of losing supremacy and the diplomatic advantages that that entails. Finally, the aggression perpetrated by Member States against other countries has only intensified the climate of mutual distrust already aggravated by the absence of any significant international control of disarmament.\n175.\tThat is why we must attack the evil at its roots. It is to be hoped that acts of aggression will cease through a voluntary and deliberate return by all members of our international community to respect for the principles of the Charter, in particular the principles of the peaceful settlement of disputes arising in one place or another between Member States, strict respect for the sovereignty of States, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.\n176.\tIt was in that spirit that, at the thirty-first regular session, my delegation supported the Soviet proposal for the conclusion of a treaty on non-recourse to force in the settlement of international disputes. \n177.\tIf such principles were adopted and respected there would perhaps be more respect for commitments, thereby , lessening aggressiveness and resulting in less and less recourse to violence. This would have as its corollary recourse to dialogue, which implies negotiation, because, in order to settle conflicts which arise throughout the world in the absence of adequate conciliation machinery, there is only armed violence either with conventional or with nuclear weapons.\n178.\tThe draft convention submitted by the Soviet Union with regard to the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon countries [AI33/241, annex, addendum] is an excellent initiative and represents a first step, but the most adequate solution would consist in simply prohibiting nuclear weapons as such.\n179.\tOn 16 December 1969, at the twenty-fourth regular session of the General Assembly, when the 1970s were declared the Disarmament Decade /see resolution 2602 E (XXIV)j. the major objective to be attained was the release of resources devoted to the arms race and their channelling for the benefit of economic and social development. However, we have since then witnessed a reverse trend. Military expenditures are increasing at an accelerated rate, going from approximately $US 113 billion in 1969 to approximately $400 billion at the present time, which represents an average of more than $1 billion every day. And there is nothing to indicate that in the near future there will be a reversal in the curve regarding military expenditures.\n180.\tIf a tax of that magnitude were to be collected by the Organization and devoted to development, as proposed\n\nso wisely by President Sedor Senghor of Senegal,  important progress could be made in achieving a new balance in international economic relations, instead of continuing to sink such colossal sums in an enterprise at once as absurd as it is perilous for the future of mankind.\n181.\tThus my delegation endorses the proposal to set up machinery to collect such a tax.\n182.\tFor rather more than five years the world has been living through one of the most serious crises of its economic and social history from the point, of view of both its proportions and its duration. This crisis is being particularly felt by the under-equipped and poor countries, which are suffering the cumulative effects of inflation, deterioration in the terms of trade, a decline in the principal raw materials market, drought and other natural calamities.\n183.\tOn the other hand, today there are still States indulging in senseless waste of large resources on military enterprises, instead of using them for the benefit of development in keeping with the declared objective of this Disarmament Decade.\n184.\tFaced with this situation, our Organization should adopt all the measures needed to define a new strategy for development, for the crisis which is raging has brought to light the inadequacy of the machinery and the failure of the means made available for development.\n185.\tThe North-South dialogue, which should work out the procedures for the new international economic order, is marking time. And the first hopes it had aroused in Paris, at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in 1977, are beginning to be stifled because of the lack of political will and firm commitment among the rich countries which cling to their privileges, although a proper perception of their interests should have led them to greater understanding and determination.\n186.\tWe must encourage the continuance of this dialogue within UNCTAD. We regret that since agreement was reached on the principle of setting up a common fund no substantial progress has been made at the negotiating conference.  We remain convinced that the common fund could play the role of catalyst in the attainment of the objectives of the Integrated Programme for Commodities. In another context, the industrialized countries accepted other commitments in Paris, including the establishment of a special fund to assist the most needy countries. They also declared themselves ready to support the African countries in their programme within the framework of their Transport and Communications Decade in Africa.\n187.\tMy country, Zaire, which relies in particular on exports of raw materials, including copper, was severely shaken by the international crisis, with its train of misfortunes, to which were added other difficulties caused by its geographical location as a semi-land-locked country. Outlets for most of its export products are located outside its territory. All these negative factors have created a very difficult situation for my country, to meet which special measures and recourse to international solidarity are required.\n188.. Thus, within the framework of its development Zaire has been forced to draw up a programme for recovery which includes such action as transport reorganization, agricultural development and the complete development of the mining industry. However, to the many difficulties in the implementation of this plan, there is added a natural phenomenon-the drought now afflicting the western region of the country, where this natural calamity has resulted in very serious losses in agricultural production and in the income of the population of that region, which numbers nearly 2 million.\n\n189.\tI should like to take this opportunity to thank all the countries which have agreed to participate in implementing the recovery plan, which bears the name of our President.\n190.\tIt is fitting to mention here another area in which negotiations between rich and poor countries are not advancing. This is the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the importance of which is vital to all in the establishment of a new international economic order.\n191.\tThe vast resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor, which have been proclaimed as the common heritage of mankind, must be equitably distributed among all the members of the international community, taking due account of the interests of the under-equipped and geographically disadvantaged countries.\n192.\tIn this new context the new law of the sea should not lead to aggravation of the situation of the under- equipped countries, particularly those which produce raw materials on land, countries which are already severely afflicted by the world crisis and by declining prices for most of their raw materials.\n193.\tThe exploitation of the resources of the sea must be carried out for the benefit of all-rich or poor, technologically advanced or not. However, in order to achieve this, all countries must show sufficient political will so that the arduous negotiations may reach a successful conclusion within a reasonable time. Meanwhile, no ill-considered initiative should be taken.\n194.\tI should like now to take up a question which for some 30 years has been debated by our Assembly; this is, of course, the Middle East crisis or, more accurately, the Israeli-Arab conflict, the background of which is the question of Palestine.\n195.\tZaire's position on this thorny problem has never altered since at this very rostrum on 4 October 1973 it was clearly defined by the most authoritative voice of Zaire, that of the President of the Republic.\n196.\tAny lasting and genuine solution of this crisis must necessarily include the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland and the withdrawal by\nIsrael from the territories it occupied as a result of the 1967 war. To this end, it seems to us that there should be a dialogue between the parties concerned. Zaire, like the other Members of our Organization, cannot fail to encourage this.\n197.\tNo one can deny that the tragedy of the Middle East is extremely complex. Simplistic solutions cannot be applied to it. Similarly, it is neither adequate nor seemly to become involved in condemnations and sterile invective or in facile congratulations for some minor success. Zaire supports all efforts aimed at establishing a just and lasting peace in the interests of the peoples of the region. We therefore encourage the initiatives of President El-Sadat and hope that they will lead to a lasting solution satisfactory to all parties to the conflict, the Palestinian people and the entire Arab nation.\n198.\tFurthermore, Zaire has always proclaimed that all the countries in that part of the world must have the right to exist. Israel is a fact, a geopolitical reality , which cannot be denied by anyone since Israel actually exists and is there. Similarly, that the Palestinian people also exist is a fact. One cannot therefore refuse to some what has been given to others.\n199.\tWhen we speak about boundaries between Israel and its neighbouring Arab States we often use expressions such as \\\"secure and recognized boundaries\\\".\n200.\tThe concept of internationally recognized boundaries appears reasonable, while the concept of secure boundaries has always seemed to us to be artificial, for how can frontiers be secure, bearing in mind modern means of warfare, except through the will-of those who inhabit the region and through international guarantees, because if there is bad faith on one side everything will be brought into question again.\n201.\tTo be more convinced of this it is only necessary to recall that, despite the boundaries it considered not to be secure, Israel waged and won the 1967 war, whereas with\nso-called secure boundaries it almost lost the war of 1973.\n202.\tLet us not forget that for centuries the Jewish people suffered from the Diaspora. The international community then gave it territory where it exercised its sovereignty for 30 years. It would be unfair now to subject the Palestinian people to a similar Diaspora.\n203.\tIn taking up the Middle East problem the international community must bear these realities ever in mind. It must do everything in its power to facilitate the establishment of propitious conditions for a frank and sincere dialogue among all the parties concerned so as to safeguard the exercise of their sovereign national rights in territory with boundaries guaranteed by the international community.\n204.\tIn recent years Africa has experienced a difficult political situation which has been exacerbated by economic difficulties engendered mainly by the international crisis and natural calamities.\n205.\tThe year 1979 will perhaps bring a ray of hope for peace and stability after the tumult we have suffered during the past three years. The process of decolonization has entered into its last phase, a decisive and hazardous phase, that requires of our Organization the greatest vigilance and a strictness that will withstand all tests, because the enemy, which is struggling with the energy of despair to maintain its immoral and historically condemned privileges, attempts by tricks and violence to vitiate and rob of all meaning the inevitable accession to independence and majority rule of the peoples of southern Africa.\n206.\tSince the process of liberation began the African continent has polarized the attention of world public opinion. Today the world can no longer question what will happen tomorrow in Africa in the field of decolonization.\n207.\tIt was following the crumbling of the bulwark of the Portuguese colonialists in Africa that the process of liberation was accelerated and broadened to include Zimbabwe and Namibia, thus creating new conditions, unknown until then in the very bastion of apartheid.\n208.\tTomorrow\u2014who can doubt it? \u2014Zimbabwe and Namibia will accede to independence, and this will deal the final blow to the system of apartheid that afflicts South Africa. This is why we can now affirm that 1979 will be for our continent a decisive year for the future of all of Africa, and this despite the rear-guard action that is being desperately carried out by the racists who built the last colonialist bastion in that part of the world.\n209.\tAs regards Zimbabwe, confusion reigns. We welcomed the Anglo-American plan,2 3 hoping that its faithful application would become a basis for discussion. The internal settlements have solved nothing because, to be valid, they would have to include all components of the problem and indicate the successive steps for peaceful accession by Zimbabwe to real independence.\n210.\tNevertheless, because of its experience and recent history Zaire sincerely hopes that all those who are fighting will unite so that the majority may take power in order and calm, without foreign interference, for the benefit of all of\nAfrica.\n211.\tLack of unity has often given an opportunity to foreign Powers to interfere in our continent and thus hamper our progress towards development. In conformity with its Constitution and the fundamental ideas defined in the Manifesto of the Popular Movement of the Revolution, Zaire reaffirms its determination to contribute to the struggle against the white racist minority in Zimbabwe, as well as its total support for the brother countries of Africa, the neighbours of Rhodesia and the victims of repeated acts of aggression by the Ian Smith clique.\n212.\tWe have been informed that Ian Smith has been invited to come to the United States and deliver a lecture. We certainly should not interfere in the internal affairs of another country, but we sincerely hope that there is still\n\ntime for the United States to prevent the arrival of Ian Smith on its territory.\n213.\tIan Smith is a criminal and an assassin and his arrival in the United States would be considered by all to be an attack on human rights. If he should come here, we sincerely hope that Amnesty International will intervene.\n214.\tThe situation in Namibia, in our opinion, seems clearer. SWAPO, the only movement recognized by our Organization and the legitimate representative of the Namibian people, has accepted the peaceful path to independence within the framework of a plan drawn up by the five Western Powers.\n215.\tThe Secretary-General of the United Nations has made relevant proposals indicating the stages leading to irreversible independence, including adequate consultation with the population concerned. Zaire cannot but subscribe to that clear and precise plan and reaffirms its belief in the unity of the Namibian people and the territorial integrity of that country.\n216.\tThe Republic of Zaire therefore vigorously condemns the sordid manoeuvres of South Africa to precipitate elections in Namibia so as to bring about a puppet government loyal to it. No form of independence is acceptable for that Territory unless it is sanctioned by our Organization. The United Nations has the imperative duty to bring Namibia to independence with respect for its unity and territorial integrity.\n217.\tThe accession to independence of the States which surround South Africa has sounded the death knell of the minority racist regime of South Africa. South Africa is waging an anachronistic war to save its iniquitous apartheid system. As was stated at this rostrum on 4 October 1973 by the President of the Republic of Zaire: \\\"A fruit falls only when it is ripe; but in the storms and the tempests of history, the fruit falls, whether ripe or not.\\\" \n218.\tIt is a sign of our times that for some days a process of political instability has been going on in South Africa. The situation prevailing in South Africa must be considered in terms of the racial conflict which provoked it and the odious and reprehensible system of apartheid, that new form of slavery of our times.\n219.\tThe tension which apartheid in South Africa has always caused and the terrible and barbarous massacres of the non-white populations to which it has given rise since Sharpeville have made the international community fully aware of the situation so that today the infamous doctrine of apartheid is unanimously condemned by all mankind.\n220.\tThis explains all the meetings and conferences which have taken place, whether in Maputo, Lagos, Maseru or, very recently, Geneva. In regard to the last, my delegation regrets the rather disappointing results of the Geneva Conference,  but continues to believe that it is not because there has been a change of attitude regarding the more general question of the elimination of racial discrimination and in particular the system of apartheid. These questions are too serious for our community to be able to compromise on them.\n221.\tI should now like to take up a matter to which my delegation attaches as much importance as to the preceding ones: good-neighbourly relations. The President of the Republic of Zaire, during the Second Congress of our Popular Movement of the Revolution, recalled this policy when he declared :\n\\\"Faithful to our Constitution and its fundamental action as defined in the Manifesto of the Popular Movement of the Revolution, Zaire attaches special importance to its African vocation and, and in particular, promotes good-neighbourly relations.\\\"\n222.\tAnd Zaire sets great store by that policy. That is why my delegation wishes to draw the attention of the Assembly, during this session, to the genuine and complete normalization, in accordance with the political and diplomatic process, of our relations with our neighbour, the People's Republic of Angola.\n223.\tThat is a major achievement of our international policy, which is to the credit of our will for peace, solidarity and brotherhood, so often proclaimed by the President of the Republic of Zaire. That will has met with an echoing response from and the same positive determination on the part of Antonio Agostinho Neto, the President of the People's Republic of Angola.\n224.\tThis, I think, is one of the appropriate important places for us to exalt this elevated political sense of the Presidents of Zaire and Angola, who resort to African wisdom based essentially on dialogue and consultation. Between them they have brought our peoples to this situation, over which every Angolan and every Zairian rejoices. The two countries have put an end to the atmosphere of opposition, which was not appropriate for two brother peoples. In our world of interdependence, peace and security constitute, to be sure, factors indispensable for the development of our countries. Africa is still far from having an atmosphere favourable to genuine development.\n225.\tOur two countries, the People's Republic of Angola and the Republic of Zaire, despite their different economic and social systems, have decided to co-operate so that cordial and brotherly understanding shall reign between them and their brother peoples with a view to their development.\n226.\tThis reconciliation, which took place after that reached by our brothers of Senegal and the Ivory Coast, on the one hand, and Guinea on the other, cannot but create rejoicing among all sons of the African continent. It shows also that as long as Africans are among themselves, free from evil geniuses or wicked sirens, there are no difficulties or disputes which they cannot overcome and iron out.\n227.\tI could not conclude under this heading without special mention of our blood brothers of the People's\nRepublic of the Congo and their President, Mr. Yhomby Opango, for the positive and substantial role they played in this normalizing of relations between Zaire and Angola.\n228.\tI shall end my statement by expressing the satisfaction of my delegation at seeing Solomon Islands joining the great United Nations family. We welcome it. We are sure that its contribution to our work will be most constructive.\n\n\n"

They consist in a recognition and formalization in international documents of a kind of code of rules for honest and fair relations among countries, a code which erects legal as well as moral and political barriers in the way of those given to military gambles. They consist in the achievement of the first understandings\u2014however modest they may be so far\u2014which seal off some of the channels of the arms race. They consist also in an intricate system of agreements covering many areas of peaceful co-operation among States with different social systems.\n67.\tOn 25 June 1978, speaking at the ceremony devoted to the presentation of the Order of Lenin and the \\\"Gold Star\\\" medal to the hero city of Minsk, the capital of the Byelorussian SSR, Comrade Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, emphasized that:\n\\\"The vital interests of the working peoples of all countries demand that the positive achievements of the last few years on the world arena should not be discarded and that efforts should be made to advance towards a genuine, lasting peace for all nations. By the joint efforts of all peace-loving forces this aim can be achieved, and we believe it will be achieved.\\\"\n68.\tGiven the complexity and contradictory nature of world developments, and despite the resistance of the forces of imperialism and reaction, the successful implementation of the programme of peace put forward by the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and of its organic follow-up, the programme of further struggle for peace and international co-operation, and for the freedom and independence of the peoples, adopted by the Twenty-Fifth Congress of the Communist\nParty of the Soviet Union, promotes the consolidation of the process of detente and provides a real opportunity for the consistent assertion in international relations of the principles of peaceful coexistence, for the development of mutually advantageous co-operation between States, for the removal of the threat of another world war and the elimination of war from the life of humanity, for the cessation of the arms race and the attainment of disarmament, for the solution of the problems of decolonization and the liquidation of racism and apartheid, and for the further economic and social progress of all peoples.\n69.\tOne cannot fail to note, however, that with the deepening of the process of detente, its adversaries are mounting a more active campaign. This requires increased vigilance on the part of all peace-loving forces. The task has become particularly urgent in the context of the apparent activation of militarist forces. The aggressive circles of imperialism are not willing to reconcile themselves to all their failures: defeat in social battles, the loss of their colonial possessions, the departure from capitalism by an increasing number of countries, and the successes of world socialism. Under the guise of deceptive propaganda campaigns, one of which makes a lot of fuss about the so-called \\\"Soviet military threat\\\", they are feverishly launching long-term military programmes to secure their military superiority\u2014a fact which poses a very serious threat to the cause of the peace and freedom of the peoples.\n70.\tThe actions of China are also fraught with serious danger. By embarking on the road of great-Power chauvinism and hegemonism, the leaders of that State preach the inevitability of another world war, openly count on an increase in international tension, sabotage disarmament, and form blocs with the most reactionary militarist forces. The course at present being followed by the leaders in Peking is a great threat to many peoples of the world. This is attested to also by the continuous provocations of the People's Republic of China against its neighbouring States, against heroic Viet Nam, whose people recently maintained, in bloody battles, their freedom and the unity of their native land.\n71.\tIn present conditions it is absolutely essential to counteract in the most resolute way any attempts to undermine the process of detente, to turn international developments back to the times of the \\\"cold war\\\". Now more than ever before it is imperative to adhere strictly in relations among States to the principles of the non-use of force and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, to respect the rights of all peoples to freedom and independence, and to increase efforts designed to ensure the extensive development of peaceful co-operation-and the possibilities of such co-operation are clearly defined in the United Nations Charter, in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, in the United Nations Declaration on the Deepening and Consolidation of International Detente [resolution 32/155/, and in other United Nations decisions.\n72.\tIn international affairs the Soviet Union is steadily pursuing the Leninist policy of peace, of consolidation of the security of peoples, and of broad international cooperation. Our Constitution outlaws war propaganda and puts forward the task of achieving general and complete disarmament. Designed for the years and decades to come, our plans are directed towards peaceful construction, for the happiness and well-being of the people. That is why the Soviet Union is so active and consistent in its policy of curbing the arms race and proceeding towards measures of real disarmament.\n73.\tLately the Soviet Union put forward a comprehensive programme of new constructive and realistic initiatives to ensure a break-through in the struggle for stopping the arms race. These specific proposals have been formulated in a number of speeches by Comrade L. I. Brezhnev and in the document entitled \\\"Practical measures for ending the arms race\\\", submitted by the Soviet Union to the United Nations General Assembly special session devoted to disarmament. It is to be noted with satisfaction that all major Soviet initiatives are reflected in some form or other in the Final Document adopted by the special session on disarmament, and they should be negotiated further or become part of the future programme of work of the Committee on Disarmament.\n74.\tIt will be recalled that the Soviet proposals provide for the complete cessation of further quantitative and qualitative increases in the arms and armed forces of States having large military potentials; an end to the production of all types of nuclear weapons and a gradual reduction of their stockpiles until they have been completely destroyed; the cessation of the production of, and prohibition of, all other types of weapons of mass destruction; the cessation of the development of new types of conventional armaments of great destructive capability; the renunciation by the permanent members of the Security Council, and by countries that have military agreements with them, of the expansion of their armies and the increase of the quantity of their conventional armaments; a reduction in the military budgets of States with a large economic and military potential, and above all those of the permanent members of the Security Council. Suggesting that negotiations towards the cessation of the nuclear arms race be started at the earliest possible date, the Soviet Union has also made a number of proposals for political measures and measures of international law to strengthen the security of all States. Of paramount importance in this respect is the need to conclude a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations, whereby all States, including, of course, all the nuclear Powers, would pledge not to use or threaten to use force; this would guarantee the genuine security of all States, big and small, nuclear and non- nuclear. We support also the proposal of the Polish People's Republic on the adoption of a declaration on the preparation of societies for life in peace [A/C.1I33I2].\n75.\tA move of greatest importance in the further struggle for the strengthening of international security is the Soviet- sponsored draft international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States which stipulates that:\n\\\"The nuclear-weapon States Parties to this Convention pledge themselves not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States Parties to this Convention which renounce the production and acquisition of nuclear weapons and which have no nuclear weapons in their territory or anywhere under their jurisdiction or control, on land, on the sea, in the air or in outer space,\\\" (A/33/241, addendum, article A].\nThe implementation of this Soviet initiative and the reaching of an understanding to the effect that no nuclear weapons should be stationed in the territories of States where there are no such weapons at present would make a substantial contribution to reducing the threat of a nuclear war.\n76. The socialist countries have recently made very substantive proposals at the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. These proposals are based on the principle of equal security for all parties. They accommodate the wishes of Western countries, from which we are entitled to expect a constructive approach to these talks.\nIt is of great importance to conclude as soon as possible the current negotiations on such questions as the limitation of strategic offensive arms, the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests, the prohibition of chemical weapons, the prohibition of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction and the prohibition of the production, stockpiling, deployment and use of neutron weapons. It is necessary to take effective measures to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons and to frustrate attempts to put into effect plans for the production of nuclear weapons in South Africa and Israel.\n78. A most pressing problem of our time is that of curbing the arms race. It is clear to all that the development of new, even mete destructive and barbaric types of weapons and the further build-up of military potential may lead mankind to the dangerous threshold of an armed confrontation. All this imposes a special responsibility upon Governments, statesmen and the United Nations, from which the peoples of the world expect not mere lip service to disarmament but the attainment of disarmament in real terms.\n79.\tThe Byelorussian SSR and all States of the socialist community are firmly convinced that the task of making sweeping advances in disarmament requires the preparation and early convening of the World Disarmament Conference, as the most representative and authoritative international forum, which could make the concern for the formulation and adoption of effective and mandatory decisions on disarmament a matter of first priority for the leaders of ail States at the highest level.\n80.\tOne of the main tasks before the present session is to take mom effective measures to eliminate as soon as possible the existing hotbeds of international tension and to prevent the emergence of new ones. This is true first and foremost of the Middle East. A just and lasting peace in the Middle East and be achieved only on the basis of the complete liberation of all Arab territories occupied by Israel in 1967, full said unambiguous respect for the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including their right to create their own independent State and ensuring firm guarantees of the security of all countries in the region and their right to an independent existence and peaceful development.\n81. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR believes that it is neither through separate deals at the expense of the interests of the Arab peoples nor through capitulation to the aggressor, thus consolidating the spoils of the Israeli aggression, but through the implementation of the United Nations decisions on the Middle East and the Palestinian issue and through negotiations within the framework of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, under the co-chairmanship of the Soviet Union and the United States, with the full participation of all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, that a lasting and just solution in the Middle East can be achieved.\n82.\tThe United Nations decisions on Cyprus providing for the settlement of the problem on the basis of respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and its policy of non-alignment, non-interference in its internal affairs and the strengthening of trust between the two communities should be fully implemented. The proposal of the Soviet Union to convene an international conference o, Cyprus under the auspices of the United Nations  has lost none of its relevance at the present time.\nV\n83.\tOur delegation advocates the implementation of the decision of the United Nations General Assembly concerning the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea [resolution 3390 B (XXX)/, thus creating the prerequisites for the independent peaceful reunification of Korea on a democratic basis, free from any outside interference.\n84.\tIt is imperative to seek the elimination of the racist und colonialist regimes in southern Africa, the prompt exercise by the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia of their right to self-determination and genuine independence, the liquidation of the system of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa, and the cessation of military, political and economic interference by imperialist Powers in the affairs of independent African countries. The imperialist forces should not be permitted to undertake, under a new disguise of far-fetched propaganda\u2014as they have more than once in the past\u2014activities tailored to the patterns of the colonial era against the peoples of southern Africa or any other dependent territories.\n85.\tThe General Assembly must make wide-ranging international efforts with a view to implementing the provisions of the Declaration and Programme of Action adopted last August by the World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination [A/33/262, sect. III]. The Conference stressed the danger of the growing ties between Israel and the racist regimes in southern Africa. It recalled the tragedy suffered by the people of Palestine and emphasized the need for comprehensive and binding sanctions against the apartheid regime in Pretoria and the racist regime in Rhodesia. The non-participation of Western countries in the Conference and their negative approach to its decisions are clear evidence of their intention to hamper the elimination of racism and of their disregard for fundamental human rights.\n86.\tIt is necessary to intensify the struggle against mass and flagrant violation of human rights and freedoms, which, among other things, endanger the peace and security of the peoples: in other words, to Intensify the struggle against apartheid, racism, the violation of the rights of the Palestinian people on the occupied territories and the infringement of human rights in Chile, Nicaragua and South Korea,\n87.\tAccording to the United Nations Charter, one of the purposes of the Organization is to achieve international co-operation in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights. What is involved here is co-operation at the inter-State level through the conclusion and universal implementation of the relevant international instruments, with due respect for the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. The struggle for human rights cannot validly serve as a pretext for attempting to shield or exonerate racist or pro-Fascist regimes or to allow agents on the payroll of imperialist services engaged in subversion to go unpunished.\n88.\tThe progress made in the main and most important area of United Nations activity aimed at strengthening peace and international security generates more favourable conditions for safeguarding the political and economic independence of the developing countries and restructuring international economic relations on a just and equitable basis. The socialist countries actively support the aspirations of the developing countries to eliminate discrimination and all kinds of artificial barriers in international trade and all manifestations of imperialist diktat, exploitation and inequality in international economic relations. It is specifically the vestiges of the colonial past and the neo-colonialist activities of international monopolies with regard to relations between developed capitalist States and developing countries that are being used by the imperialist forces to encroach upon the sovereignty of young independent States, impose their will on those States and interfere in their internal affairs. The Foreign Ministers of those developing countries have given details of the scale this danger assumes and the scope of the economic, trade, scientific and technical problems the developing countries are facing. They rightly pointed out that the political and .economic factors related to the foreign policy and economies of the developed capitalist countries, which are afflicted by crises, inflation, unemployment and constant increases in the cost of living, give rise to the phenomena of destabilization and precariousness in the development of international economic relations and have most adverse effects on the situation in the developing countries.\n89.\tAs is well known, the socialist countries have nothing to do with the colonial plundering of African, Asian and Latin American countries, the neo-colonialist ways of exploiting them or the adverse impact of the economic factors of the capitalist economy on the developing countries. The States of the socialist community neither hunt for concessions in the developing countries nor covet control over their natural resources. In our view, the way to solve the problems of economic growth and social progress in the developing countries lies in the elaboration and implementation of a series of measures that would meet the requirements of the restructuring of international economic relations on a just and equitable basis, in reducing the burden of military expenditures and channelling the resources thus released to the objectives of development, with 10 per cent of that amount being allocated to increase assistance to developing countries.\n90.\tHistory knows of no society that has been able to do or has done as much as socialism for the benefit of the working people. The peoples of the socialist countries cherish their economic, political and social gains and their social order, which they won in fierce battles and built up with their strenuous labour. A case in point is the Byelorussian SSR, which will celebrate its sixtieth anniversary on 1 January 1979. The enlightened policy of the Communist Party, the internationalist unity and fraternal assistance of the peoples of the USSR and the selfless labour of the people of the Republic have made it possible not only to make up for the material losses caused by the wars that were imposed upon us but also to transform in a short period of time a once backward country of semi- primitive enterprises and an almost ruined agriculture, a country of poverty, disease and illiteracy, into a socialist republic having a highly developed industry, a highly mechanized, intensive and collectively-managed agriculture, modern science and high standards of culture. The salient feature of the Byelorussia of today is its large-scale industry, which accounts for over 60 per cent of the Republic's gross national product. Its main components are machine building, machine-tool construction, radio- electronics, chemistry and petrochemistry, instrument- making and other modern industries underlying scientific and technological progress. The industrial output of the Byelorussian SSR has increased more than 190-fold as compared to the pre-revolutionary level. In recent decades Byelorussia's economic potential has doubled every seven years. During the past 12 years its grain and milk production has doubled and its production of meat has increased by a factor of 2.6. In the current five-year period, 1976 to 1980, industrial output should increase by 45 per cent and grain production will amount to 1 ton per capita. At the same time the average earnings of industrial and office workers in the Byelorussian SSR will increase by 22 per cent, and those of collective farmers by 32 per cent. In the past 12 years over a million apartments have been built in the Republic, housing 9.5 million people. State allocations for free all-grade education, free medical Care, social welfare and so on have been growing every year.\n91.\tThe new Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR, adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic on 14 April following a Republic-wide discussion, reflects the important social and economic changes that have taken place in the Byelorussian SSR during the years of Soviet rule. Favourable conditions have been created, and their scope is increasing, for continuous improvement of the people's well-being and full enjoyment of the entire range of rights and freedoms of the Soviet people. Ever widening and more active participation by the working people in the management of State and social affairs is the central direction of the political development of our country.\n92.\tThe delegation of the Byelorussian SSR, which is a supporter of and a participant in the statutary activities of the United Nations, wishes to stress the importance of effective administrative and budgetary activity in the Organization. In our opinion, when considering this problem at all levels and in all bodies, one should proceed from the basis of the inadmissibility of excessive expenditure and the need for rational and economical use of the allocated resources, first and foremost in the interest of achieving the major objectives of the Organization as defined in the Charter\u2014that is, the promotion of lasting peace and the consolidation of international detente, which must have specific material content.\n93.\tIt is also known, however, that the efforts made in recent years to improve the programme planning and budgetary system of the United Nations have not yet reached the goals set and that the internal reserves and resources released as a result of the completion, reduction, reorganization, cancellation or elimination of overlapping in United Nations programmes, projects or activities, or as a result of any other changes in them, are being misused and are not being turned into savings, which in turn results in unreasonably high rates of increase in the Organization's expenditure. Insufficient attention is being paid to raising the labour efficiency of the staff, to improving the administrative methods of the United Nations Secretariat and even to implementing decisions already adopted. All this naturally gives rise to legitimate concern among the States Members of the United Nations and suggests the need for constructive measures to eliminate the above- mentioned and other deficiencies in the work of the United Nations Secretariat.\n94.\tThe United Nations, whose membership totals 150 States:, plays an ever more positive role in international affairs, in the consideration of the most important issues in die world and the key problems of international relations. Under conditions of international detente, the United Nations is conducting its activities in a more business-like atmosphere and with a higher degree of constructiveness and consistency. The contribution of each State to the strict observance and implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Charter is a real guarantee of the resolution of existing international problems and the opening up of new prospects for fruitful and mutually beneficial co-operation among countries. The role of the United Nations is to be enhanced not through the revision of the Charter but rather through its consistent observance. Together with the fraternal States of the socialist community, the Byelorussian SSR attaches paramount importance to the task of safeguarding peace and eliminating the danger of war, and will actively contribute to the progress of United Nations activities in this field. By consistently pursuing and advocating this policy we are putting into practice one of the main slogans of the October Revolutions behest of the great Lenin: \\\"Peace to the peoples\\\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff27.\tMr. President, it is my great privilege to join the speakers who have preceded me in expressing to you on behalf of the Government of Ghana warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of this thirty-third session of the United Nations- General Assembly. We are delighted that you bring to this great responsibility the breadth of experience and wisdom that have been associated with your name as the Foreign Minister of Colombia. We are certain that your sterling personal qualities, which have been internationally recognized, will enable you to guide the deliberations of this session and secure their fruitful and successful conclusion. I pledge the support and cooperation of the Ghana delegation in the difficult tasks which you have assumed.\n28.\tMay I seize this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, Deputy Federal Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Yugoslavia, for the devoted and excellent manner in which he served the international community in the past year. The guidance which Mr. Mojsov gave to our Organization during the past year's unusually heavy schedule-a schedule including two important special sessions on the intractable questions of Namibia and disarmament-will long be remembered and appreciated. His conduct of the affairs of the General\nAssembly during the past year fulfilled our highest expectations.\n29.\tI should like to place on record the appreciation of my delegation of the competence and skill of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his able lieutenants and staff. We all owe those devoted international civil servants a debt of gratitude which can be paid only through sincere and strenuous efforts on our part to promote the cause of peace and justice.\n30.\tGhana wishes particularly to extend a warm and fraternal welcome to Solomon Islands as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of this Organization. The membership of Solomon Islands provides further proof that colonial rule, however benign and well-meaning, cannot be regarded as an adequate substitute for independence. The people of Ghana join their brothers and sisters of Solomon Islands in celebrating the admission of that state to this august body and pledge all the support and assistance we are capable of in resolving the problems which usually confront a developing country.\n31.. As we review the activities of this Organization over the past 32 years we are struck by the enormous contradictions and disparities which still exist between our professions of dedication to peace, justice and prosperity for all peoples on the one hand and our actions in order to achieve those noble aims on the other. Our objective of creating a world in which we share responsibility for each other's welfare continues to be frustrated by the lingering problems of colonialism and racism, by an escalating arms race, and by the ever-growing economic gap between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\".\n32.\tDecolonization is admittedly in its final stage, but this stage is also the most critical. In southern Africa the problem is compounded by intransigent minority regimes that have instituted racism as a policy in an effort to safeguard their economic interests by the perpetual domination of majorities.\n33.\tIn Zimbabwe the prospects for a negotiated settlement, which had been raised by the Anglo-American proposals, have foundered on the duplicity and unreasonableness of Ian Smith and members of his regime. Ghana was willing to give these proposals a chance, even though it had good reason to believe that when the negotiations reached a critical stage Ian Smith would prevaricate in his characteristic fashion and thereby make it inevitable for human lives and property, mostly African, to be destroyed. True to form, he announced his so-called internal settlement agreement on 3 March this year, with a programme for return to a spurious majority rule on 31 December 1978-a window-dressing exercise that leaves wholly intact the entire infrastructure and machinery of racist rule, which, of course, continued with little change: It is not surprising that that agreement failed to gain the concurrence of the Patriotic Front, a force to be reckoned with and one representing far more truly the legitimate aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe; and without that\nconcurrence it was doomed to failure. Ghana condemned it in no uncertain terms.\n34.\tThe truth is that the aim of Ian Smith in concluding this agreement was to play black Africans against each other in order to retain supremacy in political, social and economic affairs for the racist white minority population of the Territory during the next decade. There was, of course, no intention of giving the Africans any relief from the degradations of economic and political deprivation, or those of racial inequality.\n35.\tIt has been the firmly-held view of Ghana that if all members of the international community had really felt so enamoured of universal human rights as was often claimed, Ian Smith's regime would not have survived the past 13 years. It has survived and wreaked extreme havoc upon the lives of the Africans of Zimbabwe because it has received external support and assistance from Members of our very Organization. The Government of Ghana has had occasion in the past to express its concern and displeasure over breaches by some British firms of the United Nations mandatory sanctions imposed on Rhodesia. Once again British firms have, according to world-wide press reports admitted responsibility for deliberate assistance to the regime of Rhodesia, which is, by common consent, not only illegal, but also blatantly racist and brutally oppressive. Ghana again deplores this flagrant connivance and hopes that the United Kingdom Government will ensure that no British firm ever again supports racism and the repression of African peoples through such acts as British Petroleum and the Shell companies have been accused of.\n36.\tIt is regrettable that as we debate this question of Zimbabwe Mr. Ian Smith is in the United States. The Government of Ghana hopes that his visit will not lead to a breach of the sanctions imposed by the Security Council. Ghana is of the view that this is not the time to relax the pressure on the Ian Smith regime. It would indeed be tragic if any permanent member of the Security Council seemed to be publicly underwriting South Africa's blatant breaches of the Rhodesian sanctions in order to assist the continued oppression of Zimbabweans by the racist forces of Ian Smith's regime.\n37.\tGhana will remain opposed to the spurious internal settlement agreement. Accordingly, we shall continue to support sanctions and the armed struggle by the people of Zimbabwe, led by the Patriotic Front, as the only credible alternative measures for early attainment of majority rule.\n38.\tThe regime in Namibia is an even greater evil. It presents in an even worse form the worst features of the Rhodesian rebel regime. It is an alien aggressor in illegal occupation of an international territory properly under the care of the United Nations.\n39.\tSouth Africa must be made to withdraw from Namibia totally. In our view it is a great pity that the Security Council was for so long unable or unwilling to muster enough force to throw the racist regime out of the Territory and that it repeatedly allowed itself to be tricked into inaction by promises, which always proved false, that the apartheid regime was about to mend its ways, and by hopes, which were frequently disappointed, that it would prove amenable to reason and negotiation.\n40.\tToday we find ourselves dealing with yet another of those notorious dodges by which the apartheid regime has for years successfully eluded the slow pursuit of our Organization. The Security Council has stayed its hand for 15 months in the hope, which is again proving forlorn, that the peaceful and orderly withdrawal of South Africa can be achieved by negotiations alone.\n41.\tThroughout these negotiations, the apartheid regime has patently sought to retain the power to influence improperly the course of events in Namibia. It started by insisting on imposing its own puppets by means of the Turnhalle scheme. Then it insisted on retaining its foothold in Walvis Bay; then on retaining within the Territory throughout the electoral exercise a sizeable military force, together with an armed and notoriously brutal police force maintained at full strength. It pretended to negotiate for a peaceful and orderly withdrawal as long as it saw the prospect of operating those levers of manipulation without any effective check. Now it sees that effective checks are meant to be applied, that the police and military contingents of the United Nations are meant to be deployed in more than mere token strength, and so it reverts once again to its former intransigence, and resorts to a new variation of the Turnhalle farce: to elections, outside United Nations control, from which virtually all are excluded except the marionettes of Turnhalle. The apartheid regime has yet again pulled off one of its time-buying stunts. We are now entitled to demand that this stunt should be its last.\n42.\tIn its resolution 435 (1978) of 29 September 1978 the Security Council approved the Secretary-General's plan3 for the implementation of the proposals for free and fair elections in Namibia, and the withdrawal of South Africa from the illegally occupied Territory. In the same resolution, the Security Council called upon South Africa forthwith to co-operate with the Secretary-General in the implementation of his plan of action. If by 23 October South Africa still rejects the plan or refuses to co-operate, then there would be no justification, we maintain, for delaying any further the action which is long overdue under Chapter VII of the Charter. The Government of Ghana demands that in that case oil sanctions and, indeed, the full range of sanctions under Chapter VII, be applied against apartheid, until they undermine the basis of its resistance. We call for nothing less, for the simple reason that it is high time.\n43.\tThe Pretoria regime should be made to see very clearly that it would be much better, from the point of view of its own interests, if the Secretary-General's plan were put into operation. In this connexion I am happy to announce my Government's willingness to offer a contingent of military and police forces for the proposed peace-keeping operations in Namibia.\n44.\tWalvis Bay is inextricably linked by geographical, economic, cultural and ethnic bonds with the rest of Namibian territory. It would be ludicrous to expect that an independent Namibia would be willing to have its littoral and its coastal waters threatened by such a hostile military presence as that of South Africa. Its external trade, as well\n\nas its fishing industries, would be under the menace and control of a hostile and racist neighbour. Ghana will therefore fully support the South West Africa People's Organization SWAPO in its bid to ensure that Walvis Bay remains an integral part of an independent Namibia.\n45. In this regard we welcome Security Council resolution 432(1978) of 27 July 1978. We propose that this Organization should tolerate no move by the apartheid regime to make that decision yet another excuse for reneging on its acceptance of the proposals negotiated with SWAPO and the five Western Powers  for effecting its long overdue withdrawal from the Territory. And we further urge that the crucial decisions taken at the recent ninth special session of the General Assembly on Namibia [see resolution S-9/2J should guide the final negotiations for Namibia's independence. In this exercise, it would be vital to ensure that the programme for that independence will be one that has the unqualified support of SWAPO, not one dictated by South Africa.\n46- Of all the problems posed by colonialism, imperialism and neo-colonialism in Africa, none is more pernicious and dangerous than apartheid, the official policy of South Africa. Decades of international condemnation of this policy have not succeeded in persuading the racists of South Africa of the wisdom of dismantling it. The resolutions and exhortations of both the Security Council and this General Assembly have not succeeded in convincing South Africa that only by upholding human rights and human dignity can all of us hope to create the conditions in which a peaceful and harmonious world community can thrive. South Africa even exported this dangerous apartheid policy from its own territory to Namibia and Zimbabwe in a vain attempt to preserve the last remaining bastion of white supremacy and privilege.\n47.\tIt is encouraging that after the persistent frustrations of the past decades the Security Council and this entire Organization have begun to see apartheid as not only a matter of concern to black Africa, but as something closely linked to the peace and security of the whole world. My Government welcomes the mandatory arms embargo the Security Council imposed last year on South Africa in its resolution 418 (1977), though it has come rather late. But South Africa, with the active assistance of countries operating under the predominant principle of the profit motive, has been granted licences, which are still operative, to produce or assemble locally most of its arms and war equipment. That Security Council resolution did not go far enough Ghana accepted it only as a first step. We have therefore called upon the Security Council to take another positive step by imposing a total oil embargo against that intransigent regime and to maintain that embargo until it abandons the policy of apartheid or until majority rule is attained in South Africa. Such a move would reflect the clearly expressed feelings of the vast majority of this Assembly, since all of us have at one time or another declared ourselves firmly opposed to the policies of apartheid Here, then, is the opportunity for us all to demonstrate our sincerity.\n48.\tGhana will defend the sovereign right of any country in Africa, or anywhere else for that matter, to resort to any\nmeasures, including legitimate invitations to friendly foreign countries, in order to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity against external attack in accordance with Article 52 of the Charter. The fact remains, however, that recourse to foreign military assistance may often carry with it potential dangers to the sovereignty and peace not only of the recipient country but also of its neighbours.\n49.\tRecent interventions in Africa appear to have been in the right direction where they contributed to reinforcing the cardinal principle of both this Organization and the Organization of African Unity [OAU] concerning the inviolability of territorial boundaries assumed at independence. Care should, however, be taken lest Africa thereby becomes a new fertile ground for the cold-war rivalries of the 1950s and early 1960s.\n50.\tIn the wake of the very bold steps taken last year, one may have expected that a significant improvement would by now be in view in the Middle East situation. Unfortunately, while some progress has been made, this has not been so, and the situation has been further complicated by the tragic conflict in Lebanon. Even without the present Lebanese crisis, the explosive and dangerous situation in the Middle East would require all the skill of which this Organization is capable, with a view to finding a just and lasting solution. It is, however, encouraging that after 30 years of intermittent warfare and constant hostility, some signs are becoming manifest of the real peace and security which the people of the region need.\n51.\tTo keep these glimmers of hope alive, Ghana urges that a final solution be sought in the provisions of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which have been invoked in several subsequent resolutions of both the Security Council and the General Assembly. The recognition of the right of all the States at present in the area to peace and security within recognized boundaries is a vital principle from which it would be unwise to deviate. For the same reasons, we still hold the firm conviction that the Palestinians should be granted the right to self-determination including the option to establish a viable, independent State. In our view, until all these conditions are met, a permanent peace in the Middle East will continue to be an illusion.\n52. May I at this point express the appreciation of the Government and people of Ghana for the indefatigable efforts made by President Carter of the United States to help in the search for a solution to the Middle East problem. If the peace initiatives and the meetings at Camp David have not produced a dramatic and final result, one would hope that the agreement reached has at least contributed to a better understanding of the fears and concerns of some of the contestants and laid a foundation for more productive future negotiations for a settlement.\n53. My delegation had expected that at this year's General Assembly session, we would be able to express our relief at seeing some hopes of a solution to the Cyprus crisis. Instead, we find ourselves in the position of having to express once again our deep regret that practically no progress has been made on the Cyprus problem since the thirty-second session of the General Assembly. The contestants in the dispute still insist on maintaining the\npositions which have produced the stalemate responsible for the continued occupation of Cyprus \u2014 an independent, sovereign and non-aligned country -- by foreign forces, with terrible consequences for the Cypriot people.\n54.\tIn the view of my delegation, a solution to the Cyprus problem must include the withdrawal of all foreign troops from that island. That might be coupled with an undertaking by all States to respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus. That is the position of both the non-aligned countries and of this Organization. We should be able to enforce it. In the meantime we shall continue to urge all those directly involved to do all they can to remove the causes of tension in the area in order to enable the people of Cyprus to live in peace and harmony in a united country.\n55.\tOur annual review of the international situation provides an opportunity to renew our faith in the principles and purposes spelled out in the United Nations Charter and to commit ourselves anew to working for the attainment of a world in which mankind's ultimate objective of peace and security can be achieved. Disarmament has always been one of the corner-stones of Ghana's foreign policy. In a world where poverty is so pervasive that over 450 million human beings are going virtually without food every day, the arms race alone consumes the incredible amount of $450 billion each year, that is, about $1.25 billion each day. That military expenditure is equivalent to about two fifths of the combined gross domestic product of all third-world countries and twice the size of the combined gross domestic product of all countries in Africa. In contrast to this huge sum of money, the 24-member Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development was able to grant only a meagre $14 billion as official development assistance.\n56.\tIt is very sad to note that for every dollar spent on development, we also spend more than $36 to destroy that very development and the people who are expected to benefit there from.\n57.. These huge expenditures, incurred for the sole purpose of destroying property and .human lives, have brought neither the purveyors nor the buyers any nearer to the peace and security they seek; but this has not yet been recognized as the very reason for abandoning such expenditures. Some of the more powerful Members of this Organization, including the founders, have become so dependent upon exports of arms for balancing their external payments that they seem incapable of discouraging, or refraining from fomenting, disputes and armed conflicts among lesser contestants, particularly in the developing world There are always those who proffer or rush in arms at the least sign of trouble.\n58. Among themselves, those Powers continue the arms race in order to maintain a balance of fear. Caught up in the defence of rival political, economic and social systems, each entertains a dread of domination by the other, and this obsessive fear has become the propelling force for the acquisition of more sophisticated and more devastating means of destroying each other and possibly everything else in the process. This exercise is now engulfing the less powerful countries, which have become targets in a scramble for client-States. It is vital that suspicions and\nunnecessary competition and rivalry, especially in the nuclear field, should stop if we are to have the peace and security in which harmony and human development can survive.\n59.\tIt is in these disturbing circumstances that my delegation has noted with interest reports that there is the possibility of reaching an agreement in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks by the end of this year. The recent tenth special session devoted to disarmament, did not provide a major break-through for general and complete disarmament. However, the Declaration and Programme of Action and the machinery for negotiating disarmament were in themselves significant achievements for the world body. That special session, in our view, also served as a sort of preparatory session for the proposed world conference on disarmament. Another agreement at the Talks would be a good omen for that conference. My delegation, therefore, would urge the negotiators to do their best to come to an early agreement.\n60.\tIf the international political situation does not give us any cause for joy, the international economic situation is even more dismal.\n61.\tAfter very difficult negotiations, at its seventh special session the General Assembly produced guidelines [resolution 3362 (S- VII)/ for implementing the ideas contained in the Declaration and Programme of Action which had been adopted at the sixth special session in May 1974 on the New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VIJ and 3202(S-VI)]. That was in September 1975. Three years have since gone by without any important advance in the exercise of restructuring the world economy. Instead, there has been a steady increase in the concentration of economic power in the hands of the developed countries, while hunger and poverty threaten to become a permanent condition in the developing countries. The demand of the developing world for a full and equal partnership in world economic activity has continued to be frustrated by a glaring lack of political will on the part of many developed countries.\n62.\tMy delegation views with profound dismay the increasing number of protectionist measures taken by the developed countries in an attempt to nullify the steady progress of developing countries in a few manufacturing industries. Those measures will only succeed in aggravating our balance-of-payments problems. It is inevitable that developing countries will be producing manufactured goods in increasing quantities as time goes on. It would therefore be an act of greater realism for the developed countries to accept that eventuality and assist instead of fight us. World stability and security demand that we should all co-operate to improve our relationships and prevent unnecessary hardships for each other.\n63.\tMy delegation must also express its deep disappointment at the lack of progress on the multilateral trade negotiations and on the establishment of the common fund to finance the Integrated Programme for Commodities.5 My delegation is convinced that the principles underlying\nthe Integrated Programme for Commodities provide\\\" the only credible basis on which to correct the chronic and growing imbalances that exist between prices of raw materials and those of industrial products. It therefore remains our fervent hope that each of us will reconsider its respective position and begin to work more seriously, so that the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, also known as the Committee of the Whole, may be able to resume its work of advancing the New International Economic Order and provide a solid basis for the strategy for the third United Nations development decade.\n64.\tA vital area of concern to Ghana is the present efforts of the international community to restructure the legal -regime governing the uses of the oceans. The principles and rules of law which governed the oceans in the last century must be reviewed to meet the new challenges of our time occasioned by new problems arising from the technological and economic development over the last decade.\n65.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is undoubtedly one of the most important events of our time. Admittedly it has so far made very slow progress, but that is not unexpected having regard to the complexity of the issues involved and the varied, conflicting nature of the interests of all States represented at the Conference.\n66.\tThe seemingly slow progress and protracted negotiations should not, however, mean that the importance of the Conference to the international community is discounted. The significance of the Conference as a means of redressing the economic imbalance between developed and developing countries by ensuring equitable distribution and management of the resources of the seas cannot be overemphasized.\n67.\tFor those reasons, we have no doubt whatsoever that the international community stands to lose a great deal if our efforts in fashioning a new code of conduct for the seas are frustrated by certain nations. Indeed, we are very much concerned at the move towards unilateral legislation relating to the exploitation of the resources of the deep sea-bed being enacted or contemplated in several industrialized countries. It is unfortunate that those measures should be contemplated when the Conference has advanced considerably. We appeal to all nations to desist from such action, in the interest of peace and tranquillity. The concept of common heritage cannot be meaningful if areas beyond national jurisdiction are subjected to the unilateral action of States. It is our considered opinion that the appropriation of the common heritage fundamentally Undermines the spirit of General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV), to the principles of which all States have subscribed without reservation.\n68.\tWe must all resolve now to desist from unilateral appropriation of the resources of the common heritage. Such measures would prejudice negotiations and frustrate our quest for peace. Indeed the consequences would be far-reaching. It is our fervent hope that the appeal of the Group of 77 to developed countries to exercise restraint will be heeded.\n69.\tWe cannot expect all the problems that confront this Organization and the international community to be\nresolved at this session or the next. It should be possible, however, to eradicate without further delay and by all means at our disposal all the remaining pockets of colonialism and, racism, all the principal traces of that reprehensible desire to keep a section of \\\"bur society in a permanently inferior position, in defiance of the concept of the brotherhood of man to which we all profess commitment. Indeed, those are not the only pressing tasks before us. Disarmament-the need to eliminate our penchant for killing each other\u2014continues to elude our efforts; and the urge to deny equitable distribution of the enormous wealth of this world presents another set of intractable problems. These, and others of the same kind, are difficult assignments requiring great patience and persistent effort. But if all goes well, and if we all apply ourselves well enough to the task, this session may turn out to be the last in which major problems of racism are dealt with. Let us ensure that that is so, and we shall have taken a significant stride forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n3.\tMr. President, I wish to congratulate you on your election as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. The confidence this Assembly has in you is indeed well placed and I wish you well in the discharge of the responsibilities of your high office.\n4.\tMy delegation would also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts in the service of the United Nations and for the valuable personal contribution he continues to make in the advancement of its objectives.\n5.\tThis time last year the Prime Minister of Samoa addressed this body,1 upon the accession of Samoa to membership in the United Nations, on the theme of the search by man for a harmonious relationship with his environment and his fellow men. He described how the people of the South Pacific have a harmonious relationship with the region and with each other, and how we seek the same with the rest of the world. We are already acutely aware of the problems that confront us in this forum and the fact that often they seem insoluble.\n6.\tThus far, we have participated in quite a limited way but we have observed closely. It is paradoxical and sometimes disturbing to observe that, while the complex machinery of this Organization of world hope churns on with all its splendour and high-sounding rhetoric, so-many problems remain unsolved, and in some cases we seem actually to be moving backwards. Rhetoric is no substitute for action and empty rhetorical exchanges can have no real meaning for those whose problems we are here to solve. We do not wish to seem over-critical and we are well aware of past achievements of the United Nations and hold them in high admiration. We do, however, want to support the Secretary-General's suggestion in his report on the work of the Organization [A/33/1] that a streamlining of procedures, a severe pruning of the copious prose employed here and a move towards action on issues are essential.\n7.\tWe, the small countries of the Pacific region, are growing in number in this forum. We have welcomed Solomon Islands into the world body and note the accession to independence of Tuvalu just a few days ago. Next year the Gilbert Islands also will be an independent State. Although Pacific island peoples are made up of different races scattered over a vast ocean, we have a very special kinship based on the similarities in our histories, the long years of isolation from other parts of the world and, of course, our shared experience during the colonial period.\n8.\tWe feel deeply about the welfare of all the members of our group. That is why I want to express here my country's deep concern at the fact that some of our neighbours who wish to gain independence have not yet been able to do so. In some cases their wish for independence and their right to aspire to it have not even been acknowledged by the\ncolonial Powers concerned. We would wish to see an end to this situation as soon as possible.\n9.\tThe Pacific peoples who have achieved independence have for the most part followed peaceful paths to that goal. This had been due to a combination of patience and forbearance on the part of the peoples concerned and some measure of goodwill on the part of the colonial Powers involved. We would not wish to see any of our neighbours remain in a situation that might strain their patience beyond endurance.\n10.\tOn the Middle East question, we applaud the initiative and courage shown at the Camp David meetings. We hope that other countries in the area will join in renewed efforts for peace and that all parties affected will eventually be included in a comprehensive peace agreement. Only if this happens can we be sure of firm and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n11.\tThe Palestinians must have a secure homeland and must eventually determine their own future, but Israel, too, must be able to feel secure and free from attack if there is to be peace and stability in the area. The proposal for peace between the major protagonists should be allowed to pave the way for wider accord. If a settlement can be achieved in the area the countries involved will have made a great\n' contribution to the welfare of mankind, for if this seemingly endless conflict can be ended, then we can hope for resolution of the many others for which we had almost lost hope of speedy and safe conclusions.\n12.\tOn Namibia, my delegation sincerely hopes that the intransigence of South Africa will not frustrate the progress achieved in recent months through constructive discussion and conciliation; and that following free and fair elections we will soon welcome Namibia into this Organization.\n13.\tWe reaffirm our condemnation of the continuation of minority rule, which has given rise to wide-scale violence and considerable human suffering in Zimbabwe. We are encouraged by the efforts of those countries which are playing a direct part in trying to involve all parties in a negotiated settlement. It is the duty of Member nations to contribute in whatever way they can to create a climate that is conducive to the resolution of this problem and to refrain from any activities that may work to the detriment of an early settlement.\n14.\tWhen one thinks of the trouble-spots and areas of tension around the globe and the violence and suffering both actual and potential involved therein, one cannot help but ponder with sadness the ready availability and the rapid build-up of arms and instruments of destruction in general. As a country with no defence forces at all, Samoa deplores the misguided priorities which put the purchase, development and production of arms before the welfare of people. It is a fact that the world has spent $ 1.4 trillion on arms over the last five years and it is also a fact that there are more than 650 million people without enough to eat, let alone having places of security for themselves and their families. We must reverse these trends.\n15.\tIn these circumstances it is beyond our comprehension how nations can proudly claim to have produced new\nweapons of destruction to add to the world's arsenal. We cannot even say that the methods of warfare have become more humane or that the killing is swifter and less painful when we know that chemicals and other agents that cause immense pain and severe suffering have been developed for use in warfare. The limiting of certain types of means of destruction is not, however, an adequate answer. We must move towards complete disarmament.\n16.\tEarly agreement must be reached to ban nuclear testing and to cease the creation of more nuclear weapons. The Pacific has been the scene of a great deal of nuclear testing. Only recently the Bikini island people had to be once again removed from their homes because of the dangers of radiation there. Closer to home for us, the islands north of Tahiti have for some years been the site of a series of nuclear tests to which an end is not yet in sight. We in the area, had we been consulted, would have wished for the Pacific to stay a nuclear-free area. Now that our region has been exposed to nuclear pollution we can only hope that the cessation of testing and time will restore our environment to something like its original purity.\n17.\tIn the Pacific there has been a very special relationship between the people and the environment, which is why any damage to our surroundings or depletion of its resources is felt very personally by our people. We are still living in close contact and in harmony with the land and the sea, and they are for the most part unspoiled by man-made intrusions. The sea in particular has been a very sacred source of inspiration and a supplier of sustenance for us. In some cases it is virtually the only resource available to the people. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, then, is of great importance to us and we have taken part in it whenever possible. Progress has been slow, but what has been achieved is perhaps remarkable when we consider the diversity of situations and viewpoints involved. Renewed determination to resolve remaining problems is essential if we hope to see a treaty concluded by the end of this decade. As we see it, the conclusion of a convention on the law of the sea would ensure that at least in one area the heritage of mankind would be treated with respect and shared fairly among the nations  of the earth. As it is, our world is already plagued with enormous inequalities.\n18.\tIt is with a sense of despair that we see the gap between the developed and the developing world continue to widen. There have been over the past decade enormous amounts of time, words and literature devoted to searching for means to narrow this gap. Unfortunately, words have not been matched with action in most instances. Probably one of the starkest instances of this is the complete failure of virtually all developed countries, and particularly the largest developed countries, even to approach the aid-transfer target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product agreed to in this forum in 1970. In real terms, aid resource-transfers from rich to poor countries are less now than in the early 1960s. The developed world's failure to meet the agreed target and the reduction in aid transfers in real terms call in question the sincerity of its commitment to the developing world.\n19.\tOver recent months there has been a very disturbing rise of protectionism on the part of many developed countries, which has already had very adverse effects on\nsome third-world countries. Protectionism is both selfish and negative and reduces the opportunities of developing countries to help themselves. With the interdependence of all countries, surely increased trade must assist developed and developing countries alike. We therefore consider that the present wave of increased protectionism is, to say the least, extremely short-sighted on the part of the developed countries practising it, with quite tragic results for their poorer developing neighbours.\n20.\tMuch rhetoric has been devoted to the new world economic order but very little action has occurred in the implementation of any part of the package of reforms. Samoa is committed to the need for the total package of reforms and structural changes which constitute the proposals of the developing countries on the new economic order, but, given the realities of the attitudes of the developed countries at the present time, it may be most practical to isolate several of the highest priority areas in which results are achievable within a short-term period and concentrate on their early attainment. Priority areas would seem to be: first, encouraging the developed world to give effect to the commitment of aid transfers of 1 per cent of gross national product; secondly, stemming the growing tide of protectionism and achieving some positive steps towards trade liberalization; thirdly, commodity arrangements, including the initiation of a common fund for financing buffer stocks of various internationally traded commodities of importance to the developing countries; and, fourthly, reform of international financial institutions to make them more responsive to the realities of the priority financial requirements of developing countries.\n21.\tGiven political will and sincerity on the part of the developed world, great progress could be made in each of those four areas in the next 12 months. Certainly, with a collective defence budget of $1.4 trillion, even a relatively modest reduction would provide more than adequate financing for development. Having achieved progress in those areas, we could move on to the next stage of priority reforms\n22.\tIt is gratifying to note that the international community is starting to focus more attention on the real problems peculiar to smaller developing economies. It is essential for international organizations to realize that such economies suffer from a variety of constraints which are unique to them. Particular problems include the fact of geographic isolation, small domestic markets, very limited natural resources and dependence on a few sources of foreign earnings which are often unreliable and volatile. The economies of small developing countries therefore tend to be extremely fragile and very sensitive to outside events and to changes in the world economic situation. We suggest that special development techniques are required for those countries and in dealing with them it is necessary for international organizations to display sensitivity and flexibility. In this respect the continued use of per capita lending as an important leading criterion is felt to be unrealistic and inequitable as applied to smaller developing countries. Regrettably, however, the majority of international financial institutions continue directly or indirectly to use that criterion, to the detriment of the smaller developing countries.\n23.\tWe note with disappointment that the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 on the new international economic order cannot proceed with its work and that a state of stalemate exists. We trust this development does not reflect an unwillingness on the part of the developed countries to contemplate any challenge to the continuation of their comfortable positions of economic power under the existing economic order. Growing global interdependence dictates that the future economic welfare of the developed countries will depend increasingly on a constructive and equitable relationship-in fact, a partnership-with the developing countries.\n24.\tThe attainment of a new economic order is essential if the dignity of man is to be a meaningful concept. It is surely a fundamental right of man to have food, shelter and the opportunity to work and to receive adequate compensation, as well as to participate in the processes of government and to live in peace and security.\n25.\tSamoa strongly holds that economic, social and political rights are inseparable human entitlements and advocates urgent measures to redress the denial of these human rights wherever it may occur. Enlightened policies of economic co-operation at the international level would have direct relevance to the economic and social emancipation of communities in the developing countries. Of equal concern is the denial to people of their political rights and personal freedoms. Discrimination in whatever form is abhorrent to the spirit of the United Nations and contrary to its Charter.\n26.\tThe Samoan delegation looks forward to the development of machinery whereby the United Nations could play an effective part in the promotion and protection of human rights. For all its imperfections the United Nations is surely the hope of the world. It is up to each of us to help make this Organization more effective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff174.\tFirst of all I would ask you, Sir, to transmit to the President of this Assembly my congratulations on his election. The scope of his career as an historian, an economist, a diplomat and a statesman is a precious asset to our work. His presidency also illustrates the genius and spirit of a continent with which many Europeans seek ever closer ties and to which, rightly, we are never indifferent.\n175.\tThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany Mr. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, spoke from this rostrum on 26 September in a particularly explicit speech on behalf of the countries of the European Community on the principal subjects of concern in foreign policy [see 8th meeting, paras. 135-200]. That makes it unnecessary for me to raise today several problems\u2014even though I am aware of their importance\u2014such as Rhodesia, apartheid and the situation in the Horn of Africa.\n176.\tEach year we read with interest to the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization [AI33/1]. This year we were particularly impressed by the growing diversity of the tasks of the Organization, the magnitude of its responsibilities and its achievements in so many fields, such as human rights, disarmament, North- South relations and peace-keeping. Those are the first four subjects which I shall deal with.\n177.\tFirst, however, I should like to welcome Solomon Islands as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of the Organization. On this occasion I extend my Government's cordial wishes for its prosperity.\n178.\tThe United Nations has long been disparaged\u2014and often still is\u2014for its powerlessness to tackle certain conflicts, to prevent them or to resolve them, and to bestir its Secretariat, which has been described as enormous, and for its tendency to proliferate resolutions which may not be applied. However, I note with pleasure that during the past few years, and particularly during last year, the balance- sheet of the Organization has clearly been on the positive side and is worthy of the appreciation of public opinion.\n179.\tWho can fail to be struck by the burgeoning of ideas and activities in thi3 Organization? Who can forget that this is the only place on earth where all countries of the world meet daily, where cordial relations are maintained by the permanent missions, regardless of the differences between Governments, thus creating a relaxed approach? The practice of consensus is developing slowly, a sign that the spirit of international co-operation prevails. We are pleased to note we have all understood that the numerical law of the majority vote cannot bring about a solution of conflicts if all the interested parties do not participate in the agreement reached and that resolutions adopted will have\nno effect if they do not reflect a general conviction. \n180.\tThis favourable evolution must not prevent us from ensuring that we maintain a constant evaluation of the results of the activities and actions of the Organization, as well as a more effective co-ordination between various bodies, and that we pursue budgetary management according to the financial possibilities of the Member States.\n181.\tThe thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which coincides with the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, urges us to consider the scope of the work of standard-jetting accomplished by the United Nations in the Held of the protection of human beings.\n182.\tAn exhaustive list of adopted conventions, declarations and resolutions would cover pages, but none of us forgets the value for mankind of the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights [see resolution 2200 A (XXI)], as well as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [see resolution 2106 A (XX)].\n183.\tBut thought, research and codification must not stop. It is imperative that the world community should become ever more aware of the value and dignity of each human being, ensuring him wider protection.\n184.\tFor myself, I believe that our activities can be pushed ahead in two directions. First, there is the monitoring of the application of human rights.\n185.\tThe subject of human rights is becoming more and more a principal concern of world public opinion. Yet there is a prevailing impression, for example, that torture is scarcely on the wane in the world. Terrorism is rampant, and the last words of His Holiness Pope John Paul I were to condemn it. Often, rights are completely flouted by Governments, none of which would dare publicly to question the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n186.\tWhen trying to define means for international monitoring, our Organization always meets with strong opposition where concern, albeit legitimate, for national sovereignty is too easily invoked.\n187.\tThe existing possibilities for monitoring could be used better and to a greater extent. The recent mission of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Situation of Human Rights in Chile, which was able to exercise its mandate in that country, is a first encouraging example of such use.\n188.\tThe machinery of the Commission on Human Rights should be able to take care of all cases of serious and persistent violations of human rights that are flaunted in the public eye.\n189.\tOne could say that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the body of conventions already concluded or those being negotiated are such as to form an essential element in the legal order of world society. In the long run, the machinery for international monitoring of human rights should take the form of genuine legal institutions offering all guarantees of impartiality and objectivity. No doubt this is a distant goal, but I believe we should not lose sight of it.\n190.\tA second part of our efforts should concern itself with relations between rights.\n191.\tThe existence of two Covenants, one relating to civil and political rights, and the other to economic and social rights, cannot prejudice the principles of the universality and the indivisibility of rights.\n192.\tHowever, it is clear that, while civil and political rights are of immediate concern, the progressive nature of the implementation of economic, social and cultural rights cannot be gainsaid.\n193.\tMoreover, for certain rights Government action is required and the nature of that action will depend on the economic and social situation; while other rights, such as the right not to be tortured, are identified with the protection of the human being and are independent of the type of society in which they are exercised.\n194.\tLet us focus our efforts, in any case, on the maximum application of human rights.\n195.\tIn concluding this first part of my statement, I should like to express regret that the World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, which was held this summer in Geneva, did not meet with the success that was anticipated. Some countries, including Belgium, were forced to withdraw from the work of the Conference and dissociate themselves from the final texts of the Conference.\n196.\tThose texts contained paragraphs similar to those of resolution 3379 (XXX). Belgium has always been vigorously opposed to that resolution, which equates Zionism with a form of racism and racial discrimination. We are determined to continue not to associate ourselves with documents which explicitly or implicitly refer to it, whatever their value may be.\n197.\tI wish to stress here that Belgium continues vigorously to support the original goals of the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination\u2014goals that are an essential element of United Nations action, in the promotion of human rights.\ni98, In the economic Held also we have seen development in the activities of the United Nations during the last few years.\n199% It was here that the new international economic order was launched It was here that the bases for a new balance in economic relations between developing and developed countries slowly began to be established. It is here that the Group of 77 -now 113 nations - still presided over by prominent personalities -this year by Mr. Mahmoud Mestiri, with whom we have close ties of friendship- gives tile political impetus to the peaceful economic revolution that we are experiencing.\n200, For Belgium, traditionally open to the world, international economic co-operation is of primary importance. We have always participated, with our partners in the European Community, in the North  South dialogue in a constructive spirit, and in particular in the activities of what is known as the Committee of the Whole, or the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/114, which was created last year with a view to the special session of the Assembly to be held in 1980 and to be devoted to international economic co-operation,\n201. As was said, on behalf of the States members of the European Community, by my colleague, Mr. Genscher, we regret that the Committee of the Whole was unable to outcome the difficulties of interpreting its role and of defining its methods of work. Thus, it was unable to complete its task, I hope that this Assembly will be able to define the conditions for a proper functioning of the Committee for the future. In tins respect, we feel that two remarks are useful.\n202. There is no question of denying the Committee of the Whole its right to be concerned with important questions being negotiated in other bodies. However, one  must avoid duplication or the substitution of various competent international bodies. Indeed, it is preferable to let the work continue in organizations which have the responsibility, the experience and the infrastructure. Most of these institutions have political bodies where ministers convene periodically to give the necessary impetus to current negotiations. One cannot assign to a single committee a general decision-making capacity in matters of development. \n303. My second comment has to do with the mandate of the Committee of the Whole, which was defined last year by the General Assembly after lengthy and difficult discussions. It seems to be to be sufficiently wide. Would it not be wise to exploit all its possibilities during the relatively brief period which separates us from the special session of the General Assembly in 1980? In view of this, should not the Committee of the Whole starts as detailed an examination as possible on the problems of the North-South dialogue? But if for this purpose the General Assembly wishes the mandate of the Committee of the Whole to e \\\"interpreted\\\", Belgium will join in the consensus and I pleased to note, on this point, that the political will exists to resolve this problem.\n204. What seems essential to us is to see the start of a common reflection on the broad lines of the new strategy for economic development.\n205.\tAs far as we are concerned, we do not pretend to have reached final conclusions on this subject already. But, as of now, it would seem to us that several considerations ought to be taken into account for the examination of the new strategy.\n206.\tFirst, United Nations agencies, which sometimes --  even often -- act in a haphazard manner, have assigned themselves about 250 development goals in the framework of the implementation of the new international economic order. When one considers them all together, do they appear to be feasible? I doubt it. It seems to me essential to make a choice as well as, at the same time, to examine tire present validity of certain of those goals. It is important to maintain only feasible and coherent goals, in a global economic context, inasmuch of course, as that context is foreseeable. In my view, it is necessary to establish priorities and to fix a time-limit for attaining these goals.\n207.\tSecondly, it is not imperative to examine a better way of allocating aid to economic development so that it may further promote social development?\n208.\tThirdly, the recent United Nations Conference on Technical Co-Operation among Developing Countries, held in Buenos Aires, has shown the determination of those countries to mobilize their resources with a view to achieving these common goals. This concern, which has nothing to do with either economic self-sufficiency or confrontation, is worthy of our attention and the support of the developed countries.\n209.\tFourthly, should one not consider the desirability of having a clearer differentiation in types of aid for development, taking into account the economic structures of the countries concerned and the development levels already reached and giving priority to low-income countries?\n210.\tFinally, should we not endeavour to improve the quality of development aid? Should not one endeavour also to diminish the percentage of the management and operating costs of projects assigned to multilateral bodies and rectify a situation in which 30 to 45 per cent of the funds they manage do- not reach the developing countries?\n211.\tBelgium welcomes the fact that the UNCTAD Trade and Development.. Board has reached agreement on the agenda of the fifth session which will take place in Manila in May 1979. That agenda is ambitious and covers all our concerns. At that session we could take into account the considerations I have just expressed. So far as we are concerned, we will go there conscious of the convergence of our long-term interests in an interdependent world.\n212.\tThe North-South dialogue is the concern of all countries. Since our interests are common we must all make efforts Jo create a just economic order. Belgium does not intend to side-step that obligation.\n213.\tDefining human rights and being concerned to guarantee their inviolability and trying to improve the material conditions of mankind through the search for a new international economic order would be vain if the relative climate of peace which we now enjoy should be further threatened. We cannot delude ourselves. Despite a certain atmosphere of detente  the climate of peace remains fragile. Too many hotbeds of tension persist in the world. Too much distrust exists between countries, generating an ever more complex and frenetic arms race. We all recognize that this arms race is itself one of the biggest factors of imbalance and risk. It is imperative to slow it down and to try to stop it. As the problems of disarmament remain among our primary concerns, I should like to dwell on them briefly as most speakers before me have done.\n214.\tAs I said last June from this very rostrum,  there is no field more difficult than that of disarmament. The beginning of any negotiation is particularly hesitant and once it has beer) set in motion progress is slow. Discussions touch on problems of national security and therefore they are marked by the extreme caution with which the participants engage in these discussions and it is only with the greatest difficulty that they manage to overcome their fears and precautions. But the difficulties of the task must not discourage us so long as the process of detente continues. As some of my colleagues have pointed out, favourable events have occurred since the beginning of the 1960s which should prompt the international community to redouble .its efforts to bring us closer to the ultimate goal, namely, general and complete disarmament under effective international control.\n215.\tOur Assembly took an important step forward in that direction during the tenth special session, devoted to disarmament. Of course I know that the results have been evaluated and commented on, often very differently. The participation of 23 Heads of State and an impressive number of ministers has indicated the importance of that session to all parts of the world. For the first time a detailed inventory has been drawn up of the problems with which we are confronted and also of certain priorities which we should respect. For the first time the road has been opened up for new endeavours which should finally make possible genuine disarmament measures.\n216.\tAlthough we agree that nuclear arms pose the heaviest global threat to mankind we have recognized nevertheless that we must not underestimate the danger of local, conventional conflicts which may degenerate and set entire regions aflame. Hence we welcome the fact that the question of conventional armaments was retained by the special session of the General Assembly as one of the priorities to be dealt with alongside the question of nuclear weapons. We are also pleased to note the extent to which the regional dimension .of the problems of security and therefore of disarmament was stressed during the work of that session.\n217.\tBelgium will pursue its initiative with the aim of undertaking a systematic study of all aspects of regional disarmament in accordance with General Assembly resolution 32/87 D. We must in that respect take into account national contributions submitted to the general Secretariat, as well as the conclusions of the special session. My delegation will submit to this session of the Assembly a new draft resolution aimed at creating a group of governmental experts entrusted with the task of starting a general study of all aspects of regional disarmament. \n218.\tFinally, machinery established in the field of disarmament by the special session also gives us reason for satisfaction. The Belgian Government is pleased with the token of trust and the honour bestowed on it by the inclusion of our country among the 35 non-nuclear States which are members of the new Committee on Disarmament. That nomination is the fulfilment of a long-standing and legitimate ambition of my country: its history and geography have rendered it particularly sensitive to the problems of disarmament. I should like to take this opportunity to thank those who made that nomination possible. I can assure the Assembly that Belgium will be worthy of the mandate entrusted to it.\n219.\tWorld opinion has observed the growing role of the United Nations in a completely different field, that of peace-keeping operations. The Secretary-General's report mentions the existence of six distinct operations, namely, in Lebanon, in the Sinai, in Golan, in Kashmir and in Cyprus, deploying troops totalling nearly 13,000 men coming from 27 nations [see A/3311, sect. IV], and the Security Council has just approved a sizeable operation in Namibia. The world must pay a tribute to this activity of the United Nations that is so complex and requires co-operation and restraint for all. On the road to security these operations seem to us to be of overriding importance, deserving the unanimous support of all nations.\n220.\tThat is the aim of the draft declaration which the countries of the European Community wish to submit to this session of the Assembly.17 Belgium played a decisive part in this and is certain of the approval of the peace-loving international community.\n221.\tThe four subjects which I have just discussed give an idea of the considerable activities undertaken by the United Nations. Now I should like to say a few words concerning the problems of Africa and the Middle East, complementing the thoughts developed by Foreign Minister Genscher on behalf of the member countries of the European Community.\n222.\tSince; taking office I have been quite concerned with the problems of Africa. That has led me on many occasions to confirm the main lines of Belgian policy towards that continent. That policy is first and foremost concerned with co-operation beneficial to the African countries themselves\u2014whether that is established bilaterally or within the framework of the European Community and the multilateral organizations of the United Nations. Our policy respects the independence and sovereignty of the African countries. It is to be pursued in a climate of the security and stability of the African countries. If any disputes or conflicts arise between them, we leave it in the first place to the OAU to encourage negotiation and to bear the responsibility of providing ideas for solutions, whether the problem is to re-establish peace in subregions, to settle border disputes, or to smooth out ethnic rivalries. We note that certain principles are gradually becoming accepted among the members of that organization: respect for territorial integrity, the rejection of interference, abstention from resort to subversive activities, the maintenance of the territorial frontiers existing at the time of accession to independence since, if they Were to be challenged, calm relations between the patties concerned would be an essential condition.\n223.\tThat approach was progressively asserted among the African countries. It is gaining the respect of all nations. That is also our position. 1 would add, however, following tile Secretary-General, that the United Nations and the Security Council cannot renounce their global responsibility in peace keeping and in resolving conflicts which a regional organization would not be able to settle.\n224.\tIn Belgium's opinion, African stability, of which the Africans themselves are the best guarantors, demands moderation and restraint on the part of the international community. The bringing in of massive arms shipments and foreign troops can only cause justifiable concern among the African States, and, furthermore, to the entire international community. In view of this, I ant pleased to be speaking in accordance with the statement made in the General Assembly on 27 September last, on behalf of the OAU, by the President of the Democratic Republic of the Sudan, current President of the OAU.\n225.\tAll this will make clear to the Assembly the difficulty for the Belgian Government of taking the decision to stage a humanitarian rescue operation in Shaba last May with the agreement of the authorities of the Government of Zaire. Out intervention was brief, limited in aim and we were not responsible for the loss of a single life among the local population. Our action put an end to the dinger of a greater blood-bath, at a time when almost 1,000 human lives had already been lost.\n226.\tThe Government of Zaire has since then been tackling the solution of its many problems with the help of the international community. The presence of African troops to ensure security in certain regions, international consultation, under Belgian leadership, on the \\\"Mobutu plan\\\" and the many reforms decided on by Zaire itself lead one to hope that this country, with which we have so many ties, will assert itself in central Africa as a factor for peace, stability and prosperity.\n227.\tWe must welcome particularly the meeting last month of the President of Zaire, Mr. Mobutu, and the President of Angola, Mr. Neto. The reconciliation between those two countries proves that the reasons for agreement have, happily, prevailed. My recent visits to Kinshasa and Luanda have indicated to me to what extent this understanding can bring about the solution of bilateral problems which is of vital importance for those two great African newborns.\n228.\tBy the same token, untiring efforts have been made towards the solution of the Namibian problem. We are aware of the persistent patience of the Western members of the Security Council, of the front-line African States and of many others to ensure the solution of a problem which a while ago was considered intractable.\n229.\tThe report of the Secretary-General of our Organization has taken note of the possibilities for bringing together the various viewpoints. The Security Council, in its turn, has by adopting resolution 435(1978) of 29\nSeptember just confirmed a plan which allows for the peaceful accession to independence of the Territory of Namibia by democratic means.\n230.\tWe cannot believe that the South African leaders will fail to choose the Only way that offers hope for a lasting, peaceful and generally acceptable settlement instead of confrontation and a bloody conflict.\n231.\tTo conclude, I should like to say that no international problem has held the attention of our Organization for such a long time and so intensely as that of the Middle East. Thirty long years of tension and war have plunged that region into the depths of hatred and suspicion.\n232.\tAs 1 speak now violence is continuing in Lebanon. That country, which was once an example of political wisdom and of balance in a pluralist society, is now torn asunder by murderous conflict. This is a source of sadness and anxiety for my country and for all civilized countries. Each day the world could find itself face to face with a new war involving the entire region.\n233.\tIn view of this, we cannot fail to be pleased at the fact that the tenacious efforts of the President of the United States. Mr. Carter, at Camp David and American diplomacy have succeeded in outlining specific lines for negotiations rather than merely stopping at general principles. The dialogue which was initiated by the historic and Courageous visit of the President of Egypt, Mr. El-Sadat, to Jerusalem last year has thus been renewed, thanks to the political wisdom shown by the Israeli and the Egyptian Governments.\n234.\tWill the results of these negotiations produce miracles? Difficult negotiations will still have to take place in order to agree on the implementation of the agreements and to build upon them.\n235.\tOn 26 September Foreign Minister Genscher recalled here the principles of the statement of 29 June 1977 of the Ministers of the European Community.\n236.\tNo action, however partial, no agreement, however limited, should be neglected, despised or, a fortiori, attacked. The Camp David agreements must be a starting- point for dynamic peace. Of course, we cannot build a lasting and general peace in the Middle East on one or two bilateral agreements. An over-all settlement will be necessary with all the parties concerned, including the representatives of the Palestinian people. It is up to them to determine the form of the homeland which is to express Palestinian legitimacy. The Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East would provide a framework, as would any other similar formula.\n237.\tTo observe the international scene is to take note of the growing interdependence of our destinies. To find solutions to our problems, we are obliged to co-operate on a regional as well as on a world level, and, in order to do this, we must make use of universal organizations.\nIf there are many imperfections in the United Nations, let us improve this indispensable tool, but, above ail, let us use it patiently and tirelessly to communicate, to maintain dialogue and to act together.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff144.\tThe delegation of Rwanda wishes to join in the congratulations and praise addressed to you, Sir, on your election as President Of this Assembly. The unanimous confidence shown by our Assembly in electing you President of its thirty -third regular session is undoubtedly a well-deserved tribute both to your exceptional personal qualities and to the role that your country has played and continues to play in the international arena in order to bring about a world of freedom, justice and progress.\n145.\tI should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, a distinguished son of the people of Yugoslavia, a country which has constantly striven for the attainment of the noble objectives of non-alignment.\n146.\tAt this same rostrum at the same time last year, speaking of Mr. Kurt Waldheim, I said:\n\\\"My country, Rwanda, has always greatly appreciated the efforts and the wisdom shown by our Secretary-General in carrying out his very delicate tasks to ensure for the United Nations influence and effectiveness in keeping with its mission.\\\"\nI take particular pleasure in once again expressing my country's great esteem for his tireless efforts to bring about the triumph of the objectives and principles of our Organization.\\\"\n147.\tFurthermore, we share the joy of the people of Solomon Islands on this memorable occasion of its admission as a new State Member of our Organization. The independence of Solomon Islands is another landmark on the road to the complete elimination of colonialism and foreign domination throughout the world.\n148.\t\\\"The irresistible march towards the elimination of colonialism and foreign domination should go hand in hand with the fight against the present imbalances in the world, a dominant feature of which is the establishment of a new international economic order.\n149.\tThe quest for this new order involves the elimination of poverty, ignorance and sickness, and a reduction of the gap separating the poor nations from the wealthy nations. Instead of competing in the production of increasingly sophisticated weapons the wealthy nations should realize that there is a nobler struggle', that for universal social justice. That struggle would be made easier if the funds used for the arms race were diverted to development assistance. Indeed, the more than $US 400 billion poured every year into the production of weapons of mass destruction would be sufficient, we think, to enable a start to be made in improving the national economies of all the poor countries.\n150.\tWe are convinced that the present crises, both economic, and political, are based on that inequality which certain countries are perpetuating in the service of a policy which is unscrupulous and tied to various forms of hegemony.\n151.\tIn this connexion, now that the need for respect for human rights is receiving the greatest attention in the international community,  determined effort must be made by the major Powers to substitute respect for human dignity for violence and oppression by the wicked regimes of racism and apartheid.\n152.\tThe people of Namibia, Zimbabwe and Azania must recover their freedom. Our duty, based on concrete solidarity, is to support them by every means, including armed force because peaceful means alone have not made the tyranny of the regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury more yielding.\n153.\tThese two murderous regimes have become infamous in the history of Africa and in the history of the world, not only because of what they have done to the black race but also because of their misdeeds against all of Africa and mankind as a whole.\n154.\tOn the subject of Zimbabwe, the peace talks now having failed, the freedom fighters must be encouraged to stand firm. We support the Patriotic Front, the legitimate representative of Zimbabwe, in its determination to lead the country to genuine independence. The other nationalists, who were so anxious to make a deal with the racist rebels, must at last realize that they were deceived by illusory promises, because whatever happens, any genuine negotiations must take account above all of the proposals of the Patriotic Front.\n155.\tWe are fully convinced that, the two bastions of racism will fall before the irresistible march of history sooner or later. Their provocation of the front-line States will be to no avail, for the front-line States are determined to continue to help their fighting brothers, supported as they are by the rest of the peoples of Africa and by other peoples of the world which cherish peace and freedom.\n156.\tFurthermore, as regards Namibia, the delegation of Rwanda has not lost sight of the fact that the efforts of the Western Powers members of the Security Council deserve credit. However, the delaying tactics and the treachery of Ian Smith and Vorster, and in particular the brutal aggression against and the massacres of the peaceful populations of Zambia, Mozambique and Angola cast doubt on their credibility and good faith. It is for them to draw the proper conclusions from these events.\n157.\tAfrica remains attentive to all these vicissitudes and, to any attempt to undermine its cohesiveness and unity by supporting or encouraging conflicts among the African States and diverting them from their primary concerns.\n158.\tOur continent must no longer be a breeding-ground for power struggles encouraged by thinly-disguised neocolonialism.\n159.\tInter-State relations must be based on the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations and recalled in the Charter of the OAU. We must always settle our conflicts by peaceful moans and without foreign interference, whose only aim is to incite Africans to blind self-destruction to serve the interests of hegemonistic forces.\n160.\tThe aggression perpetrated by Israel against the Arab nation is of direct concern to the peoples of our continent. The peoples of the Middle East belong to two civilizations: African and Arab. Our bonds with the Arab world justify our indignation against: the annexationist policy of Israel.\n161.\tThis high organ has never ceased to recall that Israel must return the occupied Arab territories, in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967), and that the Palestinian people must be able to determine its own fate and to exercise its right to self-determination in a regained homeland.\n162.\tMy Government, in this connexion, supports the efforts of the Government of the United States to increase the momentum of the process of achieving a just and lasting peace in the area. We believe that the Camp David summit talks may have been a very important step towards that objective.\n163.\tI do not know whether this Assembly will have an immediate and adequate reply to the fundamental question of how to put an end to armed conflicts and bring about universal peace, the ultimate goal of our Organization.\n164.\tWe note that certain conflicts have come to an end but that others have arisen, elsewhere or in the same area, throughout the world.\n165.\tMy delegation deplores such conflicts, especially between fraternal neighbouring countries, such as those on the Sino-Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Cambodian borders. We regret the exodus which such tensions impose on innocent populations that have fallen victim to intriguer beyond their understanding.\n166.\tAnother major obstacle to the creation of universal peace is the division of certain nations such as Germany, Korea, Cyprus and a number of others.\n167.\tRwanda has always supported from this rostrum a realistic approach to this problem\u2014an approach worthy of rising generations and, hence, of history. The irresistible march towards the unification of divided nations, in accordance with the will of their peoples and without foreign interference, should enjoy the complete support of the international community.\n168.\tTogether with all these concerns, we believe that the first step for bringing about the universal peace we seek is complete disarmament and the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.\n169 The talks that have begun in this connexion under United Nations auspices should be pursued and lead to concrete results. The recent tenth special session, devoted to disarmament, has laid the groundwork for an international conference on disarmament.\n170.\tWe are pleased that solution of the problem of disarmament and of halting the arms race is no longer the domain of the super-Powers alone but has become the common undertaking of all countries. It is, of course, a question of great concern to all mankind.\n171.\tWe have already had occasion to hail France's initiative on this important and timely issue. The proposals if made to the special session  deserve special attention, especially since disarmament is related to development. Moreover, France's position in this connexion is akin to that of the non-aligned countries, which initiated that session.\n172.\tEven though the special session yielded limited results and brought to light very significant differences among States, we believe that its merit is that it made it possible to start the process of disarmament negotiation and identify the demands of mankind.\n173.\tSince the sixth special session of the General Assembly in April 1974, a problem as old as our Organization itself has come to the forefront of the international scene because of its explosive nature and the urgent need to solve it. I am referring to the establishment of a new international economic order.\n174.\tThe present economic order, which the international community is trying to change, has become a source of deep concern and bitterness over the years.\n175.\tThis unjust system, under which a small number of countries controls mere than 80 per cent of the world's markets, all of its technology and, consequently, nearly all industrial investments, is forcing the developing countries into a state of poverty and misery because of the constant deterioration in the terms of trade and because of the resultant inflation and economic recession.\n176.\tThe international community, and in particular the developed countries, must take appropriate action in this connexion to make it possible for the third world to have wider access to the markets of the industrialized countries by providing, not just in resolutions but also in deeds, more equitable outlets for the manufactures of the developing countries.\n177.\tMoreover, while it is true that the modern approach to development is closely connected to the problems of energy, it is consequently a matter of urgency that this question, which since the beginning of the North-South dialogue has been a stumbling-block in the negotiations between industrialized and developing countries, be speedily settled in a fair manner.\n178.\tThe industrialized countries must therefore take an active and substantial part in the solution of this problem, not resorting to unjustified protectionism but respecting the principle of mutual advantage. That implies, in addition to guarantees of non-discriminatory access to ordinary energy sources, the technology of which they control, but easier access also to nuclear energy.\n179.\tAs far as raw materials are concerned, in the world economy they continue to be subject to instability and disquieting price fluctuations, which are at the root of the sudden drops in the export earnings of the developing countries.\n180.\tAlthough the importance and urgency of creating a common stabilization fund for the prices of raw materials require no further proof, they run up against a lack of political will on the part of some developed countries. We are very pleased with the position taken by Japan from this rostrum [6th meeting] in support of an equitable solution to this problem.\n181.\tWe are equally pleased to note the efforts of some of the developed countries both as regards the setting up of that common fund and increasing their public assistance for development and as regards debt cancellation.\n182.\tThe Government of the Republic of Rwanda highly appreciates the commitment of certain industrialized countries, such as the Federal Republic of Germany, to convert into grants development assistance loans which they have Steady made or will make in future to the least-developed countries.\n183.\tBut this praiseworthy effort, unless shared by the international community as a whole, cannot bring a final solution to the world's economic problems. That is why the United Nations must make a major effort to promote true economic and social progress throughout the world.\n184.\tThis brief outline of our major international concerns has perhaps not done full justice to the complexity of the many problems which are on the agenda of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, but it does nevertheless reflect the present basic realities of international relations.\n185.\tWe hope that the desire of the peoples of the world for peace, freedom and social justice will not be eternally thwarted. That, of course, will depend on the good will that each State brings to the implementation of the noble principles of our Organization.\n"

Under your distinguished leadership, the current session of this Assembly will surely be most fruitful.\n125.\tI should also like to express my deepest - respect toward Mr. Mojsov, the former President, for his having led both the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly and the special sessions of the General Assembly, particularly that devoted to disarmament, to their successful conclusions.\n126.\tI should like at the same time to express my heartfelt respect to the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, for expending such dedicated efforts for the realization, of the goals of the United Nations.\n127.\tI am also taking this opportunity to express my heartfelt welcome to Solomon Islands, our friend in the South Pacific, on the occasion of its admission to the United Nations. Henceforth, my country looks forward to deepening its co-operation with Solomon Islands both within the United Nations framework and in our bilateral relations.\n128.\tIt is by no means an exaggeration to state that the international community today stands at a cross-roads: will it be able to take firm steps in the direction of securing a lasting peace and prosperity, or will it tread the road of confusion and instability?\n129.\tFor some years now, the world economy has been faced with such difficult problems as recession and inflation, and the rise of protectionism threatens to jeopardize the entire structure of free trade.\n130.\tThe developing countries have been particularly strongly affected by this continuing stagnation of the world economy, and are experiencing extreme difficulties in furthering their economic and social development.\n131.\tIn a number of regions-notably in the Middle East and Africa\u2014bitter confrontations and tensions continue.\n132.\tIn the midst of this situation, the world's stockpile of arms has been increasing steadily, and negotiations for nuclear and other disarmament measures have proceeded languidly and with little noticeable progress.\n133.\tThe plight of refugees and the hijacking of aircraft- humanitarian and social problems that transcend national boundaries\u2014continue unabated.\n134.\tFinally, the prospects concerning the availability of natural resources and energy do not allow for any optimism\n135.\tThese problems are grave ones, having a decisive influence upon the future of mankind, and their resolution is a common task imposed upon all of us.\n136.\tI am convinced that now all countries of the world must strive for the resolution of these problems in a spirit of harmony and solidarity, and must take firm steps toward the building of a new order for the world community, in which all countries may share equally in peace and prosperity. I believe that thus to bring about a bright outlook for the future of mankind as we face the twenty-first century is the responsibility of all of us living in the twentieth.\n137.\tJapan itself is fully aware of the responsibility which it bears as an advanced industrialized country in Asia, and it intends to co-operate to the fullest extent of its ability in the creation of this new order.\n138.\tThe first thing which my country can do in the field of international co-operation is actively to employ its economic strength for the sake of the stability and prosperity of the international community. As I stated in some detail at the special session on disarmament,  my country maintains as its fundamental policy the pursuit of peace and the refusal to become a military Power. For precisely that reason, I feel that it is particularly necessary that my country should use its economic strength for the stability and prosperity of the international community.\n139.\tTo that end, my country is not only voluntarily co-operating in international efforts to guarantee the stable expansion of the world economy, but also devoting all its strength to contributing actively to the development of the developing countries and to improving their peoples' welfare.\n140.\tIn the first place, my country has set itself the highest target for real economic growth among the developed countries and is implementing vigorous expansionary measures\u2014centering upon the expansion of domestic demand-in order to attain that target. This is a policy which, by encouraging imports to my country, will contribute to the stable expansion of the world economy as a whole.\n141.\tFurthermore, in order to suppress the rise of protectionism, as well as to maintain and strengthen the structure of free trade, Japan intends, in co-operation with the other countries concerned, to expend still greater efforts to produce a successful conclusion to the Tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations.\n142.\tAs regards the problem of the expansion of trade with the developing nations in particular, I wish first to point out that Japan's imports from these countries are increasing annually, and that in 1977 the total of such imports reached some $40 billion, or 56 per cent of our total imports.\n143.\tEach year Japan has improved its generalized system of preferences; during the last fiscal year, for example, we effected approximately a 1.8-fold increase in the ceiling of its preferential quotas. We are also striving within the framework of the Tokyo round for a further reduction of trade barriers.\n144.\tThe question of commodities, and particularly, the establishment of a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities , is one of the central issues in the context of what we refer to as the North-South problem. At the recent Bonn Economic Summit Conference of the major industrialized countries, Prime Minister Fukuda of Japan laid particular stress upon the importance of the Common Fund. As a result, the meeting agreed to pursue actively the negotiations on a Common Fund to a successful conclusion. I feel that a Common\nFund should be established at an early date, and wish to exert my every effort for such a successful conclusion at the resumed session of the Negotiating Conference scheduled for this November.\n145.\tMay I add that my country is actively participating in international commodity agreements; at the end of last year, for example, we signed the new International Sugar Agreement, and we have already pledged to contribute up to 7 billion yen to the buffer stock of the Fifth International Tin Agreement.\n146.\tTogether with the trade measures of the sort I have just discussed, the quantitative increase and qualitative improvement of development assistance are extremely important when we talk about co-operation directed toward the developing countries.\n147.\tQuantity-wise, my country has recently decided upon a vigorous expansion of our financial assistance to the developing countries, the target being to double our official development assistance within three years.\n148.\tWith regard to the quality of our assistance, moreover, we are not only striving to increase our grant aid and to improve the terms and conditions of our loans, but have also established the fundamental policy of untying our aid so as to ensure the most efficient use of the development funds we provide; this policy is already being implemented.\n149.\tFurthermore, more than one third of Japan's official development assistance is extended through international organizations\u2014including the International Development Association and the regional development banks\u2014and it is our intention actively to promote this form of assistance.\n150.\tAs regards the debt problems of poorer developing countries, Japan, in conformity with the resolution adopted last March by the United Nations Trade and Development Board [see A/33/15, part two, annex I, resolution 165 (S-IX)J, has decided to extend in principle new grant assistance as a measure which will, in substance, be equivalent to the cancellation of the annual debt-servicing obligations of its least developed debtors or to a reduction in the obligations of its debtors which have been most seriously affected by the oil crisis.\n151.\tAs I have stated thus far, Japan places great importance upon making a positive contribution to the development of the developing countries through the improvement of the trade environment and this provision of development funds; and -it is expending the maximum possible effort to this end.\n152.\tIn May of next year the fifth session of UNCTAD will be held in Manila. Furthermore, it is planned that in 1980 we will convene a special session of the General Assembly devoted to economic questions; in the meantime the Committee of the Whole, that is, the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution' 32/174, has already begun functioning with the aim of considering North-South problems from an over-all point of view. Japan is resolved to devote its every effort to the dynamic building, through these forums, of a just and equitable international economic order.\n153.\tThe fact that at present tensions and confrontations continue in several regions of the world, and that at times we even witness the outbreak of armed conflicts, is an extremely serious problem for the world community. Every one of these tensions and confrontations has the potential of directly affecting the peace and stability of the entire world. It is, moreover, a most deplorable fact that in these regions the funds and technology which could otherwise be utilized for development purposes are channelled into the unproductive purpose of expanding armaments. I strongly hope that in order to relax the tensions and eliminate confrontations in such areas, all countries concerned will make much greater efforts in a spirit of self-restraint.\n154.\tFrom this standpoint, I feel deep anxiety over the continuation of the confrontation and tension in the Middle East. The conditions surrounding the Middle East problem are at present highly complex and fluid. In the midst of this situation, a number of dramatic initiatives are being undertaken in order to bring about peace in the Middle East. In particular, my country highly values the courageous decision of those who brought about the three-country summit meetings at Camp David, which we strongly hope will lead to the realization of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n155.\tThe guiding principles for peace in the Middle East remain unchanged. It is necessary that Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) be fully implemented, and that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, particularly their right to self-determination, be recognized, respected and implemented in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\n156.\tTurning to the situation in southern Africa, I find it most encouraging that, despite the confrontation and tension springing from racial discrimination and minority rule, international efforts to achieve Namibia's independence by peaceful means continue to be pursued. In this connexion, it is most deplorable that, notwithstanding these international efforts, on 20 September the Government of the Republic of South Africa announced its intention to carry out the elections on its own. Japan earnestly hopes that the Government of South Africa will again realign itself with these joint international efforts. Japan strongly hopes that, in accordance with the Secretary-General's report to the Security Council,  United Nations activities to bring about Namibia's peaceful transition to independence will soon be set in motion. My country intends actively to participate in the envisaged United Nations operation. In the transitional period before independence, my country intends to direct its co-operative efforts into participating in the supervision and control of fair and free elections which will constitute the nucleus of the United Nations operation, and in providing materiel and equipment in support of the operation. Once independence is achieved, Japan will be willing to co-operate as much as possible in the nation-building of Namibia.\n157.\tIn Southern Rhodesia, the fact that the resistance by the white minority regime still drags on is deplorable in the extreme. Until an internationally recognized Government of\nZimbabwe has been born, it is the intention of my country fully to respect the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations, and to co-operate in international efforts to achieve a peaceful solution for this problem.\n158.\tThe continuation of racial discrimination in South Africa is something which must be vigorously condemned; and Japan strongly demands that the Government of South Africa strive to eliminate such discrimination. Until it does so, my country will continue to have no diplomatic relations with South Africa, to refuse to co-operate with South Africa in the field of nuclear development, and to prohibit direct investment in that country. That Japan does not offer any form whatsoever of military co-operation with that country follows naturally from our fundamental position as a peace-loving nation.\n159.\tIn Asia, confrontation and tension persist on the Korean peninsula. My own country is deeply interested in the peace and stability of the peninsula so dose to us, and it is our strong hope that the two parties concerned, the North and the South, will reopen their dialogue without delay and that genuine peace and stability will be established in this region. My country wishes, therefore, to co-operate with other interested countries in creating an international environment conducive to this end.\n160.\tThe peace and stability of South-East Asia is also of great concern to Japan. In this sense, it is indeed regrettable that new confrontation and conflict have broken out on the Indo-China peninsula. My country earnestly hopes that through the self-restraint and efforts of the parties concerned, peace and stability in this region will be restored and progress can be made in the economic and social development of the countries involved.\n161.\tAlong with the effort peacefully to resolve tension and confrontation between States, international efforts for disarmament are extremely important. The fact that, this May, at the tenth special session of the General Assembly, the first in the history of the United Nations to be devoted solely to disarmament, an international agreement laying down guidelines for the furtherance of disarmament [resolution S-10/2/ was adopted by a consensus of all Member States is an event still fresh in our memories. Taking the agreement of this special session as our new point of departure, we must strengthen still further our concrete efforts to promote disarmament, with nuclear disarmament receiving our primary attention. I should therefore like to address an appeal to the various countries concerned, beginning with the nuclear-weapon States, for their special efforts in this regard.\n.162. The problem of human rights is taken up within the United Nations from a variety of angles. My own country wishes actively to support the effort to guarantee fundamental human rights in a form which, at a minimum, protects the most fundamental human dignity of all individuals. This past, spring, I signed the International Covenants on Human Rights, and they are currently before the Japanese Diet with a view to their early ratification.\n163. We are today faced with grave humanitarian issues which must be tackled by the entire international community\u2014the problems of refugees and of aerial hijacking.\n164.\tThe refugee problem is one which not only includes the threat of breeding new tension and confrontation between States, but is also, in its fundamental sense, a humanitarian problem. From this viewpoint Japan has each year increased its contribution to UNRWA. In Asia, moreover, Japan is endeavouring to aid the refugees of Indo-China by means of, among other things, a special contribution of $10 million in addition to its previous contributions to the special programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We have also extended our support through the High Commissioner to the refugees who have come about along the border between Burma and Bangladesh.\n165.\tThe hijacking of aircraft, through which suffering is brought to large numbers of innocent passengers, is an act which is impermissible on humanitarian grounds. In order to prevent hijacking, it is essential that all nations should co-operate. To this end, my country took the initiative at last year's session of the General Assembly in the formation of a consensus on the resolution on international cooperation for the prevention of hijacking [resolution 32/8], and in co-operation with other interested countries, is continuing its efforts to urge all countries to become parties to the three conventions concerning the safety of civil aviation. From this same viewpoint, moreover, Japan hopes that all nations will align themselves with the import of the statement on air hijacking which was adopted last July at the Bonn Economic Summit Conference of the major industrialized countries. \n166.\tIt is the intention of my country to continue to co-operate actively in efforts to resolve these humanitarian and social problems of our international community.\n167.\tFinally, we have the extremely serious problems of how we should effectively employ the energy resources which are indispensable for human existence, and of how we shall secure them far into the future. When one considers that existing energy resources are finite, it is clear that this is a major issue whose solution is necessary even for those countries that currently possess these resources, and that in that sense it is the common problem of every country in the world.\n168.\tFrom that viewpoint I am convinced that it is important to promote the peaceful uses of atomic energy in a form compatible with the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n169.\tFurthermore it is vital that research and development be furthered through international co-operation in order to promote the more efficient use of existing energy sources and the development of new sources\u2014including renewable energy.\n170.\tMy country intends to co-operate actively in international efforts in these fields, and is further determined to join its efforts with those of the developing countries in the field of energy development.\n171.\tAs I noted at the beginning of my remarks, the world community today faces such extraordinarily difficult problems that it may truly be said to be at a historic cross-roads. Thus far I have stated my beliefs concerning what we must do in such a situation if we are to bring about a bright outlook for man's future as we move toward the twenty- first century.\n172.\tRelationships of mutual interdependence among nations transcend differences in social system, size, or stage of development, and are deepening at an increasingly rapid pace. The peace of one nation is inseparable from that of the world as a whole, and the prosperity of one nation cannot be built except upon the prosperity of the world. There can, therefore, no longer be such a thing as the peace or the prosperity of but one nation alone. What is expected of all nations in a world such as this is that they should join their wisdom in determining what each of them must do for the sake of coexistence and mutual prosperity. What is expected is that, regardless of whether countries are large or small, regardless of whether their positions are strong or weak, and regardless of whether they are developed or developing, each of them should, in proportion to its ability, act from a global standpoint.\n173.\tI firmly believe that if all countries act on the basis of this awareness then surely we shall resolve the difficult problems with which we are faced, and will create a brighter future for mankind in the. next century.\n174.\tMy country pledges to devote its every effort to making an active contribution to this common undertaking of mankind.\n \n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff165.\tThe history of the United Nations is a mixture of success and disappointment. The arrangements now necessary for accommodating representatives of States in this chamber are a testimony to an undeniable area of achievement. It is success in advancing the processes of political self-determination which has brought us nearer to universal membership, fn this context Guyana is happy to welcome Solomon Islands into our midst.\n166.\tBut, in the area of self-determination, much still remains to be done. The need to eradicate the cancer of apartheid, to defeat the arrogant resistance of the racists in Zimbabwe and Namibia, to restore the national rights of the Palestinians and the people of Western Sahara and East Timor, and to secure the independence of Belize cries out for effective action by the international community. Self-determination remains a primordial and abiding concern. But there are other fundamental issues on which desirable change is no less urgent.\n167.\tThe persistence of underdevelopment over large areas of the globe serves as a sharp reminder of the magnitude and scope of the tasks which confront us. As we- seek to grapple with these problems and to bend our collective will to their solution, Guyana feels particularly pleased that Ambassador Lievano, a distinguished son of Latin America, an eminent scholar and statesman, has been chosen to superintend our deliberations and guide our consultations.\n168.\tMay I take this opportunity to acknowledge how greatly we are in the debt of Ambassador Lazar Mojsov of non-aligned Yugoslavia, who\\\" so ably and graciously presided over our activities, not only during the last regular session of the General Assembly, but also at the three special sessions at which we sought to resolve major issues.\n169.\tThe surge of particular issues which now press upon the international agenda and the keen attention they attract make manifest the increasing universalization of concern and reflect a new perception of the nature of interdependence.\n170.\tThe main objective of international organization remains the same as that determined upon the defeat of fascism and nazism and the establishment of the United Nations. It is the creation of an international order which' advances growth, development and the fulfilment of all the peoples of the planetary community. Such an order must be firmly rooted in equity and justice.\n171.\tThis Organization has never abandoned its quest for that order. However, as each new Member State has brought to our deliberations insight and perspectives which derive from its history and national experience, perceptions of the meaning of justice and equity have been deepened and enriched. It is this constellation of perceptions which now informs the appropriate and necessary measures for the attainment of that objective.\n172.\tThe key essentials of international organization are outlined in our Charter. Foremost among them is the creation of conditions which will facilitate the construction of a secure peace. The attainment of such a regime of peace is premised on the promotion of the principle of self-determination, nationally and individually, and on the expansion of the parameters for increasing international economic and political co-operation. At the heart of the search for that secure peace lies international action which has as its central concern the rights of man.\n173.\tThe Secretary-General has observed in his report on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"The United Nations was intended, among other things, to be the guarantor of justice and peace for all nations, and most especially for defenceless or small countries which would otherwise have no recourse in a world dominated exclusively by power politics.\\\" [See A/33/1, sect. II.]\nMr. Waldheim, who has served us with such distinction, went on to \\\"say:\n\\\"... there are many situations in which military power and political influence are far more significant factors than the principles of justice and the rights of all nations as expressed in the Charter.\\\" [Ibid.]\n174.\tIn this respect the views of non-aligned countries consistently articulated over the years and expressed most recently at the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, held in Belgrade in July of this year, have manifested their enduring validity. Indeed, it has been the special vocation of the non-aligned countries to initiate those ideas and elaborate those programmes which have so greatly facilitated the search of the wider international community for global consensus in accordance with the Charter.\n175.\tAs we ponder the reasons for limited success in fully realizing a universally accepted regime of justice and equity, the conclusion is inescapable that, while justice remains the overriding consideration, its achievement has been frustrated by those who have invested in the maintenance of the status quo, clinging to a belief in the virtue of stability for its own sake.\n176.\tThe real conflict lies between those of us who call for restructuring and fundamental change and others who insist on the absolute validity of arrangements and institutions which, even though embodying important elements of justice, leave out of their consideration those wider aspects on which human growth, development and fulfilment depend. In an inequitable world, change is of the essence in the search for justice.\n177.\tThe extent of our success at this and succeeding Assembly consultations in creating a situation of peace will be measured against the bench-mark of our individual and collective capacity to acknowledge the need for fundamental change and to institute the systematic reordering dieted by that necessity. Nowhere is the need for harmonization of action more clearly demonstrated than in the area of international economic co-operation.\n178.\tIn this field, new perspectives of the meaning of justice and equity have been articulated in the blueprint for the New International Economic Order solemnly proclaimed during the sixth special session of this Assembly [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)]. The implementation of that blueprint must continue to be a primary focus of our concern.\n179.\tDuring the four years that have elapsed since the promulgation of the principles and the Programme of Action for the establishment of that order, which has such direct relevance to the attainment of full human rights by the majority of mankind, there has been only faltering and uneven progress\u2014and this despite the extensive discussions which have taken place at a large number of international conferences on its various aspects.\n180.\tAs is well known, two negotiating conferences held during 1977 failed to establish the common fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities  adopted at the fourth session of UNCTAD, the verbal commitment of developed countries to such a fund notwithstanding. It is vitally important, therefore, that the forthcoming conference scheduled to take place in November this year should produce positive results.\n181.\tSimilarly, on the question of debt relief, it is true that the Third (Ministerial) part of the ninth special session of the Trade and Development Board, held in March this year in Geneva, adopted a number of useful guidelines for dealing with specific aspects of the problem [see A/33/15]. Relief has been accorded by some developed countries to the least developed countries, but further measures need to be adopted to include the most seriously affected and other developing countries.\n182.\tBeyond this, the limited arrangements so far agreed upon in the multilateral trade negotiations, the declining level of official development assistance and the postures which have frustrated the work of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, also known as the Committee of the Whole clearly demonstrate a lack of political will on the part of some developed countries to accept the desirability of fundamental change in the present international economic order.\n183.\tIndeed, there is a resistance to structural change in the whole international system. In keeping with this position, some developed countries have sought to emphasize the \\\"basic needs\\\" approach to the problem of underdevelopment. While this approach embodies a commendable humanitarian purpose, it nevertheless, either by design or effect, leaves essentially intact the existing exploitative order which derives from imperialism, the true cause of underdevelopment.\n184.\tInternational economic co-operation is in a state of deep crisis. Unless confidence in its future can be sustained by meaningful responses, even those who are now the beneficiaries of the present exploitative order may find their present privileged positions no longer secure.\n185.\tIt is significant that, while the North-South dialogue languishes, advances are being made by the developing countries in promoting economic and technical cooperation among themselves. The results of the recent Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries held in Belgrade and the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held in Buenos Aires, attest to this reality.\n186.\tIn this connexion, my own country, Guyana, as a co-ordinator of the trade, transport and industry sector of the non-aligned Action Programme for Economic Cooperation [Aj33/206, annex II], has sought to promote an effective programme of co-operation among the developing countries in these areas. We remain fully committed to the pursuit of this objective as an integral part of the wider effort to build a new structure of international economic relations.\n187.\tIn the global order that we seek the developed countries, socialist and non-socialist, must assume their full role. We reiterate our conviction that the establishment of the new order will benefit both the developing countries and the developed countries\u2014the market economy no less than the centrally planned economies.\n188.\tAt the midpoint of this debate we have heard proposals by several delegations bearing on the establishment of the new order. Guyana stands ready to examine all these proposals on their merit. But there are other priority tasks. Since we met last year certain trends have emerged that should give us cause for deep reflection.\n189.\tThe limited results of the tenth special session on disarmament fell far short of the expectations of the vast majority of the world's peoples. There were dangerous portents of the rekindling of the embers of the cold war. New dimensions of tension have been added to persisting situations of crisis, notably in southern Africa and the\nMiddle East, and a particularly disturbing phenomenon has been the open recruitment and spreading use of mercenaries, as in the deplorable situation in Nicaragua.\n190.\tThe search for a settlement of the Middle East situation and the Palestinian question has been long and arduous. Nevertheless, the principles for a comprehensive settlement leading to a just and lasting peace in the area have been clearly enunciated.\n\n191.\tIn keeping with Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973), as well as other relevant United Nations resolutions, Guyana has consistently maintained that a solution should be based on the following three principles: Israeli withdrawal from all Arab lands occupied since 5 June 1967; the restoration of the national rights of all the Palestinian people, including their right to a homeland; and the right of all States in the area to live within mutually recognized boundaries. Any initiative that stands aside from those principles cannot hope to succeed. On the other hand, any initiative informed by them cannot fail to attract the support of the international community.\n192.\tGuyana has noted the lack of harmony in responses by parties to the conflict to recent developments. The absence of a common favourable reaction among the parties raises doubts in our minds about the potential of these developments to usher in the era of peace which the international community so anxiously seeks.\n193.\tAs we heard so clearly this morning in the address by the President of Cyprus [22nd meeting}, the threat that the continuing, unresolved situation in that country poses to regional stability, and the difficulties of making meaningful progress towards a solution, are underlined by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization. It is a matter for regret that resolution 3212 (XXIX), unanimously accepted by this Assembly in 1974, remains unimplemented, for that resolution continues to provide the only valid framework for a just solution. The present stalemate quite clearly serves the interests of aggression and occupation. We therefore feel that the urgency of a solution of the Cyprus problem requires fresh initiatives for the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions. In this regard, we are of the opinion that the Security Council should consider adopting an appropriate response in the light of the lack of progress towards the solution of the question.\n194.\tKorea still remains artificially divided in spite of the long-expressed wishes of the Korean people for reunification. This situation constitutes a potential threat to peace in the area. Guyana continues to support the stand of the Korean people in their efforts for the independent and peaceful reunification of their country free from outside interference. We hold the view that the principles set out in the 1972 North-South joint communiqu\u00e9 of 4 July 1972, as well as the programme enunciated by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea towards that end, form an adequate basis for an acceptable solution to the problem of Korea.\n195.\tIn southern Africa racism remains the dominant ethic. In the face of intensified organized violence the oppressed peoples have sharpened their militancy and strengthened their capacity to regain their freedom. But the racists in Pretoria and Salisbury have extended their brutality and aggression beyond the frontiers of the countries they at present usurp. They have stepped up their intimidation of and aggression against neighbouring independent States. The deteriorating situation in southern Africa confirms its gravity as a threat to international peace and security.\n196.\tCentral to the problem of southern Africa lies that bastion of institutionalized racism, South Africa itself. The apartheid regime continues viciously to repress the people of South Africa, denying them their most basic rights-in particular, their fundamental and decisive right to freedom.\n197.\tThe determination of that regime to survive must be countered by correlative action individually and collectively by all members of the international community. The rhetoric of condemnation is not enough. We must complete the isolation of South Africa and apply the necessary pressures in support of the majority of the people of that territory, who so valiantly struggle to end their oppression.\n198.\tEarlier this year we met in the ninth special session to consider the situation in Namibia and agreed on concrete steps for the termination of the illegal occupation by South Africa of that international Territory. Meanwhile, efforts by the Western countries to bring about a negotiated settlement continued. South Africa's attitude to all these efforts has been characteristically deceptive and defiant.\n199.\tReviewing the long record of South Africa's refusal to implement decisions of this Organization one wonders how much longer the United Nations-the Security Council in particular-can desist from adopting the necessary measures to induce its compliance.\n200.\tThe recent Security Council meetings on Namibia represent the latest attempt to advance the cause of freedom and independence for Namibia. If this effort is thwarted by South Africa there will be no alternative to mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter. Meanwhile, SWAPO, the legitimate representative of the people of Namibia, and the United Nations Council for Namibia must continue to receive our full and unstinted support.\n201.\tIn Zimbabwe, the Smiths, white and black, cling desperately to diminishing power. Their internal settlement plan, hastily put together, is virtually in tatters. Pressure for liberation by the forces of the Patriotic Front mounts daily, while the prospects for a negotiated settlement are increasingly uncertain.\n202.\tNow, more than ever, the international community needs to intensify its assistance to the liberation movements in southern Africa, so that justice and freedom may prevail in that troubled region. Guyana, for its part, will continue to provide every possible means of assistance until victory is finally won.\n203. In Latin America we witnessed the successful conclusion of negotiations in relation to the Panama Canal.\nThese developments should promote new dimensions in hemispheric relations.\n204.\tHowever, in relation to Belize we must maintain our concern and our vigilance. It is a situation in which the people of that Territory are denied their inalienable right to self-determination and independence, and their territorial integrity is threatened. In reaffirming its support for the people of Belize the international community must continue to explore ways in which it can render practical assistance to enable the people of Belize, in the exercise of their legitimate rights, to advance rapidly towards early and secure independence with their territory intact. The people of Belize are assured of Guyana's unremitting support in their just struggle.\n205.\tLikewise, Guyana has actively participated in the efforts to achieve a settled order of the oceans. We have done so since the early days of the international sea-bed Committee.  It is therefore with deep concern that we note that unilateral action on deep sea-bed mining is contemplated in certain quarters. Guyana feels that the pursuit of such action would inhibit the processes of consultation and the search for understandings upon which a successful outcome of the final negotiations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea depends. We should neither foreclose by unilateral action nor render more difficult by the pursuit of narrow national interests the achievement of an all-encompassing agreement on the remaining issues regarding the law of the sea.\n206.\tAll the issues I have raised, and others which are on our agenda, are relevant to the fundamental question of human rights, viewed synergistically.\n207.\tIt was essentially this broad vision which informed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose thirtieth anniversary we celebrate this year. Among the significant contributions to that Declaration was the tradition which articulated the importance of the political and civil rights of the individual. The Charter, for its part, insisted on a wider conception of human rights, by, inter alia, providing for the adoption of positive measures for the abolition of poverty and unemployment \\\"to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\\\".\n208.\tThe Universal Declaration and the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have provided us with textual imperatives. Indeed, through the pooling of experience in the specialized agencies and special conferences, our perceptions have been enriched, and new and important rights have been identified and formulated. Thus, the World Food Conference held in Rome some four years ago solemnly proclaimed in its Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition:\n\\\"Every man, woman and child has the inalienable right to be free from hunger and malnutrition in order to develop fully and maintain their physical and mental\nfaculties.\n209.\tFrom another perspective UNESCO has emphasized the importance of cultural rights as an essential factor for liberation and development. The exercise of those rights underpins programmes of national and collective self- reliance which aim at integrated development utilizing to the full indigenous resources.\n210.\tImplicit in that approach to human rights is the conviction that the maintenance of structures which thwart life itself constitutes their denial. Inherent in imperialism and its manifestations, these structures buttress an international order based on unequal relations, which in perpetuating patterns of dependency, imposes conditions of underdevelopment, with its concomitants of persistent poverty, hunger and disease, and harms and maims and diminishes at every moment the life-chances of a majority of the world's peoples.\n211.\tIt is in Guyana's view a contradiction that the spiralling war-system which consumes a major share of the world resources\u2014resources which should serve the purposes of life\u2014threatens the most fundamental right of all: the right to life. This culture of violence, involving the harnessing of advanced technology to the development of instruments of mass destruction has spawned practices, including the use of mercenaries, which assault the fabric of human rights. The test, therefore, of a universal commitment to human rights is our capacity to maintain and expand global consensus and to continue the process of the enrichment of the condition of man in terms of the full development of the human personality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are certain that your wisdom and your experience will mean that our common endeavour will prevail, both in the search for just solutions and in the results to which our deliberations lead. It is therefore our hope that, guided by the values you represent, we shall be able, when our work is done, to say that the thirty-third session of the General Assembly made substantial progress and was able to dispel the intangible factors that have halted the advance towards a new policy of understanding and effective decisions in the difficult task imposed on us by the expectations of our times and by the United Nations Charter. \n55.\tWe wish to avail ourselves of this opportunity to extend our most cordial congratulations to Solomon Islands on its becoming a Member of this Organization. We are sure it will make a positive contribution towards the building of a better world, a task to which we are all committed.\n56.\tThe history of the Dominican Republic has been characterized by heroic deeds in the defence of liberty. In this difficult task, this is part of the contribution that American independence has made to the principles of democracy. Up to now we have been guided by and have followed those guidelines.\n57.\tWe cannot say that after 1844, when the Dominican Republic came into being as a free and independent State through the brave actions of a few, we have not had to rise up again because of the interference to which our national sovereignty was subjected. To these incidents must be added the fact of our political turbulence, which generated the implacable scourge of internal revolutions. Nevertheless, the ideals upheld with sacrifice and selflessness by the founders of the Republic remain in essence intact within the evolution of our political thinking.\n58.\tAnother historic fact is that a new Government, one that emerged as a result of universal suffrage in the Dominican Republic, is represented at this thirty-third session.\n59.\tAll born in that land therefore rejoice that after almost a century, in compliance with the constitutionality that justified the coming into being of the Republic, a President elected by sovereign legal processes has transmitted public powers to his legitimate successor. This is the example we give of compliance with rules of law and our people's constant aspiration to exercise independence.\n60.\tOn 16 August of this year, in compliance with the people's will and the constitutional rules in force, His Excellency Don Antonio Guzman assumed the responsibilities of the President of all Dominicans. On that memorable occasion the highest official of our nation dearly and precisely gave us the guidelines of his Government. I cannot fail to mention those which refer to compliance with the general principles of public international law: respect for the sanctity of international treaties and conventions and for the rules governing the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies, as well as respect for the Organization of American States [OAS], from which is derived the legal system of our region and its organic institutions and, in general, the interdependence of States; regional and worldwide solidarity; co-operation and peaceful coexistence, as one of the most effective means of maintaining peace and eliminating the scourge of war.\n61.\tTo that is added the conviction of the President that international relations must be conducted within the framework of equality and mutual respect; that peaceful procedures must be followed for the settlement of disputes and international controversies; that social progress and the economic development of peoples are indivisible and that from this is derived the natural obligation of the developed nations, and particularly the industrialized nations, to give financial and technological assistance to the developing countries so as to eradicate the economic inequalities that are the cause of international tensions and conflicts.\n62.\tThe Government of the Dominican Republic also has its interest directed towards the third world, the non- aligned countries and, furthermore, all those with which we have not yet established normal relations. The Government is paying particular attention to solutions that will bring about greater closeness in accordance with the fact of the interdependence of States. Finally, it advocates the reaffirmation of the democratic system characterized by the principle that sovereignty resides in the people, from which it follows in our times that political pluralism must be a genuine expression of that sovereign power guaranteed by the right to vote.\n63.\tTo all nations represented here I transmit, through their delegations, this message from the Government of the Dominican Republic, which is now entering upon a new cycle of conceptual evolution and perspectives for exemplary progress with the support of legitimate institutions and prompted by an unwavering will to serve the most sacred public interest and the aspirations of all Dominicans.\n64.\tAll countries on earth should join the United Nations in celebrating at the highest level the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. One of the most solemn and constructive ways to celebrate the occasion would be to establish educational programmes incorporating at least progressive ideas on the subject, which must be related to humanistic disciplines later to be received in university centres. If this were to lead to specialization and dissemination schemes, the time would come when what we call Utopia, in which man himself would be the possessor of international human rights, would be transformed from a dream into a universal reality.\n65.\tWe are convinced that human rights represent the genuine and common heritage of mankind and, because it is indivisible and one of solidarity, violations in one country have repercussions in others.\n66.\tFor that reason, and because we shall be celebrating yet another anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I cannot fail to mention the intention of the Head of State of the Dominican Republic strictly to apply in our country the precepts and rules enshrined in those rights in the Dominican Republic as the principal obligation of the State. And in order to ensure strict respect for these rights, a draft of a law setting up a court of constitutional guarantees is to be submitted to the National Congress.\n67.\tI must now refer specifically to the fact that, within the context of the vigorous policy of the defence of human rights, the National Congress of my country has just approved a law granting general amnesty to persons imprisoned for political acts related to political breaches of the peace or political motives, and even those for which the legal description is doubtful.\n68.\tWe share the view that it is urgent to study the relationship that may exist between civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, and that Governments must advocate these investigations which are so important for making progress on a subject that is causing concern in areas in conflict. For similar reasons, we share the view that we must define distinctive types of breaches which by their nature constitute violations of human rights.\n69.\tWe also believe that it is desirable that the system of imprisonment for political crimes and breaches of the peace in their three distinctive aspects should be made more humane so that the applicable punishments shall take into account the recommendations of modern criminology.\n70.\tWe are convinced that human rights are profoundly rooted in the Four Freedoms formulated by President\nRoosevelt in 1941 before the Congress of the United States of America, when the repercussions of the world conflagration was being felt in all parts of the world.\n71.\tThat instrument advocates freedom of speech and expression; freedom of every man to worship God; freedom from hunger and freedom to live free from poverty, which presumes economic assistance guaranteeing the right to live for all the inhabitants of the earth; and freedom from fear, which would obviously mean a world review of armaments so that no nation would be able indiscriminately to stockpile arms with the risk of unleashing the scourge of war with catastrophic results.\n72.\tThe mobilization of the world conscience so as to make human rights effective, which has lately been making itself felt with admirable impetus, therefore gives rise to a new source of wisdom and of humanity in the formulation of those Four Freedoms.\n73.\tThe delegation of the Dominican Republic to the seventh regular session of the General Assembly of the OAS, which was held at Grenada from 14 to 22 June 1977, maintained a position consistent with that of the Government of the United States of America on the subject, which is to be found in inter-American instruments and also forms part of the structures of this world Organization.\n74.\tPeace, that noble aspiration of the human spirit, which has not yet been fully attained, must be the fundamental goal of all Governments on earth, particularly today when the statistics of international specialized agencies forecast more than 6 billion inhabitants of the globe at the end of the present century. And it is logical to think that, unless traditional methods are changed\u2014methods which have proved ineffective to ensure survival and education for mankind today\u2014it will be difficult to face the grave problems of the future in a world becoming smaller in space and in resources.\n75.\tIt is up to all nations, and particularly those responsible for the balance of power, to overcome differences of frontiers and ideologies so that, in solidarity, they will find definite solutions to the lack of education, food and housing, problems which increasingly weigh on the destiny of man. To this end it is essential to consolidate universal peace, that divine gift which man has denied himself and for which this Organization has always striven since it came into being in 1945, representing in sum mankind's greatest ideals.\n76.\tThe Head of State of the Dominican Republic is particularly interested in making the economy more dynamic so as to increase the well-being of the entire population, and to attain that objective he intends to broaden the domestic market and firmly to promote exports so ns to create demand for our national products. And yet all these domestic efforts intended to bring about a healthy economy, mobilize local resources, capitalize the State enterprises, stimulate the agricultural sector and improve public services require international conditions which will not have a negative effect on the efforts which our Government intends to make in the next four years.\n77.\tAlong the same line of thinking we must recall the need to be able to rely upon stable prices for sugar at the world level. Sudden fluctuations in the price of this product in the free market have caused enormous harm to countries which have considerable exportable surpluses. Our Government therefore urges that all countries which signed the International Sugar Agreement, 1977, but which have not yet ratified it to proceed to do so in order to create stability and order in the market.\n78.\tIn broadening the basis of international co-operation in every field among the great Powers and relatively less developed countries it is necessary to reach agreement on multinational financial and economic matters and to give effect to that agreement as soon as possible. This re list no longer be delayed. It is totally impossible to maintain international relations on a basis of constructive international co-operation which will be broader and more open to all States Members of the United Nations as long as we have no world food authority to deal with the basic problems of feeding the world's population. In Latin American countries, according to ECLA data, 110 million people live in a state of acute poverty. We can no longer escape the need to create an international organization which would give scientific and technological guidelines to all countries, particularly the less developed.\n79.\tA fund for the stabilization of raw materials prices, which has so often been discussed in UNCTAD but still has not come into being, can no longer await agreements for financing for the benefit of both rich and poor countries alike because of the degree of interdependence of the international economy. Many decisions are yet to be taken at a world level for the stabilization of trade relations, for the joint exploitation of the resources of the sea, for a more just and equitable distribution of the financial burden for development, and for the formulation of policies to achieve international monetary stability and to prevent serious fluctuations in the balance of payments such as have occurred recently, and for the adoption of many other measures which could give an impetus for mankind to bring about a better world under the rule of peace and peaceful coexistence.\n82. The Dominican Republic condemns the use of violence wherever it occurs, because this is one of the major obstacles preventing the world of today from being able to live in peace, which is the ultimate goal of the Uniter1 Nations.\n83.\tFor these reasons we praise the studies made by the competent international organizations to outlaw, in so far as is humanly possible, that enemy of peace and of human progress.\n84.\tThose convictions have led my country to welcome with pleasure the efforts made during the Bonn Economic Summit Conference in July to implement the anti-piracy Convention adopted at The Hague in 1970  and to provide procedures for imposing sanctions on countries which refuse to try or extradite air pirates or to return hijacked aircraft.\n85.\tWe also favour finding more effective methods to discourage the taking of hostages, which is so often an attack on innocent persons, since this evil is on the increase, as is clear from the events which have so disturbed the international community.\n86.\tWe also favour a truce in international tensions which could pave the way to the solution of problems which exist in areas of conflict such as the Middle East. For that conflict, new, correct and honourable guidelines seem to have been found on a footing of equality and mutual respect, to dispel distrust and bring about renewed goodwill, without which understanding among men and nations is not possible.\n87.\tThe dilemma in which we find ourselves leads us to recall a similar situation of conflict in the Republic of France, when Talleyrand, having been recalled for consultation after his dismissal, replied to the words of the Great Corsican, \\\"Negotiate, while you can still negotiate.\\\"\n88.\tIn brief, those are the guidelines of the international policy of my country on the grave problems afflicting the States which compose this world Organization. This represents the thinking of His Excellency the President of the Republic, Mr. Antonio Guzman.\n89.\tOn this occasion, more than on any other we can speak with the firmness given to peoples by their consciousness of what is true, genuine and just. With the election to the presidency of the Republic of His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guzman, and with the peaceful transfer of presidential power, the time has come when, for the good of the democratic world and for our own good, the Dominican Republic must definitively be considered as a State where representative democracy really prevails.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff149.\tMr. President, it is with a deep sense of satisfaction that the Ethiopian delegation congratulates you on your assumption of the presidency of the thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. Our satisfaction emanates from the fact that you bring to this office wide and varied experience. The Ethiopian delegation would like to assure you of its full co-operation in the discharge of your heavy responsibilities.\n150.\tI' should like also to express the sincere thanks and appreciation of my delegation to Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who so ably and tirelessly conducted to a successful conclusion a record number of sessions of the General Assembly during the last 12 months.\n151.\tWe are happy to note that Solomon Islands has acceded to independence. While welcoming it to the international community of sovereign nations, I should like to reiterate my Government's hope that its independence will give further impetus to the full and speedy decolonization of the remaining Territories in Africa and around the globe.\n152.\tIt is with mixed feelings that I venture to review the current international situation. I say \\\"mixed feelings\\\" because we feel that while on the one hand humanity has succeeded in bringing to fruition the results of its valiant struggle, it has on the other hand witnessed the frustration of some of its cherished hopes. The unfolding process of history teaches us that even though ultimate victory over the forces of domination, exploitation and expansion is imminent, that glorious victory cannot be won except with immense sacrifices in blood and sweat. The current world situation is the epitome of the struggle between the old and dying forces of domination, exploitation and expansion on the one side and the new and emergent forces of peace, progress, justice and socialism on the other.\n153.\tDuring the last 12 months the world political scene has been dominated by an intensified struggle against imperialism, colonialism. Zionism, racism, apartheid and expansionism in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The attempt by some Powers to dominate the Red Sea and restrict international navigation, the continued aggression and economic blockade against revolutionary Cuba and the forceful occupation of Guantanamo, the campaign of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for a massive arms build-up, international reaction in Asia with its expansionist and hegemonistic designs of \\\"big country\\\" chauvinism propagating the inevitability of war\u2014these are but some of the salient features.\n154.\tInternational imperialism has over the past year unleashed a campaign of terror and destruction around the globe in order to halt the gradual diminution of its domain and to regain its already lost positions. As we all know, that campaign is most actively pursued in, and most intensely focused on, the African continent. That is not without its reasons. With the collapse of the Portuguese colonial empire in Africa, a number of progressive and socialist States, such as Angola and Mozambique, have emerged on the African political scene. Also, genuine and popular revolutions have taken deep roots among the African masses. To say the least, these new developments seriously worry imperialism and its surrogates; and naturally enough, propelled by their desperation and bolstered by the vast economic and financial power at their disposal, they have already launched their offensive. Their strategy varies from direct military intervention to covert subversion, from open interference in the internal affairs of others to subtle psychological warfare.\n155.\tWhat these decadent forces did not foresee and expect in their adventure was the gallant and determined resistance of the revolutionary forces in Africa and also the equally determined international assistance and solidarity extended to those forces by the socialist community and by peoples that love peace and freedom all over the world. Imperialism, which, as the instigator of counter-revolution and the provider of its arsenal, has for years with impunity been rushing its marines, special units, agents, legionnaires and mercenaries into the different parts of the globe to crush popular uprisings and prop up corrupt and decadent regimes, has started to cry \\\"foreign intervention\\\" in Africa. Except for some of the shameless surrogates of imperialism, Africans have not been impressed; nor can they ever be. In fact, Africa has made its unswerving position amply clear by roundly condemning all these neo-colonial intrigues, in particular, the attempts by imperialism to establish what it has arrogantly called \\\"a pan-African force\\\".\n156.\tDespite grim short-term prospects, in the long term the balance of forces favours those who champion the causes of freedom, peace, equality and progress; so the future is bright. Yet, in the wake of its retreat, imperialism has already left, and will continue to leave until its final demise, colossal destruction in terms of both human life and material wealth. Ethiopia's experience since the onset of its revolution four years ago clearly illustrates that fact. I wish to refer to some of the sinister machinations and glaring injustices perpetrated against my country by imperialism and the forces of reaction.\n\n157.\tDisturbed by the achievements of the Ethiopian revolution, imperialism and the forces of reaction in our region spared no effort to foil the revolutionary process in Ethiopia. The methods used ranged from subtle ways of undermining our social, economic and political life to launching an open war of aggression and occupation Imperialism and the forces of reaction tried to .subvert our national unity and to violate the territorial integrity of our motherland. They organized, financed and armed runaway feudal elements, members of the corrupt aristocracy and disgruntled bureaucrats to invade Ethiopia from the west. They also financed and armed a pseudo-revolutionary anarchist group to sabotage the economy, to assassinate genuine revolutionaries and to create general chaos and instability in the country. In their bid to reverse the popular revolution these tools of imperialism and reaction launched their attacks in a co-ordinated and complementary manner. Yet the invasion from the west was repelled and the subversion from within was crushed. This aspect of our revolutionary struggle has entailed enormous sacrifices.\n158.\tThe greatest danger to our revolution and territorial integrity, however, came from the naked aggression committed by Somalia\u2014an aggression planned, financed and instigated by imperialism and reaction.\n159.\tDuring the general debate at the thirty-second session of the General Assembly  the Ethiopian delegation explained in detail the real causes of, and the forces behind, that aggression. It is with a sense of satisfaction that my delegation today informs the General Assembly that the gallant sons and daughters of Ethiopia, rallying behind the national motto \\\"Revolutionary Motherland or Death\\\" have repelled the aggression and have administered an ignominious defeat to the invading forces of Somalia. The invading forces have, however, left their heavy destructive imprint on eastern Ethiopia. Thousands of defenceless and innocent civilians have been indiscriminately slaughtered by Somalia's army. Thousands more have been left destitute. Whole villages and towns have been razed to the ground. Nearly all development projects have been destroyed. Schools, hospitals, bridges, farms, power plants and even United Nations- financed settlement projects for nomads were not spared. Subsequently the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, in his appeal for international assistance, stated:\n\\\"In response to the appeal of the Ethiopian Government, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees sent a senior officer to Ethiopia who, together with the Regional Liaison Officer of the UNHCR in Addis Ababa, participated in a mission organized by the Government of Ethiopia to some of the areas affected by the conflict\tThe Mission was able to witness extensive\ndestruction and damage to public buildings such as schools, hospitals, power stations, telecommunications, bridges, etc....\\\".\n160.\tFurthermore, UNESCO's Liaison Officer to Ethiopia, the OAU and ECA observed:\n\\\"I was very anxious to see Gode. UNESCO and UNICEF have been closely involved in projects for settlers in that area. For us, it was a very depressing experience to see what had happened. Most of the buildings in the area had been destroyed. Equipment and vehicles had been wrecked and schools had been blown up.\\\"\nFor those who may not be familiar with the area, Gode is the district where over 80,000 nomadic families were settled with the assistance of the international community.\n161.\tThese dastardly acts illustrate not only the magnitude of the heinous crimes committed against the population of Ethiopia but above all the perfidy of the regime in Somalia and its avowed claim that the population of the region are its kith and kin.\n162.\tAnd yet the authorities in Somalia, who are never tired of engaging in double-talk and whose notorious credibility gap only increases with each passing day, in February 1978 informed the world that they were sheltering 30,000 so-called refugees from Ethiopia. Then the figure was raised, and now we are told that there are half a million. At this rate one should not be surprised if in time the entire population of Somalia is considered to be refugees from Ethiopia. The fact of the matter is that, because of the disastrous consequences of the aggression it committed against Ethiopia, Somalia has been forced to establish a series of relief camps for the benefit of its own retreating soldiers and needy nationals and has with characteristic cynicism declared its own citizens to be refugees from Ethiopia. My delegation categorically rejects this preposterous-claim and has informed the United Nations High Commissioner accordingly.\n163.\tToday the broad masses of Ethiopia have come a long way in foiling many of the imperialist conspiracies and breaking up the vicious reactionary encirclement. In this regard, the support rendered to Ethiopia by the socialist countries, particularly the USSR and Cuba, to help it to repel foreign aggression has greatly contributed to the strengthening of the cardinal principle of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States enshrined in the charters of the United Nations and the OAU. In the event of an armed aggression the legitimate right of any State to resort to any measure, including the right of individual and collective self-defence in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, cannot be questioned. This right has also been reaffirmed by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU meeting in Khartoum and by the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries meeting in Belgrade. Indeed, in the course of the current general debate, many representatives, including those of the permanent members of the Security Council, have clearly upheld that inalienable right. Viewed against this background, the hue and cry over alleged Soviet and Cuban intervention in the Morn of Africa is, to say the least, hypocritical.\n164.\tOn the other hand, during these past years of struggle, Ethiopia has lost thousands of its brave sons and daughters. Much of its material wealth and infrastructure worth hundreds of millions of dollars has been destroyed, for which it demands prompt and adequate compensation.\n165.\tThe root-cause of the instability and insecurity in our region is Somalia's expansionist policy. Obsessed by a lust for other people's land, and victim of the imperialist- conceived plot called \\\"Greater Somalia\\\", the Mogadishu regime has taken the law into its own hands and has embarked upon conquest and expansion at the expense of all its neighbours. So long as Somalia refuses to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbours, so long as it continues its adventurist and expansionist policy, peace and stability in the area will continue to be elusive.\n166.\tThe Ethiopian revolution has now been consolidated. The fourth anniversary of our revolution, celebrated last month, is sufficient testimony to its popular character and the mass support it enjoys. The countries of the region, including Somalia, have much to gain through co-operation rather than confrontation. In this context I should like to quote from the recent statement made by Comrade Lt. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, Chairman of the Provisional Military Administrative Council and the Council of Ministers, and Commander-in-Chief of the Revolutionary Army of Socialist Ethiopia, who said:\n\\\"Revolutionary Ethiopia will maintain its relationship with all countries of the world with different social systems and strengthen its solidarity with the socialist, progressive and democratic forces. In this connexion, Ethiopia would like to make clear its strong desire to have close co-operation and live in peace with the neighbouring countries.\\\"\n167.\tEthiopia has embarked on a broad national campaign, not only to reconstruct its war-ravaged economy, but also to raise the quality of life and ensure the social justice won by the Ethiopian masses through their popular revolution. Despite the pressures and acts of foreign aggression that have forced us to divert scarce resources for tlis purpose of defence, in the last four years of our revolution much has been accomplished in the social, economic, cultural and administrative fields. In the years to come we intend to accomplish more. In this worthy venture we invite and whole-heartedly welcome ail International assistance on the basis of equality, non-interference and respect for national sovereignty.\n168.\tOn the global level there are still a number of pressing problems for which the international community has yet to find lasting solutions.\n169.\tThe conflict in southern Africa had long reached crisis proportions. In their vain attempt to perpetuate the abhorrent systems of colonialism, neo-colonialism racism and apartheid, the racist minority regimes and their North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies have now intensified their brutal repression, exploitation and mass extermination of the African population in South Africa, Namibia and\nZimbabwe. They have increased the frequency of their ever more aggressive and provocative attacks against the neighbouring independent African States of Angola, Zambia, Mozambique and Botswana. Those repeated acts of armed intervention are designed to destabilize the Governments in the region and convert the area into a safe haven for exploitation and racial domination.\n170.\tApartheid is a hideous crime against humanity. It is the epitome of a racially organized violence, symbolizing the most flagrant contempt for human rights. It can thus be sustained only by the brutality of the repressive machinery in' the hands of the illegal racist regimes and their imperialist allies. Along with the racist minority regimes, international imperialism and reaction are actively pitting one African State against another and sowing the seeds of discord among the peoples of Africa to facilitate the attainment of their sinister designs and thereby to weaken Africa's resolve to remain free, strong, independent and united. Under the guise of \\\"proposals for peaceful settlement\\\", the leading Western Powers are feverishly engaged in manoeuvres to perpetuate their positions of privilege as the perennial overlords of the continent and to legitimize colonial and racist domination in yet a new way.\n171.\tIt is therefore incumbent upon free Africa and, indeed, all peoples of the world which love freedom find peace, to intensify their support to, and solidarity with, the freedom fighters of southern Africa in the latter's bid to oust racist South Africa from Namibia and remove the illegal regime of Ian Smith from Zimbabwe. SWAPO and the Patriotic Front, as the sole and authentic representatives of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe respectively, must be given all requisite assistance to achieve those legitimate goals.\n172.\tThe so-called Anglo-American proposal for the peaceful settlement of the Rhodesian question has failed; and the fact that the United States Government has permitted Ian Smith to come to its capital is an affront to the international community, shows contempt for Africans and is a clear violation of the United Nations Charter, as well as of decisions of its principal organs. My delegation therefore strongly condemns this wilful disregard of the wishes of the international community. Let me also underscore that Ethiopia categorically rejects all the sinister schemes that are being hatched to perpetuate imperialism in southern Africa.\n173.\tWhile discussing the colonial situation in Africa, one cannot fail to mention the courageous armed struggle of the people of Western Sahara. In our view, their legitimate aspirations for self-determination in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) should no longer be thwarted.\n174.\tThe situation in the Middle East has continued to deteriorate as a result of the arrogant refusal by the forces of aggression, occupation and expansion to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions. Repeated acts of aggression against the Arab peoples have been paralleled only by newer and ever more insidious manoeuvres to procrastinate and further complicate a solution to the Middle East conflict.\n175.\tLast year most of the leaders of delegations to the thirty-second session of the General Assembly welcomed the joint Soviet-American statement of 1 October 1977. It was genuinely believed that the joint statement afforded realistic opportunities for reconvening the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East in which all parties to the conflict could be involved. However, since then the world has witnessed the most dramatic surrender to the forces of aggression and expansion, m well as capitulation to imperialist domination.\n176.\tEthiopia supports all meaningful efforts designed to remove the consequences of aggression and ensure the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The Government of Ethiopia firmly believes that Israel must unconditionally withdraw from all Arab territories occupied since June 1967, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. We are also convinced that no accord can be just and lasting unless it takes into full cognisance the rights of the Palestinian people to establish their own national homeland under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole spokesman and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n177.\tIn our view, the Camp David agreements are nothing but a sophisticated imperialist plot designed to exacerbate further the already difficult and complex situation in the Middle East, Our conviction in this respect is clearly borne out by the latest developments in Lebanon.\n178.\tAnother deplorable situation which falls within the Middle eastern parameter and deserves serious international concern is the question of non-aligned Cyprus. While giving its full support to the demilitarization of the island, as proposed by the President of Cyprus, my delegation calls upon the Security Council to effect a speedy implementation of the pertinent United Nations resolutions on the question of Cyprus.\n179.\tMy delegation supports the triumphant revolution of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and condemns all attempts to obstruct the legitimate aspirations of the people of Yemen for unity, peace and progress.\n180.\tEthiopia not only supports the popular revolution of Afghanistan but also strongly condemns the mischief of the architects of decay who are attempting to pressure' the long-oppressed, exploited, but none the less heroic people of that fraternal country.\n181.\tIt is gratifying to note that the courageous peoples of Viet Nam and Laos, who for decades heroically struggled against the crudest form of imperialist intervention and domination, have now embarked on the heavy task of socialist reconstruction. Though peace is a prerequisite for such an endeavour, expansionist and chauvinistic forces, in collaboration with international imperialism, are creating strife and instability in the region by attempting to implement their long-standing hegemonistic ambitions. These are the same reactionary forces which, in alliance with imperialism, have instigated and supported aggressions against progressive Governments in Africa. We express our solidarity with the people of Viet Nam in their struggle to safeguard the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of their country.\n182.\tThe Government of the United States, which has made itself the self-appointed policeman of the world and the \\\"custodian\\\" of human rights, is never tired of pontificating over alleged foreign intervention in Africa. Yet it conveniently forgets the presence of its 3,000 military bases and hundreds of thousands of its troops around the globe. The Government of the United States continues deliberately to distort the facts by talking about Cuban presence in Ethiopia. It so happens that Cubans are in Ethiopia at the express request of the Ethiopian Government, whereas the presence of American forces in Cuba is against the expressed wish and desire of the Cuban people. We reaffirm our militant solidarity with Cuba and demand an end to the continued aggression and economic blockade against Cuba, as well as the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of American forces from the base at Guantanamo. The Government of the United States must pay adequate compensation for its aggression against Cuba.\n183.\tMy delegation whole-heartedly supports the struggle of the people of Latin America for social justice and freedom from imperialist subjugation and exploitation.\n184.\tIt has long been recognized that international peace and security, disarmament and development are interrelated. One of the forces in the contemporary world which have consistently championed the strengthening of international peace and security, steady progress towards meaningful disarmament measures, international detente and the acceleration of development efforts has obviously been the movement of the non-aligned countries. Yet imperialism has been making strenuous efforts to divide the movement. As evidenced at the Belgrade Conference of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, imperialism has been unsuccessful in its divisive manoeuvres. We are confident that the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, to be held in Havana next year, will further strengthen the unity and solidarity of its members. The fact that this meeting is to take place in Havana is a recognition of Cuba's outstanding contributions to strengthening the movement and a fitting tribute to the remarkable revolutionary role Cuba continues to play in the awakening and liberation of the oppressed masses.\n185.\tThe initiative the non-aligned movement has taken in the field of disarmament has made possible for the first time the most serious consideration of disarmament problems by the General Assembly of the United Nations. The results of the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, as embodied in the Final Document adopted by it [resolution S-10/2], have laid the foundation for a new approach to the hitherto difficult issues of disarmament. The creation of a more democratic framework for deliberations and negotiations on disarmament issues and the greater role and responsibility recognized for the United Nations in future disarmament efforts are, in our view, some of the highly positive results of the special session. Other positive steps taken by the special session which deserve special mention include the establishment of priorities for disarmament negotiations.\n186.\tHowever, it must be emphasized that the results achieved with regard to other substantive matters leave much to be desired. This was so not only because the special session was convened at a time when the colonialist and imperialist attack on detente reached a new level of intensity but also because it has taken place precisely when some frantic moves were under way in certain leading Western capitals to revive the cold war, thereby gravely impeding the global struggle for detente and disarmament. Actually, at that time the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was holding a summit meeting, regrettably, not to discuss disarmament but rather to evolve new plans for increasing its military build-up. The 10-point programme adopted by that summit meeting provides for the joint production of 15 new types of sea and land-based missiles and earmarks an additional $80 billion to be spent in the next 10 years on more than 100 new programmes of armament. A manifestation of the unlimited imperialist hypocrisy is the agreement to increase further the military presence of the Pentagon in Western Europe, while talks were in progress in Vienna on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe.\n187.\tThe massive military build-up and the intensification of the arms race by the imperialist Powers and reactionary forces are not limited to the confines of Europe, where the alleged Soviet threat provides a convenient smoke-screen, but are being extended to Africa, where attempts are made at frustrating the struggle of the African people against exploitation, domination and human degradation by hysterical and hypocritical cries of Soviet intervention in Africa.\n188.\tNevertheless, the special session devoted to disarmament has succeeded at least in identifying the forces of peace, freedom and independence, on the one hand, and the proponents of the arms race and brinkmanship, on the other. These two camps represent the forces at work between disarmament and catastrophe, but the overwhelming majority of the international community has clearly chosen the former.\n189.\t1 have already mentioned the fact that international security and disarmament are inseparable. To achieve genuine disarmament, we must enhance international security. Fortunately, there are already a number of proposals before this Assembly in that respect. The non-use of force in international relations, the provision of adequate guarantees to non-nuclear-weapon countries and the urgent convening of a world disarmament conference are only a few examples. To these constructive proposals, which have been presented to the General Assembly by the Government of the USSR and the socialist community of States, Ethiopia gives its full support and it hopes that concrete action will be taken on them during the current session.\n190.\tAnother important and difficult question before the international community today is that relating to the law of the sea. Although significant progress has been made so far towards the elaboration of an internationally acceptable convention, there are still a number of extremely difficult issues, particularly those relating to the international sea-bed area, that remain to be resolved. The tendency in some industrialized capitalist countries to adopt unilateral legislation on deep sea-bed mining not only is a clear contravention of the decision of the General Assembly but could also frustrate the efforts of the international community to adopt a comprehensive treaty on the law of the sea. We therefore appeal to those States which are in the process of adopting unilateral measures to desist from such a course of action.\n191.\tMy delegation regrets to note that the implementation of the United Nations Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] has not made notable progress so far. While the Ad Hoc Committee established for the purpose continues to make every effort to discharge its duties, the imperialist Powers have been expanding their military facilities in Diego Garcia and Reunion island and increasing their military presence in the ocean itself. Since these activities are contrary to the declared objectives of the international community, Ethiopia demands the immediate dismantling of their military facilities and an end to their military presence in conformity with the Declaration.\n192.\tThe attempt by some reactionary Governments in the area of the Red Sea to convert that international waterway into an exclusive Arab lake is also a matter of serious concern. Ethiopia considers that the preservation of the international character of the Red Sea and respect for the legitimate interests of the littoral States, as well as the guaranteeing of free navigation in accordance with established international law and practice, are of paramount importance to the entire world community.\n193.\tOver the years, this Assembly has come to accept the proposition that co-operation among nations is indispensable if mankind is to survive and progress. Acceptance of this thesis, however, has not been accompanied by the kind of co-operative undertaking necessary for the solution of economic and social problems which beset two-thirds of mankind today. It is rather tragic to observe that in this era of technological miracles the international community has failed to provide for the minimum needs of nearly half of humanity. Despite lofty pronouncements often made by the industrialized nations promising to respond to the plight of the poorer countries, the disquieting gap in living standards between the rich and the poor is still growing wider.\n194.\tThe difficulties of some developing countries have been further aggravated by natural calamities which play havoc with the lives of our peoples. The Sahelian region of Africa and my own country have suffered and still continue to suffer from severe food shortages caused by successive years of drought. This problem has been compounded, in the case of my country, by the recent invasion and destruction of crops by swarms of locusts.\n195.\tThe humanitarian response that we have received from the international community has been encouraging. I take this opportunity to express from this rostrum my country's deep appreciation and gratitude to those friendly nations and to the intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations that have assisted us. Viewed against the magnitude of the problem, however, the relief aid extended to us from international sources falls far short of the amount needed to cope with the situation. To cope with the problem it is estimated that at least 250,000 tons of food assistance are required. Since Ethiopia's own capacity effectively to combat this natural calamity is limited, we trust that the international community will be more forthcoming in its response.\n196.\tWe in Ethiopia are carrying out basic and fundamental structural changes in all fields of social and economic endeavour. But to the extent that the domestic structure has its external dimensions and until and unless corresponding improvements are made in the international structure, appreciable headway is unlikely to be made in accelerating social and economic transformation within cur respective countries.\n197.\tDespite the adoption of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order[resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)] and the consensus of the seventh special session [resolution 3362 (S-VII)], very little has been achieved in concrete terms to meet the pressing needs of the developing world and almost nothing to rectify then- underlying causes. It is therefore candid to admit that the Second Development Decade has largely been a decade of frustrated hopes, especially for the poorer of the developing countries. That the policies of the majority of the developed countries have registered a regression also appears to us to be a matter of fact.\n198.\tOfficial development assistance levels have been frozen at less than half the agreed target. The distribution of international financial reserves still remains as inequitable as before, and the trend toward protectionism in the developed countries is becoming more pronounced than ever.\n199.\tAs I said earlier, we cannot realistically speak about economic growth and development, even less hope to find just and equitable solutions of the ills of underdevelopment, unless the problem is seen in the context of the need to build a new global structure of economic relationships. Evidently, the present world economic order is incapable of redressing the inequality that exists between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\". As long as there is no change in the basic structures, all our development efforts will be frustrated. What is really required now is not the patching up of the existing order through temporary measures, but rather the making of structural changes that are based on equality and justice.\n200.\tWe believe that the time has come for the international community to adopt a global approach to economic problems. It should draw up a coherent, comprehensive and massive programme for the development of the world economy as a whole and the establishment of the New International Economic Order.\n201.\tWe believe that the problem of the least developed countries should be given sufficient attention and due priority in the new development strategy, as well as in the various international negotiations currently under way to establish the New International Economic Order. \n202.\tMy delegation is convinced also that an equitable world economic order can be based only on an equitable economic system within each nation. We in the developing world therefore, no less than the developed countries, must reduce, and if possible eliminate, the gap between the privileged few and the masses. Ethiopia, being unswervingly committed to the earliest achievement of social justice at the national level, cannot but lend its strongest support to the attainment of similar world-wide objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff61.\tI take pleasure at the outset in extending to the President of the General Assembly, on behalf of the delegation of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, our congratulations on his election to preside over the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. I am confident that, under his leadership at this session, the Assembly will go a long way towards realizing the aims and aspirations of the peoples of the international community who struggled hard for the establishment of this international Organization in the hope that it would become a means to achieving justice, establishing peace and to putting an end to the injustice, colonialism and oppression which have plagued mankind.\n\n62.\tI cannot but express to his predecessor, Mr. Mojsov, the gratitude and appreciation of the delegation of the Jamahiriya for all the efforts he exerted in pushing the Organization one step forward towards the attainment of those same objectives.\n63.\tMy delegation would also like to extend its congratulations to Solomon Islands on the attainment of its independence and to welcome it to membership in the United Nations. We are confident that that young State, together with the other countries of the third world and this world Organization, will contribute actively to serving the human race.\n64.\tIt is also gratifying for the delegation of my country to see the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, continuing to discharge his responsibilities successfully and with a high degree of efficiency and the utmost dedication and impartiality. Despite all the difficulties that he has encountered he has, through the years spent at the head of this international Organization, been able to achieve a great deal. On behalf of my country, I assure him of our full backing and support in the performance of his noble tasks and reiterate our complete endorsement of the efforts he exerts in the service of mankind through this world Organization.\n65.\tMore than 32 years have elapsed since the establishment of this Organization and the signing of its Charter. No one doubts that it has done and achieved a great deal in the attainment of its objectives under the Charter to which our States and peoples have subscribed. Yet, despite all its achievements, whether in the area of international peace, in the field of decolonization or in the economic realm, one quick look at the current international situation confirms to us all that the delight of the peoples of the world with the establishment of this Organization is beginning to give way to despair and that pessimism is replacing optimism in the face of the serious events that the international community is experiencing.\n66.\tWe ask, and appropriately. What is the role of this Organization and what is its future? Or, conversely, what are the reasons for its failure to achieve peace and the freedom of oppressed peoples in many parts of the world? Why has prosperity not been achieved by the peoples of the international community in a just way instead of there being increased poverty and misery in many parts of the world and increased prosperity in others, at the expense of the peoples of the world? The question is whether the fault lies with the Organization and its inability to face up to international events by achieving its objectives and implementing its Charter, or whether it is due to the non- adherence of States, and in particular the major colonial Powers, to the Charter and objectives of the Organization, except to the extent that this satisfies their greed and helps in their exploitation of the peoples of the world. The answer is self-evident: the powers of evil, as represented by imperialism, colonialism, exploitation and monopoly, are the main reasons behind all the tragedies and wars that the world faces. The United Nations is but another victim of those powers, much as is the case with the poorer countries and weaker peoples.\n67.\tA quick glance at the current international scene will confirm the seriousness of this situation and the possibility of war inherent in it. The continued existence of such hotbeds of war, though now limited to certain parts of the world and contained as a result of the powers of terror and doom, will eventually lead to an over-all general war, the victim of which will be the whole human race,\n68.\tThanks to the struggle of peoples, the emergence of national liberation movements, the political struggle within the United Nations and its decolonization efforts, colonialism has begun to see the end of an unfortunate and painful era, its own, and is today making a desperate attempt to preserve its domination and its monopolistic, exploitative corporations in various parts of the world, even though that could cause the total destruction of the human race.\n69.\tThe Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, being part of the African continent as well as part of the Arab homeland, its people being connected with both the Mediterranean and the peoples of the third world, is devoted to this Organization and to its objectives and principles. In fulfilment of its responsibilities to the international community as a whole, the peoples of Africa, the Arab homeland and the third world in particular, it cannot but face the truth and state in all candour its opinion that the deteriorating situation in the African continent is a result, as is apparent to all, of the recent direct acts of colonialist intervention and the existence of racist regimes which perpetrate acts of aggression against the peoples of that continent and continue to violate the principles of this Organization and its Charter and to disregard human rights, in pursuit of racist policies.\n70.\tThere is no doubt that much has been achieved in recent years by the peoples of the African continent in the field of national liberation and the independence of peoples. However, that prompted imperialism and colonialism to attempt to re-impose their domination and control by resorting to unethical means, ranging from the political assassination of African leaders to the use of white mercenaries to overthrow progressive Governments\u2014whose only crime was trying to raise the standard of their peoples and to pursue a policy that served the interests of their peoples\u2014and ending with military intervention and with the use of armed force in order to re-impose colonialism on the peoples of the continent.\n71.\tThe presence of the racist regimes in Rhodesia, South Africa and Namibia and their persistence in pursuing a policy of suppression, mass extermination and violation of human rights would not have happened or continued but for the support they receive from the imperialist and Western colonialist Powers, led by the United States of America. The soothing attempts made by the major colonialist Powers, in particular the' United States, by proclaiming policies purportedly designed to help the peoples of those countries will not deceive us Africans. Nor will they, I believe, deceive this Assembly or the peoples of the international community. Our peoples cannot forget that it was colonialism that created those regimes and that it was colonialism that helped them, and is still helping them, to survive by supplying them with lethal weapons and providing them with various kinds of aid and assistance. Colonialism, therefore, cannot be a mediator but is rather a direct enemy of the African peoples.\n72.\tThe solution of the Namibian problem lies only in enabling the Namibian people, under the leadership of their national movement SWAPO, to attain independence fully and speedily. The continued attempts of the racist regime in South Africa to hinder the efforts of the United Nations and the OAU in this respect are something for which the Western colonialist Powers, which created and continue to assist that racist regime, should be held responsible. Also not unconnected with those colonialist Powers is the continued presence of the racist regime in Zimbabwe\u2014that of Ian Smith. There again the only solution lies in supporting the people of Zimbabwe, under the leadership of the Patriotic Front, in their legitimate struggle for independence and the elimination of that abhorrent racist regime. The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, being a part of the African continent, emphasizes its determination to continue to provide all peoples under the domination of racist regimes with every possible kind of support until those regimes are liquidated.\n73.\tThe colonialist attempts at intrigue aimed at changing the course of history, together with their use of political stratagems designed to weaken the national liberation movements in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia, will only end in failure similar to that experienced by colonialism in Angola, Mozambique and other parts of the continent. Such attempts by the colonialist Powers or their direct military intervention in the continent will only increase the determination of our peoples in Africa to fight until the last bastions of colonialism and colonialist monopolies vanish. This fact has been confirmed by the resolutions of the OAU Assembly in Khartoum [see Af33/235 and Corr. l]. Thus all the attempts by colonialism to sow seeds of dissension and discord among\nAfrican States or to create alliances loyal to it failed because of the will of the peoples of the continent and their determination to liberate themselves.\n74.\tThe time has come for the United Nations to play a more positive role in assisting the peoples of the African continent fighting against the racist regimes in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia or, as in the case of the Saharan people, struggling for their right to self-determination. It is time the United Nations adopted practical and effective measures to implement its resolutions calling for the application of sanctions against the racist regimes in the continent. Only such action by the United Nations will lead to the achievement of peace in Africa.\n75.\tWe cannot view the events taking place on the African continent in isolation from what is happening in the Arab region. It was the same British colonialism as that which created the racist regimes in Africa that created the Zionist racist regime in Palestine. American imperialism, the successor to British colonialism, now supporting the racist regimes in Africa, is the same imperialism as that which is supporting the Zionist racist regime in Palestine, providing it with funds and arms not only for the entrenchment of its occupation of Palestine but also for its continued aggression against the Arab nation and its expansion at the expense of that nation. More than 30 years have passed since the occupation of Palestine and the uprooting of its people-a period equal to the age of the United Nations\u2014without the international community's taking any practical action that would re-establish their .rights, put an end to this injustice and enable the Palestinian people to return to their homeland. Indeed, hundreds of resolutions have been adopted by this Organization condemning the Zionist racist regime in Palestine and demanding that it implement the resolutions of the United Nations and abide by international statutes. What was the fate of those resolutions, why were they not implemented, and why does the regime of the Zionist gangs disregard them? Each and every one of us knows that colonialism and American imperialism bear the primary responsibility in this respect. The Zionist enemy has continued to occupy since 1967\u2014or, rather, since 1948, when this Organization proclaimed, under certain international circumstances which we all know, its recognition of the Zionist gangs regime-and to occupy by force Arab lands bordering on Palestine; and it continues to commit terrorism and mass genocide against the inhabitants, in total disregard of the resolutions and appeals of this Organization.\n76.\tEvery one of us here talks of peace in that region, and we as part of that region together with the whole Arab nation, are more keen on peace than any other peoples since we know more than others the consequences of war. In the % Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya we suffered Fascist colonialism, against which we waged a war of liberation that continued for more than 30 years at the cost of more than half of the inhabitants of our country. Other Arab countries suffered virtually the same fate. Therefore, no one is keener than we are on the establishment of peace. The question is, What is that desired peace? Peace cannot mean the continuance of occupation, the dispersal of the people of Palestine and the prevention of the exercise of their right to self-determination, unless that peace is in accordance with the concepts of Zionist racism and the concepts of its ally, the United States of America. In their view, peace means agreeing to occupation and accepting humiliation. This will never be accepted by the Arab nation or the Palestinian people. In no way can the United States of America, supporting as it does the Zionist enemy with funds and arms and participating directly with that enemy in its continuing aggression against the Arab nation, be a mediator in the search for peace unless the objective of that peace is, as I have already said, the continuance of occupation, perpetuation of the dispersal of the Palestinian people and the prevention of self-determination.\n77.\tWe have all followed to recent developments in the Arab region, beginning with the capitulatory steps and dubious contacts that took place and culminating in the Camp David agreements. The whole Arab nation realizes that the policy adopted by certain reactionary Arab regimes as regards the Zionist enemy under the aegis of the United States of America will have dangerous consequences, as was emphasized by the statement of the National Front for Steadfastness and Confrontation in Tripoli and Algeria. This is in fact what happened with the signing of the so-called Camp David agreements. These agreements, signed between an occupying Power, namely, the Zionist enemy, and its natural ally, the United States of America, on the one hand, and a reactionary regime, also an ally of the United States of America, on the other has no legitimacy and is not based on any law except the law of the jungle and the law of occupation. Why?\n78.\tFirst, those agreements, which were rejected and condemned by all Arab States without exception, were signed, under the shadow of occupation of the vanquished by the victor and hence cannot be considered anything but void and illegal.\n79.\tSecondly, those agreements addressed themselves to the issue of the Palestinian people but were signed by an Arab official who has neither the legitimate right nor the eligibility to speak on behalf of the Palestinian people, in accordance with the various resolutions of the League of Arab States, the OAU and the United Nations, all of which recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\n80.\tThirdly, those agreements affected other Arab frontline States that clearly reject any eligibility or legality that that Arab official may have assumed in signing on their behalf.\n81.\tWhat took place at Camp David was a theatrical farce which, at the same time, could set a serious precedent in international relations, in that a super-Power\u2014namely, the United States of America\u2014was directly involved in an act that approves occupation by force and contradicts all the resolutions of the United Nations and of other international organizations. The fact that a super-Power like the United States should intervene to support occupation by force and to impose the signing of agreements to that effect on a defeated State that was offering concessions is, in itself, a serious precedent in international relations, the effects of which on such relations can only be negative. The whole Arab nation has rejected the Camp David agreements and condemned them and their consequences. What was signed at Camp David cannot be regarded as a basis for peace in the area since it can only increase tension there and threaten international peace and security. The consequences of the Camp David agreements have begun to appear clearly. What happened at Camp David was a new and abnormal alliance between American imperialism and the racist regime that aims at the liquidation of the Palestine issue and threatens the peace and security of the African continent. After the Camp David agreements were signed there was one who claimed that his country had an African role to play. What is that African role? The days to come will show that there is none. Yesterday we listened to the representative of the Zionist gang clearly and arrogantly rejecting and defying this international community and saying that Jerusalem would remain under Israeli occupation. And Israel is one of the States\u2014if one can call it such\u2014that signed the Camp David agreements. We listened a short while ago to someone who spoke about Jerusalem. It is clear that that agreement is a dubious one and that it can never be acceptable. We heard the representative of the Zionist gang say that the settlements will remain, and today we listened to one who called for the elimination of those settlements.\n82.\tAnybody who scrutinizes the so-called Camp David agreements must realize that they are the result of a dangerous Zionist, reactionary and imperialist alliance that will have its consequences. The consequences of Camp David have already begun to appear clearly in the events currently taking place in Lebanon and in the war that Israel is waging directly there, whether by having its warships bombard Beirut, as it has during the last two days, or through its agents in southern Lebanon, who are impeding all the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace in implementation of the Security . Council resolution, or through the isolationist lackeys whom it backs and supports. The blood that has been shed is but the beginning of the serious consequences of the Camp David agreements. After trying to put pressure on both Syria and Jordan to accept the Camp David agreements, the United States took the initiative of reigniting the war in Lebanon with the intention of creating a state of tension in the area and thus diverting the attention of the Arab nation and the world in general from what it had done at Camp David. The request of the United States for a Security Council meeting on that subject was an attempt on its part to make the problem of Lebanon an international one and a direct attempt to partition Lebanon and deal a blow at the forces which rejected its policy in the Arab region. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya supports the legal Government of Lebanon and requests that Lebanon be established as a zone of peace and remain Arab, free and independent. We believe that the time has come for the international community to adopt measures to make the Zionist gang cease their activities in Lebanon.\n83.\tThe events taking place in the Arab region represent a threat not only to peace in that area but also to the peace of the whole world. The time has come for the United Nations to do its duty and for the international community to adhere to its resolutions. The time has also come for the international community to tell the United States of America openly that what it is embarking upon is not a peace effort but an act that would cause tension to escalate and is inconsistent with all the resolutions of the United\nNations and the responsibility of the United States as a super-Power. Peace cannot be achieved except through enabling the Palestinian people to return to their land and to exercise self-determination in the same way as the rest of the peoples of the world. Peace cannot be established through occupation, dictating conditions, threatening peoples or attempting to suppress them.\n84.\tAt a time when the United Nations is working towards disarmament and devoting special meetings to that subject in an effort to establish peace and security in the world, the big colonialist Powers are increasing their armaments and sending arms and equipment to racist regimes in order to create more hotbeds of tension in support of the hegemony of colonialism and occupation. Thus, the fact that the United States continues to supply the Israeli enemy with lethal weapons can only be viewed within this framework. The United States decision to build two military bases in occupied Palestine, in accordance with the Camp David agreements, at a cost of over $2 billion, should be the object of our condemnation. The continued .support given by the United States and its allies to the racist regime in South Africa and its purveying to that regime and the Zionist regime of weapons and nuclear technology contradict all our efforts on behalf of world disarmament. Also, the continued arming of South Korea by the United States and the latter's use of the United Nations as a cover for the presence of its military forces in South Korea can only be construed as but one line in a chain of events that has led to increased armaments and aggravated the hotbeds of tension in the world.\n85.\tIt is the view of the delegation of my country that the time has come for the international community to exert pressure on and attempt to persuade the United States to withdraw its forces from South Korea, leaving the Korean people free to achieve their unity. In this respect, we can only acknowledge the great efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea, free from foreign intervention, and the removal of the colonialist American force, which is an obstacle in the way of Korean unity.\n86.\tMy country's delegation cannot but pay a tribute to the non-aligned group for its policy and its efforts to achieve international peace and security. The non-aligned countries have proved that the policy of their movement is the only one capable of achieving peace. The Jamahiriya, which pursues a policy of neutrality and is an active member of the non-aligned movement, will spare no effort to strengthen that movement and help it to achieve its aims, for the prosperity of the peoples of the whole world.\n\n87.\tWe also fully support the establishment of zones free of nuclear weapons, whether in the Indian Ocean or in the Mediterranean Sea. We belong to the Mediterranean region and we are working together with its peoples in order to make the Mediterranean Sea a lake of security and peace, isolated from spheres of tension and foreign influences. In this connexion my delegation commends the announcement by the Maltese Government, under the leadership of the Maltese Labour Party, of Malta's neutrality and of the dismantling of foreign bases on the island. I reiterate the determination of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to continue to assist Malta and provide it with aid in order to achieve its non-alignment and economic prosperity.\n88.\tAs for the situation in Cyprus, which belongs to the Mediterranean basin, is a member of the non-aligned group, and is a country with which we have strong ties, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya trusts that the efforts now under way will result in an agreement that can protect the rights of both the Greek and the Turkish communities, and maintain the unity, sovereignty, independence and non-alignment of the country.\n89.\tThe delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya commends the great efforts of the United Nations to establish a new international economic order that would take into consideration the interests of all peoples, and especially the peoples of the third world that have suffered most from the unjust economic order now prevailing throughout the world. The realization of that new order will not become a fact until colonialist monopolies have been abolished and the peoples of the third world have been enabled to exploit their wealth and are assured of the freedom to dispose of and control their resources.\n90.\tThe new economic order cannot be realized until the peoples of the third world are able actively to participate in its implementation, and peace in the world cannot be achieved as long as the world is divided into two parts\u2014a majority that gets poorer and a minority that gets richer at the expense of the majority.\n91.\tThe manner in which the colonialist industrialized States cling to their monopolies and continue to exploit the riches of the peoples of the third world, together with their intransigence regarding the initiations of a constructive dialogue, are an obstacle to the establishment of a new international economic order. Through the deliberations that took place within the framework of the General Assembly or that of the North-South dialogue, those States proved that they reject even the principle of fairness. However, we must not give in to despair and should persevere in our efforts aimed at achieving that objective, which we consider to be in the interest of the peoples of this planet, be they rich Or poor.\n92.\tFor five years the international community has been making exhaustive efforts to arrive at a convention on the law of the sea, which, if completed in a manner that took into consideration the interests of developing countries, would be a remarkable event in the history of mankind, since man would have been able for the first time peacefully to agree on the sharing of the riches of vast areas of our planet.\n93.\tHowever, we and the rest of the world were recently surprised by the fact that one developed State took unilateral measures to exploit the resources of the sea-bed, an approach that, in addition to the ambiguity of its significance, particularly at this stage, we fear will adversely affect the current negotiations on the few remaining subjects and hinder the work we began years ago.\n94.\tMy country declares its rejection of any unilateral action, regardless of its origin, designed to exploit the resources of the sea-bed. It supports and backs the position of the Group of 77 stated by that Group in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of. the Sea.  My country also appeals to those who have taken that approach, and those who are tempted to follow suit, not to defy the will of the international community but to resort to prudence and patience.\n95.\tThe Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, which, after the Great First of September Revolution, began to control its own economy and devote it to the benefits of its peoples, today works in accordance with the third international theory in all its political, economic and social aspects, seeking the happiness of man, wherever he exists, and the end of injustice and exploitation. Now that direct democracy according to this theory has been achieved and the people are able to govern themselves by themselves through grass-roots conventions and people's committees, my country is currently engaged in the application of the economic aspect of this theory, by achieving the principles of participation under the motto \\\"Partners and not servants\\\", which is designed to abolish the exploitative system and the slavery of the paid worker to capital. Workers in the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya have become partners in production, and it is time we all worked together in the implementation of this principle, in which the happiness of mankind and the individual lies. It is high time the worker became a partner and not a servant or slave of capital and the employer. The success of this experiment in the Jamahiriya will be only the beginning of the freedom of the workers of the world and of the oppressed everywhere.\n96.\tThe responsibility of the United Nations is a big one. The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, which affirms its continued support of the United Nations and its adherence to its resolutions, considers that the time has come for this Organization to play a more positive role in the achievement of its objectives of establishing peace, realizing the freedom of man and ending injustice and colonialism. It may even be time for us to re-evaluate the role of the Organization and to work towards eliminating any obstacle impeding its effectiveness or its participation in the search for solutions to international economic and political problems. In this connexion, the delegation of the Jamahiriya considers the amendment of the Charter of the United Nations a necessity, since the Charter, written during a period in which the membership of the United Nations did not exceed one third of its present membership, and in international circumstances of which we are all aware, is neither appropriate for, nor compatible with, present political conditions. The retention of the so-called veto rights of a few States is a key factor hampering the Organization and preventing it from playing its required role. Therefore, it is time for the Charter to be revised in such a manner as to ensure the achievement of equality among States, regardless of their material, human and economic capabilities, so that, the Member States can effectively participate in establishing peace and prosperity in the world. It is also high time for us to implement the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the thirtieth anniversary of which we shall soon be celebrating.\n97.\tThe continued existence of racist regimes in Africa and Palestine is a violation of human rights. Human rights are indivisible. Blacks should not have rights that are different from those of whites, and the achievement of human rights for the Palestinian people and the African people cannot differ from their achievement in other parts of the world.\n98.\tYesterday we listened to the representative of the Zionist gangs speaking of human rights. His presence in this Organization is in itself a violation of human rights, because that representative, if we can so describe him, came here over the dismembered corpses of the people who were dispersed from their own homeland. If human rights were respected, it would be the Palestinian representative who would be sitting here and not he.\n99.\tWithin the framework of human rights, the Zionist representative spoke about immigration as if it meant only immigration from the Soviet Union. But according to the theory of the racist Zionists, expelling and annihilating a whole people is in line with the observance of human rights. That representative also pointed to violations of human rights in other parts of the world. The representative of the Zionist gangs should more correctly speak of its own human rights practices that have been denounced by the United Nations. There exists in the United Nations the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories.\n100.\tProceeding from this premise, we should oppose the law of the jungle and work towards preventing and combating terrorism. The Jamahiriya, on the basis of its Islamic principles and its belief in human rights according to these Islamic rules, will spare no effort in working with this Organization to combat terrorism, be it individual terrorism such as \\\"sky-jacking\\\" and the taking of hostages, or international terrorism such as that perpetrated by major Powers, when they intimidate the smaller nations or try to impose their supremacy, dictate conditions or intervene militarily. Is it not terrorism to disperse an entire population? Is it not terrorism when war planes are sent to strike at the African peoples? Is it not terrorism to have foreign bases and to use colonialist fleets to threaten those peoples?\n101.\tDespite this bleak picture of the international situation, the peoples of the whole world still view this Organization with optimism, since it is their only available means for achieving peace and prosperity, in spite of all its defects and short-comings. However, their hope may turn into despair if we fail to work together and to concentrate our efforts on joint constructive action for the establishment of a just peace , the realization of prosperity for all peoples and the attainment of happiness for man wherever he may exist, regardless of his colour, of his physical characteristics or of where he lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n7.\tMr. President, the tradition which offers Brazil the privilege of opening the general debate at the United Nations General Assembly gives me this year the very special pleasure of being the first among the speakers to compliment you on your election by acclamation to the presidency of this thirty-third session of the Assembly. Without stressing the strong and traditional ties that bind our two countries, neighbours and sisters, it is for me a source of particular personal satisfaction to see the labours of this main political body of the United Nations entrusted to the skilful and experienced guidance of my Colombian colleague and friend, Indalecio Lavano Aguirre.\n8.\tNor can I fail to express to Mr. Mojsov our appreciation of the manner in which he accomplished in this past year the task of presiding over the General Assembly during its thirty-second regular session and the unprecedented total of three special sessions.\n9.\tThirty-three years after the creation of this world Organization we have arrived, as a result of the process of decolonization promoted and accelerated by the United Nations itself, at a membership of 120 States. Solomon Islands now joins the community of nations with full rights, and we bid them welcome.\n10.\tThe tradition to which I referred in my opening words gives Brazil not only the .privilege but, above all, the responsibility, which falls upon me, of opening this debate, the only one to be held every year at a high political level among the representatives of the international community as a whole, without distinction between the powerful and the weak or the rich and the poor.\n11.\tThis is the fifth time I have addressed the General Assembly as the Minister for External Relations of my country. When I spoke in this forum precisely four years ago  as the Foreign Minister of President Ernesto Geisel's Administration, whose work was then beginning, I pointed out that we wished our language in the international field to be plain and straightforward, that we desired frank and \nuninhibited communication among the States Members of the United Nations and that we would explore all roads to understanding, for we held the fundamental belief that co-operation is more effective than antagonism and that mutual respect is more creative than the ambition of preponderance. I stressed, further, that we were ready, wherever Brazilian national interest might move us, to look for areas of convergence and zones of coincidence with the interests of other peoples, acting always in pursuance of objectives that were clearly identified and accepted by the Brazilian people.\n12.\tThat, in brief, has been the guideline followed by Brazil during these years in its external relations, both bilaterally and multilaterally. And the balance, I believe, is positive. We have greatly increased the areas of co-operation and understanding with our neighbours of the Latin American region, with our overseas neighbours, the sister republics of Africa, and with the other countries of the world. Traditional friendships have been strengthened and new and mutually beneficial friendships have been developed. Zealous for our sovereignty and independence, we have reaffirmed whenever necessary by word and deed our unshakeable adherence to the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of States, mutual respect and self-determination. And we have lived in peace, always trying to solve with serenity our differences of opinion with, or eventual divergences, from other nations.\n13.\tWe have sought, as far as possible, to break obsolete patterns of international relations and to replace them with more equitable and more balanced arrangements. This has enabled us to open up new diplomatic horizons. And we have thus revealed the true international profile of Brazil, ever sensitive to changes in the world reality.\n14.\tThus, a solid base has been created on which Brazil can stand in the coming years, a country firmly devoted to the task of promoting its ideals of peace, justice and development in harmony with the other nations of the earth.\n15.\tIn that same speech of September 1974,1 underlined certain grave problems afflicting the international community which were included in the General Assembly's agenda and which, directly or indirectly, also affected and continue to affect the country I represent. In some of those cases the balance of these last four years has been positive, although still unsatisfactory. In others it was clearly negative.\n16.\tTo mention only one of those problems, I then referred, first of all, to the general theme of decolonization and to the inhuman policy of apartheid. The past years have brought great rejoicing to Brazil with the independence and admission to the United Nations of all former Portuguese territories in Africa. But our attention is still turned to the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe, who still seek their self-determination and independence, not to mention other peoples, in other parts of the world, who still remain under the yoke of foreign domination. We anxiously await the occasion, which we hope will come very soon, to welcome to the United Nations the nation of Namibia, free and sovereign at last, with its territorial integrity fully preserved. But our cautious satisfaction with the apparent progress of that African country towards independence-the object, this year, of the historic ninth special session of the Assembly-is not enough to counterbalance the continued frustration of the expectations of the international community in relation to the self-determination of the people of Zimbabwe and the abolition of the apartheid regime.\n17.\tNor can we be reassured by the relatively unstable peace which prevails over a great part of the world when we observe the persistence of explosive situations and, in some cases, their rapid deterioration. In a world of solidarity and interdependence, there is no peace while there remain focuses of tension, of injustice and of conflict, even when localized.\n18.\tIn this sense, the extremely volatile situation in the Middle East gives all of us reason for the most profound concern. The continual resurgence in that region of the mistrust and hostility that have so often marked its turbulent history and, in particular, the tragic events in Lebanon, which caused the convening of the eighth special session of the General Assembly this year\u2014all contribute to create a climate of disquiet and discouragement.\n19.\tThe recent negotiations at Camp David are a new element in the search for peace in the region of the Middle East. We await with interest new stages in the process that is now under way, and we are attentively observing the degree of acceptance it is being accorded by the other parties more directly involved in the question, while cherishing the hope that it will be possible to arrive at just and lasting solutions compatible with the principle of the non-acquisition of territory by force, with the principle of the recognition of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, and with the right of all parties to the conflict to survival and self-determination.\n20.\tI cannot avoid making special mention of a problem which increasingly endangers the very existence of mankind. I refer, obviously, to the arms race and, in particular, to the nuclear arms race.\n21.\tThe situation today demands decisive action on the part of the international community, which has complacently and for many years contemplated the uncontrolled accumulation, by a few States, of arms of mass destruction and the terrifying and permanent refinement, by those same States, of instruments capable of annihilating human life on earth. The threat to us, to each of us in this room, and to each one of the 150 countries we represent, lies not only in the danger that those weapons may one day be used, but also in the very existence of that weaponry.\n22.\tThe spirit of frankness which should inspire this general debate leads me to say that, in this sense, the results of the first special session devoted to disarmament\u2014the tenth special session\u2014which was held in May and June of this year, were disappointing. Although we were conscious of the limitations which would inevitably follow from the realities of power, we nurtured the hope that the special session would be a first step, albeit a modest one, towards the solution of priority problems relating to nuclear weapons.\n23.\tAware of the need to ensure the co-operation of all States, particularly of the nuclear Powers, we all agree that the appropriate method of work was to seek solutions by consensus. Nevertheless, we witnessed the blockage even of successively diluted versions of texts that addressed themselves effectively to disarmament. Entire sections dealing with the really urgent problems relating to nuclear weapons were completely suppressed or made ambiguous. The Final Document of the special session [resolution S-10/2] contains serious omissions and confers disproportionate importance upon issues of secondary urgency in the general field of disarmament.\n24.\tSince it was not possible to achieve significant progress on the substantive issues of greater priority and urgency during the special session, it is symptomatic that the main practical results of the Assembly on disarmament lie precisely in the procedural area of machinery for future negotiations and deliberations. Willing to continue contributing, in good faith, to all constructive efforts in that area, we supported the decisions on the new negotiating body and on the new Committee on Disarmament. Within the limits of its possibilities, Brazil will exert every effort to help those bodies to achieve the results urgently required in the field of disarmament, particularly in the field of nuclear disarmament.\n25.\tThe obstacles that certain developed countries try to raise against the acquisition by the remaining States of technologies indispensable to development, including nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, are only one area in which some highly industrialized countries, aware of the g-owing political and economic importance of technology in a world of more and more limited natural resources, systematically try to hinder, restrict or block the access of developing countries to the means which are needed for the promotion of the welfare of their peoples. The situation, which tends only to become more grave, is a source of concern, especially as it fits into the increasingly bleak picture of North-South economic relations, marked in practically all its aspects by a worsening of trends, such as protectionism contrary to the establishment of a more just and equitable international economy.\n26.\tIt is to be regretted, in this context, that the lack of political will on the part of a large number of our developed partners continues to block the progress of constructive negotiations. Two weeks ago, the seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held its last meeting in these halls. Nothing would give me more pleasure than to be able to affirm that that session, the latest in a long series, arrived at positive results. Unfortunately such was not the case. During that part of the session which took place in Geneva we had noted some progress on important issues, but the continuation of the work in New York seems to have provoked setbacks and withdrawals, a fact which does not allow us to declare ourselves even modestly satisfied with what was achieved.\n27.\tThe prospect of having national legislation on matters under negotiation adopted unilaterally, in direct opposition to resolution 2749 (XXV), which was accepted without dissenting voices, did not contribute to better results. We cannot yet evaluate precisely just how far the consequences of such actions will go, but it is not possible to view them without deep concern. It is worth remembering that the Conference on the Law of the Sea is, in the judgement of many, the most important negotiation since the San Francisco Conference, at which our Charter was established and our Organization was created.\n28.\tAnother glaring recent example of this situation was the suspension some days ago of the work of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174,; known as the Committee of the Whole, a body which, in principle, should have decisive influence on the progress of specific negotiations within the framework of the North-South dialogue.\n29.\tBrazil will always continue to be pledged to the promotion and improvement of international co-operation, but it sees with disenchantment the gradual fading of the hopeful picture that had been sketched as a result of the seventh special session of the General Assembly. This thirty-third session will, consequently, be of crucial importance in determining the direction which the North-South dialogue will take.\n30.\tIt is in the light of these facts that we attribute special importance to the development of machinery aimed at filling the gaps in North-South co-operation. With this aim in mind Brazil has put forward and supported efforts _to promote, enlarge and intensify horizontal and equitable co-operation among the countries which strive for development. The United Nations Conference on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries, which took place recently in Buenos Aires, was an important landmark for multilateral efforts in this field.\n31.\tThe United Nations is the only universal body with the duty of maintaining international peace and security and simultaneously promoting co-operation for the social and economic development of all peoples. It is an imperfect system, much in need of reform. But, above all, it is a system imperfectly utilized.\n32.\tThe Charter of the Organization itself establishes, as the first of its basic principles, that of sovereign equality among all States. But that provision, which should be the foundation of universal co-operation for the solution Of the great problems of today's world, is undermined every moment. We do not deny that certain States are immensely more prosperous and more powerful than others. What we cannot continue to accept is that a few States seek to resolve the political and economic destinies of the world, with the United Nations kept on the margin and without regard for the interests, of the great majority of its Members. To these latter, participation in the process of making decisions which directly or indirectly will affect their fates can no longer be denied.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n1.\tMr. President, on behalf of my Government I wish to express to you our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are particularly pleased that the choice has fallen upon you. It is fitting recognition of your outstanding qualities of leadership and enlightened grasp of international issues. We feel confident that under your wise and inspiring guidance this session of the General Assembly will provide a new momentum for international co-operation towards peace.\n2.\tI also wish to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who, by his dedication and outstanding performance in presiding over the deliberations of the previous year, lived up to his country's distinguished record in world affairs.\n3.\tI should also like to reiterate and convey the appreciation of my Government to Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our Secretary-General, of his tireless efforts to promote the principles and ideals of the United Nations. I am sure he will continue to do his utmost to overcome the difficulties hampering the implementation of those principles and ideals. We, for our part, realize the complexities of his task and stand ready to support him in the fulfilment of his responsibilities.\n4.\tOn behalf of my Government, I should like to welcome Solomon Islands into this community of nations. I feel certain that its co-operation and contribution to our Organization will be of great value.\n5.\tThe problems facing the United Nations are many and\ncomplex, and in some instances highly sensitive. The year\nthat has passed since the last general debate cannot be\nconsidered as marking any great achievements in terms of resolving important problems which are on the agenda of the United Nations. None the less, the achievement of progress on some extremely difficult problems to which our Secretary-General draws attention in his annual report on the work of the Organization [A/33/1] is certainly encouraging in terms of other important and as yet unresolved problems.\n6.\tThe principal purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace. As we all know, the concept of peace is as old as civilization, but the requirements of peace change with a changing world and there is no such thing as static peace based on static balance and order. Therefore in today's rapidly changing world a dynamic approach should guide efforts aimed at the attainment of peace.\n7.\tThere can be no true peace except when nations exercise self-restraint, the weak are as safe as the strong and the poor can participate in progress equally with the rich.\n8.\tIf I may translate those concepts into single words or letters: detente, disarmament and development\u2014that is to say, the \\\"three Ds\\\"-should constitute the main pillars of a true peace today.\n9.\tAllow me first to dwell on detente. The great Powers have a special responsibility for the maintenance and promotion of detente. Yet detente should not be the exclusive concern of the great Powers, because detente is as indivisible as peace, and a selective application of detente can only increase tension in the long term. Therefore all States, big and small, and all regions should have a stake in detente in the belief that lasting results can be achieved only with the full participation of all States in that process.\n10.\tTurkey, for its part, attaches great importance to the promotion of detente. In fact, it has made consistent efforts to facilitate and promote detente, following an active policy of friendly co-operation with all its neighbours and the countries of the region.\n11.\tDetente, at present, is based largely on a balance of armed deterrence. Should the balance be tilted in a given region in favour of one side, detente might consequently suffer. As we see it, the present balance is a precarious one and does not ensure substantial progress. Detente, therefore, should be based on a sounder balance, a balance of interests aimed at maintaining peace and mutual confidence among nations.\n12.\tIn the long run the survival of detente will be dependent on progress in disarmament. For detente and\ndisarmament are intertwined processes. That brings mc to the second pillar, disarmament. I am sure that all will agree that disarmament is one of the most urgent problems on mankind's agenda.\n13.\tIn general terms, every State has a contribution to make in establishing the conditions for general and complete disarmament.\n14.\tTurkey, for its part, is keenly interested in disarmament, and the search for genuine and concrete disarmament constitutes one of the basic endeavours of the foreign policy of Turkey. As a developing country, Turkey no doubt feels more than others the harmful effects of the burden of armaments.\n15.\tWe whole-heartedly welcomed the convening last June of the tenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly, devoted to disarmament. Since the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr. Bulent Ecevit, addressed the special session1 and his detailed explanation of the views of our Government on disarmament went into the record, I shall confine myself to a few points only.\n16.\tI am confident that it is the common view of all delegations here that the ultimate goal is to achieve general and complete disarmament under effective international control, which will create a secure world in which all nations would be free from fear. I shall not be revealing a secret when I say that in an age of sovereign States whose interests are not always convergent the question of disarmament is directly related to the security of those States. The process of detente has not yet led to a reversal, or even a cessation, of the arms race. All countries are buying greater and greater insecurity at higher and higher costs.\n17.\tThis cannot be a safe way to disarmament. While disarmament negotiations proceed, armouries are being made bigger and bigger. What we should do is to substitute for a fragile system of security based on the arms race a more stable system of security based on mutual trust and confidence. A break-through in disarmament cannot be achieved if we do not have more trust in each other and a greater awareness of the common aims and interests of all mankind. The promotion of mutual understanding, trust and friendship would provide the soundest basis for disarmament efforts.\n18.\tAlas, our world exists in an environment that is far from being one of trust and confidence. The ever-growing violence, in addition to the continuing arms race, increases the disaffection and anxieties of millions of people.\n19.\tOn the other hand, terrorism and violence have reached alarming dimensions in our age, indicating the insufficiency of educational efforts to cultivate feelings of love and tolerance in the hearts and minds of the young.\n20.\tIt is obvious that it is difficult to mobilize the will of mankind for disarmament and peace in a psychological atmosphere that breeds hate, hostility and violence.\n21.\tWith this peculiar and disturbing situation in mind, the Turkish Prime Minister suggested in this very hall that the\n\nUnited Nations should require all Member nations to adopt and implement educational programmes that would breed a culture of peace and international friendship.\n22.\tBefore I conclude on this subject, I should like to emphasize that, despite some progress, the history of post-war disarmament endeavours can be seen only as one of repeated lost opportunities. Be that as it may, we none the less refuse to be led into pessimism. The slow pace of progress in the field of disarmament stems from the very nature of the subject. Disarmament is too important a question, however, to leave any areas unexplored. Therefore we should be bold enough to try every step that will bring us closer to our goal, and while doing so we should be wise enough to protect scrupulously the progress we have already achieved, no matter how little or modest it may be.\n23.\tPeace and prosperity are indivisible. The questions of detente and disarmament cannot be considered apart from their economic dimension-that is to say, development, which is the third pillar of a true peace.\n24.\tThe need to establish an equitable and just economic order in the world is also very closely related to detente and disarmament. At present, -the world revolves on two axes-one East-West, the other North-South. Rapid progress through a stable but at the same time dynamic process should take place on both of those two fronts. There can be no stability and security in a world of hunger, misery and injustice. Furthermore, efforts in the fields of detente and disarmament would be incomplete and ineffective unless adequate measures aimed at reducing the ever-increasing gap between the rich and the poor, between North and South, were undertaken.\n25.\tTurkey, as a developing country, is profoundly interested in the establishment of an equitable economic order in the world and is sincerely anxious to contribute to it. Our Government, which came into office at the beginning of this year, intends to make Turkey's contribution to this process more effective. In line with this objective, Turkey had the privilege of acting as host to a seminar on the New International Economic Order held in August in Istanbul. Our Government is proud to have had the opportunity of bringing together in the seminar a number of distinguished politicians, diplomats and scholars who have been making valuable contributions to the search for a New International Economic Order.\n26.\tIt must be admitted that, in spite of the intensive efforts made under the United Nations umbrella, no important concrete results have yet been achieved. The sessions of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, known as the Committee of the Whole, which was established last year to oversee developments in connexion with the New International Economic Order, to give them impetus, and to serve as a forum, where appropriate, for the exchange of views on global economic problems\u2014in brief, to take up and negotiate every aspect of the New International Economic Order-ended in a dangerous deadlock.\n27.\tThe persistent economic recession which exacerbated the difficulties of the developing countries coincided with the suspension of the dialogue in the Committee. This,\ntogether with the acutely felt short-term effects of the global economic crisis, could frustrate to a great extent the long-term aspirations of the developing countries. Therefore this stalemate is an ominous sign for the efforts made in other United Nations bodies with regard to the New International Economic Order. If this General Assembly fails to resolve the differences that emerged in the form of procedural matters, this will sooner or later adversely affect the negotiations on the Integrated Programme for Commodities and the common fund, which in turn will gravely endanger the prospects for the fifth session of UNCTAD.\n28.\tIn the course of 1978 the developing countries had to face protectionist tendencies of alarming proportions in the industrial countries. We suspect that protectionism is on the way to far exceeding what is needed for reducing unemployment or facilitating industrial structural adjustment. To our disillusionment, protectionism is becoming an autonomous escalating force which the policy-makers of industrial countries are individually either unable or reluctant to withstand. It is hardly necessary to recall that the labour-intensive, value-added manufactured goods of the developing countries are the main losers by this process. Therefore those countries should not shy away from the responsibility of actively participating in the work of the Tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of GATT.\n29.\tIn the atmosphere of slow growth of the last two years, we are awaiting the results of the domestic expansion of the countries with surpluses as a remedy for stagnation, on the one hand, and for payments maladjustments and monetary instability, on the other. Nevertheless, the economies of those countries cannot be expected to respond, beyond some modest point, to the internal expansionary measures, for there are structural causes inhibiting their being global driving forces.\n30.\tThe potential growth of the world economy, however, depends indisputably on the developing countries, which buy 28 per cent of the total manufactured goods exported from industrial nations and which at the same time constitute the only part of the globe having healthy demand. Regrettably the prevailing traditional economic thinking does not allow the industrial countries to embark upon a co-operative effort which would benefit all and create an atmosphere conducive to rapid progress in the negotiations on the New International Economic Order. On the contrary, the developing countries are more often than not called upon to restrict their growth for the sake of strict internal financial stability. Some of the lender countries and monetary institutions require certain policies which lead the economies of developing countries to stagnation in the name of \\\"stability\\\", even after they achieve the feasible level of internal economic adjustment necessitated by the economic crisis. Stability is no doubt one of the prerequisites of a sound economy; yet developing countries can achieve development not through a stagnant but through a dynamic stability. Forcing them to a stagnant stability would inevitably cause grave social and political crises and eventual upheavals in those countries.\n31.\tWhile there is a pressing need for structural changes in the global economic system, there is also a need for the developing countries to break some vicious circles among\nand within their economies. The Turkish Prime Minister, Mr. Bulent Ecevit, in his opening address at the Istanbul seminar on the New International Economic Order suggested that, first, developing countries should increase and render more effective their economic co-operation in adapting and developing technology. Secondly, with the strength they would obtain through solidarity and cooperation, they should try to increase their' collective effectiveness in the international trade of commodities and industrial goods, as well as their influence in international financial organizations and institutions. And thirdly, they should subscribe to a new development concept which should be different from that prevailing in some developed countries, a concept which would consist in the aspiration to a healthy social structure, and to healthy values that emphasize quality rather than quantity.\n32.\tIt is in the light of the concept of individual and collective self-reliance that we have evaluated the results of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held in Buenos Aires. We believe that that Conference was instructive and inspiring as to the value of a collective approach. We further believe that it offered new vistas to the developing countries, in that the Plan of Action adopted by the Conference2 constitutes a broad framework for the implementation of the concept of technical co-operation among developing countries. The individual and collective self-reliance which this endeavour will generate will contribute to the efforts towards achieving the New International Economic Order.\n33.\tAt this stage, I wish to inform you that my Government is fully prepared to share with the developing countries the scientific and technical capabilities of my country which have been accumulated in the course of Turkish development efforts. National institutional machinery has recently been created to this end. No doubt technical co-operation will not only strengthen bilateral economic relations among developing countries by bringing into action a hitherto unutilised potential, but at the same time it will help to promote the New International Economic Order on the basis of collective self-reliance.\n34.\tOn the other hand, I should like to stress our sincere hope that the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development, to be held at Vienna next year, will be a step forward in the endeavours to create a New International Economic Order and will provide an insight into and an understanding of the problems that face both developed and developing nations.\n35.\tWe also hope that this session of the General Assembly will give a new impetus to the efforts to transform the status of UNIDO into a specialized agency before the Third General Conference of that organization in 1980. Needless to say, such a transformation, if implemented according to the aspirations of developing countries, will constitute another step in the direction of the New International Economic Order.\n36.\tI must add that the work of the United Nations will be judged by future historians according to its success in establishing a just international economic order.\n37,\tEconomic and social development as a whole can be regarded as an effort to promote human rights. Economic and social rights on the one hand, and civil and political rights on the other, are inseparable and interdependent. It is our firm belief that world order and peace can be based on justice and equality only when effective guarantees are secured for ensuring the respect and protection of human right, This is why the Charter itself urges on the United Nations the talk of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n38.\tThe date of 10 December of this year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Anniversaries are moments for the review of past performance reflection on present realities and a renewal of conviction mid resolve in regard to future conduct. In this spirit we believe that countries should give real expression to and protect fundamental human rights and freedoms in their own societies.\nLet us therefore be reminded that we must continue to exert efforts towards creating a better world where all human beings fully enjoy their fundamental rights and freedoms and where the dignity and worth of the human person are firmly secured and fully honoured.\n40. Mankind should be protected not only against oppression and injustice but also against terror and violence. My country, which has recently been the victim of several attacks against the lives of its diplomatic representatives, is ready to contribute to initiatives taken in order to combat international violence effectively.\n41. While we look for ways to improve stability in the world through detente, disarmament and development, the agenda of the General Assembly remains crowded by many decades-old conflicts.\n42. The right of peoples to independence is one of the basic principles which the Turkish government has supported since its foundation. Turkey, the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, fought 60 years ago the first of war of independence against imperialism to free itself from foreign coercion and occupation, to protect its territorial integrity, and to asserts national sovereignty and national dignity. it has always rejected the theory and practice of colonialism in whatever form it may exist.\n43. Today as we meet here under the roof of the United Nations, which by virtue of its charter is dedicated to the emancipation of the oppressed peoples, the situation in southern Africa still remains critical and even constitutes a menace to peace; the policy of apartheid practiced in South Africa, the prevailing  situation in Namibia and Southern\nRhodesia, in defiance of the unanimous and repeated appeals of world public opinion, is an affront to mankind and a flagrant violation of human rights. \n\nIn South Africa there can be no solution to the problem of apartheid as long as the Government continues to subject the African majority to the will of a white minority and to exclude it from the\n political life of country. My country - like many others - voiced repeatedly in the United Nations and elsewhere its deep\nconcern for racial injustices In South Africa as they have been institutionalised in law and practise. We believe that the international community should embark upon a policy of strong and unrelenting pressure on the racist regime of Pretoria.\n45.\tTurkey has been privileged to be a constituent member of the United Nations Council for Namibia. It has played and continues to play an active role in all endeavours related to the political destiny of that Territory.\n46.\tWe reaffirm our solidarity with, and fully support, the people of Namibia in their just struggle under the guidance of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], its sole legitimate representative, against the racist and colonialist regime of Pretoria. Turkey fully appreciates the positive attitude taken by SWAPO in the process of peaceful transition to independence. Any solution to the problem of Namibia should take into account the basic principles contained in Security Council resolution 385.\n47.\tIt is in this spirit that we welcomed Security Council resolution 431 (1978), which requests the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Representative for Namibia in order to ensure the early independence of Namibia through free elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations. We hope that efforts currently under way to implement this resolution, as well as the one just adopted in September 1978 approving the report of the Secretary-General, resolution 435(1978), will lead to success.\n\n48.\tHowever, the unfortunate unilateral decision recently taken by the Pretoria Government to hold elections in Namibia is a great setback for the sustained efforts by the Security Council and by many African countries to promote the independence of Namibia on a basis acceptable to the Namibian people. We only hope that this decision will not be implemented and that the South African Government will realize the danger inherent in an attitude incompatible with the United Nations resolutions and the wish of the world community as a whole. There is no doubt that if the South African Government persists in this attitude the Security Council should promptly reconsider the situation and adopt adequate measures.\n49.\tIt is now more urgent than ever before to settle the issue of Southern Rhodesia. The illegal Smith regime has been implementing the so-called internal solution aimed at preserving the privileges of the white minority.\n50.\tWe firmly support the people of Zimbabwe in their legitimate struggle against the illegal white minority regime in Salisbury. We are firmly opposed to any settlement which excludes the Patriotic Front. I would therefore like to stress that, without a genuine act of self-determination encompassing all Zimbabweans, it is evident that there cannot be a real and lasting solution to the problems in that country.\n51.\tWe hope that ongoing efforts exerted to resolve the question of Southern Rhodesia will lead to majority rule and real independence for the people of Zimbabwe.\n51. the Middle feast has for three decade been the cause of special international concern. This important region of the world, which has been the scene of four wars, has known no stability in spite of many past and present initiatives taken to that end. The situation in the Middle East has come to a point where the perceptions of a peaceful and lasting settlement are intertwined with the prospects of new and more violent confrontations. We believe that, without solving the essence of the problems, tension and the spectre of war will continue to loom large on the horizon of the Middle East. The policy of the Turkish Government with respect to this problem has always been that a just and lasting peace settlement must flow from Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) and give effect to the following principles, First, it must implement the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force. Secondly, it must end the territorial occupation which Israel has maintained since 1967. Thirdly, it must take into account the national legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinians. Fourthly, it must safeguard the independence, the sovereignty and the security of the recognized frontiers of all the countries of the region. On the ether hand, negotiations for a just and lasting settlement could not take place in the absence of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole lawful representative of the people of Palestine.\n53.\tTurkey would be willing to welcome any initiative aimed at a settlement which takes into consideration the factors described above. Furthermore, it supports initiatives of a nature such as to defuse tensions and thwart developments which could endanger peace both in the region and in the world.\n54.\tWe have followed the Camp David summit meetings with keen interest and we are conscious of their importance. It would be premature to express a judgement at this stage, especially when the parties directly interested in the solution of the problem are in the process of evaluating the results of the meetings at Camp David.\n55.\tLebanon is another source of deep concern in the Middle East. We have followed with great sorrow the developments in that country, which has suffered so much during the last years. Security Council resolutions 425(1978) and 426(1978) and the creation of UNIFIL were certainly moves in the right direction. We nourish feelings of solidarity with the people of Lebanon, and we fervently hope that they will be able to maintain their unity and recover their vitality.\n56.\tThe new Turkish Government has from the very beginning concentrated its attention on a rapid resolution of the Cyprus problem and hoped that there would be no need to discuss this issue at the thirty-third regular session of the General Assembly. Indeed, as early as January this year the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus, with the active support and encouragement of the Turkish Government, undertook a series of initiatives in order to hasten the process of negotiations. The Turkish Cypriot Administration came up with concrete, comprehensive and constructive proposals and presented them to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, on 13 April 1978. The\nTurkish Cypriot proposals, which covered all the aspects of the Cyprus problem, including both the territorial and the constitutional aspects, were characterized by the Secretary-General as \\\"concrete and substantial\\\". The proposals did not reflect an inflexible stand; on the contrary, they were put forward as a negotiating position. Furthermore, the Turkish national community has at the same time made a commitment to the Secretary-General that it was ready to enter into negotiations in a spirit of conciliation and flexibility.\n57.\tIn short, the Turkish side has made every effort to promote intercommunal talks and a productive dialogue with a view to finding a lasting solution to the Cyprus problem. It has also endeavoured to improve the existing situation in the island. In this connexion the Turkish Cypriot Administration, taking into consideration the Secretary-General's recommendation in his report to the Security Council, announced that, with the start of the intercommunal talks, Greek Cypriot inhabitants of the city of Varosha could begin returning to their homes and businesses and that it was also ready to discuss the re-opening of Nicosia airport to civilian traffic.4 We estimate that the resolution of the problems pending between Turkey and Greece would also contribute to the emergence of a better atmosphere for the solution of the Cyprus problem As is known, we have taken the initiative in establishing a dialogue at the Prime Minister level with Greece, and this process is still continuing.\n58.\tAll the efforts of the Turkish side have unfortunately been of no avail, because of the intransigence of the Greek Cypriot Administration. Their only concern seems to be to conduct a widespread campaign in the world to minimize and discredit the proposals which they rejected out of hand.\n59.\tIt is regrettable that the Greek Cypriot leadership is wasting such an historic opportunity for the good of the whole population of Cyprus by dragging its feet and obstructing the way to intercommunal negotiations. The Greek Cypriot side should accept the fact that it must be prepared to negotiate directly and on an equal footing with its Turkish Cypriot partners.\n60.\tThe letter and spirit of all relevant United Nations resolutions, as well as the Geneva Declaration of 30 My 1974, to which Turkey, Greece and the United Kingdom were parties, establish the principle of equality between the two communities in the search for a peaceful settlement. The two communities should therefore have an equal say in all the forums of the United Nations, and in particular in the General Assembly. The denial of this very natural right to the Turkish national community would adversely affect the negotiating process as such, would hinder the full understanding of the Cyprus problem and would constitute a grave injustice to the Turkish national community. Intercommunal equality should also be respected not only in words but also in deeds, as well as in all United Nations activities, such as the provision of economic and technical assistance to Cyprus.\n61. The Turkish Government's stand on the Cyprus problem has been explained very dearly on numerous occasions. My Government believes that a viable and just solution to this problem could best be achieved on the basis . of the guidelines agreed upon by the late Archbishop Makarios and Mr. Denktas, with the participation of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in February 1977, according to which Cyprus must be an independent, sovereign, non-aligned, bizonal and bicommunal federal State, In line with its efforts to contribute to peace and tranquillity in the island, the Turkish Government has to date withdrawn 17,500 troops from the island as a gesture of goodwill and it commits itself to withdrawing all its armed forces from the island, with the exception of those that will be mutually agreed upon by the parties concerned when a final solution to the problem is found. My Government also feels that Turkey and Greece should assist and encourage the two national communities in Cyprus to find an equitable solution to their problem,\nIt can be stated impartially that basically the Cyprus problem is ripe for solution. The two parties involved in the dispute-the Turkish and the Greek communities-have indeed agreed on a framework which indicates clearly an outline of a future solution.\n63.\tThis framework embodies a delicate equilibrium between the two communities in the light of the unfortunate history of the island since the creation of an independent Cyprus. On the other hand, a procedure for negotiation exists in the mandate given by the Security Council to the Secretary-General of the United Nations in its resolution 436 (1978). Whatever the reasons that may still divide the two communities, there is no excuse for delaying the intercommunal talks. Both sides stand to gain much more from negotiations than from rhetorical exchanges and propaganda activities.\n64.\tBefore I conclude my remarks, I should like to recall the phrase of a great man of peace, Mahatma Gandhi, who once wrote: \\\"Love is the strongest force the world possesses, and yet it is the humblest imaginable.\\\" It is the same belief which led my Government to stress in its programme the following phrase, among others: .. we shall strive to ensure that world peace is based upon human love\\\". I wish that, in accordance with this motto, human love may guide for all times the relations of nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n1.\tMr. President, it is a pleasure for me to greet you as the representative of a continent with which we find that we have, through its Latin roots, long-standing affinities that are still very much alive. I also want to pay a tribute to you as an historian, economist and statesman whose training and experience will surely be invaluable to the pursuit of our work. I wish you, as indeed I wish us all, complete success in it and I assure you that you can count on our total co-operation.\n2.\tBy recalling the eminent qualities of our Secretary-General and paying a tribute to his tireless dedication, I am not simply conforming to some kind of ritual. It is only natural that the outstanding debt the international community owes him should be acknowledged publicly and that we should tell him once again how grateful we are to him for serving the goals of our Organization with such wisdom, enthusiasm, energy and competence.\n3.\tOne year ago from this very rostrum1 I observed that the world situation was neither good nor reassuring. Alas, the events that have occurred in the past 12 months are scarcely reason to alter that view. The main points of tension persist; new ones have emerged; still others have reappeared. Economic imbalances and inequalities remain and at times have even widened. While the guiding principles of our Charter are not contested, one has to admit that their application is still inadequate. Finally, human rights are still subject to many violations.\n\n4.\tThat observation may seem severe but it is not intended to be pessimistic. The United Nations today is represents ? e of almost the entire world community. It has been enlarged again by the admission of Solomon Islands, which we are pleased to welcome. Mindful of the countless ties it has long had with the Pacific region, France hopes to enjoy the best of relations with that new State.\n5.\tAs our Organization draws still closer to being universal it is acquiring growing influence in world affairs. As a founding Member of the United Nations, and having fully integrated its goals and principles into our own political philosophy, France welcomes this course of events. As we have shown just this year, we are prepared to associate ourselves directly with the efforts of our Organization on behalf of peace. Indeed, now more than ever France is convinced of the value of collective action and the need for genuine international co-operation, without which our quest for peace and prosperity would be but an illusion.\n6.\tFrance pursues that policy first and foremost in its natural environment, Europe. With its eight partners, France is continuing the work begun more than 20 years ago to build a prosperous and peaceful community able to make its own contribution to international life. The current President of the European Community has described to the Assembly our views on the main questions it is to debate this session [see 8th meeting, paras. 135-200]. He expressed our shared determination to steer the development of our peoples on a course that is more rational and more generously open to the world. The many countries of every continent that are associated with the Community, as well as those nearby that are preparing to join, are aware of the determination behind this endeavour. They know the price and appreciate the difficulties in the present economic situation.\n7.\tBeyond the context of the nine countries members of the Community, France applies in Europe the principles of detente which it helped define and to which it remains deeply committed. Whatever the vicissitudes or stumbling-blocks, that policy is still the only reasonable one; therefore it must be pursued and developed to the full dimensions given to it by the Final Act of Helsinki.2 It must also be extended elsewhere in the world, for clearly areas outside Europe must not become the object or stakes of a confrontation between the major Powers, or the very process of detente will be imperilled.\n8.\tLong ago we established without reservation ties with European nations having social systems different from our own, and my country reaffirms its commitment to co-\n\noperation with the Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe. In the same way, it welcomes the development of its relations with the People's Republic of China. It intends to make those relations commensurate with the physical, human and political dimensions of that great country.\n9.\t\\\"To maintain international peace and security\\\": that is the principal goal the Charter assigns to our States. Now, even more than last year, persistent tensions or current conflicts are jeopardizing international peace. We are all aware of them. They are located primarily in the Middle East, in Africa and in the Indo-Chinese peninsula. The draft text on peace-keeping, which my colleague from the Federal Republic of Germany presented on behalf of the European Community [A/SPC/33/L.19J, deserves the full attention of the Assembly, because it invites us at a very opportune moment to lend the Organization our assistance in this essential matter of collective security. Occasions for doing so, I am sorry to say, are not lacking.\n10.\tIn view of the crisis provoked by the Israeli intervention in southern Lebanon, my Government decided last March to participate in UNIFIL. Its decision to make a contingent available to the Organization was a concrete expression of its often stated commitment to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of that friendly country and of its support for President Sarkis's efforts to Strengthen the authority of the State and reconcile the communities within Lebanon. Who can fail to see that a free and united Lebanon is an indispensable element for the equilibrium of the entire region? But who can fail to see also that its tradition of freedom and openness exposes it more than any other State to the impact of the tensions and crises that surround and penetrate it?\n11.\tIt was therefore justifiable for the international community to give the people of Lebanon, who had already been so severely tried, direct evidence of support following the occupation of southern Lebanon by Israeli armed forces. The operation undertaken by the United Nations has unfortunately not achieved all the objectives set for it. Although the withdrawal of Israeli troops was achieved, they are still overtly supporting rebellious elements along the border which refuse to submit to legitimate Lebanese authority and keep tension alive by dangerous acts of harassment. Security has not yet been restored to the entire area, mainly because it has been impossible for the units of UNIFIL to deploy along the border.\n12.\tWith regard to restoring the authority of the Government of Beirut, the obstacles to this are not ones that UNIFIL has the mission or the means to overcome. The Force cannot take the place of the Government in the exercise of its sovereignty. While the Force\u2014and we should pay tribute to it since the difficulties of the task are unprecedented for an operation conducted by our Organization\u2014may draw on all the resources available to it in the framework of its mandate, it is not its job to maintain law or to impose a settlement the implementation of which would require also the co-operation of forces outside its sphere of action.\n13.\tUNIFIL would be diverted from its real goal if the protection it provides permitted the status quo to continue\nand the parties to become immured in their intransigence, deaf to the suffering of the people and blind to the dangers of allowing the wound to fester. This was the meaning of the Security Council's resolution 434(1978) of 18 September to renew the mandate of the Force for four months. The stability of the region requires measures to be taken without delay to restore the authority and sovereignty of Lebanon, and everyone who understands this will find encouragement in this extension of the Force's mandate. But the time-limit imposed on the mandate should serve as a warning to those who entertain the illusion that the presence of the Force will from now on be a permanent factor in the situation.\n14.\tI do not want to leave the subject of Lebanon without stressing my Government's concern at the persistence of tensions in other parts of that country, particularly in Beirut. I should like to remind you once again of our constant position: that there can be no solution to the crisis in Lebanon unless it is founded on respect for the unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of that country. Any undertaking that did not recognize this requirement would be doomed to failure and would risk destroying, along with itself, the very cause it claimed to serve.\n15.\tThe situation in Lebanon cannot be dissociated from the Middle East situation, which has greater repercussions on that country than on any other in the region. After the historic initiative taken by the President of Egypt, Mr. El-Sadat in going to Jerusalem last fall, a new situation emerged Both those who approved and those who disapproved recognized it. Everyone realized that what was at stake was no longer Israel's existence but the terms of its coexistence with the Arab countries.\n16.\tThis breach in the wall of distrust that had separated Israel and its neighbours for 30 years was not turned to as much advantage as had been hoped; the process begun last winter stalled too quickly. The President of the United States, Mr. Carter, tried to inject new life into it, and I want to pay a tribute to his courage and tenacity in his personal involvement in the Camp David undertaking. This meeting, unprecedented in style, has ushered in a new phase. Clearly, there is still great uncertainty in it. But we would like to hope that under the. shadow of ambiguities, precaution and silence, the complex texts adopted by two of the parties directly concerned can be used to further progress towards the necessary settlement.\n17.\tWe believe that, for this phase to be decisive and to lead to peace, it must pave the way to an over-all settlement, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), with which all the interested parties would be associated, including the representatives of the Palestinian people. This settlement, may I repeat, must be based on withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967, on recognition of the right of the Palestinians to a homeland, on consideration for the legitimate concern for security of all the States in the region, naturally including Israel, as well as on the mutual recognition of boundaries and on the gradual establishment of peaceful relations among the States concerned. Only respect for these principles can bring about the just and lasting peace to which all the peoples of the region aspire.\n18.\tWe deplore the fact that in Cyprus the renewed efforts of our Secretary-General have had little success in breaking the stalemate. In order to strengthen the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and to restore trust between the communities, these communities must resume their talks and must be prepared to conduct them on a reasonable basis. The de facto state of affairs must not become law; pre-conditions cannot lead to negotiation. My country is too closely linked with that part of the Mediterranean not to know how deep and firmly rooted the concerns of each party are, but our own historical experience has shown us how much can be overcome by the determination of leaders and peoples. It is this impetus that we urge the parties to find, and we are\nalways ready to encourage them to do so. \n19.\tAfrica has suffered new ordeals this year, without a settlement being found for certain problems too long discussed by our Organization. That continent, one of the cradles of humanity, has begun a new chapter in its history. Many recently independent States, which have not yet firmly established internal equilibrium, today find themselves involved in rivalries which are not their own and which thus hurt their chances in the only struggle that is worth while, the struggle for development.\n20.\tIn Rhodesia the recent turn of events has increased the dangers. The illegal regime in Salisbury continues to defy the international community. The agreement reached last March between Ian Smith and certain nationalist leaders with the aim of promoting a so-called \\\"internal solution\\\" only deepened divisions and heightened tensions. The application of the Anglo-American plan drawn up last year at this time would doubtless have paved the way for Zimbabwe's independence to be accepted, but we see today that violence is on the rise. Only direct negotiations among all the interested parties under the aegis of the administering Power could make it possible for Zimbabwe to accede peacefully to independence. But time is passing, intransigent positions are becoming more entrenched, and a storm is brewing. It is high time to listen to reason.\n21.\tIn rejecting the implementation of the plan to settle the question of Namibia-a plan it had accepted four months previously\u2014South Africa has created a crisis that could have grave consequences if the Government in Pretoria does not reconsider the position it has taken in defiance of international opinion.\n22.\tFrance again asserts that there is no essential difference between Mr. Waldheim's proposals and the settlement plan of the five Powers. In finding fault with some adjustments that alter neither the spirit nor the basic terms, the Republic of South Africa seems to be looking for pretexts to back out. In agreement with its Western partners, France has asked that the Security Council meet as soon as possible in order to adopt the Secretary-General's proposals.\n23.\tConfident as it is of the support of the African countries and, above, all of those the front-line countries,\nand mindful as it is of the suffering of the Namibian people, who have waited too long for the right to self-determination to be accorded them, and assured as it is, along with its four partners, of the support of the international community, France again most solemnly calls upon South Africa to refrain from setting out on a dead-end road which can lead it only to suicidal isolation. Let me add that Namibia's independence will be effective only if prepared in co-operation with the international community.\n24.\tIn the Horn of Africa, where violent clashes occurred last year, the situation is still disturbing. It is high time that the disputes that are setting Africans against each other were left to the Africans alone, so that they may seek the paths of a settlement through procedures of their own. Accordingly, it falls to the Organization of African Unity [OAU] to continue its efforts at rapprochement, without which tension and resentment will persist.\n25.\tThree other situations especially hold our attention: they involve Chad, Western Sahara and Zaire. I will discuss these at somewhat greater length because France's position has not always been understood, nor has there always been a desire to understand it. Because France has on three occasions been led to give direct assistance to the countries concerned, it has been claimed in some quarters that France sought to play some kind of role as \\\"gendarme of Africa\\\". I want once again to refute these accusations, which show little understanding of the reasons for our policy, which is based on two principles that I have already explained on several occasions but that I should like to reiterate.\n26.\tFirst, it is for African countries themselves to settle their disputes. This means that their independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity must be free from all interference that would make Africa the arena for rivalries from outside the continent; it means that they must remain free to decide their political options for themselves.\n27.\tSecondly, it is with strict respect for the sovereignty of States that France shows its solidarity with Africa. \\\"Africa for the Africans\\\" does not mean rejecting this solidarity or erasing friendships.\n28.\tThough France did intervene on the African continent, it was always at the express request of the recognized Government of the country in question, and the extent and duration of French assistance were limited according to the necessities of the situation. In each case France was responding to an appeal from States which were victims of aggression originating from or supported from the outside; these States were trying to defend themselves within their borders and did not yet have the military means to ensure their own security.\n29.\tAccordingly, my country remains true to the policy of non-interference and of co-operation that it has always followed; no one can accuse France of straying from it and following supposed neo-colonialist or other designs.\n30.\tThese supportive actions do not of course imply that we have taken any position on the substance of the issues or made any attempt to impose a solution. To our mind, the settlement of disputes is the exclusive domain of the parties concerned.\n31.\tIn Chad, unmistakable aggression developed this past spring in violation of the Sebha and Benghazi cease-fire agreements; this aggression was clearly backed from the outside and led the Government of Chad to request our support. The sole objective of our action was to make it possible to restore the security necessary to the quest by the people of Chad\u2014and by them alone-for national reconciliation. Today this endeavour is well under way, as everyone can see.\n32.\tIn the different situation that prevails in the western reaches of the Sahara, France similarly answered an appeal from Mauritania, a country without substantial material resources or military forces which was the victim of aggression supported from the outside on uncontested national territory. In this matter France, which has longstanding ties with all the States involved in the conflict, has but one wish, and that is to see these States re-establish friendly and fruitful co-operation with each other. Accordingly, we note with interest the recent turn of events that is more favourable to restoring calm. We hope this trend grows. Since we had no part in the Madrid agreements, we would not be party to the dialogue that might begin. But we are prepared to encourage such a dialogue so that a peaceful solution might at last be found, with the help, if need be, of international organizations. As for us, it is in the forum of the United Nations that we have stated our commitment to the self-determination of peoples.\n33.\tFor the second consecutive year, Zaire has had to endure bloody incursions in Shaba province by elements from the outside. To all indications, the toll of this attack in human lives, and material terms would have been even heavier without rapid international support. Since our soldiers have long since returned to their bases on our territory, who today can question the strictly humanitarian concerns that motivated us?\n34.\tFrance's action in Africa has never been aimed at jeopardizing the sovereignty or security of any country on that continent. Our sole ambition is to contribute, when the desire for this is expressed and when we are asked, to the development and well-being of the peoples of Africa, who have as much right as anyone else to stability and security.\n35.\tAs for the Comoros, I emphasized last year that France had a feeling of solidarity with countries to which it was especially bound by history, and that we were ready to demonstrate this feeling toward the new State. I am therefore pleased that diplomatic relations have now been established between the Comoros and France and that the door is thus open for co-operation. Our co-operation can only facilitate better understanding between the Comorians and their neighbours in Mayotte, who have freely chosen a different path but who, I repeat, will have another opportunity to express their wishes regarding their future.\n36.\tTherefore, was it necessary to enter the question of Mayotte on our agenda again? Allow me to express some\ndoubt about the usefulness of such a debate if in fact the aim is, as everyone must hope and work for it to be, the restoration of an atmosphere of trust between the peoples in question.\n37.\tIn South-East Asia, France can only deplore the fighting that has resumed on the Indo-Chinese peninsula, so long afflicted by war. This fighting is between two peoples with which we have historically had very close relations and for which we still feel deep friendship today. We hope that all the States of the region can devote themselves to the priority tasks of development and establish true cooperation between themselves, with respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of each of them, free of all undue interference from Powers outside the area.\n38.\tOne of the most painful consequences of the situations of confrontation that we deplore is the exodus of part of the population. France, traditionally a land of asylum, could not remain unmoved, especially when this ordeal involves peoples that were once linked to it. This is why we took in 150,000 refugees, nearly one third of whom came from the Indo-Chinese peninsula; and we are keeping our doors open to other refugees, from this area to a limit of 1,OCO a month. Since this is an eminently humanitarian endeavour, we hope the burden can be shared to a large extent by the members of the international community.\n39.\tWith the fate and protection of the human being at stake, how could we fail to mention the pledge made by our States when they adhered to the Charter, namely, to respect human rights?\n40.\tWe mast be exacting in this, but also humble. Human rights are too sacred to be used for partisan ends; and they are precious enough for respect to be demanded for them everywhere.\n41.\tFrance has not forgotten that it was in Paris on 10 December 1948 that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted; we are celebrating its thirtieth anniversary this year. But who would venture to claim that this is also the anniversary of its application?\n42.\tIn view of the continued violations of these rights, we are forced to admit that there is still a wide gap between the most solemn statements and actual behaviour.\n43.\tPolitical persecution, racial discrimination, torture and arbitrary sentences are still a painful reality today. The news offers too many examples of something that is all too common. There should be no hierarchy of arbitrary priorities in human rights, whether individual or collective. To tolerate selection would be to legalize all violations in advance.\n44.\tUnless there is respect for the supremacy of the individual, no progress can be made toward human equality and dignity; both would bet flouted, here in the name of economic imperatives, there in the name of security requirements. Neither the cause of peace nor the cause of development can justify the persecution of individuals or groups who ask only that international texts endorsing their basic rights be respected.\n45.\tIn this connexion I should like to recall our staunch condemnation of the policy of apartheid. We denounce it not only as the manifestation of indescribable disdain for human beings but also as a potential detonator of dangerous conflicts. France has associated itself with the sanctions taken last November against a regime whose blindness makes a constant policy of such disdain. We therefore strictly apply the embargo on arms sales to Pretoria.\n46.\tGranting individuals and peoples every civil and political freedom and the means to enjoy it in peace was already the goal of our States a few decades ago. Today we all agree that it is important for them to have the economic means to exercise those freedoms. Furthermore, development, which should remedy the most blatant economic inequalities, is itself a factor for peace. Has it not been said at this very rostrum that development is the new name for peace?\n47.\tNevertheless, when we speak of development, let us beware of taxing the peoples' patience. We are nearing the end of the Second United Nations Development Decade. What contribution has it made to the most impoverished among us? What has been its real impact on world hunger? Have we at least established the conditions that could, on the basis of national economic take-off, generate a process of self-development? Alas, that hardly seems to be the case.\n48.\tIf public opinion in the developed countries and in countries benefiting from co-operation for development is not to become discouraged, the third development decade will have to respond in a more concrete manner to the needs of peoples and will have to be expressed more consistently in practical ambitions that mobilize support. It is important that the next decade attest to the commitment of the international community to deal realistically\u2014that is, in the concrete terms in which they are presented\u2014with the acute problems that confront a number of Governments daily and affect the lives of hundreds of millions of individuals. Therefore this decade must usher in, if not another type of development, at least a more pragmatic and diversified approach, and it must reject fruitless discussions on the nature of basic needs.\n49.\tIn this regard we welcome the agreement reached recently at the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries in Buenos Aires; it opens up new prospects for international technical co-operation to further development.\n50.\tNew elements may also be expected from the fifth session of UNCTAD, which is to be held in Manila next year, from the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development and the Third General Conference of UNIDO. Those elements should be integrated into a comprehensive whole and should be guided by master plans that serve to enlighten the mind and mobilize the spirit of determination.\n51.\tInstead of waiting passively for guidelines from the 1980 special session of the General Assembly, it is our duty to start thinking now, individually and collectively, about an outline for the third decade. While the objectives of the present Decade, which were defined globally [resolution\n2626 (XXV)], will undoubtedly establish the general frame of action for the 1980s, changes in the world economic situation and the lessons learned from experience should none the less make certain priorities clearer.\n52.\tBy the same token, the fight against the most dire effects of poverty is certainly a task in keeping with the possibilities of our Organization, and one that would enable it to respond to the hopes people place in it.\n53.\tThe basis for such a project exists. It is the programme of action, adopted unanimously in 1976 by the tripartite world employment conference.7 But the programme should be expressed in terms of strategy by an effort of planning and by wide-ranging consultation, in particular with a view to eliminating any misunderstanding. The way was opened, inter alia, by the Conference of non-aligned countries which met last July in Belgrade. That Conference pointed out [see AI33/206] that the policy defined in Geneva - and I agree with this view\u2014is based on the need to promote a new international economic order; it noted that such a policy did not dispense with the need for a global strategy designed to accelerate the economic growth of the developing countries; and, lastly, it stressed that those countries themselves were responsible in the first place for their own development and particularly for satisfying the basic needs of their peoples.\n54.\tI might add that that policy, rightly attentive to rural development and to the problems of unorganised urban concentrations, must not be used as an excuse for neglecting the indispensable geographical redistribution of industry.\n55.\tI have mentioned the necessary industrialization of the developing countries. I hope they will know how to control it and will avoid the mistakes we made in our own industrialization.\n56.\tMoreover, we, like the developing countries, are opposed to any international division of labour, old or new, that would imprison certain peoples in certain tasks. Faced with competition in some sectors from young industries in the third world, we decided, at the price of imposing real sacrifices on our companies and workers, to reject the facile solution of protectionist measures. We have allowed adaptations and reconversions to take place in the context of free trade and realistic pricing. We believe that by so doing -we have served honestly the interests of all.\n57.\tThe third development decade, as 1 have said, needs some master plans. It also needs a sense of method and instruments for its implementation. With respect to this, the current restructuring of our Organization's machinery\nin the economic and social domains, which has included the creation of a high office in the Secretariat, entrusted to Mr. Kenneth Dadzie, increases our confidence in the capacities of the system. The implementation of the General Assembly resolution [resolution 32/197] should be continued, especially with regard to strengthening the role and increasing the effectiveness of the Economic and Social Council.\n58.\tI should, however, like to point out one serious and paradoxical short-coming in our complex system, and that is the lack of any framework for genuine discussion on the fundamental issue of energy. By that I mean not the \\\"energy crisis\\\" that made headlines in the press but the crisis facing us, the one that must compel us all to adopt an active policy to conserve energy, which my country has embarked on with determination and success; the crisis that forces us to make a difficult, yes, but inevitable choice between various sources of energy with due regard for the balanced development of the entire planet, for the protection of our natural and man-made environment and for nuclear energy by guaranteeing that it will be used for peaceful purposes. To this end, while France has banned the export of sensitive equipment that could facilitate access to nuclear weapons, it is also anxious not to deprive any country of the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy or the advantages of the most promising technologies. For this reason we have agreed, pending the results of consultations under way in the framework of the international nuclear fuel-cycle evaluation programme, to provide our eventual partners with every service in the fuel cycle.\n59.\tThe problem of energy, therefore, needs to be approached globally, without any spirit of confrontation, in order to take into consideration the interests of the international community as a whole. I thus welcome as a positive element resolution 1978/61 passed by the Economic and Social Council which retains the principle of an international conference on new and renewable sources of energy. The French Government will take an active part in preparing that conference.\n60.\tWith regard to the 1980 special session of the General Assembly, we regret that the work of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, known as the Committee of the Whole, is to be suspended, this being an irreplaceable forum for pursuing the North-South dialogue to which France is committed. Certainly starting such a dialogue on economic and development problems at the world level is an ambitious and arduous undertaking whose difficulties I underestimate less than anyone. Some divergences have become apparent on the interpretation of certain aspects of the mandate of the Committee. Nevertheless, the formula that found acceptance at the start of the month with a large majority of delegations is still entirely valid, in our view, and should enable the Committee, with the active collaboration of one and all, to tackle the main problems at last.\n61.\tWithout the security to which our nations are rightfully entitled, no development is in effect possible. Yet security should not command an excessive share of our resources. In other words, the disarmament undertaking is an obvious necessity and one that should concern us all.\n62.\tThe tenth special session of the General Assembly, by malting it quite clear that disarmament should be the affair of the entire international community and not of just a few State, has at last placed the debate in its real perspective.\nThis is not the only thing to its credit; it also provided us with the means to pursue the undertaking.\n63.\tIn this matter, no one should entertain doubts about France's determination. The participation of the President of the Republic in person in the work of the special session attests to this. The presence of France in the place reserved for it in the new Committee on Disarmament, a presence that I now officially announce from this rostrum, confirms that this momentum will be maintained.\n64.\tThe recognition of the central role that should fall to the United Nations and the concomitant reform of the machinery for negotiation and deliberation, with greater participation, better regional equilibrium and more democratic functioning through the dismantling of the co-presidency in Geneva, guarantee, in our view, that a new phase can now be entered. It has, therefore, become possible for France to join the Committee. It has become necessary for us to assume the role dictated by the importance of the stakes, for all our States.\n65.\tI should like to pay a special tribute at this point to the President of the special session, who was also the President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, whose political understanding, dedication and great competence were invaluable to him in successfully carrying out the mission entrusted to him by the Assembly.\n66.\tWith the help of revised machinery, the work envisaged last June could now begin. A set of principles and a time-table have already provided useful reference points, although we believe that in certain areas, notably in the nuclear domain, a different wording would have been better suited to the realities of the situation. This document, which is an attempt to cover a set of particularly complex and sensitive problems, nevertheless bears witness to a remarkable consensus within the community of nations on several key points.\n67.\tLet me mention: the right of all States to security; the special responsibility that must be shouldered by the great Powers in the area of disarmament, since they themselves recognize that they have arsenals far in excess of the requirements of strategic balance; the importance not only of nuclear but also of conventional disarmament, in view of the fact that the build-up of conventional weapons, particularly in Europe, constitutes an increasingly serious threat to peace; the need for effective monitoring of disarmament measures; and, finally, the allocation of funds thus freed for economic and social development.\n68.\tFrance has, moreover, presented concrete suggestions on some of these points which should be studied right here or in specialized bodies. I am referring to proposals for a satellite monitoring agency and a disarmament fund for development, as well as the establishment of an institute for disarmament studies, all initiatives whose usefulness has been widely recognized.\n\n69.\tThe realistic approach to disarmament that should be encouraged leads us to recommend that measures of a regional nature be studied. It is within this framework that balanced solutions can be found which take into account the role deterrence plays in the security of part of the planet. We have therefore proposed to the countries interested in the security of the European continent that a conference on disarmament be convened.\n70.\tA regional consultation could also bolster efforts to limit the transfer of conventional arms. The geographical entity that a region constitutes is most often an arena for threats just as it is for co-operation. So it is at this level that the exigencies of each State's right to security and those of non-discrimination among partners must be assessed. Real progress cannot be made from the outside, by some cartel of producers or through unilateral actions. It can be based only on the common will of the interested States and their common understanding of the purpose and scope of a verifiable regional agreement. In this context the initiative recently taken by a group of Latin American countries sets an example and should be commended.\n71.\tI am addressing this Assembly as the representative of a country that is mindful of its independence and intent on preserving it. But mine is also a country convinced of the growing solidarity which links together all the countries of our planet. In the face of the crises, upheavals and threats of all kinds to which our peoples are exposed, none of us\u2014whether a small, medium-sized or even very large Power-can expect to act alone and emerge unscathed. Co-operation is no longer a choice; it is a necessity that we must accept. Let us give it the means to grow stronger here.\n72.\tWe must of course be realistic. Disunity too often pervades this privileged gathering place. Resistance to change is tenacious. And much imagination and political determination will be needed, it is true, to ensure that man, wherever he lives and whatever his race, religion or national origin, will enjoy personal dignity, a fair share of the world's resources and a part of the responsibility for decisions that concern him.\n73.\t\\\"As the strange dawn of the third millennium draws closer\\\", as the President of the Republic said in this very forum last May,12 the undertaking offers enormous scope for our intelligence and efforts. France for its part is determined to take part in it.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\tMr. President, the Pakistan delegation congratulates you most warmly on your election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your mature understanding of the role of the United Nations in the contemporary age will enable you to steer the proceedings of this thirty-third session to a successful conclusion.\n\n2. We also congratulate Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who handled\nwith great skill and ability the deliberations of the\nthirty-second session and the three special sessions, including\nthe tenth special session devoted to disarmament.\n\n\n3. Solomon Islands is the first among the new Member States to be admitted to the world Organization this year. We warmly welcome it in our midst and pledge our goodwill, friendship and co-operation to the new State.\n \t4. In his report on the work of the Organization for 1978 IA/33/11 the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, has summed up the activities of the United Nations since the thirty-second session. His deep insights into the political, economic and moral imperatives confronting the international community have enriched our understanding of their nature and magnitude. I take this opportunity of reaffirming the full confidence of my Government in his leadership of the world Organization.\n\n\n5.\tSince last year the world has become a more troubled place: new areas of global tension have emerged as a result of the exacerbation of relations between the two; leading military Powers; disputes among States and internal conflicts are being resolved through [external intervention and recourse to the use of force; the arms race continues unabated and now encompasses most, of the regions of the world; the world economy remains in the grip of an endemic crisis; the rich Nations are in the midst of a protracted recession; most of the poor are on the brink of economic disaster; international co-operation is at an ebb; and pressing global problems have not moved any closer to solution. These are the daunting challenges which overshadow the current Assembly session.\n\n6.\tLet me dwell for a moment on Pakistan's endeavours in the past year to promote peace and co-operation.\n7.\tThe process of normalization of relations with our neighbour, India, has been maintained. We shall continue our endeavours to promote good neighbourly relations by addressing ourselves to the underlying causes which in the past have impaired bilateral relations. We look forward to a just and honourable solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in the spirit of the Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972  on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. Such a solution would open new vistas of co-operation between Pakistan and India and make an immense contribution to the strengthening of peace and stability in Asia and the world.\n8.\tSincere efforts have been made to promote friendly relations with Afghanistan on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. The President of Pakistan, Mr. Zia-ul-Haq, was the first Head of State to visit Kabul after the new Afghan Government assumed power.\n9.\tCo-operation with fraternal countries, namely, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other Arab States, and Bangladesh, in the political, economic and other areas has been further developed.\n10.\tBonds of enduring friendship with China have been reinforced with the opening of new routes of trade and access.\n11.\tRelations with the United States have been pursued in the spirit of traditional friendship and co-operation.\n12.\tEconomic co-operation with the Soviet Union has been enlarged and State relations continue to be developed on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence.\n13.\tAssociation with the non-aligned movement last July has added a further dimension to our consistent solidarity with the collective endeavours of the non-aligned countries for peace, justice and progress in the world.\n389\n14.\tThe conflict in the Middle East continues to be a cause for deep anxiety to the international community. We have closely followed the personal involvement of the President\n. \n\nof the United States, Mr. Carter, in the peace-making efforts culminating in the Camp David summit meetings. The full impact of the framework accords'' will become clear with time. However, a peace formula that is acceptable to all the parties in the Middle East question remains to be devised.\n15.\tFor some years now, there has been a consensus in this Organization, based on Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) as well as resolution 3236 (XXIX) of the General Assembly, that the prerequisites for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East remain: first, Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, including the Holy City of Jerusalem; and secondly, the fulfilment of the national and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people including their right to establish an independent State in Palestine. No comprehensive settlement can ignore these imperatives.\n16.\tThe restoration of the Holy City of Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty must form an integral part of any comprehensive settlement. It will be recalled that following the initiative of Pakistan, the Security Council adopted resolution 267(1969), under which the principle of inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by military conquest was made applicable to the Holy City of Jerusalem. We note that the United States continues to recognize Arab Jerusalem as occupied territory, as stated by Mr. Yost in the Security Council on 1 July 1969.  The General Assembly in resolutions 2253 (ES-V) of 4 July 1.967 and 2254 (ES-V) of 14 July 1967 declared as null and void the measures taken by Israel to annex the Holy City of Jerusalem.\n17.\tWhat is the kind of peace that the international community envisages for Palestine? As far back as the First World War the call went out from a great Power for a peace without annexations and indemnities, a peace based on the principle of the self-determination of peoples. What followed however was a sort of Carthaginian peace, which sowed the dragon's teeth.\n18.\tDuring the Second World War a great war leader proclaimed the following principle: \\\"In war\u2014resolution: in defeat\u2014defiance; in victory\u2014magnanimity; in peace- goodwill\\\". We would appeal to the peace-makers to eschew a punitive peace of annexation and occupation and opt for a settlement in a spirit of magnanimity and goodwill.\n19.\tImmediate steps need to be taken to maintain the momentum for the achievement of a just and comprehensive settlement on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and the participation of all the parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, which has been recognized by the international community as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Since the Second Islamic Conference of Kings and Heads of State and Government, held at Lahore in 1974, the Palestine Liberation Organization stands on an equal footing with other national liberation movements recognized as such by the international community, for example, the South West Africa People's Organization SWAPO and the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe. The United Nations has an inescapable responsibility to redeem its solemn pledges to the Palestinian people.\n20.\tWe therefore support the convening of a special session of the Assembly to resolve the Palestine question, which is the core of the Middle East conflict. And in regard to the claims of the Palestine Liberation Organization to be legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, let us also recall what was said at a historic moment of peacekeeping by an eminent statesman. At the Conference for the Conclusion and Signature of the Peace Treaty with Japan in 1951 he said: \\\"Fellowship is not the mood of peoples who are denied fellowship.\\\"  Regard for justice rarely animates those who have been made to suffer such cruel wrongs that their suffering has a bearing on the present peace.\n21.\tThe restoration of normality in Lebanon and the preservation of Lebanon's territorial integrity are inextricably linked with a comprehensive solution of the Middle East conflict. We view with deep anguish the continuing tragedy of that country, whose body lies bleeding and is being torn apart by fratricidal strife. We extend our full support to UNIFIL.\n22.\tCyprus continues to be another source of concern for international peace. We note with regret that there has been no resumption of the talks between the two communities, despite the commitment by the leadership of the Turkish community to a spirit of conciliation and flexibility in the negotiations. We believe that the resolution of this problem should be possible through negotiations between the two communities on a basis of equality and within the guidelines  agreed upon between late Archbishop Makarios and Mr. Denktas, with the participation of the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and within the framework of an independent, sovereign, non-aligned, bicommunal and bizonal federation of Cyprus. The statement of the Turkish Foreign Minister in the General Assembly the other day [19th meeting] has further convinced us that the present opportunity for peace-making should not be lost.\n23.\tPeace is also imperilled in southern Africa. We appreciate the sustained mediatory efforts of the five Western Powers in evolving the agreement on Namibia's transition to independence under the-control and supervision of the United Nations. We also commend the flexibility and statesmanship demonstrated by the President of SWAPO, Mr. Sam Nujoma, in accepting the five-Power plan. \n24.\tPakistan strongly condemns South Africa's repudiation of its earlier agreement to abide by the provisions of\nSecurity Council resolutions, and welcomes the Security Council's determination to proceed with the arrangements, in accordance with resolutions 431 (1978) and 432 (1978), to ensure the early independence of Namibia through free and fair elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations, with the objective of securing the withdrawal of South Africa's illegal administration in Namibia. Should South Africa not respond to the Security Council's latest call, the only alternative left would be to adopt drastic measures, including economic sanctions against South Africa.\n25.\tIt is deplorable that even 30 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the international community has not succeeded in eliminating the abhorrent practice of apartheid in South Africa. Pretoria remains adamant in refusing to dismantle the structure of racism. The- economic collaboration of certain States encourages South Africa in its obduracy. The threat to peace posed by South Africa's policies would assume a graver dimension if it were to realize its ambition of acquiring nuclear weapons capability. It is time the Security Council enforced the demand in its resolution 418 (1977) that all States sever economic, military and other links with South Africa and adopt effective measures to prevent the racist regime from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n26.\tIn Zimbabwe the so-called \\\"internal settlement\\\" stands exposed as a device to prolong white minority rule. The Smith regime, after some prevarication, has reverted to brutal repression of the people of Zimbabwe and has resumed armed attacks on the freedom fighters and neighbouring States. These desperate acts cannot sustain the white minority in power, The path of wisdom lies in a peaceful and immediate transfer of power to the majority of the people of Zimbabwe, led by the Patriotic Front. What is to be gained by delaying the inevitable by a few months, at the cost of a bloody racial conflict in Zimbabwe, which would destroy all hopes of a multiracial society?\n27.\tDisarmament is central to the quest for international peace and security. Only a few months ago the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament adopted by consensus a detailed plan of work for comprehensive disarmament and established new negotiating machinery, which promises to ensure the participation of all the nuclear-weapon Powers in the disarmament negotiations and deliberations. The Final Document of the tenth special session [resolution S-10/2] accords the highest priority to nuclear disarmament, together with certain  measures of reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments. Altogether it constitutes a considerable achievement, which would have been greater if there had been a higher degree of involvement of the leading military Powers, particularly in regard to the immediate measures that can be taken in conventional disarmament and in strengthening the non-proliferation regime.\n28.\tIn the special session we proposed that the most immediate consideration be given to the conclusion of an agreement at the current second series of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and to the comprehensive test-ban treaty by the three nuclear Powers presently engaged in negotiations to halt underground nuclear weapons tests. We also\nurged, in parallel with these two processes, mutual and balanced reductions of armed forces and armaments in Europe, followed by the prohibition of the first use of nuclear weapons by the nuclear-weapon Powers\u2014as, for example, on the lines pledged unilaterally by the People's Republic of China.\n29.\tThese suggestions are fully in accord with the Declaration and Programme of Action contained in the Final Document [ibid., sects. II and III]. I hope that at the current session the General Assembly will find it possible to reach consensus on these priority measures and to commend them to the two major nuclear Powers, which bear special responsibility for nuclear disarmament by reason of having accumulated the largest nuclear stockpiles, and that it will also commend them to the members of the two opposing military blocs.\n30.\tSuggestions have been made for an immediate ban on the deployment of other types of nuclear weapons, such as the neutron bomb and the SS-20 limited-range mobile missile. We see no reason why these measures, as well as the proposal to prohibit the flight tests of new strategic delivery vehicles, should not also be given the highest priority in the negotiations on nuclear disarmament.\n31.\tThe two super-Powers are pledged to conclude an agreement at the third series of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks immediately following the conclusion of one at the second series in order to effect further major reductions of their nuclear weapons and delivery systems. We consider that the prohibition of the use, or threat of the use, of nuclear weapons should also be concluded as soon as possible after the third series.\n32.\tThe strengthening of the non-proliferation regime is a matter of great urgency. We believe that the twin objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and the development of the peaceful uses of nuclear technology can and should be reconciled. The inalienable right of all States to develop and acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, without discrimination, was upheld by the previous session of the General Assembly [resolution 32/87 F] and the special session devoted to disarmament. However, we regret that the restrictive and discriminatory policies adopted by some supplier States have remained unchanged. We very much hope that international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will be promoted. This would be an important contribution towards evolving the consensus to be jointly developed by the nuclear-weapon and non- nuclear-weapon States on ways and means of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n33.\tWe firmly believe that if the non-proliferation regime is to be fully developed and truly strengthened it must be complemented and reinforced by security guarantees of both a negative and a positive character to non-nuclear States, thus striking a more equitable balance in the rights and obligations of nuclear and non-nuclear-weapon States.\n34.\tFor several years Pakistan has called for agreement among the nuclear-weapon Powers on negative security assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States. A few years ago we submitted a formula on the subject which was adopted by the General Assembly. At the tenth special session the nuclear-weapon Powers responded in some measure by unilateral declarations concerning the non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States; - it, except by the People's Republic of China, those Powers made their statements so qualified and hedged by reservations that they fell far short of constituting credible or meaningful undertakings.\n35.\tPakistan has consistently maintained that security guarantees to non-nuclear States should be given multilateral form, and should not be put forward as bilateral transactions. Therefore' we note with special interest the proposal of the Soviet Union on the conclusion of an international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States [see A/33/241J. Although the Soviet proposal, in content, remains highly qualified and would need to be appropriately amended in order to elicit the support of the other nuclear-weapon Powers and the acceptance of the non-nuclear-weapon States, it constitutes an important response to the concerns and preoccupations of the latter group of States. Hence we hope that the new item [item 128] will receive serious consideration at this session and be remitted to the new Committee on Disarmament for negotiation. At the same time, I would recall the formula adopted by the General Assembly on Pakistan's initiative in resolution 31/189 C, which would extend negative security guarantees to all non-nuclear-weapon States which are not parties to the nuclear security arrangements of certain nuclear-weapon Powers.\n36.\tI also put forward at the tenth special session the idea of positive security guarantees  in order to strengthen the credibility of the positive, though highly qualified and conditional, security assurances extended to non-nuclear- weapon States by the three nuclear-weapon Powers in Security Council resolution 255 (1968). Those assurances by the three nuclear-weapon Powers are embodied in their unilateral declarations of intention to come to the assistance of a non-nuclear State victim of nuclear aggression.\n37.\tNon-nuclear States rightly fear that unilateral and bilateral positive security assurances would turn them into protectorates of the guarantor nuclear Power or Powers; but multilateral positive guarantees within the framework of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, which recognizes the right of States to individual and collective self-defence, would in no way constitute an infringement of their sovereignty and independence, inasmuch as the nuclear umbrella provided would be integral to the universal collective security system expressly envisaged by the Charter.\n38.\tThe establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones constitutes a most effective measure of disarmament and also of non-proliferation. Pakistan's proposal for such a zone in south Asia  will ensure against the spreading of nuclear arms in the region and promote the security of the regional\nStates. As a first step, the pledges of the south Asian States to refrain from the acquisition of nuclear weapons might be transformed into a joint and binding undertaking.\n39.\tIn a broader regional context, peace and security would be promoted through the creation of zones of peace, such as the Indian Ocean, South-East Asia, the Mediterranean and other regions. Such zones would, of course, need to take into account the interrelated aspects of eliminating the military presence of, and threat from, external Powers and the maintenance of security among the regional States. In this context, we welcome the meeting of the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean, to be held in July next year, as a first step towards the conference to be convened to establish the zone of peace in the Indian Ocean.\n40.\tThe roots of the disparity between the developed and the developing countries lie in the present economic system, which serves the interests of the industrialized nations. The hopes and expectations aroused by the call for the New International Economic Order are nowhere near fulfilment.\n41.\tThe developed countries have been able to adjust to the impact of the increase in the price of oil. The brunt of these adjustment measures-that is, growing trade restrictions, slackening demand, persistent inflation and exchange fluctuations\u2014has been borne by the developing countries. Their balance-of-payments deficits have tripled; their external debts have doubled; and they have been forced to reduce economic growth.\n42.\tTrade and the transfer of resources are the twin pillars on which development co-operation is based. The present volume of the transfer of resources to the developing countries is neither adequate nor certain and has been declining during the last three years. The level of official development assistance flows has stagnated at less than half the target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product and has declined in 1977 to a new low of 0.31 per cent. Only three developed countries have achieved or exceeded this target, and the major donors are lagging the furthest behind. Official development assistance should be doubled during the next two years to achieve the 0.7 per cent target, as decided, by 1980. Secondly, agreement should be reached on the 'proposal for a massive transfer of resources to the developing countries to stimulate the world economy.\n43. Debt-servicing liabilities are a major drain on the\nresources of many developing countries. The UNCTAD\nagreement in March this year [see A/33/15, part two,\nannex I], for retroactive readjustment of the terms of past\nofficial loans to the poorest countries is the least that could\nhave been done in this regard. We thank Sweden, the\nNetherlands and the United Kingdom for granting general\nrelief to several poorer countries, including my own. It is a\nmatter of concern, however, that the major creditor\ncountries have not implemented this agreement even in the\ncase of Pakistan, whose debt burden is one of the heaviest\namong the developing countries.\n \n44. The existing international monetary system is\nobviously weighted against the developing countries. For\nexample, during the five years from 1969 to 1974 the\ndeveloped countries received 97 per cent of total reserves \ncreated, while the developing countries received only 3 per \ncent. If the pattern of world production and trade is to be \nmade more equitable, it is imperative that reserve creation\nshould be under international control and that its distribution\nshould be more equitable and linked with development\nneeds rather than economic power. Reform of the\nmonetary system may be the key to world economic revival\nand should be brought to the centre of the North-South\ndialogue once again.\n\n45. The external trade of the developing countries, instead\nof sustaining their development, has so far contributed to\nthe deterioration in their economic conditions. Their terms\nof trade have registered a steady decline. The share of the\ndeveloping countries in world trade, despite the increase in\noil prices, has declined from 25 per cent in 1950 to 17 per\ncent in 1975.\n\n46. The developing countries are important markets for\nthe industrialized countries. They absorb 25 per cent of the\ntotal exports of the advanced countries and 40 per cent of\nthe exports of the European Economic Community. The\nUnited States sells more to the developing countries than to\nthe community, 1apan and the socialist countries put\ntogether. It is ironic that, despite this evident interdependence,\nas the GATT report for 19771 0 indicates, the\nexports of the developing countries have been a special\ntarget of protectionist measures in the advanced countries.\nIn 1977 alone protectionism led to a contraction in world\ntrade by $30 billion to $50 billion.\n\n47. In the multilateral trade negotiations, contrary to the\nprinciples of the Tokyo Declaration, the developing\ncountries have been virtually excluded from the main\nbargaining in the final phase. For the developing countries\nthe balance-sheet of these negotiations might well be\nnegative. The current multilateral trade negotiations should\nbe concluded as scheduled by the end of the year. But this\nshould not result Insetting aside the trade problems of the\ndeveloping countries indefinitely. The Tokyo round of\nmultilateral trade negotiations should be immediately followed\nby another third round-a \\\"third-world round\\\"-of\nnegotiations devoted primarily to the problems of trade\nbetween the developed and the developing countries.\n\n\n\n48. We hope that agreement will soon be reached for the\nestablishment of an effective common fund for commodities\nincluding a substantial \\\"second window\\\". Concurrently,\nit is necessary to examine the idea of a global trade\n.compensation scheme to meet the shortfalls in the exports\nof developing countries due to deterioration in trade terms.\n\n49. It is ultimately through industrialization that the\ndeveloping countries can attain a satisfactory measure of\nself-reliance and economic prosperity. We support the\nproposal for a specific programme for industrial development for the third United Nations development decade and \nwould suggest that UNIDO and UNCTAD may be authorized to prepare a study on this subject. The system of\nconsultations in UNIDO should be specifically designed, as agreed at the Second General Conference of UNIOO, to \n initiate the process of redeployment of world industrial\n capacity.\n\n\n50. We hope that the United Nations Conference on\nScience and Technology for Development, to be held in\nVienna next year, will result in an increase in the level of\nsupport to science and technology in the developing\ncountries and an appropriate augmentation of research in\nthe industrial world relating to the problems of the\ndeveloping nations.\n\n51. It is in the interest of the developed and developing\ncountries to take concerted action to restructure world\neconomic relations on a more equitable basis. Yet, the\nrecord of the development dialogue thus far has been very\ndisappointing. The dialogue is now in a state of impasse.\n\n52. Pakistan sponsored the creation of the Committee\nEstablished under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, of\nthe Committee of the Whole, in the wake of the inconclusive\nParis Conference on International Economic Cooperation,\nto facilitate agreement on outstanding issues\nrelating to the New International Economic Order. However,\nit has become apparent that the developed countries\nare not prepared to negotiate in the Committee on the\nconcrete issues of transfer of resources, industrialization,\nfood production and so forth. The Committee was obliged\nto suspend its work last month, in the wake of the failure\nto reach agreement on its mandate, despite the persevering\nefforts of its Chairman. It is not in the interests of either\nthe developed or developing countries to allow the impasse\nto continue. In this context we have noted the statement\nmade here by the Secretary of State of the United States\nMr. Vance, on 29 September and his view that \\\"sufficient\nprocedural agreement now exists to resume. substantive\nwork\\\" in the Committee [14th, meeting para. 127]. My\ndelegation considers that there is general agreement that the\nCommittee will negotiate with a view to its adopting\nguidelines on central policy issues, as well as achieving\nagreement on the resolution of fundamental or crucial\nissues underlying problems relating to international economic\nco-operation, as far as possible on the basis of\nconsensus, without prejudice, however, to the rules of\nprocedure of the General Assembly. Obviously, there is no\nprocedural device by which the Committee cm be prevented\nfrom considering any issue related to its mandate. At the same time, it would be the part of wisdom not to\ninsist on consideration by the Committee of those issues on\nwhich there is an absence of broad agreement. This is the\ncourse we wish to follow. We know that consultations are\ncontemplated on this issue. Without prejudice to their\nc outcome, I would venture to suggest that the work of the\nCommittee might be resumed on the basis of an understanding\nalong these lines.\n\n\n53. In any case, we attach more importance to the\nsubstance of the dialogue than to the mechanisms through\n which it is pursued. During the forthcoming months, both\n sides will have ample opportunities to address the fundamental\nissues -- for example, during the current Assembly, at\nthe fifth session of UNISTAD, in the preparations for the next development strategy and at the 1980 special session \nof the General Assembly.\n\n54.\tPreparations should be initiated for a comprehensive operational and time-bound development strategy for the next decade aimed at giving practical shape to all the major elements of the New International Economic Order. This strategy should indicate the specific ways and means of achieving the goals of development co-operation and define the role and contribution of all countries to attaining the common objectives.\n55.\tPakistan hopes that by next year the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will find it possible to resolve the major outstanding issues and to adopt a convention. We are most concerned at the unilateral legislation being contemplated by some advanced countries for the exploitation of the sea-bed beyond national jurisdiction. This will jeopardize the negotiations on the law of the sea and create a chaotic situation with far-reaching political and economic consequences of a most negative character.\n56.\tIn concluding, I should like to make a few brief observations on the reflections of the Secretary-General in the introduction to his annual report on the work of the Organization on the imperative need to struggle for the establishment of a world order based on the central principles of the Charter of the United Nations [see A/33/1, sect. U]\u2014for example, the non-use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes on the basis of justice and international law, and equal rights of nations large and small\u2014in the place of great Power rivalry, the struggle for hegemony and power politics. I fully endorse the Secretary-General's plea for the replacement of systems of political and economic domination by a more democratic international order based on the recognition of interdependence and equal partnership.\n57.\tThe appeal is neither Utopian nor visionary. The international system of peace and security and of economic relations envisaged by the United Nations Charter was\\\" the product, nor of the imagination of poets, philosophers and dreamers, but of the minds of great war leaders and statesmen of the most powerful nations of the world who, with their unrivalled experience of war and peace, had twice in their lifetime seen the suffering and disaster brought about by the untrammelled pursuit of power politics and rivalry for spheres of influence. It is these men who decided to opt for a more civilized international order under the aegis of the United Nations.\n58.\tThe time has come for all of us to seize the opportunity now presented to us to make a small beginning towards the establishment of a universal collective security system in the nuclear era through guarantees for the security of non-nuclear States and for the realization of the great promise of the New International Economic Order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It was a performance unique in the annals of our Organization, which nevertheless is now entering its thirty- third year. Mr. Lazar Mojsov brought honour to his native Yugoslavia, a country with which my country, Mali, has very friendly relations which have been most fruitful since our attainment of international sovereignty.\n132.\tA member of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples since its inception, my country cannot but welcome the accession to independence of Solomon Islands. We salute the struggle of that valiant people. The admission of that country to our Organization brings the United Nations closer to its ultimate objective of universality. My delegation welcomes the sister delegation of Solomon Islands, and through me, wishes to assure it of our loyal and brotherly co-operation.\n133.\tTurning now to this, the thirty-third, regular session of the General Assembly, which has brought us together here, I should like, on behalf of the people and authorities of Mali, to convey my warmest congratulations to the great people of Colombia on the signal tribute which the international community has paid to it by electing to the presidency of the General Assembly of. our Organization one of its best sons in the person of Mr. Lievano, the Colombian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Your great personal attributes, Mr. President, your broad experience of international affairs, based on your long and brilliant career and the quality of the officers of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly, together with the competence of the Secretary-General and his devoted colleagues, ensure the sound and efficient guidance of our work.\n134.\tOur Assembly will have need of such trump cards in order to deal with the many delicate questions of concern to the populations of the 150 States represented in this Assembly.\n135.\tThese concerns are, on the one hand, international peace and security and, on the other hand, something without which that international peace and security can never be guaranteed\u2014I refer to the world economic and social situation.\n136.\tIndeed, we are among those who believe that it is just as important for the international community to deal with economic and social questions as with the dangerous situations that exist in some countries and regions of the world.\n137.\tWith regard to these explosive situations, we are unfortunately bound to admit that this last year again saw serious tensions in international relations.\n138.\tOutside the African continent, conflicts drag on eternally, particularly in the Middle East and in Asia.\n139.\tThe situation prevailing in the Middle East receives particular attention from my delegation, which reaffirms through me the unswerving position of my country.\n140.\tWe note with bitterness that the settlement of problems in this region has made very little progress. Quite the contrary, there is a worsening of the situation because of the arrogance of Israel, whose rigidity is in fact blocking every attempt at a peaceful settlement.\n141.\tA priori, the Government of Mali, for its part, is not opposed to any initiative designed to bring peace back to the Middle East.\n142.\tHowever, my delegation wishes to reaffirm that any just and lasting settlement of the Middle East crisis must of necessity take into account the following considerations: first, the exercise by the Palestinian people of their national rights, including the right to self-determination; secondly, the immediate withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories occupied by force, including the Holy City of Jerusalem; thirdly, the guarantee of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of all States in the region, which have all an equal right to live in peace within legitimate borders.\n\n143.\tOf course, it goes without saying that only a comprehensive settlement associating in the peace process all of the interested parties, and particularly the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole authentic representative of the Palestinian people, can resolve the crisis.\n144.\tIn this context, our country feels that the Lebanese question cannot be isolated from the Middle East situation in general, because of the struggle between the various factions at odds and because of the support they are receiving from abroad. Thus, detente in Lebanon has to come through an improvement in the Middle East situation as a whole.\n145.\tAsia continues to be unsettled. In western Asia there is still a persistent arena of tension in Cyprus, where the situation is still of concern because there it has reached an impasse.\n146.\tMy country feels that any solution of the crisis in Cyprus must be based on the safeguarding of the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment policy of that State.\n147.\tTo achieve this, intercommunal talks are the best means of getting out of the impasse. Hence an appeal should be addressed to both communities to restart those talks, with the assistance and under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n148.\tThe Asian subcontinent can have only a precarious peace as long as Korea has not been properly reunified.\n149.\tThe Korean question, which has for too long been on the agenda of the various sessions of our Assembly, must be finally settled in accordance with the resolution 3390 B (XXX) of the United Nations General Assembly, which, it should be remembered, has from the beginning been the guarantor of the integrity of Korea. My country continues to think that, as that resolution sets forth, the real solution is based on strict respect for the following imperatives: first, the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the fallacious cover of the United Nations; secondly, the dissolution of the so-called \\\"United Nations Command\\\".\n150.\tRespect for these requirements would make possible the peaceful reunification of the country on the basis of three principles of reunification stipulated in the North- South joint communiqu\u00e9 of July 1972. \n151.\tThere can be no doubt that as the result of such a measure we should see seated in our world Organization the true representatives of a people whose experience would surely be valuable.\n152.\tIn this world of torment and anguish the African continent remains, unfortunately the most afflicted, a victim of violence and of attempts at destabilization, with areas of outdated tensions and internal conflicts.\n153.\tIn its southern part, Africa is still suffering from colonialism and is still struggling against a system which is repugnant to human conscience\u2014I mean the hideous system of apartheid.\n154.\tFor many years our Organization has been devoting an important part of its time to the search for proper solutions to the explosive situations that persist in that part of cur continent, where people are still suffering from colonial domination in these final years of the twentieth century.\n155.\tConcerning Namibia, our Assembly held its ninth special session this year. This session had to deal with recent developments in the situation.\n156.\tAfter the successive victories of the nationalist forces, which have forced the South African enemy to come to the negotiating table, the heroic people of Namibia, under the clear-sighted direction and guidance of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPOJ, its sole authentic representative, has agreed to the proposal for a peaceful settlement of the Namibian question, put forward by the five Western Powers members of the Security Council,  which, in its resolution 431(1978), took the first steps towards the full implementation of the proposals of this settlement plan.\n157.\tThe sending to Namibia of the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General \\\"and the publication of the report on his mission  concerning the best way of carrying out the mandate entrusted to him by the Security Council brought a glimmer of hope, which has unfortunately just been snuffed out with the unilateral decision- of the proponents of apartheid to carry out so-called elections, which would, lead the Namibian people to only nominal independence, whereas the Western plan provided for democratic elections under the auspices of the United Nations, the democratic outcome of which, of course, must worry the illegal regime of Pretoria.\n158.\tThis reaction, this turnabout, came as no surprise to my country in so far as we were and have been long aware that the racist regime of Pretoria would do everything possible to bring to naught any attempt to make Namibia a really free and sovereign State. Indeed, to survive, the racist minority South African regime needs to surround itself with a buffer zone of puppet States. Hence any solution which would not make of Namibia another bantustan could never be acceptable to the South African racists.\n159.\tFor the Namibian people, with SWAPO at its head, and for the African peoples, this masquerade shows that there is only one choice: armed struggle.\n160.\tMy delegation dares to believe that the time devoted to the Western plan will not have been spent in vain.\n161.\tAfrica dares to hope that those who believed in the sincerity and serious-minded approach of the racist regime of South Africa will have heeded all the lessons to be learned from their sharp setback and will admit that it is high time for the international community to assume its responsibilities by making every effort totally to isolate a regime which has voluntarily put itself in the dock. In this respect my delegation associates itself with any measure of total and complete embargo against South Africa and harbours the hope that that decision will be vigorously observed by all Member States, including the five Western Powers that sponsored the plan rejected by Pretoria.\n162.\tIn Zimbabwe the situation is no different. Here it is another racist minority regime, the illegal regime of Ian Smith, which is opposed to any solution likely to lead to the application of simple democratic rule of the majority in that Territory.\n163.\tWe now see clearly that the so-called \\\"internal settlement\\\" has settled absolutely nothing at all, since it took no account of the real representatives of the sons of Zimbabwe in the Patriotic Front, which is and remains the only valid spokesman for any process of settlement of the Rhodesian question.\n164.\tTo these peaceful solutions put forward by the valiant freedom fighters Smith and his puppets reply by increasingly ferocious repression and give themselves over in their arrogance to criminal acts of open aggression against the independent neighbour States of Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia.\n165.\tThese military expeditions without a doubt are serious offences against the sovereignty of those States and dangerously jeopardize international peace and security in the region.\n166.\tIn South Africa the dignity and freedom of 20 million blacks continue to be flouted by the unacceptable system of apartheid. Our Organization has repeatedly denounced and condemned this odious policy which has been declared a crime against humanity. In spite of everything, far from improving the situation continues to worsen. Thousands of South African patriots in the ANC and PAC  are still huddled in the white racist prisons. The exploitation and repression have attained unimaginable proportions.\n167.\tFaced with this tragedy the international community has reacted by taking measures designed to remove this scourge.\n168.\tThe conclusions of the recent World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, held in Geneva in August last (see A/33/262], amply showed the need to step up the struggle to eliminate racism, racial discrimination and apartheid.\n169.\tIt is in this same perspective that the peace-loving and justice-loving world celebrated the International Anti- Apartheid Year in accordance with General Assembly resolution 32/105 B.\n170.\tIn. application of this resolution, throughout the length and breadth of my country democratic people's organization and organizations of young people, women and workers organized large-scale demonstrations designed to make public opinion as fully aware as possible of the realities of apartheid and to show their solidarity with their oppressed brothers in South Africa and so to contribute in their own way to isolating the racist regime even more.\n171.\tWhether it is a matter of Namibia, Zimbabwe or South Africa it is quite clear that these racist white minority regimes could not have stayed in power\u2014let alone arrogantly pursued their policy of oppression, exploitation and racial segregation\u2014had they not benefited from the complacence, the support and the complicity of certain Member States of our Organization which, none the less, seek the friendship and the co-operation of the African peoples.\n172.\tRecently serious revelations had been made on the violations by European transnational corporations of the economic sanctions instituted by our Organization against the rebel regime of Salisbury. These facts, which are established, show the international responsibility of certain States, and not those among the least, for the persistence of the crises in southern Africa.\n173.\tFrom this podium, we appeal earnestly to those States to show greater understanding because our peoples cannot stand these serious attacks on their dignity very much longer. Furthermore, it is the duty of every one to abide by the purposes and principles of the Charter and the noble ideals enshrined therein. Human rights here, as elsewhere, must receive the same solicitude.\n174.\tThe rest of Africa also has been very rudely put to the test as a result of the colonial phenomenon. Africa has been shaken by attempts at recolonization and destabilization.\n175.\tThus the Comoros have seen unrest with the intervention of mercenaries, those sworn enemies of the\ncontinent, the worst of whom have even been put at the head of that afflicted brother State. We invite the United Nations to espouse and respect the concerns of the Organization of African Unity [OAUJ, which hopes that the administering Power may complete its undertaking of decolonization, observing the cardinal principles of the OAU Charter, which are: territorial integrity, respect for the frontiers left by the colonialism and non-interference in the affairs of the Comorians.\n176.\tIn the north-west of the continent the conflict of Western Sahara is of concern on more than one count to the people and Government of Mali. Not only is that conflict being waged on our frontiers but it also sets at odds fraternal neighbour States with which Mali has the best of relations.\n177.\tThat is why my country will spare no effort and will support any action\u2014provided it is African action-to promote a proper solution to that conflict between brothers that would take into account the legitimate aspirations of the Saharan people and the no less legitimate stability of the States of the region.\n178.\tConcerning other inter-African conflicts, people have sought to make us believe that they could be resolved by setting up a so-called inter-African force. Vigilance permitted us immediately to realize that such a force, if not established by the OAU within the framework of the liberation of Africa, might become a convenient instrument\nfor enslavement.\n179.\tThat is why on that very important question, President Moussa Traore, the Head of State of Mali, was at pains to clarify Mali's position at the fifteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, held at Khartoum in July, by saying, among other things:\n\\\"If tomorrow it were a matter of setting up a continental force to intensify our struggles for economic and political independence, Mali would be among the first in line in Africa. But that force could only be African, conceived by Africans to guarantee the freedom and security of Africans. An inter-African force would be an impregnable buttress against any foreign aggressor deemed to be such by the Africans. Its vocation would not be to entrench internal unrest or to serve as a protective umbrella for the maintenance of colonial privileges.\\\"\n180.\tThat is how the people and Government of Mali conceive the possible creation and function of an inter- African force.\n181.\tThe peace and security to which mankind aspires are more than ever conditional upon the happiness and prosperity of all.\n182.\tIt is becoming clearer each day to everyone that the world cannot find real peace, and that even the richest countries or the richest strata of the so-called developed societies cannot find a secure future, as long as the huge imbalances between nations have not been overcome.\n183.\tAt the end of this year 1978 the two-thirds of mankind living in anguish are still wondering what the new year holds for them. Quite clearly, they are not really expecting an improvement in their already tragic situation. Indeed, as the Second United Nations Development Decade is coming to a close, the precariousness of their economic and social circumstances and the problem of their survival are acute.\n184.\tWhile 2,500 people are dying every day-I repeat \\\"every day\\\"-the resources made available to the developing countries by the 17 richest countries in the world have gone from $59 billion in 1976 to $65 billion only in 1977\u2014an insignificant increase\u2014less than the rise in the cost of living.\n185.\tMoreover, to be comprehensive, it should be stated that, according to the sources of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, whose Development Assistance Committee has just published its annual report, the total of $65 billion for 1977 includes only $21 billion for public assistance, of which an alarmingly increasing place is occupied by financing at very heavy interest out of a concern, as we know for sheer profit and a regression in the percentage of the gross national product which has not only not reached the target of 0.7, but has dropped from 0.33 per cent in 1976 to 0.31 per cent in 1977.\n186.\tWhat is more, four-fifths of those credits for so-called public assistance contribute to the operation of the economic machinery of the donors in the form of wages and salaries of the famous cohorts of experts and technical assistants of all kinds and the orders to the enterprises of the industrialized countries.\n187.\tThe second terrifying aspect of the general economic situation lies in the devastating effects of the present crisis on the world economy, which is so severely affecting the economies of the developing countries.\n188.\tThe slowing down-of general economic activity has meant a curbing of international trade and has intensified protectionism against developing countries. Those who have recourse to such restrictions imposed on the developing countries even forget that they may go against the aim they have in mind because they jeopardize a much higher rate of exports.\n189.\tFurthermore, those protectionist .practices that are being observed in the economic policies of some industrialized countries give a disquieting dimension to the deterioration in the terms of trade and further stress the iniquity of the rules of international commerce.\n190.\tIn that general context, the African countries are becoming increasingly a sounding-board for those evils which affect the world economy. The 20 African countries which are among the least advanced of the world recorded in the 1970s an annual average growth of only 0.6 per capita of their gross internal product, while the annual average for all the developing countries was 2.7 per cent.\n191.\tAlong the same line of thought, the aims defined by the World Food Conference, held in Rome in 1974 and the 1977 Programme of Action to Eradicate Hunger and Malnutrition contained in the Manila Communiqu\u00e9 of the World Food Councili9 have remained pious hopes. Food production, despite the praiseworthy efforts of the African countries, scarcely attained the annual rate of population growth. It has been established, unfortunately, that that trend will be difficult to reverse as long as the transfer of resources to the agriculture of those countries continues to decline.\n192.\tWorse, throughout the world food has become a source of profit, an instrument for economic and political control, and a means of assuring effective domination of some over the rest of the world, particularly over the \\\"damned of the earth\\\". So the \\\"green revolution\\\" has aggravated the inequalities between the rich exploiters and the enslaved poor.\n193.\tIn order to meet the imperative needs of development, African countries are more and more becoming indebted to the privileged countries.\n194.\tSo that is \\\"how the other half of the world is dying\\\". That is the disturbing picture we have of the world economic and social situation.\n195.\tIn that situation, the reactions of the industrialized countries are disquieting. Their profound guiding philosophy remains that the world economic order should be based on a system at the centre of which is a minority of opulent countries and on the periphery is the majority of dependent countries providing raw materials. However, the serious crisis which has been troubling the world economy in the 1970s has shown how vain that doctrine is. The many attempts at various levels to neutralize this crisis have proved in vain.\n196.\tShould we be pessimistic? It seems that we can discern some changes in attitudes, in sensitivity and even in the positions adopted.\n197.\tRecently, in June, the Ministers of the countries members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development acknowledged for the first time the need for interdependence and the importance of the concept of the mutual interests of the industrialized and the developing countries.\n198.\tIt is a fact that this implacable law of interdependence, which today characterizes the international community, commits us to make a more appropriate reply to the legitimate aspirations of our world, which is facing one of the greatest challenges of mankind. That is what n at stake here\u2014the very survival of two-thirds of the human race.\n199.\tIt is within our ability to act in such a way that a profound and thorough change can be made in international economic relations without delay. The dualism of the world is not only a new scandal but also a serious threat because of the crisis of the North, which is growing weaker in the face of a considerable increase in the power of the South.\n\n200.\tIn terms of the drafting of the new international order, a year ago we established a world institutional framework to promote dialogue on the development of this order and to promote its establishment.\n201.\tUnfortunately, that last-chance dialogue is at a standstill today. The responsibility falls particularly on the so-called developed countries, which persistently reject a proper interpretation of the mandate of the so-called Committee of the Whole, or the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, or which threatened to block the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea by unilaterally enacting national legislation concerning the exploitation of the sea-bed in the international zone. Such attitudes, inspired by national selfishness, are contrary to the letter and spirit of General Assembly resolutions 2574 (XXIV) and 2749 (XXV).\n202.\tAs to the substantive rules of the new international order ..o be established, they must be based essentially on justice and equity because what is unacceptable is the law of the strongest; what is unacceptable is the excessive advantages that some States still have while others stagnate in disadvantageous situations.\n203.\tIt is unacceptable that, in order to live in opulence and waste, some countries take advantage of the poverty and growing indebtedness of the majority of peoples. It is unacceptable that the poor should not receive their proper share of the fruits of growth. It is unacceptable that, as the World Bank has just said so courageously in the conclusion of its annual report on development throughout the world \\\"about 800 million people... still live in absolute poverty\\\"20 and that this fact will for decades to come remain a gigantic problem.\n204.\tMoreover there is no lack of means. Colossal sums are swallowed up daily in developing, manufacturing, perfecting and stocking more and more sophisticated and more and more murderous weapons because of the will to dominate and exploit which, unfortunately, has overcome the noble ideals of peace and justice in our common Charter.\n205.\tThe absurdity and danger of this disgusting waste increasingly shock the public conscience.\n206.\tThat is why, reflecting the anguished voices raised, the non-aligned countries took the initiative in the convening this year of. the tenth special session of the Assembly, which considered this worrying problem of the mad arms race.\n207.\tThe first results obtained were very modest, but they must not be underestimated, and our Organization should pursue untiringly its efforts to achieve new progress oh the road to general and complete disarmament in order to save mankind from the spectre of war and preserve it from general destruction.\n208.\tIn so doing our Assembly will be fulfilling the hopes of the peoples of the United Nations who, after the Second World War, undertook the commitment through the United\nNations Charter.  \\\"... to save succeeding generations front the scourge of war, which twice in out lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind..\n209.\tThis noble objective must remain our aim and to achieve it there is still time to build in the place of this \\\"great disorder\\\" the new order of peace, which must of necessity be based on two pillars: an order of security and an order of justice.\nLet us proceed carefully, Gentlemen, although we are in a hurry.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff268.\tMr. President, first of all I should like to offer you my warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of our Assembly. Nor can I forget your predecessor as\nPresident, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, and the excellent work he did at the thirty-second session.\n269.\tUnlike other sessions, the thirty-third session of the General Assembly is not taking up any new items. It closes a period of intensive activity and at the same time prolongs it in trying to consolidate better the points of agreement that have been found here and' there as a result of the patient dialogue among the different interests in this world. In addition to the special sessions, we have had conferences in various places, each dealing with a specific topic: Geneva, New York, Vienna, Belgrade, Khartoum and Buenos Aires, to mention just a few, and those meetings clearly showed the long road that ideas must follow in order to evolve, ripen and gain acceptance.\n270.\tWithout succumbing to euphoria or to gloom, we can say that the year has indeed been a full one, but what have we achieved?\n271.\tThere can be no doubt that those meetings kindled sparks of hope, with regard to both the fundamental questions of the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples and the establishment of the new international economic order, and the questions of peace and security.\n272.\tNo doubt, too, it would be difficult to ignore <or disregard the slow and laborious effort at understanding made by parties completely divided, both with regard to social life and with regard to political and economic interests. In some almost intractable cases, like it or not, there has been a reawakening of interest in the approach to solutions, although their fundamental political dimensions have not yet changed. This applies to the problems that trouble more than ever before southern Africa and the Middle East. \u2022\n273.\tMoreover, when we take up the economic relations between rich and poor countries we become lost in abstractions in trying to understand the reluctance to change of certain great economic Powers when faced with the necessity for a fundamentally new approach in a deadlocked world which cannot flourish without the active participation of the peoples of the third world.\n274.\tA year of work, even of fruitful work, certainly does not mean a year of security. The Secretary-General recalls in his report on the work of the Organization:\n\\\"One of the main reasons for setting up the United Nations was to replace the struggle for spheres of influence with a more civilized and more representative system of world order in which the nations of the world governed their relations and tackled their common problems with the agreement and participation of all, the weak as well as the strong.\\\" [See A/3311, sect. II.]\n275.\tThirty-three years later it is no longer a question of struggle: it is a question of wars of influence and the desire for acquisition. Fifty-two nations met at San Francisco in 1945 and laid the basis for a Charter that no one disputes but that is daily violated by all those who are moved by the spirit of domination and the bitter need to exploit, in their insatiable desire to enrich themselves. Today, 150 countries \u2014 what progress towards universality! \u2014 are participating in the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. The great majority of those countries have .come to seek co-operation, but above all security, individual security and collective security.\n276.\tThis underlines the gravity of the deadlock in which we find ourselves and to resolve which we must persist in the collective struggle in order to see the ideals of equality, liberty and justice triumph.\n277.\tSecurity, which remains the major concern of the Government of Niger, will be the keynote of my statement this evening. The Assembly will easily understand my anxiety because, as an African, I can hardly remain silent in view of the vast conspiracy which is planned daily in the back rooms where the continent of Africa, that last stronghold of true innocence and genuine humanity, is being remodelled into ideological or economic units to reinforce a system or to ensure an increase of power. Hence the difficulties that are deliberately created to prevent regional groups from forging the necessary strength and solidarity for the development of their peoples; hence the abandonment of development programmes in order to pursue a more urgent need\u2014security; hence the backwardness imposed on the peoples of Africa by their subordinate role as producers and suppliers of raw materials; hence the threats and intimidations that slow down the education effort needed to liberate the masses from the cultural and economic alienation to which they have always been subjected throughout the decades; hence the diabolical plan to destabilize by internal or external force; hence the fratricidal wars which are sparked off as if by magic; and hence the support given to racist South Africa to enable it to continue to trouble the rest of Africa.\n278.\tWe know from experience that this phenomenon is not peculiar to Africa. It has long existed in Latin America and Asia, where it has succeeded in stifling whole generations. Since then it has taken more sophisticated forms but it keeps the same name: interventionism. In whatever disguise interventionism imposes on the Governments and institutions of our States major concerns that go beyond their capacity to control events and which have no relationship with the normal options and priorities of logical development. By thus thwarting all efforts, interventionism imposes its laws, which are designed to create an atmosphere of insecurity, an atmosphere of permanent destabilization, an atmosphere of despair.\n279.\tMany hoped that the African continent, which had just emerged from the black night of colonialism, after millions of its sons had known slavery, exile and dehumanization would finally, at the moment of its rebirth, know the joy of existence and of preparing its future in accordance with principles recognized by all charters.\n280.\tQuickly, alas, those charters were abandoned. The OAU, which very early revealed the determination of the continent to cope with events, after several successes is moving towards impotence and unfortunately tending to become bogged down in paralysing contradictions, nullifying its capacity to damp down even the tiniest flash-point. In this general disarray indifference takes root and the door is opened to interference and insecurity.\n281.\tWhile the insecurity of African States stems in part from the vicissitudes of political options and negative choices with regard to economic flows and the importation of products which the culture of the continent cannot assimilate, it also arises out of the existence of the cancer of South Africa, with apartheid and its henchmen. What man of justice would not feel troubled by the martyrdom of Steven Biko, by all those defenceless men, rejected by the laws of their own country as mere cattle placed in a strait-jacket of non-dignity, non-humanity and nonexistence? Apartheid and its henchmen, not content with crushing the black man in his own country simply because he is black, are sowing destabilization and war in neighbouring countries simply because their inhabitants are black, thus creating a climate of insecurity and anger throughout the continent.\n282.\tAfrica, subjected to the stubborn will of a band of pariahs, has no choice. A cancer is a cancer. It must be cut out, but no one can disregard the consequences of an operation of that kind. The many companies which feed the bonfires in that camp of hell are, we are told, slowly beginning to understand that they cannot play with human life with impunity. There is a time for everything. Perhaps we may express the hope of seeing the Western Powers persevere in the effort they have begun in Namibia and Zimbabwe? Perhaps we may merely express the hope of seeing them finally assume their historical responsibilities in the face of the scourge of apartheid and its henchmen\u2014and I am referring to the Vorsters, the Ian Smiths, the Pik Bothas and the other Bob Denards.\n283.\tThe security of the continent requires that, just as it requires that the umbilical cord that links Pretoria to Tel Aviv be cut. That connexion is another two-way mirror created by the nature of things to perpetuate insecurity in the Middle East and Africa. That is a cancer, like any other.\n284.\tIn addition to the structures of insecurity and the blocking of development in Africa, Africa has to face the demons of ideology which flatter men's minds with sweet-sounding arguments conceived for a kind of intellectual guerrilla warfare. How many men of good faith and goodwill have those sirens enticed to themselves? But Africa, built in an age-old mould, made of patience and attentive tolerance, has always succeeded in regrouping and rejecting thinking which is nothing more than a basely mercenary intention thinly veiled with a few philosophical ideas. Imperialism remains imperialism, in whatever disguise. It costs the same price, the price of the freedom to exist.\n285.\tHow can we make clear the dedication of our countries to liberty and our profound desire to be ourselves, the deep meaning that we give to our solidarity? It is no longer possible to live in a closed community, within a wall. Change, whatever its nature, is always enriching and none of our States rejects it\u2014quite the contrary -but change should in no way be an occasion for flagrant interference, alienation and destruction.\n286.\tMany of those who discover Africa or think, they know it well enough to have praiseworthy feelings of friendship, for it hope to see their own image every time they look deep into Africa's eyes. The simple reality is that\nAfrica is what it is and can be nothing else. It can contract certain childhood illnesses following independence and be cured of them; that is the natural order of things, even if it is inconsistent with a certain logic.\n287.\tTo respect our cultures, our customs, our ways of living and our concept of the present and future is to give us our chance of development. It is a necessary condition of the security of the continent which we dream of achieving in the best interests of our peoples.\n288.\tIn this connexion, we know that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe produced the Final Act, signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975, which has the merit of providing, inter alia, for a code of peaceful and friendly relations among European States, as well as for the establishment of measures of confidence in the conduct of their relations.\n289.\tBut the Final Act of Helsinki will have no value unless its ethic and scope are extended to other, non- European States; in other words, if its signatories, as well as their allies, complete their historic action by prohibiting any intervention or military interference in Africa in particular, whatever the reason or justification. It is against that background that my country will encourage any initiative for the convening of a conference on peace and security in Africa which would give our nations the tranquillity that neither ancient nor modern history has yet succeeded in giving them completely.\n290.\tSecurity problems are great and worrying. We followed attentively the work of the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, a session to which we brought our inmost convictions. The balance of terror which maintains the world under a permanent threat of destruction creates a situation which is both unjust and inadmissible. The stake hardly justified the persistence required to gather together such a quantity of deadly weapons. Whatever the desires of one side or the other, we believe it was impossible to resolve the problems of disarmament and international security during that special session. The background may have changed, but nothing essential changed. We must hope that the super-Powers and those which hope to be super-Powers will be wise enough to respect each other and recognize the uselessness of accumulating weapons whether sophisticated or not. What is the good of having weapons that can destroy the world 10 or 100 times over when the world can die only once?\n291.\tMankind can expect a lot from the nuclear field and disarmament as a whole; it has a right to. So much wealth and intelligence could do much better in the service of development programmes.\n292.\tBut although that elementary truth is often repeated no one thinks of applying it. There is no satisfaction to be gained from the special session on disarmament so long as the notion of development has not superseded that of the strategy of destruction.\n293.\tI referred to security and development. These concepts, which closely affect the life of all the nations which we represent here, are practically indefinable historically. Their basic content deserves greater study.\n294.\tSecurity, we are told, is without price. It often justifies the adoption of the most excessive positions in defence calculations. It pays little heed to the existence of others to whom all kinds of intentions, even the most unlikely, are attributed. In order to establish confidence on the national territory it does not hesitate to make any sacrifice on behalf of the national right to exist. Security conditions everything within the nation-State, confers value on heritage and on interests. It is said that it is better to over-prepare than to be surprised by an enemy. That concept of security is the same everywhere. We can only regret the excesses to which it leads and the withering away of confidence that results in the relations among neighbours which should become closer.\n295.\tUnfortunately that phenomenon is extending to Africa, where certain States are accumulating weapons on a scale quite out of proportion to their internal security requirements.\n296.\tFor young countries such as ours, it is obvious that security and development are two words that go together in theory but are separated in fact. There is no development without security. That is required by the notion of the nation-State. As for economic development, if it is translated in terms of investment programmes and efforts to improve the standard of living it turns its back on security. The two are difficult to reconcile in one budget, particularly when it is a tight budget.\n297.\tThis concern, I was going to say this balance which it is very difficult to establish, is not, unfortunately, the only handicap on certain developing countries, particularly those of the Sahelian region, of which my country is a part. Climate fluctuates and often causes catastrophes in an economy that has no cushion against such shocks. Economies based mainly on agriculture and animal husbandry survive with difficulty the destruction caused by an uncertain climate, particularly when this is spread over a long period.\n298.\tAs the President of the Supreme Military Council, Head of State, Lieutenant-Colonel Seyni Kountche, addressing the nation on 15 April last, said:\n\\\"We are always on the alert, always listening to the needs of villages which have difficult food situations, a water problem, a problem with medicines or a school\nproblem\tWe are continually absorbed, continually\nattentive and continually impatient for the reconstitution of our herds and for the realization of our projects which are delayed ...\n\\\"And you know that in that area our determination has not flinched. You know that the food problem, which is one of our first concerns, is still paramount among our objectives and guides our choices.... Because self- sufficiency in food production is essential for us, it must be achieved if Niger is to control its growth and begin to move towards development at last.\\\"\n299.\tIt is indeed very disturbing that in this era of abundance and waste, this era of advanced technology in which man is reaching out to the conquest of space, millions of other men on earth are daily facing hunger, and sometimes 'succumbing to hunger. This sad reality is perhaps the most serious and shameful of the anachronisms that exist today, a challenge to the whole of mankind.\n300.\tIt is agreed, then, that the problem of food on a world level is no longer one of technology; it is a political question which the whole of the international community and particularly the richest of its members must attack with swift radical measures in order to forestall the risks of a generalized catastrophe whose victims, it is calculated, would be some two-thirds of the world population.\n301.\tWe hardly need point out that these millions of human beings over whom the threats looms so close are mainly members of developing countries, and most particularly of African countries-for Africa is still behind other regions in the development of the production and distribution of food. It does not even produce enough either to compensate for the chronic deficits it suffers year in and year out, or to meet the needs of a growing population, whose rate of growth is the highest in the world. This is an unjust situation for Africa, particularly as this continent has sufficient potential to increase its food production to the point of self-sufficiency and-to maintain it there.\n302.\tIt has often been said and repeated that overpopulation and the demographic explosion of the third world will be at the root of the world food crisis; that being so, it is considered that the solution of the crisis would be to slow down or, indeed, to halt population growth. This is obviously a Manichaean vision of third-world problems, of African problems, for Africa remains one of the most under-populated areas of the globe.\n303.\tReports from FAO, the World Bank or other specialized sources on questions of economic and social development show that there are enormous possibilities for growth in the agricultural sector, if accompanied by the requisite transfer of technology adapted to African structures.\n304.\tThus, these reports also indicate that, by bearing in mind available scientific and technological factors for increasing agricultural production, on the one hand, and all factors which could objectively limit world food production, on the other, we could achieve a world agricultural production capable of feeding 76 billion human beings, that is, a population some 15 to 18 times greater than the present population of the world.\n305.\tHowever serious and precise- this study may be, its conclusions remain and will long remain vain hopes, as long as the political will for their implementation is not present.\n306.\tIt is to this that my delegation\u2014a delegation from a land-locked developing country in the Sahelian region whose constant efforts to mobilize its forces are well known today\u2014once again draws the attention of the delegations here, representatives of States or international organizations, so that our Assembly, individually or collectively, may assume its historical responsibility in the face of the challenge posed today by the world food problem.\n307.\tMy delegation, like many others, believes that, within the framework of efforts for the establishment of the new international economic order, it is necessary to give particular attention to the urgent solution of the food problem.\n308.\tThat, in our view, is one of the many, but fundamental, aspects of the security which our nations have a right to claim. This is an elementary need which must first be satisfied, together with the other primary needs of health and education.\n309.\tIt is with this in mind that my country has supported and continues to support the setting up of the International Fund for Agricultural Development and, in general, the activities of the FAO and other agencies of the United Nations family.\n310.\tThe efforts made by Mr. Saouma, the Director- General of the FAO, to implement a strategy and open up long-term prospects for a rapid increase in food production in Africa merit attention. We dare to hope that this analysis will contain a genuine plan of action for a radical struggle against drought' and other permanent dangers posed by locusts and other enemies of the crops in numerous parts of Africa today.\n311.\tMy delegation would also make an urgent appeal to our respective Governments to respond more fully to the plans of action adopted in Nairobi  with regard to the struggle against desertification and in Mar del Plata for the development and exploitation of potential water resources. \n312.\tThat is the contribution I wished to make, on behalf of my country, to the debate of this thirty-third regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Security, in its numerous aspects, is at the heart of the concerns of all States, particularly the young States, which are the most vulnerable. However, the main task incumbent on everyone is above all to feed, care for and educate our populations. Consequently, let us look beyond the intentions which we sometimes read into the activities of others, let us cultivate a spirit of universal detente and let- us together resolutely take the beneficial path of genuine international co-operation\u2014the only path likely to relieve humanity of its sufferings and thus to solve the many problems confronting it.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff2.\tMr. President, your election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly deserves my sincere congratulations. Your long experience in diplomacy, government and journalism, combined with your knowledge of the United Nations, make you eminently suited to that high office. The delegation of Mauritius assures you of its co-operation in the fulfilment of your mission.\n3.\tWe greatly appreciated the excellent work of your distinguished predecessor, Lazar Mojsov, during the thirty-second session and the tenth special session, on disarmament. The dedication and devotion, of the Secretary- General and his staff over the last year also deserve our praise. The appointment of Mr. Kenneth Dadzie to the post of Director-General for Development and International Economic Co-operation is greatly appreciated by all. His long experience in the United Nations and in the service of his country will, I am sure, be of great value to all of us. My delegation also welcomes the admission of Solomon islands to the great family of the United Nations.\n4.\tFinally, I should like to express my heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the Governments and peoples of those Member States, such as India, Bangladesh and Iran, which have recently been the victims of natural disasters, and to the Government and people of Kenya in their bereavement on the loss of their great President, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta.\n5.\tMy country views with concern the intensifying conflicts among African States on the continent of Africa.\n6.\tThe process of \\\"destabilization\\\" of peace and progress there only endangers the frail economies of the newly independent States. Though this serious conflict in Africa is among African States, the role of foreign Powers there is certainly of importance. If there is an opposition of interests among different African countries, it is obvious that there is also, regrettably, the expansionism of certain outside Powers.\n7.\tThe background of the conflict in Africa is, I believe, an everlasting desire for recolonization on the part of old or new masters. For us the fundamental problem is that Africa, which is' fighting a hard battle against poverty, finds itself in a dependent position in the present world economic order and has no hope of redress in the foreseeable future. There is no projection for world development pointing to a reduction of the gap in production and consumption which separates the rich from the poor in the world.\n8.\tInequality and dependence mean that our economic structures are organized around the needs of the multinational corporations, and thus the development of national capital is retarded, our pattern of investment distorted and the result is the stagnation of technical development and of the advance of productivity.\n9.\tDebt increases and service payments are becoming a serious burden, thus causing a chronic balance-of-payments problem. A deficit country must deflate, devalue its currency, or borrow. Borrowing solves nothing in the long run. Devaluation neither changes the fact that one is poor nor improves the ability to compete against the rich. And deflation makes sustained expansion impossible. In such a system a country which begins in poverty ends in poverty.\n10.\tThese deficiencies in the present world economic order constitute a serious drawback to our development and impose inequality upon us, thus perpetuating suffering and poverty. During the last decade we have begun to understand what the world economic order means for us in Africa. We find it increasingly difficult to accept the prospect of permanent stagnation and deepening poverty. The process of change continues even after independence. Self-assertion and intensified nationalist pressure are already evident in every part of Africa. The developed countries find that they are dependent upon the maintenance of existing economic and political relationships. They need our exports and our labour. \n\n11.\tThe real problem is therefore an opposition of interests between Africa and the developed countries. For evident reasons, African countries want and need basic changes in the present pattern of relationships with the developed countries. The reaction of many developed countries to these desired changes is unfortunately one of diffidence and stiffened resistance. Every African demand, every change of government, every clash, is construed as something sinister. The growing tendency towards foreign intervention is highly dangerous, as it threatens the peace and security of Africa. The recent resolutions and declarations adopted at the fifteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], held at Khartoum from 18 to 22 July 1978, [see A/33/235], highlighted this danger and reaffirmed the right of each African State to choose its own political system and friends.\n12.\tJust as Africa is trapped in an inequitable world economic order, so are the people of southern Africa trapped in apartheid and colonialism. The OAU Assembly reaffirmed its support for the liberation struggle in southern Africa and decided to increase its support and assistance to the liberation movements there.\n13.\tMy Government fully appreciates the efforts of the five Western Powers of the Security Council and those of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, regarding Namibia. We have no doubt that they, in turn, have appreciated the co-operation of the African delegations, as well as that of South West Africa People's Organization SWAPO. The hope of a peaceful settlement in Namibia is real now, despite recent public statements by South Africa. The efforts of the five Western Powers have borne fruits which may still be green; but with more sustained patience the harvest will be rich. I am satisfied that the Secretary- General, with his wisdom and patience, will find a solution possible after the new Government in South Africa has been nominated.\n14.\tMy delegation fully supports the report of the Secretary-General,  which is in accordance with the mandate given to him by Security Council resolution 431 (1978) of July 1978. The clarifications and interpretations are now clear. The Security Council should, therefore, in my opinion, be in a position to adopt a draft resolution approving the report of the Secretary-General and to give him a mandate regarding the United Nations Transition Assistance Group.\n15.\tBoth the future of Namibia and the authority, as well as the credibility, of the United Nations may today seem to be in jeopardy. However, I am confident that the Security Council and the Secretary-General will know how to take appropriate action and to ensure that Namibia achieves genuine independence and sovereignty.\n16.\tAs to the illegal regime in Zimbabwe, it can hardly be expected to last much longer. We can look forward to early independence for its people, who have suffered so much. The internal settlement has proved sterile and has shown\n\nthat the process of decolonization, by force or otherwise, is irreversible.\n17.\tThe session of the OAU Assembly held at Khartoum in July noted the dangerous and increasingly deteriorating situation in the Middle East. The continued denial of the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination must stop, and Israel must comply with the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council. There can be no peace in the Middle East as long as the Palestinians are denied their legitimate rights.\n18.\tMy Government welcomes the efforts of the President of the United States, Mr. Carter, the President of Egypt, Mr. El-Sadat, and the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Begin, to move towards a solution of the Middle East question. We welcome the Camp David accords  as a first positive step in the right direction. We reiterate our view, however, that only the Peace Conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and under the co-chairmanship of the United States and the USSR, with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization, '\\\"/ill provide the framework for a just and lasting peace in the region.\n19.\tMy Government also welcomes the efforts made by the Government of the Republic of Korea and those of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve, through friendly and constructive negotiations, a solution acceptable to both countries and the international community.\n20.\tMauritius, as you know, is particularly concerned with events in the Indian Ocean. Recent events in the Horn of Africa and in the western Indian Ocean have stirred considerable anxiety in my country. We have constantly been calling on the great Powers to refrain from increasing their military presence in our region. We should like to see in the near future the convening of a conference of all the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean, under the auspices of the United Nations, with the object of finding effective means for ensuring the creation of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. My Government has already offered Mauritius as the venue of such a Conference.\n21.\tThe problem of arms limitation in the Indian Ocean is quite crucial for Mauritius. It is only one aspect, however, of a larger problem about which we are all concerned.\n22.\tMankind is confronted with an unprecedented threat of self-extinction arising from the massive and competitive accumulation of the most destructive weapons ever produced. The danger- of -\\\"war, including nuclear war, is increasing despite efforts to strengthen international peace and security. Disarmament is no longer an option; it is the only alternative to universal destruction. I have repeatedly stressed the imperative need-for such action. The tenth special session of the General Assembly that took place in May and June of this year offered a unique opportunity to achieve this end. Though it had limited success, yet it laid the foundations for an international disarmament strategy that aims at general and complete disarmament under effective international control. This, in turn, will strengthen the procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes.\n23.\tThe task before the members of the international community is to rise to a different level of understanding of both their rights and duties in international relations and to conduct their policies in conformity with the universal interests of peace, security and development all over the world.\n24.\tIn order to strengthen the rule of law and the means for the peaceful settlement of international disputes, I reaffirm the previous proposal of my country to establish a body of the General Assembly for the peaceful settlement of disputes in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n1.\tMr. President, I wish to offer you the sincere congratulations of my delegation on your unanimous election to the presidency of our Assembly. Your election is a tribute to your country, Colombia, and also a reflection of the knowledge which delegations have of your valuable contributions to this Assembly and to important international conferences. We are confident that this experience and the fruits of your impressive career will allow you to follow the exemplary presidency of Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia with distinction and success.\n2.\tMay I also extend a very warm welcome to the one hundred and fiftieth Member of the United Nations-Solomon Islands. We are especially pleased that the right of the peoples of Solomon Islands to self-determination and independence has been achieved peacefully and with the full co-operation of the United Kingdom as the administering Power.\n3.\tWe begin another session of the General Assembly with a full agenda. The list of problems before us this year is long-as long as ever it has been. In all, we will debate almost 130 questions before this session closes in December.\n4.\tIt is evident from one look at this formidable list of complex international issues that the Secretary-General is right to say, as he does in his report on the work of the Organization, that global order is increasingly indispensable and that we need a sense of human solidarity which will find expression in a strong family of international institutions [see A/3311, sect. I].\n5.\tWill the work done here over the next three months show real evidence of this sense of human solidarity? Will\nour debates and resolutions advance us further towards that global order which the Secretary-General says is now indispensable? These seem to me to be the fundamental questions underlying virtually all the individual problems on our agenda.\n6.\tAt the centre of many, if not all, of these issues is an injustice or conflict arising from the political or economic dominance of one group, of one country or of one interest, and the consequent exclusion or suppression of another. Such situations are by their nature unstable. In a world where all major problems are now interrelated and interact on one another, injustice leading to instability in any one area can be a danger to us all.\n7.\tClearly, efforts to maintain domination in human relations today are dangerous and wrong. Instead, we need, in every area of international life, to try to replace domination by participation and co-operation. In this way we can hope to create patiently and by stages a more just and a more stable world order. In doing this, we will need to use to the full all the possibilities offered by this great Organization and the family of international institutions, of which it is the core.\n8.\tIt is clear, of course, that this cannot be achieved all at once-and perhaps in a complex world it will never be wholly achieved. The Secretary-General has done well to warn us that there are many issues where, at best, we may be able to contain and defuse the problem and allow time for a settlement to evolve.\n9.\tMany of these problems do not yield immediately to settlement because they have roots which go deep into history. But though the past constrains us in these cases, it does not wholly determine the choices now open to us. How we face these inherited problems in our day will decide what the next generation to ours will inherit in its turn. We can pass on or add to the burden which we have inherited, or, instead, we can begin to lift this burden-even if it takes years to remove it completely.\n10.\tSome here, of course, carry greater responsibility than others for the origin of particular problems; and some will have to do more than others to contribute towards a solution. The contribution which each of us can make in any particular case will depend on our capacity and on our degree of involvement. But since we have a world Organization where these issues are debated and voted on, all of us have some responsibility, and all of us need to do what we can to contribute towards a settlement.\n11.\tI would summarize as follows the principles which will guide my country on the issues before us in the United Nations.\n12.\tFirst, we accept the fact that, though we are a small country, even distant problems and conflicts do concern us, because of a sense of human solidarity and because we know that many of the larger issues can be dealt with only on a global scale and by a common effort to which we all contribute.\n13.\tSecondly, we reject relations based on domination by any one group over any other. Our aim, instead, is to see participation and co-operation take the place of domination in every area of human life, and we have tried to act accordingly ourselves.\n14.\tThirdly, we accept that peoples have a right to see to their own security, but not in ways which seriously threaten or endanger the security of others and contribute to the insecurity of all.\n15.\tFourthly, we want to see the resources of our planet shared more equitably and with due regard to the need for conservation where they are limited. The conspicuous waste which is a feature of some of the more advanced societies not only should not but cannot be repeated on a world scale.\n16.\tFifthly, we believe that peoples of diverse outlook and culture must be free to develop in accordance with their own traditions and their own understanding of their own needs. The structure of relations between communities and nations should be such as to help and promote this, and any structures or practices which inhibit or prevent it must be changed. But there can be no uniform model for development, and the international community should not try to impose one. Instead, it should promote conditions in which each people can develop, in its diversity, to its full potential.\n17.\tSixthly, our concern and our sense of human solidarity is directed not to States only but to people as individual human persons. We believe that there are certain minimum requirements for human dignity which cut across cultural differences and national boundaries, and which men and women everywhere are entitled to expect as of right. In a world of such diversity it will take much patient discussion and growth of understanding in various bodies to develop fuller agreement on these rights and on how they are best given effect. But, in my view, we have already gone well beyond the stage where any one of us could claim that the denial within our borders of a basic minimum of individual human dignity is a wholly private matter and not a legitimate concern of the whole international community.\n18.\tSeventhly, we believe that progress can be made towards a better world order and a greater sense of human solidarity and interdependence where States of a particular region with a common outlook come together in a regional grouping or organization, provided that they also show a sense of wider solidarity and concern extending beyond their own group to humanity as a whole.\n19.\tIreland is one of the nine member States of the European Economic Community and this helps us - to extend and deepen our relations with other countries and groups. The common viewpoint of the nine States on many of the issues on the agenda was expressed here two days ago\nby our President, the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany, and we share fully in those views.\n20.\tEighthly, we believe that, however regional organizations or groups may evolve, we shall always have need of a world organization to deal with world problems: the political, economic and social problems of mankind as a whole. The United Nations, together with the family, of more specialized organizations which has grown around it, is such a body; and for all its faults it has already done much, over more than 30 years, to promote that sense of human solidarity which its Secretary-General has asked us to show.\n21.\tThis, in broad outline, is the approach which the Irish delegation will take to the complex of issues before us at this Assembly. Some of these are global issues of direct concern to all of us. Some are problems of instability and conflict in particular regions which also present wider dangers. I turn now to indicate in more concrete terms our viewpoint on some of these specific issues.\n22.\tThis year, for the first time, the General Assembly held a special session on disarmament, its tenth. The session was attended by many Heads of Government, including my Prime Minister, Mr. Lynch, who set out very fully the views of the Irish Government.1 One good result of the session was the establishment of new negotiating and deliberative bodies with wider participation. We hope that this will breathe new life into disarmament negotiations.\n23.\tWe welcome the positive outcome of the special session. But we believe that its success will be measured only by the extent to which States translate into concrete measures the principles and programme they accepted in the Final Document [resolution S-10/2J. All countries, and especially the nuclear Powers, must show the political will to take real steps towards disarmament, and to escape from the vicious cycle of competition which, instead of contributing to their own security, is in fact adding to the insecurity of all. All nations claim that their armaments and military power are purely for their own security. They ask others to accept this on trust. But the military strength so acquired can arouse distrust in others and can be an instrument for the domination of others or for intervention elsewhere. Military strength does not even have to be used; its mere existence gives power to those who control it, which others less powerful may have to respect.\n24.\tThe major Powers must accept that ever-increasing armaments, which they claim are purely for defence or basic security, promote such distrust and insecurity in others that they feel obliged in turn to build up their own military capacity. Some non-nuclear States feel that even the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is discriminatory and is designed .to perpetuate the dominant position of the nuclear Powers. As representative of Ireland, a small country whose Foreign Minister first proposed such a treaty in a draft resolution presented to this Assembly as far back as 1958,2 I cannot agree. But I do agree that the\nvoluntary renunciation of nuclear weapons by countries such as my own which have signed the Treaty makes it all the more incumbent on the nuclear Powers to take steps to limit the build-up of armaments. Moreover, the nuclear Powers should give clear and unambiguous guarantees not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States. Such guarantees should be in a form which does not undermine or substitute for the non-proliferation Treaty but rather helps to strengthen it and promotes wider adherence to it as a treaty providing a regime of universal nuclear responsibility.\n25.\tApart from the particular problem posed by nuclear weapons, we have witnessed in the years since the Second World War an ever-increasing build-up and spread of so-called conventional weapons. The millions of dead and maimed in the many conflicts fought with conventional weapons remind us that it is not just nuclear weapons whose spread and use must be prevented. Moreover, it is a scandal that countries whose people live in poverty should be encouraged to buy arms and trained to use them against their neighbours, whose people, though just as poor, have been similarly armed and trained. The suffering of the poor and the innocent should be alleviated by the financial resources of the wealthy and powerful rather than aggravated by their destructive resources.\n26.\tBut although we should aim to divert resources from armaments to development, the poorer countries of the world simply cannot afford to wait until disarmament has been achieved. It is questionable whether even diversion of the whole of the world's expenditure on arms, vast as it is, would be enough to meet what is urgently required.\n27.\tThe figures are startling. One quarter of the population of the earth controls 80 per cent of its income and consumes 80 per cent of its protein. In contrast, 40 per cent of the world's population are so poor that they hardly even enter the world's economy as purchasers at all. The poorer countries have only 7 per cent of the world's industry, and more than half the output even of that industry comes from five countries only.\n28.\tTo the developed countries this huge disparity may once have seemed to be due entirely to the superior skills or abilities of their own peoples. It is clear, however, that, on the contrary, this disparity is in very large part due to distorted economic relations which have evolved over the centuries. Apart from the special case of oil, a study has shown that the 12 major primary products, which brought the developing countries about 80 per cent of their export earnings, brought them a total income of $30 billion. Those same commodities, when processed in the developed world, were worth $200 billion, nearly seven times what the developing countries earned by the sale of the raw materials.\n29.\tThere is no evidence that either God or nature has determined once and for all the relationship which should exist between the price of goods processed or manufactured in the developed world and the price which the primary-producing countries get for the raw materials. What has determined the relationship is the emergence of a serious structural imbalance in the world economy, which had its origin in the position of dominance which the developed\nworld established for itself and which now helps to sustain it. If interdependence and co-operation are to replace domination in international life we need now a serious commitment by the developed world to accept significant changes in the structures of international economic relations, changes which can help to bring about a more just and equitable international economic order.\n30.\tThe Secretary-General's call to all of us to show a greater sense of human solidarity applies here with particular force. The developed world must learn to accept major changes because it is dangerous and wrong that the international economic system should grossly undervalue the productive output which the countries of the poorer two-thirds of the world have to offer. The developing countries, on the other hand, must accept that change will have to be carefully made. The system may be unfair, even perhaps grossly unfair, but it cannot be dismantled all at once without the gravest damage to all. What is required is a genuine and urgent commitment to reform and a willingness to co-operate and negotiate the major reforms which are needed.\n31.\tThe developed countries are not themselves all of a piece. There are countries like my own which, prosperous as they are in proportion to the third world, are underdeveloped in many ways in comparison with their neighbours. As we rightly seek to develop our own economies for the benefit of our own people, we may have to face some difficult choices. In some industries we may find ourselves in competition with the more successful developing countries as they seek to industrialize, and we may have to weigh our international moral obligations very directly in the balance against the immediate economic interests of our own people. However, it must surely be recognized that it would not be equitable that within the developed world the main burden of the restructuring which is necessary should fall on the weaker part of it.\n32.\tSome industrially developed countries have in fact opted out of their obligations. If we as a small and less prosperous country with limited resources, which was itself the subject of economic exploitation for so long, accept our responsibility, we cannot agree that other more powerful and technologically advanced countries should refuse to do so.\n33.\tThe developing countries, on the other hand, will, I hope, be wise enough to see that their aim cannot and should not be to recreate throughout the world that profligate waste of resources which is a feature of present-day industrialized societies. As I said earlier, the help which I believe these developing countries need is help to create conditions in their own societies which will be consistent with their own aims and their own traditions, and which, I hope', will show a greater respect than the industrialized world has yet shown for the natural limits of the resources and the environment of our small planet.\n34.\tEconomic and social development is but one aspect of the wider question of the achievement of human rights based on the acceptance of the dignity and worth of the human person.\n35.\tThis year we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nThe Universal Declaration had, and continues to have, great moral force in the world. Its preamble and articles were a source of enormous hope to those who had survived the terrors of totalitarianism and world war, and its emphasis on the dignity of the individual human being was widely welcomed. Many countries have now incorporated its elements in their constitutions or basic laws, and it continues to provide an ideal for the aspirations of our citizens.\n36.\tOf course, those who drafted the Declaration knew that it was only a beginning and that much further work would be needed to develop in more detailed and specific form the general principles which it set out. In the intervening 30 years a great deal of work has been tackled and a body of international law and practice on human rights has been built up.\n37.\tI should like to comment on just one aspect of recent human rights deliberations in the United Nations system.\n38.\tThere is now wide agreement that situations which demonstrate a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights are a proper matter for international concern and are not within the exclusive domestic jurisdiction of States. This agreement is reflected in the large majorities of the General Assembly in recent years in condemning human rights violations in Chile and southern Africa. We welcome this general agreement and would like to see it apply consistently to the human rights problems everywhere.\n39.\tThere are obviously other countries where civil authorities deliberately and constantly repress basic rights, even in defiance of their own publicly expressed and freely accepted international commitments. These failures threaten the process of detente and relaxation of world tensions in the interests of world peace. They must also adversely affect the confidence and support of international public opinion, which is a highly important factor in this process.\n40.\tAt the United Nations we are now at the stage where it is necessary to take every step open to us to establish and confirm the international will to investigate consistent patterns of gross human rights violations. An important advance in this area occurred this year when agreement was finally reached between the Government of Chile and the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Situation of Human Rights in Chile for the visit of members of the Working Group to Chile in pursuance of General Assembly resolutions. We await the report of that Group. On the other hand, the racist regime in South Africa continues to ignore our consistent condemnations of apartheid and massive violations of human rights in that region. My country utterly abhors and rejects racism, and my delegation will play its full part in our deliberations on this matter.\n41.\tI said earlier that our aim was to strengthen the United Nations so that it can become a better instrument for the maintenance of peace and the promotion of justice. We have always considered that if there is a role for other nations in local or regional conflicts it is ideally exercised not by direct intervention, but on behalf of the international community as a whole as part of a United Nations peace-keeping operation.\n42.\tMy Government has demonstrated its commitment by supplying over the years some 17,000 Irish soldiers to nine different peace-keeping operations in turn, and this is from a very small Irish permanent defence force. Over this past year, United Nations peace-keeping activities have increased both in scope and significance. In order to support peace-keeping and the useful work of the United Nations Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations, Ireland, in common with its partners in the European Community, believes that it would be useful if the General Assembly were to adopt by general agreement a declaration of support for peace-keeping.\n43.\tIn keeping with our policy, Ireland in May of this year sent a battalion to serve with UNIFIL, and we have recently agreed to augment that force. We felt it our duty, and indeed are proud, to contribute in a practical way to making the United Nations more effective as an instrument in the cause of peace and to help a troubled country. In its first six months UNIFIL has indeed achieved a great deal, and in this context I should like to congratulate the Secretary-General and the Force Commander, Major-General E. A. Erskine, for their conduct of this operation, which called far a high degree of courage, judgement and resourcefulness. The Force has succeeded in exerting its control over most of its area of operation and has contributed to the achievement of peace and stability for many of the people of that area. The Secretary-General has, however, rightly pointed out that much remains to be done. It is vital that UNIFIL be enabled to operate freely throughout its entire area of operations, and that the Lebanese Government should re-establish its authority in southern Lebanon.\n44.\tIt is a cause of grave concern to my Government that certain armed elements, supported from outside Lebanon, continue to restrict the freedom of movement and the full deployment of UNIFIL and likewise to resist the deployment within Lebanon of properly constituted elements of the Lebanese army. I would therefore appeal to all States with influence in the area to ensure that all parties give their full co-operation to UNIFIL so as to enable it to discharge its mandate and contribute generally to peace in the Middle East.\n45.\tIn common with other members of the European Community we continue to support the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Lebanon. The Lebanese situation is in itself inextricably linked with the over-all problems of the Middle East, and a satisfactory solution of Lebanon's problems requires progress towards a general settlement in the Middle East.\n46.\tSince the situation in the Middle East was last debated in this Assembly there have been important developments. Some of them seem to offer hope of progress towards a stable and comprehensive, peace in that area. Others again remind us just how complex and intractable the problems of that region are.\n47.\tAlong with our partners in the European Community we commended. the courageous initiative taken by the President of Egypt, Mr. El-Sadat last year, and more recently the important step taken at Camp David by the President of the United States, Mr. Carter, President El-Sadat and the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Begin.\n48.\tIt is our hope that all of these efforts will lead in time to a just, stable and comprehensive settlement which will take account of all aspects of a difficult and complex problem. Such a settlement in our view will require careful and patient negotiation; and it must involve all of the parties and respect the rights of all of the parties.\n49.\tIn our view such a settlement should start from Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) and should also take full account of the principles which the member States of the Community, including Ireland, set out in the statement on the Middle East made by their Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers at the European Council meeting in London on 29 June 1977. In particular, as we have made clear, there should be acceptance of the rights of all States in the area to live within secure, recognized and adequately guaranteed boundaries; and there must be respect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinians, which would include their right to participate in the determination of their own future and would take into account also their right to a homeland. I sincerely hope that what has been done may become a beginning on the difficult road toward such a settlement.\n50.\tI have recently had the opportunity to learn at first hand in Africa the views of some African leaders, both in regard to the development of their own countries and in regard to wider political issues. It was made clear to me that the desire of Africans today is to create their own structures of society best fitted for African needs, drawing on and developing their own traditions, while accepting what seems valuable from outside. Africans wish, in other words, to be masters of their own destiny, and look to others to co-operate with them in this task, both economically and politically.\n51.\tIt is also plain that the wish of African States to assert their own individuality has not lessened their willingness to work together in the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and to co-operate at the world level in the United Nations. The high hopes for African unity and the OAU may not always have been fulfilled. It is not realistic to expect that all of Africa's problems, whether indigenous to the continent or bequeathed by colonial rule, can be easily or quickly overcome, but we support the desire of African States to seek African solutions for African problems. We in Europe know only too well how long it takes to create structures to enable us to pursue common interests and concerns together, despite all that we have in common, and indeed those structures that we have are as yet only partial.\n52.\tThe unfinished business in southern Africa remains one of the most likely causes of serious international tension today. The damage to Africa's development and the diversion of resources that stem from these unresolved issues are very great. The injustice of domination by one human group over another, the consequent instability and the dangers inherent in delay in resolving such issues are nowhere more evident than in southern Africa.\n53.\tThe folly of the white minority regime in Rhodesia in trying to maintain its rule by excluding the majority from any effective participation in government is clear for all to see. The consequences of allowing a situation to drift for too long, and a lack of zeal in carrying policies through, are\nevident. A renewed effort must be made to bring all parties to the conflict in Zimbabwe together, so that the transfer of power to the majority may take place peacefully. The alternative is a continued and agonizing struggle which will bring further suffering and misery to all races in Zimbabwe and risk a wider conflict that will engulf surrounding countries. Ireland will continue to implement the sanctions which were imposed by the Security Council to bring effective pressure on the Smith regime to negotiate on a realistic basis.\n54. In Namibia, we have in the past year had cause to hope that, in contrast, concerted action by the international community and by some of its members in particular, would lead to a just and internationally acceptable solution. The five Western members of the Security Council demonstrated by their efforts their commitment to peaceful change and acceptance of a responsibility to ensure the exercise of self-determination in Namibia. The Presidents of the front-line States, accepting the good faith behind these efforts, worked unceasingly to ensure their success. The South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPOJ put aside its justifiable suspicions of South Africa. South Africa appeared to demonstrate a new realism. It is a grievous disappointment then that South Africa has drawn back by rejecting the Secretary-General's detailed proposals3.1 am convinced that pressure on South Africa to change its mind must be maintained and that the South African Government should be left in no doubt as to the very serious consequences that will ensue if it further resists the will of the international community on this issue, in which the United Nations has a very particular involvement.\n55.\tThe root of the problems in southern Africa lies of course in South Africa itself, in the policies of systematic racial discrimination of apartheid. I do not propose to spell out in detail my views on the apartheid system, which I outlined to this Assembly last year.\\\" I would simply say in summary that it is criminal because it condemns millions of people to a second-class existence within their own country, to the destruction of their social and family life and to oppression when they resist; it is hugely wasteful because it deprives the country of the talents of many of its most gifted citizens; it is disastrous because it is bound to fail; and it is tragic because the descendants of those who successfully fought for self-determination against the then colonial Power now deny it to their fellows and claim to be acting in the name of Christianity and as defenders of Western civilization. I believe that we who hold these values have a special responsibility to reject this claim. The reality is that it is white South Africa that, in claiming to defend these values, does them the greatest outrage.\n56.\tThe problem we face is that those who hold power in South Africa and their supporters refuse to see the reality of the world around them. How do we get them to open their eyes? Unfortunately I can see no sign that they are prepared to make the fundamental changes in policy that are required to avert disaster or, indeed, even to take the\nfirst step down such a road. No one should pretend that constructing a multiracial society is an easy task, but the longer it is postponed the more difficult it becomes and the greater the likelihood of violence. My Government is therefore fully convinced that co-ordinated outside pressure on South Africa is required to bring it to change its policies. We are determined to play an active part, both here in the United Nations and with our partners in the European Community, in the formulation and implementation of effective international measures to this end.\n57.\tIn the meantime the world also has a responsibility to show its concern in a practical way for those who suffer under the apartheid system and to support the United Nations funds for this purpose, particularly in this International Anti-Apartheid Year. The South African Government should, as this Assembly has so often requested, release those imprisoned solely for opposition to its apartheid laws\u2014such as, for example, the young Christian workers recently arrested\u2014and it should refrain from actions, such as the proposed execution of Solomon Mahlangu, which can only serve further to embitter the situation.\n58.\tFinally, I should like to report to this Assembly, as successive Irish Foreign Ministers have done, on a problem of direct concern to us: that of Northern Ireland. I think it is important because for this Organization to maintain its credibility each of us must be ready to accept, in the case of problems which involve our own direct interests, the standards of conduct which we want to see applied to problems in which we are not directly involved.\n59.\tThis year, I am pleased to be able to bring to this Assembly a message of greater hope about Northern Ireland It is true that it is violence generally which makes headlines in the world press. But it is important to look beyond the headlines to the fact that, in Northern Ireland, violence is now clearly seen as futile, and that it is rejected and repudiated by all except a tiny minority.\n60.\tThere are signs of new thinking on the part of all of those concerned with this problem\u2014within Northern Ireland itself, in the island of Ireland as a whole, and in the United Kingdom, with which, on this difficult subject, my Government has regular and close consultation. The new thinking and the hope to which I referred derive in part from progress and new developments in Ireland. Today the Republic has one of the fastest growing economies in Western Europe. The problems of inflation and unemployment are being brought under control.\n61.\tNow that both parts of the island are within the European Economic Community, we have become more conscious than ever of the extent to which the problems aid opportunities we face are similar in both parts of the island. There is a. new mood which recognizes that on many questions we have common interests which are best pursued in common. My Government would like to ensure that there is a clear awareness: abroad of this new mood and of the new possibilities in Ireland.\n62.\tI stressed at the outset of this statement my belief that relations based on domination or fear of domination by any one: group over any other must be replaced by participation\nand co-operation. In dealing with problems of divided communities anywhere, what is necessary is to build trust and reconciliation on a basis of respect for a diversity of traditions and outlook. In such cases, reconciliation can be promoted and encouraged by political institutions which are broad and generous enough to take account of differing aspirations while expressing and promoting common interests.\n63.\tWe have always believed that it would be in the interests of all of the people of Ireland and of good relations between the Irish and United Kingdom Governments if the people of Ireland were to come together by consent, by negotiation and under agreed structures. Without taking from the rights of the majority in Northern Ireland, we would hope to persuade the United Kingdom Government also of this point of view, so that It should indicate its interest in the unity of Ireland by agreement, in independence, and in a harmonious relationship between the two islands.\n64.\tAs we move into a new era of confidence and opportunity, both within Ireland and internationally, I am convinced that we will be able to reassess the relationships ant attitudes which we have inherited from history and which in the past have been a source of tension and conflict.\n65.\tThis reconciliation that we hope to see in the island of Ireland would release new energies and open up new opportunities in a new and changing international economic environment. Our belief is that we can share a bright and hopeful future in Ireland and that in so sharing we would all be enriched and be able to play a fuller part internationally.\n66.\tHere before our brother nations, I want to tell our brother Irishmen of old traditions-that we respect their past and have confidence in their future.\n67.\tWhile the problems of Northern Ireland have been acute they can scarcely compare with the terrible human problems that have persisted elsewhere. I know that many people from all parts of Ireland are engaged in unselfish service-in developing countries. It seems essential, then, that we should find new political understanding to encourage that service.\n68.\tThe voice of my Government is heard in the European Community, at these United Nations> and in our relations with these developing countries. We believe that the voice of Ireland will be all the more persuasive when, as we hope, it speaks on behalf of the people of the whole island of Ireland with their agreement and consent.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff59.\tFirst of all, I wish to congratulate you warmly, Sir, as a prominent Colombian statesman, on your election to the lofty and important office of President of the thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly.\n60.\tI salute the important contribution made by Mr. Lazar Mojsov to the work of our Organization during the past year as President of the thirty-second session as well as of the three consecutive special sessions of the United Nations General Assembly.\n61.\tI sincerely thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and his associates for the devotion and wisdom which they have displayed in their multifarious activities on behalf of the international community and for their tireless efforts to further the implementation of the General Assembly resolution on assistance for the reconstruction of Viet Nam [resolution 32/3],\n62.\tThe Vietnamese delegation welcomes Solomon Islands on the occasion of its admission as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of the United Nations.\n63.\tDuring the year that has elapsed since the last regular session of the General Assembly we have witnessed the victories of many peoples in their struggle for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress. Never have the people of the world seen such bright prospects open before them as those of today. Conscious of the dynamics of history, the system of socialist countries, the movements for national independence and the movement of the working people struggling for economic rights and democratic liberties are being strengthened unceasingly and have scored new successes. This is the main trend in the development of the world situation, no matter how hard imperialism, in collusion with international reactionaries, tries to hinder the advance of mankind.\n64.\tFor many generations now, the maintenance of peace has been the primary concern of the people of the world, because peace is related to the vital interests and the rate of development of all nations. Life today has further strengthened our confidence in the possibility of preventing a new world war and preserving lasting peace on our planet. Imperialism has waged two world wars and hundreds of colonialist wars of aggression; but the forces of war have been repulsed , by the peoples of the world and have collapsed part by part.\n65.\tThe high tide of revolution among peoples during and after the two world wars brought the system of the socialist countries into being and caused the disintegration of the colonial system  which was dominated by imperialism. The colonialist wars in the past half-century have further weakened imperialism and exacerbated the crises it has suffered. Though defeated, imperialism has not given up its policy of force and, far from curbing, has in fact stepped up the arms race, thereby causing tension throughout the world. For this reason mankind must be vigilant. Nowadays, however, through their multifaceted struggle and with the combined strength of the forces of socialism, national independence, democracy and peace, the people of the world are more capable than ever before of defending peace and defeating every dark scheme of the warmongers.\n66. The victories which have been won by the movement for national independence since the Second World War have brought into existence nearly 100 independent States, thus profoundly changing the political face of the world. Yet at present national independence, self-determination and equality among nations remain the pressing demands of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America, and indeed the whole of progressive mankind. The peoples still living under the yoke of imperialism, colonialism, racism, apartheid and Zionism are relentlessly struggling for their sacred national rights. Those countries which have gained political independence are continuing to consolidate it and are intensifying their struggle for economic independence and for the recovery of sovereignty over their natural resources. At the same time, they are strengthening their solidarity with other progressive forces in the struggle for a just and equitable new international economic order.\n67.\tThe new victories won by peoples throughout the world prove that peoples are now capable of surmounting every difficulty and choosing freely the path to development which most effectively ensures their independence, freedom and happiness.\n68.\tHuman rights constitute a question of major concern to the world community. Viet Nam is of the view that human rights are, first and foremost, the right to be master in one's own country, the right to use all forms of struggle to defend the vital interests of one's fatherland, the right to choose one's own way of advancement in conformity with one's national traditions and aspirations, and the right of every man and woman to work, study and live a happy life. That is why the struggle for human rights is primarily the straggle to attain and safeguard each country's political and economic independence, and to establish a new international economic order on the basis of respect for national independence and sovereignty.\n69.\tIn order to carry out their expansionist and hegemonistic designs, international reactionary forces are increasingly working hand in glove with imperialism in order to undermine world peace and security and to violate the independence and sovereignty of other countries. They are feverishly stepping up the arms race, preaching the inevitability of war, inciting one country to fight another, and backing and abetting both reactionary and Fascist regimes everywhere to repress the peoples of the world. They try to sow discord among developing countries, to sabotage the unity of the movements for national liberation and the non-aligned countries, and to drive a wedge between those movements and other, revolutionary and progressive forces. They resort to vicious and blatant manoeuvres to oppose the countries which persist in their policy of independence and sovereignty and refuse to submit.\n70.\tTheir acts are designed to side-track the essential goals of the struggle of peoples for independence, democracy and social progress and to make confusion between friends and enemies so that they can side with the chief enemy of mankind\u2014namely, imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism, racism and apartheid.\n71.\tThe whole-hearted assistance extended by Cuba to other peoples and countries in their struggle for liberation, in defence of their independence and sovereignty and for their national reconstruction is a noble undertaking that has\nbeen highly esteemed by the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Colombo in 1977, and greatly appreciated by many Latin American countries. Slanders and distortions by imperialism and international reactionaries can in no way detract from these brilliant acts, which are devoted to the just cause of humanity .\n72.\tThe fact that the non-aligned movement will be convening at its Sixth Conference in Havana in 1979, the capital of a nation rich in revolutionary and internationalist spirit, clearly demonstrates the high prestige of Cuba and the tendency towards ever-increasing unity among the forces of peace, independence and social progress.\n73.\tThe acts of the imperialists and international reactionaries run counter to the trend of history and have been condemned by the-whole world. The people of the world, vigilant and united, will certainly foil the desires and actions of the imperialists.\n74.\tThroughout three decades of struggle for the independence, sovereignty and reunification of our country, Viet Nam experienced great devastation due to the wars which were imposed on us. Today, however, in our south-west border regions the Vietnamese people continue to be killed, and their villages continue to be ravaged. The Vietnamese people have no more earnest aspiration than to live in peace in order rapidly to heal the wounds of war, to rehabilitate and develop their economy and their culture, and to build a prosperous, advanced and happy homeland. Viet Nam desires peace in South-East Asia and in the rest of the world. The foreign policy of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is one of independence, sovereignty, peace, friendship, unity and co-operation.\n75.\tAs a socialist country Viet Nam has unswervingly pursued a policy of solidarity and co-operation with the Soviet Union and the other fraternal socialist countries. In the past, as now, after its complete liberation and reunification, it continues to enjoy great and effective assistance and support from the socialist countries, friendly countries and the progressive peoples throughout the world. That Viet Nam has become a full member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is an auspicious development in the existing relationship between Viet Nam and the countries members of that important international economic organization. At the same time Viet Nam has also established relations with many other international economic organizations in keeping with its policy of broadening and diversifying its relations of international cooperation.\n76. For many years South-East Asia has suffered from a situation of instability and has been the arena of many conflicts due to imperialist and colonialist aggression. It is now necessary to put an end to this situation in order to restore peace, and stability and to achieve friendship and co-operation. Viet Nam's attitude is to look to the future and be ready to turn a new page in the history of its relationship with other South-East Asian countries. Viet Nam has been and is prepared to join with other South-East Asian countries in undertaking, through treaties or other formal agreements, strictly to respect each other's independence and sovereignty, to rule out wars against each other, - to refrain from interference in each other's internal affairs, to settle all disputes through peaceful negotiations and to promote bilateral or multilateral co-operation.\n77.\tWe are glad to note that our country is developing ever better relations of friendship and co-operation with South-East Asian countries. This has been clearly evidenced by the visits which, have been permeated with friendship, of Vietnamese leaders to various countries in that region. Those direct top-level contacts have strengthened mutual understanding and trust and have actively contributed to joint efforts to establish a zone of peace, independence, freedom and neutrality, a zone of stability and prosperity, in South-East Asia in keeping with the interests of each country and the common interests of the entire region, and for the benefit of world peace and security.\n78.\tWe welcome the very important contribution that has been made by the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic to the cause of peace and the co-operation of the countries of South-East Asia. We also welcome the efforts and the goodwill of many other South-East Asian countries in normalizing and strengthening relations among the countries of that region.\n79.\tAt present there are forces which nurture ambitions for expansion and big-nation hegemony and are trying to follow the old path of the colonialists by sowing division, suspicion and enmity among South-East Asian countries. -They thereby run counter to the aspirations for peace, friendship and co-operation that prevail among the countries of that region.\n80.\tThe 4,000-year history of the Vietnamese nation is one of long and hard struggle but one that has been crowned with glorious victory for national independence. In their contemporary history the Vietnamese people have waged an undaunted struggle to defend their independence and freedom. They perpetrate aggression against no one, but they will not allow anyone to encroach upon their independence and sovereignty. The more they cherish their own independence and freedom, the more they respect the independence. and freedom of other countries.\n81.\tThe Vietnamese people are deeply convinced that the differences and; disputes, even the conflicts, between independent and sovereign States can be satisfactorily settled on the basis of respect for one another's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and equality between states and respect for one another's legitimate interests. This is in conformity with the desire of the peace- and justice-loving peoples throughout the world and constitutes one of the principles of the United Nations.\n82.\tIn this spirit, the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has made several constructive proposals for settling the conflicts and lessening-the tension between Viet Nam and some of its neighbours. My Government is. persisting in its endeavour to seek a satisfactory settlement that serves the interests and traditional friendship existing between Viet Nam and those countries, and to further peace and stability in that region.\n83.\tThe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has improved normal relations and its comprehensive co-operation with other countries, irrespective of their political systems, on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence.\n84.\tWe are prepared to negotiate with the United States in order to normalize relations between our two countries, and we are confident that, with goodwill on both sides, the problems that concern them will be satisfactorily settled step by step.\n85.\tViet Nam is willing to pursue bilateral and multilateral co-operation with other countries and to participate in or maintain relations with international co-operation organizations in order to develop its economy on the basis of respect for each other's independence and sovereignty, equality and mutual benefit. Viet Nam is a member of the World Bank, IMF, the Asian Development Bank, the Mekong Committee and many other international organizations. It also maintains relations with the European Economic Community.\n86.\tI wish to express here the profound gratitude of the people and Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to their friends all over the world who are showing both sympathy and support for our efforts to build the homeland and to defend independence and sovereignty.\n87.\tThe Vietnamese people are fully aware that their struggle, in the past as well as in the present, for their own national interests is closely associated with the common struggle of the people of the world for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress, as well as with the objectives of the non-aligned movement and those of the United Nations. During the past year the peoples of Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Democratic Yemen and others have obtained major victories in their revolutionary struggle and in the defence of their revolutionary gains.\n88.\tThe Palestinian people and other Arab peoples in the Middle East are continuing their struggle against the Israeli occupation, which is backed by imperialism. We reaffirm our strong support for the struggle of the Palestinian Arab people, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization to win back their fundamental national rights, including the right to establish a separate, independent and sovereign State. We support the Arab peoples in the Middle East who are endeavouring to recover completely their territories occupied by Israeli aggressors. We welcome all efforts aimed at bringing about peace and an end to war in the Middle East. However, in order to have genuine peace, the sources of war must be eliminated. A durable peace in that region requires that the aggression be totally eradicated and implies the restoration of the fundamental national rights of the Palestinian people and total sovereignty of the Arab countries over their occupied territories. A solution in which-only the aggressor has his say, and even the right of veto, while the victim of the aggression, the Palestinian people, whose. legitimate representative is the Palestine Liberation Organization, is prevented from making its important voice heard can only encourage aggression and damage the cause of peace in that region. Unfortunately, that is the essence of the Camp David peace agreements,\n89.\tIn view of the ever greater victories that have been scored by the peoples of southern Africa, the imperialists and their agents are resorting to increasingly wicked and deceitful manoeuvres. We reaffirm our strong support for the peoples in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa in their struggle for self-determination and genuine independence against Fascist regimes and apartheid.\n90.\tThe United States must immediately and unconditionally cease its embargo against Cuba, pay damages for the losses caused by its aggression and its embargo against Cuba, and restore Cuban sovereignty over Guantanamo. We support the Korean people in their struggle for the peaceful and independent reunification of their country in keeping with the three principles and five guidelines laid down by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We support the Panamanian people in their continued struggle for complete sovereignty over the Canal Zone. We support the peoples of Puerto Rico, Belize, Cyprus, Western Sahara, those islands \\\"under trusteeship\\\", the Non-Self-Governing Territories and other countries which are now struggling for their fundamental national rights. We support the people of Nicaragua in their struggle against die Fascist and dictatorial Somoza regime for the restoration of democracy and freedom in Nicaragua. We energetically condemn the savage repression perpetrated by the Fascist clique now in power in Chile.\n91.\tWe support every effort to achieve peace and total and complete disarmament. As regards nuclear disarmament, we are in favour of any initiative that will ensure the protection of non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of the use of such weapons by the nuclear Powers, provide non-nuclear States with adequate rights and the conditions for developing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, help to stop the nuclear arms race and prohibit the production of new systems of those weapons. These matters relate to the rights and obligations of both nuclear-weapon States and non-nuclear-weapon States, and both have equal rights and obligations in the matter of nuclear disarmament as well as in that of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. For that reason these matters should be settled in an interrelated way.\n92.\tWe support proposals aimed at inculcating noble sentiments concerning peace in the youth and broad sectors of the peoples of all countries.\n93.\tAlthough in the present situation we are still-confronted with complex and difficult problems, the struggle of the people of the world for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress has consistently gained new successes, and this has been reflected in part in the documents of our Organization during the past year.\n94.\tWe are confident that the noble goals of the international community will, one by one, be achieved. Progressive mankind will find proper solutions for the major problems of our time. In this conviction we will co-operate closely with, other Members of our Organization and contribute our part to the success of this thirty-third session of the General Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff286.\tNot so long ago, the United Nations was subjected to criticisms which were as vehement as they were destructive by some forces. Accused of powerlessness, it was thus insidiously kept out of the settlement of questions vital to peace, international security and the progress of peoples, which are its fundamental goals.\n287 In so doing, those forces tried to keep an exclusive hold on the conduct of international affairs, on the one\nhand, and, on the other hand, they tried to divert the United Nations from its primary mission: the democratization of international relations in favour of all Members, large and small.\n288.\tToday, the credibility of the United Nations is increasing among nations. This renewal of confidence is due to a large extent to the world-wide scope of the problems dealt with here, to the results attained and to the quality of the men called upon to exercise responsibilities therein.\n289.\tMr. Lievano is the most convincing example of that quality. My delegation welcomes his election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. In these difficult times of tension and confrontation the choice could not have been wiser. His long diplomatic experience and the fact that he belongs to a people whose philosophy is one of both moderation and resolute determination in the service of just causes are encouraging factors for those who are expecting this session to be conducted in an experienced manner, giving clear but judicious expression to the right of peoples, the very raison d'etre of our Organization. It would be superfluous, I think, to assure the President, of the co-operation of my delegation in ensuring the total success of this session, which will do honour not only to him but also to Colombia, his country. And his success will be his own.\n290.\tI should like on this occasion to pay a tribute and express our thanks to the Deputy Federal Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who conducted with such wisdom and vision the work of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly and the special sessions which followed it.\n291.\tI should like to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his tireless efforts in the interests of peace and security, which can only be attained by a more democratic redistribution of responsibilities and resources among nations, as he himself has often recalled.\n292.\tThe admission of Solomon Islands to the concert of free nations which Burundi welcomes with pleasure falls within an inevitable process of decolonization for all peoples of the earth.\n293.\tThe serious problems before our Organization have been subjected to wide and comprehensive analyses at this rostrum. From that standpoint, our contribution might run the risk of merely reiterating the relevant statements made by those who preceded me, and thus tire an audience already sorely tried.\n294.\tNevertheless, the persistence of colonialism and racist regimes, the re-emergence of conflicts among States fed by the allies involved, the permanence of a system of exploitation of the weak by the rich, the accelerated waste of human and material resources invested in an over-armament which is as dangerous as it is inexplicable are concerns which cannot but be mentioned here.\n295.\tTo be sure, all the voices of the world combined would not bring any answer to the problems involving such vast egotistical and contradictory interests. Nevertheless, it\nis true that the constant return to the same questions gradually defines their shape, thus making possible greater awareness on the part of the peoples, which alone in the final analysis are capable of finding lasting and just solutions.\n296.\tWere it not for the possibility of learning to speak on behalf of the right of peoples, the recurrence of our debates within this Organization would be reduced to vain reiteration of statements, irritating because of their futility. So the right tone must be used so that the lesson makes it mark.\n297.\tA certain Power endeavours to single out the faults, even the crimes of others, in the conduct of third parties, hoping thus to blind its own people and be considered innocent by other Members.\n298.\tA humble nation sometimes advocates the interests of its defenders and assists its adversaries, forgetting its own short-comings vis-\u00e0-vis its responsibilities. Accusing others becomes the art of vindicating oneself. Thus, the rostrum of the United Nations may soon run the risk of becoming the place for passionate invective and petty bickering.\n299.\tAs for us, along with many others, we think that the seriousness of the situations requiring our attention calls for a lucid approach and calm and collective thought, which should be concerned not with overcoming or diminishing the adversary but with together finding dynamic compromises for the benefit of all.\n300.\tGuided by the spirit of conciliation, without complacency or surrender, any statement would be a positive contribution to transforming old situations of injustice of which colonialism, apartheid and Zionism are typical examples.\n301.\tWhether we are dealing with southern Africa, Western Sahara, the Middle East, East Timor or Belize, we are faced with flagrant colonial situations: the denial to peoples of their right to self-determination, the diversion of their resources and labour forces for the profit of their masters and metropolitan countries, cultural subordination and the distortion of their values.\n302.\tFaced with that iniquity, the advantage of an objective start requires that we identify the protagonists in order to allocate the respective responsibilities.\n303.\tWithin our Organization and elsewhere it has become a commonplace to denigrate the white minority regimes. Of course, those regimes bear the grave responsibility of exercising anachronistic racist domination over millions of Africans. Nevertheless, this cannot vindicate the Powers that are the allies of those minorities, which in certain respects are the tools of exploitation of the black people.\n304.\tIf, instead of resorting to the usual subterfuges, the friends of Pretoria and Salisbury were to recognize their open complicity, and if, instead of virtuous protests, effective pressure were brought to bear upon those advocating racial discrimination, there is no doubt that a step would be taken towards peace and the rehabilitation of those peoples reduced to slavery in their own land.\n305.\tOne seeks in vain the reason for the constant support provided to the white regimes in the political, economic and above all military fields.\n306.\tIt is true that Pretoria is constantly developing preposterous ideas to legitimise its policy, such as the superiority of the white man, to be safeguarded by racial solidarity against black barbarity or Western civilization threatened by communism, for which the blacks serve as middleman.\n307.\tIt would be alarming if such falsifications were to gain support, however vaguely it might be expressed. It goes without saying that a formal disavowal in fact would not be sufficient to comfort the victims of apartheid and their allies, led by Africa.\n308.\tRather than be given verbal assurances, Africa and our Organization are entitled to witness specific gestures on the part of the Western Members. On the one hand, instructed by colonial history, they are in a position to understand the justice of the cause of subjected peoples and to assess their determination to win in the end. Moreover, the past of many of them is characterized by desperate struggles to gain or maintain their independence. Finally, it seems that the place of those who escaped the scourge of nazism should naturally be in the forefront of the anti-apartheid and anti-colonial struggle. The humiliations and the tombs are there: devastating proof to compensate for any lapse of memory which might occur.\n309.\tIf, despite all these reasons, a decisive opening has been so long in coming, it is beyond all doubt because of the existence in these colonies-and in southern Africa especially\u2014of vital material interests, objectively linked to the socio-political structures of the racist and colonialist systems.\n310.\tHere again, a cool and open-minded look at the reality of the future reveals the possible choices. Either the West will try to guarantee its interests by maintaining the socio-political regimes which are an insult to mankind and therefore must be condemned, or it will change its allies and become involved in the task of establishing cooperation among the far-sighted humanist elements existing in white society on the one hand, and the popular forces on the other-those forces which  are the architects of the inevitable national liberation, whatever may be the shortcomings, the backward steps or even the internal betrayals.\n311.\tThe alternative seems clear.\n312.\tGiven the temporary material superiority of the white regimes and the colonial Powers, the first choice, alliance with oppressive forces, has the tenuous advantage that it maintains the enormous immediate interests in an outmoded situation. The second path, alliance with progressive forces, opens up a threefold prospect: first of all, preventing white and black mankind being struck down in the flower of its youth in a savage and deadly war; then setting up between former enemies lasting egalitarian co-operation which takes account of the legitimate aspirations and interests of all the parties involved; finally, after so much hatred and blood, proclaiming before the world that right is greater than might, that freedom will prevail\nover subjugation and that fraternity will prevail over discrimination, all of which is in accordance with the humanist tradition of Western civilization and honours man per se.\n313.\tIf reason thus took precedence over passion and emotion, the essential over what is expedient, and if, therefore, those who have traditionally supported the oppressors chose the second path, backing the progressive forces, such a development would impose new duties and attitudes with respect to each colonial situation.\n314.\tIn South Africa, instead of adopting a reprehensible delaying attitude which allows Pretoria time to create irreversible situations, our Organization, unanimously this time, must proceed to threefold concerted action: first of all, to breaking off all relations with the apartheid regime to force it into total isolation; secondly, at the same time to begin, using all the communications media, a psychological campaign to rid the white and black people of their respective complexes of racial superiority and inferiority, which create psychological trauma, mutual distrust and reciprocal persecution. If one assesses the destruction caused to people's minds by the ideology of the natural supremacy of some and the inherent deficiencies of others, one realizes that this cleansing action is in no way superfluous. Finally, it will be necessary to promote internal structures of egalitarian co-operation among races, at work, in the schools and in the areas of social and political life.\n315.\tThese structures of co-operation will not only counterbalance the dismemberment of the country into bantustans, but will also be the necessary internal link which, together with the co-ordinated struggles of the nationalist movements, will create the conditions for the final overthrow of the stubborn racist core in power.\n316.\tLet no one see in what I have said mere academic thoughts. Victory will be the fruit of multifarious popular resistance, co-ordinated both internally and externally.\n317.\tWe are among those who abhor the use of violence. If the racists renounce the use of violence, the nationalists-who have little means of violence-will have to use peaceful means; otherwise, they will have to fight.\n318.\tOn Zimbabwe, our Organization must reiterate its condemnation of the \\\"internal settlement\\\" and discourage inconsistent compromises aimed at undermining the unity of the Patriotic Front, the sole fighting force and the only guarantee of decolonization which would not be merely a revitalization of foreign domination in the guise of docile and complaisant black power.\n319.\tAs for Namibia, the international community must unconditionally support the decolonization plan of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and call on the Security Council to implement it without further delay. The fact that South Africa exercises over Namibia a power usurped from our Organization in 1966 and, moreover, today arrogates to itself the right to dispute the provisions established by the legitimate administering Power, is inadmissible. Recent developments are not encouraging. We must nevertheless show the Western countries, which have\nalready made praiseworthy efforts, that those efforts are not sufficient and that more pressure and more sanctions are necessary in order to lead Namibia to total independence, with complete territorial integrity, under the leadership of SWAPO.\n320.\tThe heroic struggle of the Saharan people must be hailed by all those who believe in right and freedom. The best tribute which Burundi can pay to that people is to call on our Organization to give general recognition to the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic under the leadership of the Frente POLISARIO. If this desire is not fulfilled immediately, I am happy to say that justice will certainly not be long delayed. Already positive prospects are opening up, which are the just results of a bitter and tenacious struggle out of all proportion to the modest numbers and means available. This is touching proof of the invincibility of peoples who abhor submission.\n321.\tTurning to the question of Palestine and the Middle East, whatever the initiatives taken in various bodies, the position of my country is clear: the restoration of the occupied Arab territories and the restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian people constitute the foundation of a just agreement. But to reach that point, the Arab nation must assess the dangers of fragmentation on the one hand and, on the other, the possible relegation to the background of Palestinian resistance, which is the principal protagonist in the struggle against Israel and the driving force of any lasting victory.\n322.\tThere is no need to review all the colonial situations. Those profiting from such injustice should understand that the liberation of peoples is an irreversible phenomenon. Therefore the manoeuvres, whether overt or disguised, designed to maintain under foreign domination East Timor, Belize, Mayotte and all the African islands around the continent, appear futile.\n323.\tIf our Organization is to live up to its objective of maintaining peace and security, some Members will have to refrain from fostering hotbeds of tension and divisive\nsituations, which must be eliminated in whatever way necessary. In fact sooner or later like the two Viet Nams, the two communities of Cyprus will find a modus vivendi, Taiwan will be reintegrated in the People's Republic of China and the two Koreas will be reunited, as Burundi whole-heartedly hopes. That is the profound wish of the peoples; that is the course of history. Capriciously dismembered, torn apart by countless dissensions, Africa itself will find within itself the resources necessary to make it whole again.\n324.\tDecolonization would be an unfinished task and the relaxation of tensions and the solution of conflicts a success without a future if conditions for a genuine economic liberation were not created at the same time.\n325.\tAfter the decisions adopted by the General Assembly at its sixth and seventh special sessions, after the proclamation of the Charter on Economic Rights and Duties of States [resolution 3281 (XXIX)], despite all attempts to establish equitable international economic relations, a\nminority of wealthy nations continues to prosper at the expense of others who suffer from hunger, disease, ignorance and natural disasters.\n326.\tWhile the structures which have created these injustices still exist some would have the so-called poor countries believe that access to the capital, technology and products of the rich world is the royal road to development.\n327.\tIt is easy to forget that this affluence is what is blocking the development of our countries. Extreme indebtedness, the facile and subordinate role of the supplier of raw materials-a role which keeps us from industrialization - the outward flow of trade which prevents us from having access to huge potential neighbouring markets, and the intrusion of inappropriate technology, which inhibits the creative skills of our people-all these are things unlikely to produce the goods required to meet the basic needs of the majority.\n328.\tIf at least this policy were proposed at least in good faith! But what do we see? As soon as the developing countries are able to master a given technology for the market the rich countries overtly or covertly resort to protectionism; they want to ensure in every possible way that the international economic system operates first and foremost in their favour, while making certain concessions which are reassuring to the third world.\n329.\tWe must indeed in our Organization continue to look for tentative solutions to such serious problems as those of commodities, foreign indebtedness, the balance of payments and the transfer of technology.\n330.\tHowever, in order successfully to achieve real development for our countries, we must have a complete transformation of the world economic system. While that is easy to say, it must nevertheless be translated into facts. This involves two requirements: first of all, the poor countries must resolutely choose a new development policy; and secondly, it is necessary to elaborate a global strategy accordingly.\n331.\tThis new vision of development is based on two main beliefs. The first is that the so-called poor countries possess an enormous potential. Instead of yielding to a sense of powerlessness and dearth, Africa, Asia and Latin America should show their people the wealth of their soil, their manpower, and their energy and mineral resources. The second belief is that, instead of allowing the foreign exploitation of this wealth, the third world has enough imagination to develop it on its own on the basis of interdependence with the industrialized countries and not on the basis of servitude.\n332.\tHaving recovered their sense of self-confidence, the people of the third world can bring about genuine development, guided by a few key ideas which have become increasingly popular and which have been tried and tested: autonomy, on the one hand, and, on the other, the belief that man is the centre of initiative as well as of creation.\n333.\tWithout overlooking the need for co-operation, the need for autonomy gives to those who choose this option\nthe assurance that the tools of development are within their reach in the mastery of their environment on the basis of existing potential, thanks to their own strength. Such a reasoning will bring about a beneficial breaking off of all kinds of colonial relationships and structures of dependence.\n334.\tThus, instead of engaging in a frenzied search for capital, technology and expertise as the only nostrums the men of the third world, since they are most directly concerned, must be the initiators of development, with the help of well organized collective work, workmanlike methods constantly being perfected and their own creativity which can become expertise. This outlook has often been criticized as backward-looking. But, while like the flow of capital from abroad, the flow of technology and expertise remain useful and even indispensable, it could never be a lasting substitute for genuine involvement and the use of one's own tools.\n335.\tWhile history does give examples of societies which have developed themselves from within by their own muscle power using simple, local techniques and appropriate imitations when necessary, on the other hand, when industrialization has invaded man's living space from the outside, breaking down his doors, it is not development that is produced, but the marginalization of the peoples, who are reduced to serving crushing machines without overcoming hunger and disease.\n336.\tIn short, rather than lagging behind the industralized world, the third world should rely first on its own population and the means at its disposal in order to achieve development on the basis of self-reliance and to satisfy the basic needs of the masses of the people.\n337.\tWhat is needed is realism rather than originality. We need the politics of the possible. To try to create the most modern industry at the expense of agriculture in areas where there is hunger and disease runs counter to reason and common sense.\n338.\tMost nations Members of our Organization, even those which have many options and choices, could not achieve development by themselves in the face of the crushing power of the transnational corporations and the nationalistic selfishness of the industrialized world. What is needed is concerted action on the part of all the forces of progress. The bases of a tripartite strategy already exist and must be strengthened; I am referring to a strategy of the developing countries, the United Nations and its specialized agencies, and the forces of the industrialized world.\n339.\tEven though they do not always satisfy everyone the tireless efforts of the United Nations have exceptional merit. Evidence of this is the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, whose decisions and recommendations have the strong support of my delegation.\n340.\tMay I also be permitted to pay a tribute to our Organization for persevering in the elaboration of an international convention on the law of the sea which is designed to govern the equitable distribution of marine resource. The drafting of national legislation in this\nconnexion by some technologically powerful States worries us. Such actions seek to circumvent the future international convention and to lend legitimacy to the appropriation of the wealth of the sea at the expense of our countries. This, we think, is inadmissible and must cease.\n341.\tAlthough the efforts of the United Nations are important they can never replace the struggle of the third world itself. In order to determine the role the countries of the third world should play in the strategy for the new economic order they must draw up an inventory of their strengths and their weaknesses. Suffice it to point out the \u2022 disparity of their means as well as the diversity of their cultural and socio-political systems. This is an indication of the need for greater consistency, which is indispensable for the achievement of economic integration.\n342.\tThis integration is needed for several reasons. First, it is impossible for most States of the third world to achieve development separately because of a lack of adequate human and material resources. Secondly, even the richly endowed large States cannot individually withstand the partisans of an international system of economic exploitation. Lastly, in the absence of a genuine, well-balanced development profitable to everyone, it will be impossible to ensure inner stability, peace and security among neighbouring States.\n343.\tIt is therefore clear that integration is necessary in order to increase the ability to resist the forces of exploitation and neo-colonialism. In this connexion the non-aligned movement, the continental organizations which are not in the sphere of influence of the major Powers, regional co-operation under the leadership of young economic communities, and the groupings of producers of raw materials are all reasons for satisfaction and, at the same time, an indication of what remains to be done for the third world in order effectively to counteract the imperialist coalition.\n344.\tIn addition to the timely efforts needed there are other requirements for the success of economic integration which are as yet far from being met: without an effective harnessing of the national wealth, without greater intensification of horizontal trade and the development of regional industrial policy, without the joint financing of autonomous scientific and technical research programmes the third world will continue to be exploited by the industrialized world and its disinherited peoples will have to suffer further intolerable consequences.\n345.\tEven if it were in our interests a show of force is not part of our tradition. But, in light of our responsibility to our people, I would like to ask: what other options do we have when faced with the intransigence of the rich?\n346.\tInstead of being an exercise in empty polemics, this statement was designed as an objective reflection in an effort to contribute to the understanding of certain painful problems and also to outline some solutions which have not been sufficiently explored.\n347.\tIn the areas of colonial domination or dangerous conflicts and tensions we have called upon the victims and the oppressors to reassess their conduct in order to\nsafeguard their long-term mutual interests and to respect the people who no longer accept brute force as the guiding principle of their relations with others.\n348.\tAs to the unequal distribution of resources and unfair trade, a new way must be found to achieve development on the basis of autonomy and the skills of the people themselves. Moreover, at the international level equitable co-operation is preferable to economic warfare.\n349.\tAware of their needs aid of the complementarity which is necessary among people, the poorer countries unceasingly display patience. Some may have believed that the systematic resort to compromise was tantamount to capitulation.\n350.\tA long history of humiliation always brings serious dangers for the victim as well as for the adversary. Human rights are so often mentioned these days. Is it not time to render justice to this humanity of the third world, the prime victim of exploitation and domination? Despair and resistance are interpreted everywhere as expressions of anarchy and terrorism. Should we not gradually put an end to all situations of frustration which are tantamount to provocation?\n351.\tTo those who rely on the lassitude of the oppressed and the abandonment of their rights, we would like to say that the people have never given up. On the contrary, each passing day strengthens their faith in their cause. The exemplary history of the peoples who have triumphed-in former Portuguese Africa, in Indo-China-the maturation of their aspirations for freedom in the wake of the suffering they have endured in their struggles; the growing solidarity of the progressive forces of the world-all these elements converge to strengthen the legitimate combat of the peoples and inevitably lead them to victory.\n352.\tBetween intransigent oppression and the determination of the victims to take up the challenge, our Organization has no choice.\n353. In keeping with our Charter, its objectives of peace and justice, it is our obligation to promote solutions acceptable to all. Where there is obstructionism or bad faith, we must side with the victim. It is our duty: our Organization cannot fail in this duty without betraying us.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff46.\tMr. President, the delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic would like to congratulate the Foreign Minister of Colombia upon his election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and sincerely wishes him every possible success in the fulfilment of his important task.\n47.\tWe should also like to pay a tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Mojsov, who so skilfully conducted the proceedings of the thirty-second regular session and also the three special sessions of the General Assembly.\n48.\tOur delegation would also like to note the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Waldheim, in strengthening the role of the United Nations in ensuring peace and security among peoples. Our delegation takes pleasure in congratulating the delegation of _ Solomon Islands upon its admission to membership in the United Nations and would like to wish the people and Government of that new State every possible success in strengthening their national independence and ensuring their economic and social progress.\n49.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic holds the view that the salient feature of present developments in the world continues to be the steady growth of the might and influence of real socialism, and the consolidation of the positions of all progressive and revolutionary forces as well as the advancement of the cause of peace, national liberation and social progress of nations.\n50.\tThe economic, scientific and technical potentials of the States of the socialist community continue to show a dynamic increase. The liquidation of the colonial yoke has entered its final stage; the ranks of people's democratic States which have replaced colonial and feudal regimes in Africa and Asia are steadily growing. The last fascist regimes in Europe have collapsed and the basis of the dictatorial regimes in Latin America is being increasingly undermined.\n51.\tAs a result of the consistent and dynamic efforts of the countries of the socialist community and of all peace-loving forces of the world, the process of international detente continues to deepen and the principles of peaceful coexistence are being increasingly adhere to in relations among States, while the equitable and mutually advantageous co-operation of States in the political, economic and other fields is growing.\n52.\tMillions of peoples in all countries are more actively engaged in the struggle for preventing the threat of a new world war, consolidating universal peace and security, and implementing effective measures of disarmament. All the foregoing open up a bright perspective for a peaceful future of mankind.\n53.\tHowever, it would be an unforgivable mistake if one were to underestimate the threat which is posed by the growing collusion of the forces of imperialism and great Power chauvinism to the cause of peace and security of nations. The latest developments testify to the fact that here a great deal is being staked on reviving and employing the forces of revanchism and militarism.\n54.\tThis growing alliance of the most reactionary groupings is trying to liquidate detente and to revive the policy of \\\"positions of strength\\\". Moreover, its spearhead is directed against the world socialist community and the forces of national liberation and social progress. Therefore, these circles oppose everything progressive, just and reasonable in the world. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic, while pointing out the existing danger, has no intention of exaggerating it. Possessing the necessary means to check aggressors, the world .socialist system, jointly with all forces fighting for peace, national independence and social progress, is capable of forestalling a new world war and promoting the deepening and broadening of the positive changes which occur in the world.\n55.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic is of the view that today the struggle for the cessation of the arms race and the implementation of measures of genuine disarmament represents the core of international efforts aimed at the deepening of detente and at consolidating universal peace and security.\n56.\tIn order to preserve peace, a decisive rebuff, should be administered first of all to the policy of the militant circles of NATO and other reactionary forces which, under such artificial and false pretexts as the \\\"Soviet threats\\\" or the \\\"protection of human rights\\\", are escalating the arms race and trying to inflate a war hysteria.\n57.\tThe tenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly, which was devoted to disarmament, showed convincingly that the overwhelming, majority of States in the world consider disarmament, and in the first place nuclear disarmament, to be the most urgent task in contemporary life.\n58.\tThe special session gave new impetus to the struggle of the .world community for disarmament, having outlined the basic principles of an approach to this complex problem, a programme framework and priorities for practical measures to achieve the goal of general and complete disarmament.\n59.\tFurthermore, the session showed the urgent need for convening a world conference that would adopt binding decisions on the cessation, of the arms race and on disarmament, through the constructive and business-like participation of all States. A world disarmament conference able to take decisions based or? the common will of all its participants to implement genuine measures of disarmament could serve as such a forum. In this context, the Mongolian delegation considers that the current session of the General Assembly should set up an organ which would deal with practical preparations for a world disarmament conference. As is known, there exists a consensus as regards the need for adequate preparation for such an important forum.\n60.\tWhat is required now is a demonstration of political will on the part of all, primarily on the part of the nuclear Powers, and a constructive and realistic approach towards the implementation of the provisions of the Final Document of the special session of the General Assembly.\n61.\tIn that regard, it would be of the greatest importance to approach in an unprejudiced, business-like manner the proposals of the Soviet Union on practical measures for ending the arms race  submitted to the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on 26 May of this year. Those proposals envisage a series of measures, presented in a most realistic and practical way, which should be agreed upon at the present and subsequent stages of the disarmament negotiations within a definite period of time. The implementation of these measures would decisively promote the cause of genuine disarmament and, above all, of nuclear disarmament.\n62.\tTo develop and make more concrete its proposals on practical measures to halt the arms race, the Soviet Union has come forward at this session with new initiatives for the conclusion of an international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States [Aj33/241] and to reach an agreement prohibiting the stationing of nuclear weapons on the territories of States where there are no such weapons at present [ibid., annex II].\n63.\tThese closely interrelated proposals fully meet, in the first place, the basic concerns of the non-nuclear States\u2014 concerns that predominate in all documents pertaining to disarmament negotiations, including the Final Document of the special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament. In circumstances where the military-industrial complex and bellicose forces in the Western countries are accelerating the arms race and encouraging the development of new, sophisticated types of nuclear weapons, this initiative is of exceptional practical importance.\n64.\tThe implementation of the new Soviet proposals will, first and foremost, strengthen to a considerable extent the security of the overwhelming majority of States of the world and, at the same time, will contribute a great deal to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and lessening the danger of nuclear war.\n65.\tAmong practical measures designed to curb the arms race, the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic continues to attach great importance to the Soviets- American talks on the limitation of strategic offensive arms. A positive outcome of those talks would represent a turning-point in checking the missile and nuclear-arms race and would create favourable conditions for securing concrete results in other forums of disarmament negotiations too.\n66.\tThe Mongolian delegation associates itself with the view that the United States in its stand on this vital issue should overcome extraneous considerations of expediency and should, like the other party, be guided first of all by the larger interest of saving mankind from the danger of thermonuclear catastrophe and ensuring its peaceful future.\n67.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic welcomes the constructive proposal of the socialist countries at the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe, which offers a fair and mutually acceptable basis for an essential agreement founded on the principle of equal security. Acceptance of that proposal by the Western countries participating in the talks would lead to the conclusion of an agreement which would be extremely important for diminishing the danger of military confrontation in this region of extremely high concentration of armed forces and armaments. Such an agreement would also make a most tangible material contribution to the strengthening and advancement of the spirit of the Helsinki Conference.\n68.\tTo prevent the qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and the emergence of new types of them, it is necessary first of all to take effective measures for a comprehensive ban on nuclear-weapon tests. The USSR proposal to reach agreement on a moratorium on nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes along with a ban on all nuclear-weapon tests for a definite period opens up, in our view, the possibility of the early elaboration of the text of a treaty on the complete and .general prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests.\n69.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic, together with all peace-loving forces, resolutely opposes the attempts of the NATO hawks to produce nuclear neutron weapons and deploy them on the territory of Western European States.\nThe world public demands that the United States accept the proposal of the Soviet Union to reach agreement on the mutual renunciation of the production of this type of weapon, intended exclusively to annihilate man and other living beings.\n70.\tThis session of the General Assembly should earnestly recommend that the Committee on Disarmament begin without delay the elaboration of an agreement on the prohibition of the production of neutron weapons on the basis of the draft convention submitted by the socialist countries to that Committee.\n71.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic favours the approach that, along with the elaboration of a general agreement on the prohibition of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction, agreements should be concluded on the prohibition of specific types of such weapons. It is in this light that we deem it important to negotiate an agreement on the prohibition of radiological weapons.\n72.\tThe Mongolian delegation, taking note of the recent report on the status of the talks between the Soviet Union and the United States on the question of the prohibition of chemical weapons, wishes to underline here the need for the earliest possible removal of this type of weapon of mass destruction from the arsenals of States.\n73.\tThe reduction of military budgets by States having large military potentials would be a practical and tangible measure. In this connexion, the proposal by the Soviet Union that agreement be reached on a reduction in absolute figures of the budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council deserves the most careful consideration.\n74.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic, like many other States, believes that the concluding of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations would consolidate confidence among States, diminish the risk of confrontations and conflicts, and thus create a favourable political atmosphere for making progress in disarmament matters.\n75.\tFor the Mongolian People's Republic, the conclusion of such a treaty-in addition to its significance of principle\u2014now has immediate practical importance. As is well known, my country shares a common border with a country whose ruling circles are engaged in open preparation for war, and who consider it a \\\"normal phenomenon\\\" and are exerting crude pressure and open encroachment\nupon the national interests of other States.\n76.\tHere, from this high rostrum, my delegation wishes to express the fraternal solidarity and full support of the Mongolian people and its Government to the Vietnamese people, which .is defending with-dignity the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of its country in the , face of obvious pressure, provocation and aggressive incursions on the part of great-Power expansionists and their tools.\n77.\tIn view of the aforementioned circumstances, the question of the limitation of arms sales his acquired for us the same importance. We are entitled to disapprove in a most decisive manner, the policies and activities of those\nGovernments which in one way or another are aiding and abetting the militarization of a country whose authorities are pursuing a hegemonistic policy towards our country and others.\n78.\tIn its foreign policy activities, the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic attaches great significance to the problem of strengthening peace and security on the Asian continent.\n79.\tThe urgent need to unite the efforts of all States of the continent for this vital purpose can be explained, first and foremost, by the fact that here on this vast continent, where more than one half of mankind lives, peoples continue to suffer from incessant armed conflicts, provoked by neo-colonialists and other forces of international reaction. Furthermore, in Asia there exist dangerous hotbeds of tension, fraught with the threat to universal peace and security. The situation there is aggravated, furthermore, by the recent increase in the collusive activities of imperialist, great-Power, chauvinistic and militarist forces in Asia and the Far East.\n80.\tIn pursuance of its policy of principle, Mongolia has been steadily broadening its relations with other Asian countries and has been seeking to strengthen mutual understanding and co-operation with all nations for the sake of upholding peace and security on the continent.\n81.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic has consistently supported all actions which promote the cause of peace, national independence and social progress, particularly on the Asian continent. The Mongolian people welcomed with enthusiasm the victory of the peoples of South-East Asia over the American aggressors, the emergence of a unified socialist Viet Nam and Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the proclamation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan as a result of the victory of the people's revolution in that country.\n82.\tWe attach great importance to continued normalization of relations among States of South-East and southern Asia and to the growing trend among Asian countries of adhering to the principles of the peaceful coexistence of States with differing social systems and freeing themselves from the shackles of military alliances.\n83.\tIt is the considered view of the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic that the most urgent task in the consolidation of peace and security on the Asian continent remains the elimination of the existing hotbeds of military tension and conflict.\n84.\tThe situation in the Middle East is becoming ever more explosive. The recent separate talks in Camp David under the aegis of the United States have once again clearly demonstrated the root-cause of the growing tension. The result of these talks has been rightly assessed by progressive Arab opinion as one further attempt to impose upon the Arab world a solution tailored to the expansionist designs of Israel and its patrons, a solution which is fraught with the danger of opening the way to military penetration by imperialist forces into that region for far-reaching strategic ends.\n85.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic continues to hold the view that a just settlement of the Middle East problem can be achieved only through the concerted efforts of all interested parties on the basis of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967 and by ensuring the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including their right to the creation of their own State, as well as preserving the security of all States in the area. The principal means for achieving such a comprehensive solution of this problem remains the resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference with the participation of all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n86.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic advocates strict respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and its status of non-alignment. We continue to believe that an international conference on Cyprus to be held under the aegis of the United Nations in conformity with its decisions would be an important instrument for the speedy and effective solution of the Cyprus problem.\n87.\tThe situation in the Korean peninsula, whose southern part has become the bridge-head for aggressive encroachments by imperialist circles, is fraught with serious danger to peace and security not only in the Far East but in Asia as a whole.\n88.\tFurther efforts are needed for the speedy implementation of the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in the south of Korea, the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Command and the replacement of the Armistice Agreement by a permanent peace agreement [resolution 3390 B (XXX)].\n89.\tThe Government of the Mongolian People's Republic consistently supports the proposals by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea designed to bring about the unification of Korea in accordance with the aspirations of the Korean people and with the interests of peace and security in Asia and throughout the world.\n90.\tIn expressing its anxieties over the deterioration of the situation in Indo-China resulting from the schemes of the hegemonistic forces, the Mongolian delegation, like many others, maintains that that problem should be settled through peaceful means at the negotiating table, as has been proposed by the Vietnamese side.\n91.\tThe aggravation of the situation on the African continent caused by the intensification of the plotting of the leading Powers of NATO against national liberation forces and progressive States is giving rise to grave concern on the part of the world community.\n92.\tImperialist circles, together with the racist regimes of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, are doing everything possible in their power to preserve their positions on that continent so rich in natural resources, and for that, sole purpose they will do anything, including resorting to collective military actions against the independent African States. All that is accompanied or, rather, is covered up by neo-colonialist manoeuvres.\n93.\tThe political strategy of the neo-colonialists is to undermine the unity of African States and to strike a blow at the progressive and democratic regimes of the continent.\n94.\tThe Mongolian people has always expressed its internationalist solidarity with the People's Republic of Angola, the People's Republic of Mozambique, socialist Ethiopia and other African progressive States which are defending with dignity their national independence and democratic achievements against the hostile activities of external and internal reaction. Our people also supports the just struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa for national and social liberation and against racism and apartheid,\n95.\tIt is of overriding importance to secure the implementation of all the United Nations resolutions related to the liquidation of colonialism, racism and apartheid, in particular the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)].\n96.\tThe most significant component part of the liberation movement at the present stage is the struggle of the developing countries for the elimination of the pernicious heritage of colonialism-economic backwardness, for strengthening their economic independence, and for the establishment of a new international economic order. The absence of any tangible progress at the so-called North- South dialogue as well as the complete stalemate in the work of the Committee which was set up to promote those negotiations, demonstrate once again the reluctance of the principal capitalistic Powers to meet the legitimate demands of the developing countries and their desire to retain unequal economic relations, inherited from the time of colonial domination.\n97.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic, which enjoys the benefits of socialist inter-State relations based on the principles of equality, mutual advantage and mutual assistance, understands well the legitimacy of the demand and struggle of the developing countries for the restructuring of their economic relations with the capitalist world on the basis of equal rights and mutual advantage.\n98.\tWe should like to note that the introduction of far-reaching social and economic changes by the developing countries, including the development of the public sector in the national economy and the carrying out of agrarian reform with a view to creating a progressive basis for public production and distribution, could serve as an effective instrument for solving their economic and other complex problems. The fostering and expanding of economic cooperation between the developing countries and the socialist system of economy would serve as a sound basis for strengthening their national economies as well as for enhancing the effectiveness of the struggle for the establishment of anew and just system of economic relations on a world-wide scale.\n99.\tThe Mongolian People's Republic attaches great importance to activities of the United Nations designed to strengthen international security and co-operation. We advocate the enhancement of the role and effectiveness of\nthe United Nations in this field on the basis of strict observance and implementation of the provisions of its Charter.\n100.\tWe should like to express our hope that this session of the United Nations General Assembly will mark another important contribution in promoting the further consolidation and spread of the process of international detente and the strengthening of mutual understanding and trust among States.\n101.\tIn that connexion my delegation warmly commends the initiative by the delegation of the Polish People's Republic, which has submitted to this session a draft Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in Peace.\n102.\tIn conclusion, I should like to assure representatives to this Assembly that the Mongolian delegation will spare no effort to contribute in every possible way to the success of the work of this session.\n"

The agenda of this session includes several important issues which are closely linked with the stability of international peace and security and with the- stability of all peoples of the world and their steady progress towards economic and social development. I have no doubt that, with his well-known competence, wisdom and wide experience, Mr. Lievano, as our President, will supervise the work of the session in a way that will ensure further progress towards the realization of the aspirations and noble objectives of the entire world community set forth in the Charter of this Organization.\n139.\tI wish also to commend the presidency of his predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia, who directed the deliberations of the thirty-second regular session and the three special sessions held since.\n140.\tAlso, I should like to praise the continued efforts made by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, in the service of this Organization in order to promote its effectiveness and to ensure the discharge of its role and the responsibilities that it bears.\n141.\tI also wish to seize this opportunity to express my country's welcome to the newly-independent Solomon Islands as it joins our Organization, assuring it of our co-operation in our joint efforts to realize the objectives upon which the .Charter of this Organization is based.\n142.\tAt this time every year we meet together to reassess the international situation and exchange views on the most important international issues. We review our contributions and intensify our efforts to find appropriate and just solutions to the issues and problems that we face.\n143.\tThe Middle East problem is one of the most important, and consequently Over the past 30 years it has been one of the major preoccupations of the Organization.\n144.\tThe Sultanate of Oman, under the leadership of His - Excellency Sultan Qabus\u2014may God preserve his life\u2014has\nbeen careful to clarify its position throughout this period through which the Arab nation is passing, and it summarizes its attitude as follows.\n145.\tFirst, the Sultanate of Oman has called and will continue to call for the establishment of a just, honourable and durable peace for coming Arab generations. It will always support courageous Arab efforts to defend Arab rights, which are clear to the whole world, and to eradicate the impact of hostile efforts to blur the clarity of rights.\n146.\tSecondly, the Sultanate of Oman is determined that a just and comprehensive solution to the problems of the area must be based upon total Israeli withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied in 1967, foremost among which is the\ncity and the area of Arab Jerusalem, which has been Arab and Islamic ever since the days of Caliph Omar ibn Al-Khattab and will so remain. No one in the Arab or Moslem world has the right to change its Arab or its Islamic character. Arab sovereignty has to be restored to it.\n147.\tThirdly, the Sultanate of Oman supports the right of the Arab Palestinian people, wherever they may be, to self-determination and to the exercise of the full rights, as stipulated by United Nations resolutions, in the Arab territory of Palestine.\n148.\tFourthly, the Sultanate of Oman, in the light of the present circumstances in the region, gives its blessing to all efforts that may lead to salvaging the situation of the Arabs and the restoration of Arab unity, and it welcomes the idea of an Arab meeting at summit level to deal with that situation. It favours all efforts to consolidate the Arab position on Jerusalem in the Arab and Islamic world with a view to establishing a just, honourable and durable peace.\n149.\tMy country, being geographically close to the African continent and because of the historical links between it and the peoples of that continent, shares their aspirations for the complete elimination of racist systems, which we hope the world will witness very soon. At the same time we are following with great interest the various efforts deployed to avoid confrontation and to settle all disputes by peaceful means. No matter what difficulties are involved, it is incumbent upon us to find the means to achieve peaceful settlements of disputes, to work for unanimity of effort, to strengthen our solidarity and to maintain our sovereignty, independence and good-neighbourly relations, in order to attain the desired objectives. But this can only be achieved, in our opinion, by putting an end to foreign intervention and its harmful impact on the sequence of events in the African continent. The OAU has proved its ability to tackle the problems of that continent and to find appropriate solutions, in order to preserve and maintain security and stability for its peoples. We are confident that the OAU will continue its efforts to bring about a better life, an independent and noble life, for the sons of the African continent and put an end to all injustice and oppression.\t\n150.\tMy country regards with grave' anxiety overt intervention in the affairs of the African continent by foreign forces intent on the domination and control of its resources. Such foreign intervention does not in any way help to solve existing problems in Africa, but drags Africa into the disputes of the great Powers. This deprives the African continent of real peace and prolongs the bitter sufferings of its peoples, depriving them of liberty and equality.\n151.\tThe African Assembly held recently in Khartoum realized this, namely, that the problems and preoccupations of Africa are the responsibility of Africa, and the OAU at that Assembly, denounced foreign intervention in the African continent, which sows seeds of dissension among the peoples and exploits regional disputes, furthering plans for domination and hegemony over African resources.\n152.\tAt successive General Assembly sessions, and elsewhere in other international forums, the Sultanate of\nOman, a country with a long coastline on the Indian Ocean, has, like other countries, firmly supported and called for the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, free of nuclear and strategic weapons, to ensure that that area remains outside the sphere of conflicts among the superpowers, thus ensuring for the countries and peoples of the region stability, peace and security and freedom from foreign intervention and foreign threats. My country expresses its readiness to contribute effectively to all the current efforts being made in the United Nations, and its hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will resume talks on this subject as soon as possible so that we may achieve the objective of bringing durable peace to this region.\n153.\tThe tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to 'disarmament, reaffirmed the need to intensify efforts to bring about general and complete disarmament under effective international control.\n154.\tWe are all aware of the great dangers which mankind faces as a result of the continued development and manufacture of nuclear weapons in quantities and with destructive potentialities unprecedented in the history of mankind. We join others in expressing our anxiety over the fact that progress was not made towards ending nuclear experiments and the development and manufacture of nuclear weapons and towards the destruction of existing stockpiles.\n155.\tWe hoped that the result of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament would be the beginning of a new stage in United Nations efforts in this field. For the first time in the history of this Organization the General Assembly was giving special and well-merited attention to the problem of disarmament. We hope that the Final Document approved by the special session [resolution S-10/2] will be implemented, that agreements will be formulated for the non-proliferation and use of nuclear weapons, and that the nuclear-weapon States, particularly the two super-Powers, will participate in such efforts, since they shoulder the major responsibility for achieving real, authentic progress towards that end.\n156.\tThe two super-Powers bear special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security but, unfortunately, we note that the split between them still-exists, and its impact spreads beyond relations between them and their allies to other countries and regions which are linked to them by relations of a different kind. That leads, as we have witnessed during past years, to the aggravation of some regional disputes. We join others in calling upon the super-Powers to refrain from extending their differences to the rest of the world and to work for the solution of their regional problems instead of exploiting them in order to extend their spheres of domination.\n157.\tMy country has taken part in all the sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, because it is convinced of the importance and vitality of those deliberations for ensuring the formulation of a comprehensive international convention which would serve as a sound legal basis for all activities relating to the sea.\n158.\tDespite the fact that patience is almost exhausted as a result of the slow progress in the work of that Conference and the problems resulting from that slow progress, as well as by the waste of effort, money and time, it gives us pleasure to note that during its last two sessions, in Geneva and New York, the Conference did manage to make some progress. We hope that the world will see the crowning of those strenuous efforts by the signing of the convention which we have long awaited.\n159.\tIn this connexion we welcome the achievements of the negotiations on subjects relating to the control of production and protection of the rights of the developing countries to the utilization and exploitation of their resources and to equitable arrangements for their distribution. We hope that the negotiating groups will be able to reach agreement regarding the transfer of technology to and the training of cadres from developing countries, a matter which is no less important than the necessity of safeguarding the sovereignty of the littoral States.\n\n160.\tI turn now to the international economic situation. There is no doubt that a certain amount of economic and technical co-operation exists among countries today, but at the same time we realize that there is scope for wider co-operation for development and progress and we call for the intensification of efforts, particularly on the part of the developed and industrialized countries. We also call upon those countries to increase, or double, their aid to promote the rate of growth of the developing countries, to work for the fixing of prices of their manufactured goods and to put an end to inflation and alleviate the burden of debt of the developing countries, for fairer prices for their products, and other aims and objectives expressed by the Group of 77.\n161.\tWe call for the intensification of efforts in those fields as that would permit the attainment of the objectives of development, particularly in the developing countries. In this connexion we must affirm the necessity of continuing the constructive dialogue regarding the establishment of a new, more equitable world economic order. We deplore the failure of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, we appeal to all parties to re-examine the reality and the practical effect of the harmful results that will be inflicted on the whole international community in the case of the failure of those negotiations. We also hope that the political determination exists in the industrialized world to permit those negotiations to be effectively and seriously pursued within the United Nations framework, so that we may be able to achieve the desired results and to adopt decisions during a special session of the General Assembly in 1980.\n162.\tSimilarly, we cannot forget that the developing countries, for their part, should redouble their efforts, by focusing upon development and production in the pursuit of vigilant practical policies, because social and economic development should be based on firm foundations of stability and self-reliance. As we can see, there is wide scope for the promotion of economic, trade and technical co-operation among the developing countries themselves, and particularly at the regional level. We believe that through pursuit of regional co-operation we can create greater potential for the expansion of international cooperation in general. The regional framework provides opportunities for co-ordination, and economic and cultural integration, and geographical proximity facilitates the development of co-operation and co-ordination in keeping with the abilities and potential of the different regional groups. In addition, those countries increase their cohesiveness in a spirit of friendship, co-operation and goodwill in their relations. In that way we avoid any possibility of dispute or confrontation among them.\n163.\tIn view of all this, my country has always called for the promotion of such co-operation in our region and has worked for this end in all sincerity. It still continues to hope for further co-operation among the different countries, in our region in various spheres for the well-being of those countries and their peoples.\n164.\tThe Sultanate of Oman, under the leadership of His Majesty Sultan Qabus\u2014may God preserve his life-extends a hand of sincere friendship and fruitful co-operation to all peoples and countries of the world, regardless of their different economic, social and political systems, on the basis of respect for sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of others. Furthermore, it will make every effort for self-development in co-operation with all, for the welfare of all and in complete commitment to the fullest possible implementation of the principles of the United Nations Charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff25.\tAllow me first to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the important post of President of the General Assembly.\n26.\tI wish also to take this opportunity to welcome the State of Solomon Islands to our Organization.\n27.\tThe events which have occurred since the last session of the General Assembly attest that die situation in the world remains serious and complex, and fraught with threats and dangers to freedom, independence and the sovereignty of various peoples and countries.\n28.\tToday we see increased aggressiveness on the part of the super-Powers, constant intensification of their expansionist and hegemonist policy, and their feverish preparations for wars and aggression. Their fierce rivalry to divide and re-divide the world and to ensure for themselves zones of influence, markets and sources of raw materials, has increased. In numerous parts of the world hotbeds of tension and conflict, wars and aggression exist and are being created.\n29.\tEvents such as those occurring in the Middle East, in Africa and in South-East Asia prove that ancient and modern imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism will stop at no crime to regain their lost positions, and to prevent peoples from devoting themselves to strengthening their political independence, and their independent economic and social progress.\n30.\tThe American imperialists, the Soviet social- imperialists and other imperialists are trying to submit peoples of sovereign countries to their domination, to make them subscribe to their doctrines of bondage, and to make them renounce their freedom, their national independence and their liberation struggle. In order to achieve these ends they stop at no action-however reprehensible it may be, and however much it may run counter to the norms of moral and international law\u2014from sabre-rattling to treacherous attitudes and the brutal breach of agreements officially concluded between States.\n31.\tWhile they have recourse to pressure and violence, the super-Powers are waging an intense propaganda campaign to delude world public opinion, and to pass off their aggressive stratagems as actions serving the cause of peace, the settlement of major international problems and the defence of the interests of other countries. They are not lost for words to express their desire to see \\\"harmony and understanding established\\\", \\\"detente\\\", and \\\"general and complete disarmament\\\", \\\"to avert nuclear wars\\\", and to see the world becoming a mosaic of \\\"zones of peace and denuclearized zones\\\", and so on.\n32.\tThe consequences of the policy and aggressive activities of the imperialist super-Powers are obvious in many parts of the world. Much has been said about detente and peace and security in Europe. But the facts show that Europe is not a continent of solved problems, tranquillity and stability. In Europe the dangerous confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union and their aggressive political and military blocs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization continue as hitherto. In Europe the two super-Powers have massed considerable military forces and have further strengthened their military bases and their nuclear arsenals. They continually organize offensive manoeuvres and make feverish preparations for war. The American imperialists and the Soviet social-imperialists use every political, economic and military means to strengthen their positions in their respective zones of influence and to undermine the positions of their adversaries. The accusations they level at each other concerning the non-observation of the so-called \\\"spirit of Helsinki\\\" decisions and the deadlock in the Vienna negotiations and deals are attempts to justify the maintenance of their influence and their hegemonistic policies. The status quo established by the United States and the Soviet Union has harmed and is harming very seriously the sovereignty of the peoples and States of Europe.\n33.\tToday in Europe other imperialist forces which show much zeal in fanning the flames of conflict in that continent are seeking ever more overtly to gain a foothold. They are doing their utmost to increase the possibilities of conflict and war in Europe between the two super-Powers, between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization, to give rise to as many confused situations as possible in Europe.\n34.\tThe Albanian Government has long expressed its view that detente and the establishment of genuine peace in Europe are attainable not through illusions and hopes based on the promises of the imperialists and the social imperialists, but only by unmasking and countering resolutely their misleading diplomatic manoeuvres. In order that genuine steps may be taken towards the establishment of peace in Europe, first and foremost the military bases and the foreign troops stationed in various countries of that continent must be withdrawn and the aggressive military blocs headed by the super-Powers must be dismantled.\n35. The imperialist Powers have always striven to create and maintain a tense situation in the Balkan peninsula and to stir up quarrels and conflicts between the States of that\nregion. As a result of the policy of intervention of the\nsuper-Powers a number of disquieting factors have accumulated\ntoday in the Balkans; there are problems which\nhamper the normal development of good-neighbourly relations\nbetween the various States in that region; and there\nstill prevail conditions which prevent the Balkan peoples\nfrom feeling secure and sheltered from danger.\n36. The most recent events show that the imperialists, far\nfrom having renounced their plans in the Balkans, are\nstepping up their provocative actions to turn that region\ninto a \\\"powder keg,\\\" an armed camp and a bridge-head for\nthe~ warlike strategies. It is to this end that the various\nvisits by delegations have been made at the highest possible\nlevel by the imperialist Powers to various Balkan countries.\nIt goes without saying that whoever goes along with the\ngame of the super-Powers in the Balkans is harming the\ninterests of his own people and at the sane time creating\ndangers for other peoples.\n37. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania has always\ntaken principled and constructive attitudes on problems\nwhich concern genuine peace and security in the Balkans.\nBy its actions it has shown its will to contribute to\nimproving the situation in that zone. It is and always has\nbeen in favour of good-neighbourly relations, and has\ndeclared that it will never allow any evil or danger to\nneighbouring States to come by way of its territory .\n38. The Albanian Government holds that the Balkan\npeople are capable of acting resolutely to bar the way to\nany intervention, to any intrigue by the imperialist Powers.\nIt considers that the interests of peace and security in the\nBalkans require that the Balkan States act responsibly, that\nthey not allow themselves to be involved in the dangerous\nplans of those who do not wish them well. The leader of\nthe Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, once said:\n\\\"The Balkans have never in themselves been a 'powder\nkeg'. They were made so in the past by foreigners and\nimperialists, who held all the detonators and who wish to .\nmaintain that situation even today. The Balkan peoples\nare in duty bound to cut all the fuses with the sword, so\nthat peace- and security may be firmly established in the\nBalkans. It goes without saying that our peoples need\nfriends. But they must never become the tools of\nforeigners to the detriment of the interests of any people\nor of all our peoples jointly.\\\"\n39. As a Mediterranean country, the People's Socialist Republic of Albania has always attentively followed the complex situation which has been created in the Mediterranean\nby the aggressive aims and activities of the United States of America and the Soviet Union and in particular by the presence of their navies in that sea. The situation in the Mediterranean would \\\"change for the better - which would  contribute to the maintenance of peace in the region - were the Mediterranean countries to take specific measures against the presence of the navies of the United States of America and the Soviet Union, to forbid the establishment of\nAmerican and Soviet military bases on their territories and to refuse port facilities to the warships and air corridors to the military aircraft of the two super-Powers, The concessions being granted to one or the other super-Power, or to both, are fraught with grave consequences not only\nfor the country which grants them but for other countries\nas well.\n40. The earliest and most just possible solution of the\nproblem of Cyprus would eliminate one of the hotbeds of\ntension in the Mediterranean and one of the factors which\nhas a negative influence on the situation in the Balkans.\nCyprus must be an independent and sovereign State where\nthe two communities can live in understanding and harmony.\nThe Albanian Government's view has been and\nremains that this problem can and must be resolved in a just\nmanner by the people of Cyprus itself, on the basis of its\nfree will and without any foreign intervention.\n41.. The effects of the imperialist-Zionist aggression and\nthe rivalry of the United States of America and the Soviet\nUnion in the Middle East continue to weigh ever more\nheavily on the Arab peoples, first and foremost the\nPalestinian people. The Israeli Zionists have until now\nenjoyed numerous advantages from the constant military,\npolitical and economic support they have received from the\nAmerican imperialists and from the anti-Arab manoeuvres\nof the super-Powers. The tragic events in Lebanon show\nthat they have stepped up even further their aggressive\nactions against the Arab peoples and countries. Life and the\nfacts have confirmed the warnings given by the true friends\nof the Arab peoples with regard to the danger and the grave\nconsequences of the numerous plots hatched by the\nimperialists for years on end to sabotage the liberation\nstruggle of the Arab peoples, to divide them and to draw\nthem into the trap of so-called political settlements, of\nconferences and mediations of the imperialists, which can\nonly lead to the sacrifice of the fundamental rights of the\nArab peoples, first and foremost the Palestinian people. The\nimperialists strive to impose humiliating conditions on the\nArab States and partial solutions to the Middle East problem. But as long as its legitimate rights are denied to\nthe Palestinian people, as long as Israeli troops occupy even\none inch of Arab land, peace in that world trouble-spot\ncannot be assured.\n42. We are confident that, whatever the difficulties, the Arab\npeoples, whose energy is great, will finally attain their\nrights, thanks to their resolute struggle and their unity. The\npeople and the. Government of Albania have supported and\nwill always support with determination the just cause of the\nPalestinian people and the other fraternal Arab peoples.\n43. This year has been marked by a sharp increase of\ntension in 'the African continent. The African peoples, which have after a long struggle, arduous efforts and many sacrifices broken the chains of centuries-old colonial domination and now aspire to consolidate their independence\nand national sovereignty, are now confronting difficult\npolitical, economic and military situations brought about\nby the interference of the super-Powers and imperialist\nPowers in Africa. The imperialist super-Powers stir up\ndisputes and conflicts among the African countries and incite among them hostility that has its roots in the problems which they have inherited from colonial domination. Africa is flooded by arms, countless advisers, specialists and military instructors from the West and the East, who seek to induce the Africans to fight among\nthemselves for the benefit of foreigners. The hotbeds of war\nand armed conflicts kindled by the United States, the Soviet Union and other imperialist Powers in various parts of Africa are causing great tragedies to the African peoples. In order to befuddle the African peoples and countries as much as possible, the super-Powers make a great show of being the friends of the African peoples and accuse one another of \\\"intervention\\\" in Africa or of \\\"disrupting the balance\\\". Others, on the pretext of struggling against Soviet social-imperialism, strive to intervene themselves in Africa and advise the African countries to unite with American imperialism and the former colonial Powers. In fact, all have the same goal\u2014to dominate, and carve up Africa, to create or extend zones of influence and to bring the African States into the orbit of their policy of bondage.\n44.\tBut the African peoples can no longer allow the imperialist Powers to act as they see fit in Africa. They can no longer allow, them to oppress the peoples, to pillage and to establish the borders of a State according to their whim. Their struggle to defend their sovereign rights against the interference and intrigues of the imperialist Powers and to wipe out colonialism, neo-colonialism and racism enjoys the sympathy and support of the whole of progressive world opinion.\n45.\tThe victories which the African peoples have won thus far in their struggle for liberation and the consolidation of their national independence, the struggle of the peoples of Azania, Zimbabwe and Namibia against apartheid and the racist regimes, the efforts of freedom-loving countries of Africa to exercise complete sovereignty over their natural wealth for their own free and independent development prove that the process of great changes which has begun in Africa cannot be stopped.\n46.\tThe Albanian people and the Government of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania express their complete solidarity with the African peoples in their just struggle against brutal intervention by the imperialist Powers in Africa. They staunchly support the struggle of the peoples of Azania, Zimbabwe and Namibia against the racist regimes in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, the existence of which continues to inflict a serious wound on Africa.\n47.\tA serious situation fraught with dangerous consequences has been created once again in South-East Asia. The armed conflict between Viet Nam and Cambodia is saddening, especially to freedom-loving peoples who for years followed with great admiration and supported the heroic struggle for national liberation waged by the peoples of those countries, shoulder to shoulder, against American imperialism and its lackeys. The conflict between these two countries is stirred up by the imperialist Powers which, in order to intensify their expansionist policy, continue their interference and their plots to prevent those peoples from living in peace, developing and advancing on the road to progress.\n48.\tThe Albanian people and its Government, sincere friends of the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples, have followed with sadness the development of events and are grieved at the grave consequences of the fratricidal war between those two peoples. They have expressed and still express their conviction that the bloodshed can be stopped and the disagreements resolved only through joint efforts and goodwill on the part of the two countries, through friendly negotiations and by barring the road to any foreign interference.\n49.\tBut unfortunately we note that the conflict in South-East Asia, instead of progressing towards a solution in a spirit of friendship and mutual understanding, is tending to worsen. The Vietnamese people who have waged a heroic war and have made a great contribution to the peoples' struggle, have now become the target of open blackmail and pressure from outside, which horrifies honest people. No one has the right to interfere in their internal affairs and to dictate to them what they should do internally.\n50.\tAs a result of the American occupation of South Korea the situation in the Korean peninsula remains complicated. The Albanian people supports the just demand of the Korean people for the withdrawal of the United States troops from South Korea and for the independent reunification of the country.\n51.\tIn the turbulent situation which prevails in the world today, the peoples are confronted by the imperative task of fighting resolutely to foil the plans of the imperialist super-Powers and reactionary forces designed to cause a new world conflagration.\n52.\tThe danger of that war breaking out remains real. The super-Powers and the imperialist Powers by their various .policies are heading for war. It would be an illusion to think that the military balance between the super-Powers eliminates the possibility of another war breaking out. The world cannot escape that danger by leaving it to the imperialists to settle problems of war and peace as they see fit.\n53.\tThe demagogic words and slogans of the imperialist Powers do not bring about disarmament; they mask armament. The tenth special session of the General Assembly showed once more that the super-Powers are not thinking about disarmament at all but are striving by all means in their power to increase and improve weapons of all kinds, speed up the aims race and increase their military budgets. Weapons are not being reduced or eliminated and war cannot be avoided by pinning hopes on the discussions and bargaining of the super-Powers, such as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and many other negotiations arranged by the United States and the. Soviet Union, or by decisions such as those taken at Helsinki,  or by resolutions and documents, which TO often adopted under the pressure and the manipulation of the imperialist super-Powers.\n54.\tPeoples and sovereign States which want peace and genuine security support genuine and effective disarmament and hate imperialist war. Their interest demands that they struggle resolutely against the aggressive policies and plans, the armament and preparations for war and the deceitful demagogy of the super-Powers.\n55.\tThe imperialists, social-imperialists and other reactionaries greatly fear the intensification in breadth and depth of\nthe struggle of the peoples and the strengthening of their solidarity and fighting unity. Therefore they strive by all possible means to stifle the liberation and revolutionary struggles of the peoples in order to destroy, by co-ordinated force and methods, the unity and solidarity of the people, to divide them, to isolate them from each other or to lead peoples and sovereign countries into misguided and dangerous paths.\n56.\tThe strengthening of the unity and solidarity of people is of major importance today. The peoples need a genuine and healthy unity, directed against their enemies, not a false unity in line with the stratagems and slogans invented by the imperialists and the opportunists.\n57.\tThe super-Powers have now intensified to the maximum degree their efforts to create a psychosis according to which no people and no country can guarantee its freedom and independence except under the umbrella and the tutelage of a large State. The American imperialists, who have always played and still play the role of the international policeman and who spread the policy of oppression and exploitation to the four corners of the world, have spread the idea that they alone can guarantee independence and progress for other countries, and that, if other States rely on them, they can feel themselves sheltered from the danger of the Soviet social-imperialists, or the Warsaw Pact, or any other dangers. The Soviet social-imperialists, for their part, endeavour to pave the way for their policy of expansion, domination and diktat, by offering to defend countries against the danger of American imperialism and of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. They trumpet the slogan of the \\\"anti-imperialist front\\\" under their guidance.\n58.\tAccepting the \\\"protective umbrellas\\\" of the super-Powers is tantamount to accepting the elimination of the freedom, independence and national sovereignty of one's own country, and accepting bondage.\n59.\tWe ate opposed to the imperialist and social-imperialist super-Powers which engage in various forms of neocolonialism exploit and oppress peoples, deny them freedom and independence, and pit them one against the other in bloody conflicts to satisfy their own rapacious interests, Among the fallacious means used to ensure exploitation; and domination we find a certain theory of \\\"the three worlds\\\", the authors of which preach to the proletariat and the oppressed peoples that they should enter into monstrous affiances with the imperialists and the capitalists. They do so to justify their hegemonistic designs, which they camouflage by the alleged need to fight one of the super-Powers.\n60.\tThe policy of our party and our State is and always will be directed against any hostile action which would endanger the freedom, independence and sovereignty of the peoples. We expose, as we have always exposed, all enemies of the people and their reactionary ideological ideas and expansionist actions, whether overt or covert. The policy of our Government is to support the aspirations of peoples and to combat policies of oppression and exploitation no matter who practises it.\n61.\tThe peoples of the world must be vigilant, because a tragic game is being played out behind the backs of us all.\nWe think, therefore, that no country and no people ought to stand idly by, accepting the frauds and malevolent actions of the super-Powers and of various imperialists.\n62.\tThe People's Socialist Republic of Albania has always staunchly supported the just struggles of the peoples for their national and social liberation, the right of sovereign peoples and countries to live freely and independently, to develop, to make progress in conformity with their own legitimate will and aspirations.\n63.\tThe Albanian people and Government are vigorously opposed to any reactionary concept, any concept of enslavement, which the imperialist Powers seek to impose in international relations in order to force the small peoples and countries to submit to the diktat and policies of the big Powers, and they reject that concept. In our view, all countries and peoples, whether large or small, have their contribution to the development of human society. The weight of that contribution cannot be measured by geographical size or the size of the population of the State concerned but, first and foremost, by the path it is following, the ideas it holds and the positive or negative role which it plays in international relations.\n64.\tWe consider that international policy should not be the preserve of the large States. To us it is inadmissible that other countries should be denied the right to hold and openly express their points of view and their positions on major political problems of concern to peoples and to mankind as a whole, and to participate actively in finding solutions to those problems.\n65.\tThe Albanian Government has always pursued a just policy of principle in its relations with other countries. It has always been, and still is, in favour of the development of normal and friendly relations with all countries which respect the principles of equality, sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of others. Faithful to that policy, the People's Socialist Republic of Albania has constantly maintained, developed and extended good normal relations with an ever growing number of States. It has rejected the attempts made by various imperialist and chauvinist Powers to exploit relations or agreements as a means of pressure to dictate their will and impose their positions and views on Albania.\n66.\tWith the same determination, the Albanian Government has rejected the efforts of the Chinese leadership to dictate to socialist Albania its own policy and its big-Power attitudes. As the Assembly knows, on 7 July last the Government of the People's Republic of China engaged in an overtly hostile act against socialist Albania and the Albanian people by cutting off aid and credits which it was committed to supply under the terms of official bilateral agreements. That was an arbitrary and a perfidious act by the Chinese Government, a flagrant violation of the obligations it has assumed on the basis of official agreements and the most elementary rules of relations between sovereign States and laws governing international relations. The real reasons for those agreements being rescinded were not purely technical, as the Chinese Government claims, but were profoundly political and ideological. The only reason for the Chinese Government's decision to violate the agreements concluded and extend ideological differences to the sphere of inter-State relations was that socialist Albania never agreed to go along with the chauvinist great-Power policy of the Chinese leadership.\n67.\tThe Albanian people has always appreciated sincere friendship. Our history has taught us to be vigilant, to distinguish between friend and foe, not to fear the attacks and threats of enemies or be deceived by the hypocritical smiles of those who pretend to be friends but whose actions are prompted by evil intentions towards us. Albania has never held out a begging hand to anyone, nor will it do so. We are not alone or isolated, as our enemies would wish or as they would have other people believe. The so-called isolation is a concept spread by the propaganda of the imperialist and chauvinist Powers, which see the position of other States according to their ideology and describe as \\\"isolated\\\" anyone who refuses to toe their line.\n68.\tThe People's Socialist Republic of Albania has declared that no imperialist Power whatsoever should whet its appetite or cherish illusions by thinking that Albania, under the pressure of international circumstances, may change its course and rely on one super-Power or another. Anyone who thinks that a so-called vacuum has been created in Albania and dreams of filling it is greatly mistaken and will suffer defeat. There has never been and will never be in our country any vacuum waiting to be filled by the imperialists or social-imperialists.\n69.\tIn its free and completely independent homeland, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Labour Party, with Comrade Enver Hoxha at its head, is working selflessly to build a completely socialist society and to defend the freedom and independence of its country. Albania has seen uninterrupted development in all fields and is a country of progress, social justice and work for all.\n70.\tThe Albanian people will continue to advance with determination along the path of socialism, relying on its own forces. Self-reliance does not mean that we are in favour of autarchy or introversion. On the contrary, we have always been and still are in favour of extending international co-operation. We favour the development of trade and cultural relations and relations in other fields with .different States on the basis of the recognized principles that govern relations between sovereign States.\n71.\tWe base the defence of our country not on political expediency or on the various aggressive military alliances but on the strength of our people, which is prepared as one man to defend with determination its achievements and its socialist homeland.\n72.\tIn the future, too, the Albanian people and the People's Socialist Republic of Albania will strengthen their solidarity with freedom-loving peoples and with the democratic and progressive countries. They will staunchly support the struggle of the peoples for national liberation against the old and the new imperialism and against reaction.\n73.\tDuring the work of this session of the General Assembly the Albanian delegation will spare no effort to make its modest contribution to the discussion of the problems on the agenda, in the interest of the cause of the peoples and of international peace and security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n37.\tThe Tunisian delegation takes pleasure in the election of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia to preside over the General Assembly. It is an honour to his country, Colombia, with which we maintain the best possible relations within the framework of co-operation among the members of the Group of 77, and is indeed a well-deserved one. The Tunisian delegation is convinced that under his leadership the Assembly's work will be conducted with wisdom and efficiency.\n38.\tThis session of the General Assembly has not opened under the best possible auspices, but we should not give way to pessimism. Instead, we should face realities with the greatest possible measure of lucidity so that we can find appropriate solutions to the pressing problems facing the international community which are now being considered by our Assembly.\n39.\tWhether it concerns the Middle East, southern Africa or international economic relations, the present situation in\n\n\nno way allays the anxieties we expressed at the last session. Indeed, the hopes glimpsed 12 months ago have now given way to disappointment, and there is the danger of this increasing the general feelings of disenchantment and frustration, which only generate bitterness, despair and violence.\n40.\tNot too long ago grounds for hope seemed greater than ever, and with regard to international problems there opened up before us prospects which suddenly were belied by dangerous developments.\n41.\tAs far as the Middle East is concerned, from time to time we glimpsed rays of hope that there was a possibility of a negotiated general settlement. Unfortunately, we have been disappointed in that, but we continue to believe that an equitable solution will be found and that the Palestinian people will enjoy its right to a free and independent existence in security and peace.\n42.\tIn southern Africa the Anglo-American plan for Rhodesia  and the efforts of the five Western Powers to fina a solution in Namibia gave grounds for believing that the obstinacy of the white minorities in maintaining their colonial and racial domination had finally been overcome and that a peaceful settlement would shortly restore freedom and dignity to the peoples of that area. But we know what is happening: one \\\"internal settlement\\\" succeeds another, while the spectre of a widespread conflagration is beginning to haunt us once again.\n43.\tWith regard to disarmament, the hopes aroused by the first special session of the General Assembly ever devoted to that question have been only partially justified.\n44.\tAs to the North-South dialogue, the principal instrument for the creation of a new international economic order, the hopes which had been placed in the creation of the Committee of the Whole have been dashed. The developed countries, having systematically turned their backs on the reality of interdependence-which, however, they miss no opportunity of calling for\u2014in the final analysis rejected the principle of true dialogue and specific negotiations.\n45.\tIf such trends were to continue all those anxieties would be justified and we could only fear the worst, because problems of this kind will not brook the procrastination which hitherto has marked the attitude of one part of the international community.\n46.\tThus in the Middle East all the gestures made by the Arab side, which were marked by moderation and the will for peace, affirmed, reaffirmed and proved, have turned out to be futile in the face of systematic rejection by successive Israeli Governments, particularly the present one, which remains tied to the policies of another age. The Government of Israel refuses to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people; it refuses to recognize its authentic representative, the Palestine Liberation Organization, thus closing the door to genuine peace.\n47.\tThe Tunisian Government regards all efforts to bring peace to that area as meritorious; similarly, any serious gesture in that direction deserves consideration. But it is clear that the diplomacy of contacts, however essential it may be, cannot truly be expected to prove effective unless it is based on a correct analysis of the nature of the problem. Now, the essence of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict lies in clear-cut and sincere recognition of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people.\n48.\tIn 1947 the United Nations adopted a resolution advocating the creation of an independent Palestinian State [resolution 181 (II)]. As a matter of principle, respect for international legality, rejection of the occupation of territories by force, and recognition of the right of peoples to self-determination are obligations incumbent upon all Member States and determine the degree of their responsibility in the conduct of international relations.\n49.\tIf we fail to bring to bear the will to peace on the very core of the conflict we run the risk of thwarting once again the possibility of a new era of peace and relief from conflict for all the peoples of the region. Indeed, all the upheavals and convulsions afflicting that part of the world are directly connected with the instability created by the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.\n50.\tThe latest manifestation of this conflict is the invasion of southern Lebanon, which the occupation forces refuse to evacuate, despite United Nations resolutions and the intervention of the international Force dispatched by the Security Council, UNIFIL.\n51.\tIn this regard, we take pleasure in paying a tribute to the Secretary-General and to his civilian and military colleagues for their devotion and efficiency. Indeed, it has become clear that it is only Israeli obstruction which has prevented UNIFIL from attaining the objectives laid down for it by the Security Council.\n52.\tThe time has come for the international community and our Organization, particularly its most responsible Members, to impose peace, lasting peace, peace which will respect the independence and dignity of all the peoples of the area, and particularly the pillaged people of Palestine. On the Arab side, the will to peace has been accompanied by an effort at comprehension and a concern for realism, supported by an overwhelming majority of members of the General Assembly.\n53.\tThe Middle East region as a whole can enjoy genuine lasting peace only within the framework of an over-all settlement that takes into account the following essential aspects, among others: first, the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including its right to build an independent State; secondly, participation in the peace negotiations by all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people; and, thirdly, the illegality of the acquisition of territory by force, which would entail, in particular, the liberation of the city of Jerusalem.\n54.\tThe Charter of the United Nations and General Assembly resolutions provide the guidelines for a rapid and over-all settlement, without which the threat of a new war, with all its unforeseeable consequences, will continue to face not only that already dangerously troubled region but the world at large.\n55.\tIn this connexion, we should heed the warning of the Secretary-General in his report, that in the Middle East \\\"time is not in favour of peaceful developments\\\" [see A/33/1, sect. III].\n56.\tAfter the tenth special session, devoted to disarmament, the Assembly should do its best to promote the implementation of its decisions, and to extend the real scope of the historic impact of that session on all those areas connected with international peace and co-operation. It was indeed a historic session because it was the first of its kind and also because it brought about a real consensus. Because it opened the way to more active participation on the part of the medium-sized and small countries in the disarmament negotiations, and because it gave more precise outlines for action and conduct, the special session marked an important milestone in our common effort to spare humanity the enormous waste of effort and resources devoted to armament to the detriment of economic and social development.\n57.\tWe believe that, in addition to diverting productive resources, the arms race serves to fuel conflicts and rivalries and inevitably serves to make tighter and tighter bonds of dependence on the principal suppliers. For the third-world countries this anomalous process fundamentally jeopardizes the principle of non-alignment and leads, in the final analysis, to a greater measure of vulnerability.\n58.\tAfrican problems continue to be of the greatest concern to my country and Government. It is not only that the grave problems in the south of the continent have not been solved, but the whole of Africa is today the scene of crises and regional conflicts which have been aggravated in the course of a deliberate process of interference and intervention from outside Africa, both of which unfortunately have done much more to crystallize these problems than to solve them.\n59.\tThus, we note a rapid deterioration of the situation in southern Africa. The disappointment and anxiety we feel are a measure of the hope we had entertained that the problems of Rhodesia and Namibia would be brought into a process of peaceful settlement worked out by the Western countries. The racist Governments of Salisbury and Pretoria have responded to this by setting up their own so-called internal plans for settlement, which are just so many manoeuvres that are fraught with consequences. The distrust shown by the Patriotic Front in one case, and SWAPO in the other, have proved, unfortunately, entirely justified.\n60.\tThe authorities in Salisbury and Pretoria have cynically exploited the breathing-space provided by the peaceful settlement initiatives, in an attempt to create in the Territories which they dominate irreversible situations to perpetuate the exploitation of the people and the resources. Any new initiative should therefore be accompanied by the most serious guarantees if we do not want despair and violence finally to prevail over a peaceful settlement, which remains the preferred approach of the African peoples. For their part, SWAPO in Namibia, and the Patriotic Front in Zimbabwe, have shown the measure of their realism and moderation in an attempt to find democratic and humane solutions.\n61.\tThe authorities of Pretoria have just rejected the settlement plan of the United Nations for Namibia.  This reversal makes it even more incumbent upon us to safeguard the opportunity for a peaceful outcome and to associate SWAPO, as closely as possible, with the efforts of our Organization and the Western Powers, which have already been launched, for Namibia to be able to become independent on schedule, within the framework of its unity and territorial integrity.\n62.\tIn South Africa itself, a heroic struggle is being waged by the black people and its youth against the apartheid regime. Neither intimidation nor the most brutal repression will be able to crush this struggle, which is none the less extremely arduous and murderous, in a country where a white minority, with feelings of racial superiority, have no inhibitions in the way they treat the nationalists. The murder of Steven Biko will remain for ever the symbol of what has now become, from Sharpeville to Soweto, an authentic nationalist struggle.\n63.\tWe are convinced that the resistance of the last outposts of racism is doomed to failure. However, the persistence of the struggle is delaying even further the development of the African continent by diverting its resources, by destroying its best elements, and by sacrificing its youth.\n64.\tEvery year the General Assembly examines the international economic situation, and every year it sees that the problems facing the world, and in particular the third world, are becoming more numerous and more complex. We consider in turn such subjects as monetary instability, inflation, the slowing down of the rate of growth. Today, the world is staggered by the sight of the combined effects of all these phenomena.\n65.\tIt would appear that the international community is overlooking global and long-term solutions. It is confining itself to attempting to blunt, as best it can, the worst effects of the crises. Indeed, the grave monetary crises which in 1971 culminated in the suspension of the convertibility of the dollar and which gradually came to extend to the whole of the Western economy, made it an imperative necessity to bring to bear concerted action at the world level. The momentum thus generated helped to strengthen the notion of interdependence and entailed an intensification of international negotiations. The general awareness of the scope of the crisis and our incapacity to overcome it in isolation won round the last remaining sceptics to a recognition of the need to work towards the establishment of a new international economic order.\n66.\tBut the countries that were strongest economically quickly acquired a safeguard mechanism, which, though limited and fragile, was a misguided diversion of energies that should have been devoted to the major dialogues and broad and global solutions called for by the vast majority of the developing countries. This shilly-shallying, so ill adapted to the actual dimensions of the problems, of course only granted a short-lived respite, which was immediately threatened because, in the face of problems of world dimensions, such as monetary instability and the slowing down of the growth rate, it served only to delay the inevitable.\n67.\tThe consequences of this situation affect even more severely the economies of the developing countries, which are not able to act decisively. In the face of the protectionism which is affecting more and more seriously the most dynamic sectors of their fledgling industries, and the tumbling of the export prices of primary commodities, the developing countries have been suffering from an even more marked deterioration of the terms of trade and a consequent worsening of the deficit in their trade balances. Those developing countries with \\\"an intermediate income\\\" which have succeeded, at the cost of many sacrifices, in maintaining a reasonable balance of payments, could not really maintain this effort much longer. They were forced into massive indebtedness towards the private capital markets, on the most difficult conditions and terms, while the supply of public assistance had dried up almost completely.\n68.\tAre we to wait until the crisis assumes catastrophic dimensions before we begin once again to take action and to do so together? Of course, conferences at the highest levels among the major developed countries are being held one after another and decisions are taken or envisaged in an attempt to arrive at co-ordinated policies. Permit me to repeat here that any policy which today ignores the interests, needs, and economic potential of the third world, not only serves to perpetuate injustice but actually stems from selfishness which can only aggravate general economic insecurity.\n69.\tIn this regard, analyses in various quarters corroborate each other. In his address to the World Bark and the IMF just two weeks ago, Mr. Robert McNamara denounced with remarkable candour the absence of any coherent global policy, as well as the illusory and perilous refuge of protectionism and the dangers of the excessive indebtedness of the developing countries. His commitment and his conviction deserve commendation from this rostrum because he was speaking, with the utmost clarity and was bold enough to place the responsibility squarely where it belongs.\n70.\tThe third world for its part cannot resign itself indefinitely to playing a passive role in world industrial production. As the developing countries proceed to modernize their economies, they must be able to play a more active world role without being exposed to artificial obstacles. The New International Economic Order, established to serve the general interest, had as its central theme that of permitting the developing countries to take their proper place within the world economy, to contribute to the general growth and to benefit from it appropriately. The North-South dialogue was to have provided the outlines for, and to have embarked upon, the process of reform likely to trigger off this process.\n102. The dialogue has rarely gone beyond the stage of analyses, general declarations and statements of intent. The Committee of the Whole set up last year by the General Assembly to supervise and co-ordinate the various aspects of that dialogue immediately came up against the conflicting multiplicity of interpretations as to the nature of its mandate, to such an extent that it was prevented from taking any action. That makes it absolutely clear that divergences relate fundamentally to the sense and purport of the dialogue itself.\n103 For Tunisia, and we think for the developing countries as a whole which form the membership of the Group of 77\u2014which did us the honour this year of entrusting its presidency to us-the dialogue is not a forum simply for the use of theoreticians, or a battleground for confrontation and polemics, nor is it a subterfuge to maintain, however flimsily the status quo in international economic relations. The dialogue we look for would be a framework for negotiations best suited for the purpose, and devoted essentially to the promotion of the New International Economic Order, in the strictest sense of the term. In order to promote this dialogue our Assembly must be able to play a central role. More than ever before the United Nations needs an effective instrument bringing together all Member States and having a clear-cut and unquestioned mandate. The dialogue if it is to succeed cannot continue to take place disparately or within technical structures seemingly indifferent to the evolution of international relations.\n104.\tIt is the task of this session of the General Assembly to give content and a framework to the North-South dialogue, which will thus be able to develop in harmony and security rather than in confusion and confrontation. Beyond matters of procedure, the debate on this point will illustrate more fundamentally the reality of commitments undertaken vis-\u00e0-vis the New International Economic Order itself and the will of all the partners to make a sincere and determined contribution to this project, which will affect the security and welfare of all nations and which Tunisia considers, for its part, as one of the fundamental reforms of our time.\n105.\tOne of the best ways to bring about this New International Economic Order is certainly to inform international opinion faithfully, carefully and accurately about the reality of the claims of the third world, and the spirit of co-operation and interdependence that underlie it. How can we trust the mass media today to transmit this message of justice and solidarity?\n106.\tIn the developed countries, most of the media present the New International Economic Order as a threat to the well-being of industrialized societies and often claim that the crisis of the developed world stems primarily from the claims and demands of the developing counties. That is one aspect, but an important aspect, of world imbalance which serves to accentuate the cleavage between the developed and the developing countries.\n107.\tBy its very essence, information plays a vital role in international relations as a way of bringing knowledge and understanding from one nation to another. Furthermore, the headlong progress of technology makes the media today increasingly influential and gives it an ever-growing audience. The diffusion and dissemination of information and knowledge has become an essential pre-condition of progress and the flourishing of all organized society.\n108.\tIn the circumstances, we must undertake a far- reaching reform of the distribution circuits and the content of information so as to make the developing countries actually producers and partners in the whole process instead of just being consumers.\n109.\tThese third-world countries essentially receive information conceived, prepared and distributed by other countries. They suffer from the effects of a de facto monopoly of the information media by the industrialized countries.\n110.\tThe concept of freedom of information, which we basically support, is thus so distorted as actually to serve as an additional factor of domination which perpetuates relations based on inequality and injustice. The free circulation of information must not be reduced to the freedom to receive that information; it must also include the ability to produce the information and to pass it on.\n111.\tThat objective is connected with the determination of the third-world countries to rely upon themselves first and foremost to promote their own means of information, while remaining open to support from outside, and to give an authentic expression to their own problems, their aspirations and their values.\n112.\tThat effort will make it possible to embark in more favourable conditions upon a definition of equitable and balanced co-operation among developed countries: the new Order in information is all the more necessary because it is a corollary of the New International Economic Order, and an instrument of a new humanism.\n113.\tThe situation in the world does not encourage optimism However, this Organization, whether it be the Security Council or the General Assembly, has laid down with respect to each problem the outlines of a peaceful and just solution. That is true of the Middle East, of Namibia, of international economic relations and many other problems.\n114.\tWill it be too much to ask those who possess the means of translating the intentions of the international community into concrete realities to do their duty? Is it too much to ask of them to keep their promises in southern Africa, to apply their resolutions in the Middle East and to translate into reality their professions of faith with regard to interdependence by condescending to hold a dialogue and to negotiate with the peoples of the third world? \n115.\tLet us hope that this session will be an opportunity for all of us resolutely to undertake not to allow blind, narrow interests to blind us to our true common interests, namely peace, peace everywhere, in a necessarily interdependent world of growing solidarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff33.\tMr. President, first I should like to congratulate you on your election to your high office. I can assure you of the all-out support of my delegation in your efforts to lead this session of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion.\n34.\tI should like also to avail myself of this opportunity to .welcome the one hundred and fiftieth State Member of the United Nations, Solomon Islands, to which I extend my congratulations.\n35.\tMajor international developments took place on the eve of this General Assembly affecting two of the most dangerous conflict areas in the world: the Middle East and southern Africa. The impact of those events will be a major theme in the present general debate.\n36.\tIn this context it is also relevant to discuss the various aspects of the United Nations peace-keeping activities.\n37.\tWe are at present confronted with a grave crisis in the world economy. Future prospects have become more uncertain. Within the United Nations this serious situation has a negative impact on the North-South dialogue, in which progress is lacking.\n38.\tThe achievements and short-comings of the United Nations are bound to come up for scrutiny at each session of the General Assembly. The report of the Secretary- General on the work of the Organization [A/33/1] offers most valuable comments and suggestions on this subject. Particularly, I have in mind the Secretary-General's comments on the role of the United Nations: what the Organization can and ought to do. Rhetoric may create expectations of immediate over-all solutions to intractable issues, but progress is hardly made in such a, way. Practical results can be achieved only through a realistic and pragmatic approach. In order to make proper use of the potential inherent in this Organization we must also recognize its limitations.\n39.\tThe Secretary-General focuses also on our work patterns and procedures-and rightly so. It is a question that is technical in nature but one that in the modern world will have political implications. The point is well taken by the Secretary-General when he states: \\\"Once having arrived here by jet aircraft, however, the procedures adopted are much the same as they were in 1919\\\" [See A/33/1, sect. X]. We should therefore seriously contemplate how CT work patterns can be adjusted to the requirements of today.\n40.\tI will now address myself to the situation we are facing as a result of South Africa's decision to break off further co-operation with the United Nations regarding a peaceful transition to majority rule in Namibia. This step by South Africa has created a new and serious situation in southern Africa. South Africa's decision is an arrogant challenge to world opinion. The United Nations must react against this affront to our persistent efforts in pursuit of the liberation of Namibia. During this session of the Genera] Assembly we must make it understood that the international community cannot accept a solution which does not embrace all political groups, including the South West Africa People's Organization. Norway, for its part, will not recognize an arrangement established on such a basis. Should it become dear that South Africa has irrevocably rejected further co-operation with the United Nations regarding a peaceful settlement in Namibia, new measures must be taken against South Africa.\n41.\tMidway through International Anti-Apartheid Year we cannot but note that South Africa has not changed its policy of racial discrimination and oppression of the black majority of the people. In this situation the world community has, in our opinion, no choice but to increase the pressures against South Africa. An international mobilization against apartheid is imperative. Norway has, together with the other Nordic countries, already implemented certain measures against South Africa on a bilateral basis. We are considering further steps as an expansion of the joint Nordic programme of action against South Africa, which was adopted by the Nordic Foreign Ministers at their meeting in Oslo earlier this year.\n42.\tWe are also prepared to lend our support to measures aimed at stepping up the international pressure against South Africa, including mandatory economic sanctions. Through concrete action the international community must demonstrate its solidarity with the peoples of southern Africa in their struggle against racism and apartheid.\n43.\tSouth Africa's position on the question of Namibia may also have negative effects on the possibilities for a negotiated settlement in Zimbabwe. My country shares the view that a settlement in Zimbabwe that does not include the Patriotic Front will not lead to a peaceful transition to majority rule. A solution is possible only if all parties are brought to the negotiating table at the earliest date. We believe also that the United Nations sanctions against the Smith regime must be maintained until a settlement acceptable to all parties concerned has been found.\n44.\tLately regional or local conflicts in Africa have increasingly added to the tension between the big Powers. This must be avoided not only for the sake of the African countries themselves but also because of the relations between the big Powers. In our opinion conflicts on the African continent must be resolved by the African States themselves, if necessary with assistance from the United Nations.\n45.\tThe greatest threat to world peace has for many years been the situation in the Middle East. Today our attention is focused on the Camp David agreements  and their implementation. Different views have been expressed on these agreements. The Norwegian Government welcomed the initiative of the President of the United States, Mr. Carter, and his efforts in this matter. I would also like to express our hope that the results achieved at Camp David will prove to be a milestone on the road to a lasting peace in the Middle East. I express this hope because we consider inflexible positions to be the greatest threat to peace in the Middle East. It was against this background that the Norwegian Government supported President El-Sadat's bold initiative last fall, an initiative that has now been followed up by the Camp David agreements. We fully realize that the most important problems are still unresolved. It remains to find a way to bring the other parties-involved into the peace process.. That is a necessary condition for a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.\n46.\tI would hope that the momentum which now may have been created will be utilized so that the peoples of the Middle East, who for years have been the subject of conflict and confrontation, may soon be able to live in peace .and freedom. The Norwegian Government remains of the view that Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) offer the best foundation for peace in the area.\n47.\tThe situation in Lebanon calls for particular attention, in the light of the recent fighting in the country and because the United Nations forces in the south have met with considerable difficulties in the implementation of the mandate given them by the Security Council. The task entrusted to the forces has therefore been only partly fulfilled. We attach decisive importance to the full cooperation of all parties in the-implementation of the United Nations mandate and to the restoration of normal and peaceful conditions in the area. We fully support the Security Council decision to renew the mandate of UNIFIL, and we have taken all the necessary steps to continue our participation in the Force.\n48.\tThe Nordic Foreign Ministers have recently expressed their support for the efforts of the Lebanese President and Government to preserve the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon and to re-establish peace and security in the country. We consider this to be of utmost importance also for future development in the Middle East.\n49.\tIn a long-term perspective, bridging the widening gap between the rich and the poor countries represents the greatest challenge to the international community. Although the existing social and economic imbalance cannot be redressed overnight, the need for immediate action is imperative. Thus my Government shares the concern of the developing countries over the present impasse in the North-South dialogue. Progress has been slow in coming. Four years after its adoption, the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order /resolution 3202 (S-VI)] remains largely unimplemented. The expectations arising out of the consensus of the seventh special session have not been met. The global economic crisis has been adverse consequences. One main reason for the dismal picture has, however, been an absence of the necessary political will.\n50.\tThe most compelling reason for renewed and increased efforts in this field is the intolerable situation of the developing countries themselves, characterized by mass poverty and conditions which represent an affront to human dignity. But in the view of my Government the presence of great unutilised productive capacity in the developed world, on the one hand, and the great unfulfilled needs of the developing countries, on the other, also make a convincing case for the new international economic order.\n51.\tWe have witnessed over the last few years a growing acceptance of the concept of global interdependence. Now is the time for concrete action. The proposals submitted during the first session of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, the so-called Committee of the whole, for a massive transfer of resources to the developing countries [see A/'33/34, part two J should thus be pursued resolutely. A revitalization of the global economy is in the interest of all countries.\n52.\tMy country would like to re-emphasize its support for the Committee of the Whole, which has an important political role to play in the North-South dialogue. It is our sincere hope that the present impasse can be overcome, enabling the Committee to attack the many urgent problems awaiting bold action from the world community through the United Nations.\n53.\tOnly through progress on substantive issues can new impetus be given to the North-South dialogue. The reconvening by UNCTAD of the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities later this fall is of particular importance. A break-through on the main outstanding issues at that Conference would create a new and positive climate for the North-South dialogue and hold out promise for the future of the Committee of the Whole and for the upcoming fifth session of UNCTAD.\n54.\tIt was hardly to be expected that the General Assembly's tenth special session, on disarmament, should be able to provide a final answer to issues which have preoccupied humanity for generations. In spite of different points of view, agreement was, however, reached on a comprehensive programme of action. This may herald a new era in the work towards disarmament. In the years before the next special session our joint task must be to make full use of the momentum thus created so that we may reach the objectives now pointed out for us.\n55.\tThe most important direct result of the special session was the strengthening of the international negotiating machinery through the reorganization of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and the re-establishment of the United Nations Disarmament Commission. We hope that these decisions will lead to broader participation in the work for disarmament by big and small countries, which have a contribution to make in this field.\n56.\tThe dangers inherent in the enormous consumption of resources for military armaments are abundantly clear to us all. In this connexion I would draw attention to the expert study on the relationship between disarmament and development which was initiated by the special session. The objectives of this study are to identify concrete measures which may make it possible to arrive at a more rational use of the world's scarce resources and in this way contribute towards eliminating some of the underlying causes of armed conflict.\n57.\tOn 10 December this year we shall celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. By their acceptance of this Declaration and the subsequent conventions, the States Members of the United Nations have committee themselves to respect and protect the fundamental human rights of their citizens. However, we must all admit that there is still much to be done to achieve the fulfilment of these commitment.\n58.\tThere are also positive developments in the present situation. In his report the Secretary-General points to a distinct improvement in the co-operative efforts of Member States to deal with alleged violations of human rights.\n59.\tIn this connexion there is every reason to welcome the fact that_ the United Nations\u2014with broad support- succeeded in establishing and dispatching to Chile a fact-finding mission to examine the question of missing prisoners. We see this initiative as having ramifications beyond this one country. The decision to send such a fact-finding mission implies that the world community has accepted the principle that violations of human rights by Member States cannot be regarded as an internal matter outside the competence of the United Nations.\n60.\tIn its work to promote the international protection of human rights, my Government emphasizes especially the following points of view.\n61.\tWe shall work to strengthen the machinery of the United Nations for the protection of human rights. This includes continued support for the proposal to establish a United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights.\n62.\tWe shall work to ensure the establishment of the most consistent and effective procedures possible for dealing with human rights issues in the Commission on Human Rights and in the Human Rights Committee.\n63.\tWe shall work to reinforce the view that gross and persistent violations of human rights are the concern of the entire world community. The principle of non-intervention cannot today be seen as constituting any legal obstacle to such violations being dealt with in international forums.\n64.\tWe shall put great emphasis on the endeavours to strengthen human rights in the regional context.\n65.\tAnd we shall attach particular importance to the efforts to combat racism and racial discrimination within the framework of the United Nations Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, and we hope that this work can be carried out without the introduction of extraneous elements.\n66.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea continued its efforts to find agreed formulas on major unresolved issues. During the seventh session the Conference produced new compromise texts on many of the controversial points holding up the final convention. If we are able to maintain the degree of progress shown in Geneva and New York this year, it should be possible to reach solutions on the hard-core issues facing the Conference. We cannot afford to fail, having reached this stage. In this connexion the possibilities of informal, inter-sessional discussions before the Geneva meetings in March and April next year\u2014if conducive to early completion of the treaty\u2014should be explored.\n67.\tAt the closing of the seventh session of that Conference opposition was expressed to unilateral legislation affecting the mining of the international sea-bed area. The Norwegian Government shares this concern. This was expressed also in the joint declaration by the Governments of Finland, Sweden and Norway on that occasion.\n68.\tIn concluding, I should like to say a few words about the necessity of strengthening the peace-keeping role of the United Nations.\n69.\tThe United Nations involvement in Lebanon is an example of an extremely difficult situation which could be solved only through the help of this Organization. In Namibia a strong United Nations presence during the transition period represents more than ever the only alternative to a violent solution. Thus, there are indications that the United Nations peace-keeping role is becoming increasingly important.\n70.\tThe most obvious task, and the one that is perhaps easiest to accomplish, is to strengthen the existing United Nations machinery for peace-keeping operations. Here, several measures should be considered.\n71.\tFirst, we may reinforce United Nations preparedness by means of stand-by forces which may swiftly be deployed when the need arises. Norway and the other Nordic countries have long had such stand-by forces specially earmarked for United Nations service.\n72.\tSecondly, we must find adequate solutions to the problem of financing. States Members of the United Nations have a collective responsibility for strengthening the Organization's capacity to undertake the functions provided for in the Charter. Consequently, these States also have a collective responsibility for the financing of the United Nations peace-keeping operations. The notion that the costs of a United Nations operation should be borne by the parties directly involved or by the so-called guilty parties is untenable. This very view would, if accepted, result in no one being able to afford to ask the United\nNations for help . It is also untenable because, in practice, it puts the financial responsibility on the troop-contributing countries.\n73.\tThirdly, we must also give the Secretary-General increased powers to handle the day-to-day problems which arise for the United Nations forces in the field. This will of course have to be done within the terms of reference laid down by the Security Council.\n74.\tThe United Nations today can assist in a number of ways in reaching peaceful solutions to conflicts between States. It is for the States Members of the world Organization to make better use of these possibilities.\n75.\tAs a consequence such measures will strengthen the capability of the United Nations to prevent the use of force in international conflicts, and thereby a climate of confidence will emerge. Such a development in its turn could be conducive to disarmament, to strengthening the United Nations also in other fields and to enabling the world Organization to play its full role in the creation of a more secure and just world order.\n"

The record of long and distinguished service in international diplomacy which you bring to it assures us that you will provide sound and fruitful leadership. As one of the Vice-Presidents at the current session, I wish to pledge to you the fullest co-operation of my delegation in the discharge of your heavy responsibilities.\n97.\tOur grateful thanks go also to your predecessor Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia, who won our respect by the wise and efficient manner in which he guided our deliberations at the thirty-second session of the General Assembly and at the important special sessions held during the year.\n98.\tThis year we have much pleasure in warmly welcoming Solomon Islands to membership in this great Organization. Our complete support for this admission is evident from our sponsorship of the draft resolution to that effect. It is a fitting tribute both to the administering Power and to the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples that Solomon Islands' accession to independence has been peaceful. Its entry into the United Nations bring? us yet another step closer to our goal of universality of membership, a goal to which the Kingdom of Bhutan attaches high priority.\n99.\tThe year 1978 has been marked by a number of positive developments on the international scene. Unfortunately these have been counterbalanced by a lack of progress in other areas and by an evident lack of willingness on the part of the parties involved to find lasting solutions to some of the critical problems facing the world community. We have seen the convening of a high-level special session on disarmament here at the United Nations, a session which impressed upon the international community the seriousness with which the world's Governments and its peoples view this long-sought and crucial goal.\n100.\tWe have seen, too, the ninth special session on the question of Namibia, -which was held in New York, and the World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, held in Geneva. These meetings have been significant in showing support for the continuing struggle of the oppressed peoples in many parts of the world for their right to independence and self-determination\u2014a struggle which continues to gain momentum.\n101.\tAnd we have seen, too, the disappointing suspension of the deliberations of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, referred to as the Committee of the Whole. We very much hoped that the Committee would pursue the promise of a new kind of world _order, indeed of the New International Economic Order which we had all agreed to establish, based not on old and outdated concepts, but on the equal and harmonious development of all States, and on an equitable distribution of the world's resources and knowledge.\n102.\tThe Kingdom of Bhutan attaches the greatest importance to the principles and objectives of non-alignment and to the Charter of the United Nations. We believe adherence to these principles by all Member States can and will show the way to world peace, a peace based not on shifting and precarious alliances, not on rivalry for spheres of influence and domination of the many by the few, but on a genuine framework of mutual respect and co-operation among nations, large and small, rich and poor.\n103.\tLike many non-aligned Members, we believe that all Member States should be actively and tirelessly engaged in working towards just and enduring solutions to the world's problems. We must find solutions which will bring about not a temporary abatement of tension or an illusory glimpse of peace, but a genuine and permanent stability. The history of this century has taught us all too painfully that the formation of Power blocs and military alliances among great Powers brings not peace but war, not freedom from fear but the institutionalization of fear.\n104.\tIt was in recognition of this sobering truth that the United Nations was founded, /et the international situation today, more than three decades later, makes it clear that the lesson, learned at so great a cost, has been all too soon forgotten by the major world Powers. Tension continues to be generated by the struggle for supremacy between the two Power blocs and in the process many weak and smaller countries are being subjected to various forms of pressure and, in some cases, even exposed to threats or acts of domination and aggression. Nowhere is this situation more apparent today than in Africa and the Middle East region. There, as in many other parts of the world, developing countries are finding themselves caught up in a game of power politics not of their own making. Their already limited resources are being severely strained and their people are suffering unnecessary hardships for causes inimical to their national development.\n105.\tIt is hard to envision lasting and universal progress towards peace as long as this situation is allowed to continue. It is not enough to pay lip service to the high ideals on which this Organization is founded. We must show ourselves ready to work constructively to bring about the new era of world peace and understanding that was the vision of the founders of the United Nations and to outlaw forever the divisive and destructive forces of imperialism, expansionism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism and racial discrimination.\n106.\tAt the heart of this vision is the concept of national independence, sovereignty and self-determination. We must resolutely reject all interference in the internal affairs of other countries and maintain the inviolability of legally established national boundaries on the basis of the sovereign equality of all nations, whether big or small. It was in recognition of this very equality that the United Nations was founded.\n107.\tWe are pleased that this year has seen the continuation of good and productive relationships between Bhutan and our neighbouring countries. It is our aim, and an integral part of our foreign policy, to establish relationships of friendship and co-operation with all countries, in the genuine spirit of non-alignment and mutual respect. In our home region, the south Asia subcontinent, the prospects for promoting peace and stability are excellent. All States have contributed to the present encouraging situation by demonstrating a spirit of conciliation and accommodation. A number of successful initiatives have been taken towards building bridges of mutual trust, understanding and cooperation. As a result, some of the major issues impeding stability have been resolved. In this context, my Government would like to express to the Janata Government in India its deep appreciation of its pragmatic and constructive policies towards its immediate neighbours.\n108.\tElsewhere in the Asian region there have been some concerted efforts towards peace, although in some areas the situation has been less encouraging. We sincerely hope that the countries directly involved will be able to display a sense of real conciliation and accommodation in the interests of creating an atmosphere of renewed respect and co-operation. My delegation fully subscribes to all attempts to bring about a better, more secure life for all peoples in the region.\n109.\tAs we meet here, the attention of the international community is focused on events in southern Africa. In Namibia, the just struggle of the people for independence and self-determination seemed to have brought promising results. We welcome Security Council resolution 435 (1978), designed to implement practical measures to lead to, the attainment of independence by the people of Namibia, and commend the Secretary-General for his forthright stand in calling for a concerted United Nations presence to ensure a peaceful transition through free and fair elections.\n110.\tElsewhere in Africa, the people of Zimbabwe continue to be denied self-determination and true independence. It is clear that peace will not come to this troubled land until the majority of the people, and not just a token handful, are given the right to self-rule through a freely elected and genuinely representative government. In the meantime, under the bogus so-called coalition Government, the terror and oppression and grim toll of death continue. Acts of aggression carried out by the Smith regime against Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia are unpardonable infringements of the national sovereignty of those nations and pose a disturbing threat to peace in the area. We support the struggle of the Patriotic Front, and urge that all possible efforts be made by the United Nations to bring about a real and just settlement of the conflict.\n111.\tInternational security also continues to be threatened by the situation in the Middle East. During the past year, and recently, there have been several initiatives for peace in that region and yet the situation remains fluid. My Government believes there must be concerted efforts to move towards a comprehensive and meaningful settlement acceptable to all peoples in the area. We remain convinced that no enduring settlement can be achieved without full recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland and establish their own independent State and the right of all States in the area to exist within universally recognized boundaries.\n112.\tOur other area of concern is the Republic of Cyprus. It is to be regretted that no tangible progress has yet been made in alleviating the tension under which the people of Cyprus have lived so long. The last session of the General Assembly strongly endorsed the need for swift implementation of General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) and\nSecurity Council resolution 365 (1974). These measures provide the basis for a just settlement of the community's problems, under which the territorial unity and integrity of Cyprus would be preserved. Continuation of the dialogue between the two communities is essential if a settlement is to be achieved. We appreciate the role being played by the United Nations peace-keeping Force in Cyprus and by the Secretary-General.\n113.\tNo task facing the international community is more imperative or of wider ranging significance than that of disarmament. We are gratified that, through the initiative of the non-aligned nations, the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, was held here this year, and that all nuclear-weapon States participated. There is no doubt that this landmark meeting was instrumental in refocusing world opinion on the whole question of disarmament and in mobilizing public support for this goal. At the same time, we share the disappointment expressed by many countries that the Final Document produced [resolution S-10/2J fell short of our expectations. As we said in our statement at that session,  it is our belief that all nations must be involved, and actively involved, in a fresh and enlightened examination of this crucial issue. In particular, we should like to see all nuclear-weapon States included in all negotiations and represented on both deliberative and negotiating bodies.\n114.\tIn the same spirit, I should like to reaffirm the commitment of my Government to the establishment of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, as called for in resolution 2832 (XXVI), adopted by the General Assembly in 1971 and endorsed in the Political Declaration of the Fifth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Colombo in 1976.  We are disappointed to find that while talks concerning this objective have been initiated by the great Powers they remain inadequate in scope and little substantive progress has been made.\n115.\tIt has long been recognized that the disproportionate allocation of resources for military purposes is a major factor in the imbalance in the world economy. It is hard to imagine how a just economic order can ever come into being without the reallocation of even a small part of these resources for peaceful purposes.\n116.\tMuch of the unrest in the world today is generated by the patent imbalances and inequalities in the international economic system. The economic s/stem is marked by inflation, currency fluctuations, instability in commodity prices and the growth of protectionism\\\", These factors are of serious concern to many countries, but particularly to the developing countries, as they directly affect their development plans and over-all economic growth. The growth recession experienced by many nations, accompanied by a slackening in world trade, has, in our interdependent world, taken a heavy toll in many developing countries. The gap between rich and poor countries has widened still further. The upheaval in the world economic situation in 1973 provided a warning of the consequences of, not restructuring the international economic order. A number of important initiatives were taken. The sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly outlined the framework for the establishment of a New International Economic Order. The North-South dialogue held in Paris'0 was continued at the thirty-second session of the General Assembly,'1 and it was with great hope and expectation that the Committee of the Whole was established to overview problems involved in the formation of a new economic order. That hope has not been fulfilled and it is with great disappointment that we find the work of the Committee has been suspended. The report of the Committee of the Whole [A/33134] makes clear the reasons for its failure. It points to a lack of willingness on the part of some countries to engage in constructive negotiations and to move towards agreement on a number of fundamental proposals concerning the restructuring of the international economic system. We hope that the underlying differences about the role and functioning of the Committee will be resolved so that this important work can continue without impediment.\n117.\tAll efforts aimed at the constructive transformation of world economic conditions must take cognisance of the fact that the gap is \\\"widening not only between the economies of the developed and developing countries, but also between those of the least developed land-locked countries and other developing countries. This is an alarming situation and we earnestly hope that further positive measures will be taken to help the land-locked countries to overcome the enormous disadvantages they face, so that the gap will not widen still further. Without such measures those countries will be hopelessly constrained in their attempts to overcome their geographical handicaps and achieve economic progress and self-reliance.\n118.\tBhutan, as a land-locked developing country, has, along with others in a similar position, continued to work towards overcoming its geographical disadvantages through a constructive, balanced and realistic development strategy. We are encouraged by the progress which has been made in a short time towards our goal of economic self-reliance, and towards ensuring a full and productive life for our citizens. Under the wise and able leadership of our dynamic monarch, we look forward to the future as an active and peace-loving member of the community of nations.\n119.\tNext year, 1979, will be the International Year of the Child. In recognition of the importance of this Year in bringing attention to bear on improving the conditions of children everywhere, my Government has initiated a number of programmes with Bhutan. As this important year approaches it is fitting, too, to remind ourselves in the strongest possible terms of the responsibility we bear, not only towards the children of today, but towards all future generations, to forge a new era of peace, prosperity and happiness for all the world's peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff235.\tGenerally speaking, our annual assessment of the world situation requires that we reaffirm the aims of the Charter, analyse the means that have been used to achieve those objectives and redefine our priorities, if necessary.\n236.\tOne might be tempted to say that this is, in fact, a repetitive, if not futile, exercise, an accepted formality and ritual, since certain segments of international opinion want to regard the United Nations only as a forum for dissension;\nand furthermore the items on our agenda have been practically the same for a good number of years.\n237.\tIt is difficult for us to go along with that opinion, because we feel, quite sincerely, that the United Nations must, above all, be a centre for thought and for concerted action, and not a framework for the promotion of a retrograde view of the world. At each of our annual sessions it is essential for us  o take account of the profound changes in the world since the adoption of the Charter, the positive trend in international relations towards the creation of a new world and the increasingly preponderant attention devoted to the concepts of justice, social progress and liberation. It is precisely here that we can discern the value of our exchanges of views, enriched by the way in which we defend our respective positions.\n238.\tIn point of fact, our general debate goes beyond a simple evaluation and becomes a crucible from which emerges gradually a revolutionary vision of the world; it becomes the point of departure for an awareness which, because of its positive and realistic nature, stands out in contrast to pure speculation and passive contemplation. That is the spirit in which the Malagasy delegation intends to make its contribution to the work of this session.\n239.\tA developing country like the Democratic Republic of Madagascar, resolutely committed to a socialist revolution, cannot but be disturbed by the constant deterioration we have observed in the world economy, affected as it has been by crises of increasing acuteness and by a lack of vision and political will. Unfortunately people have been content with simply proposing short-term and often sectoral solutions to these problems.\n240.\tFor more than a decade the world has been painfully survived by dint of following the course of expedients and it is not surprising that the image that it now presents to us is that of a cloak that is tattered and patched in many places.\n241.\tMost of the industrialized countries have acquiesced in that policy of doom since it makes it possible for them to continue to misuse the established system to strengthen their hold over world development and to continue to pursue with profit their practices. of domination and exploitation. That mere crumbs are left the so-called developing countries which have not been given any serious chance of real development is only to be expected from the advocates of expansion at any cost.\n242.\tAfter the recession of 1974-1975 it would have been possible to correct the various structural imbalances and thus to ensure the regular growth of the world economy. But at present what we are witnessing is an accumulation of unresolved problems and the deliberate preservation of a climate of -uncertainty which has been engendered by delays in multilateral negotiations.\n243.\tIt is not surprising, therefore, that an economic crisis is once again threatening the world; and attempts are being made to counter that crisis by methods which we have denounced previously, as if the intention was deliberately to ignore the indications given and the commitments undertaken at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly.\n244.\tIt is hardly necessary to rehearse the outcome of those two sessions because each and every one of us must now be aware of his own responsibilities and of the most appropriate way of discharging those responsibilities. But do we have to wait for the energy crisis which has been predicted for 1985 before some political will is finally evinced by the industrialized countries? When will they give up their policies of uncontrolled consumption and agree that, if only in their own interests, they must agree to some reduction albeit small, of their prosperity, which has become a scandal in a world that is growing poorer and poorer? When will they face the fact that some middle way has to be sought between the requirements of internal order and the needs of developing countries?\n245.\tEfforts for adjustment, however realistic, are far from being responsive to the urgency of the situation, and we can perceive no real progress , towards a restructuring of the world economy. On the contrary, as in the worst hours of the most recent recession, we can see that there is a diminution in growth rates, an increase in unemployment and an aggravation of underemployment; there is galloping inflation which is sometimes controlled but never stopped; there is a return to protectionist measures; and there are chaotic trends in monetary and financial relations.\n246.\tThose who are most affected by this set of negative factors are still the developing countries. Unfortunately they are subject to terms of trade, whose cyclic deterioration, sometimes deliberately maintained, has adverse repercussions on their balance of payments, their capacity to service debts and their investment capacity.\n247.\tFrequently, we have been told to have patience in order to turn us into reasonable-or rather resigned-partners. Nevertheless, if we wish to give some meaning to equal interdependence and international co-operation in the economic, financial and monetary fields, we will have to cease circumventing those problems which have already been set forth in clear and unambiguous terms since the very first session of UNCTAD,\n248.\tWhat we must do above all is to abandon the idea that the participation of developing countries in international trade depends in some way on their growth which, in its turn, is conditioned by the economic expansion of industrialized countries. It is much to be feared that, according to a distorted interpretation of interdependence, we might arrive at postulating the principle that the growth of the poorer countries is desirable only in so far as it promotes the expansion of the rich countries. The cynicism inherent in such a principle must be obvious to all. Nevertheless everything seems to indicate that it is being practised in two key sectors, namely, that of primary commodities and that of industrialization.\n249.\tFrom the declarations of intention which have been made here and elsewhere, we have learned that, in order to redress the present imbalance, it is important to plan production and investment efficiently, to provide the developing countries with adequate export earnings in real terms and also to stabilize markets in order to benefit the consumers. That programme, which is far from being innovative since it reproduces the claims which have been put forward for some years now, has not been followed up\nby any decisive action and the few timid and traditional measures that have been taken are hardly likely to remove our scepticism.\n250.\tIn effect, nothing would suggest that the Integrated Programme for Commodities which was adopted at the fourth session of UNCTAD will finally be accepted. Nor does anything give us the assurance that significant negotiations will be entered into on the common fund. So far as primary commodities are concerned, we can see that, of the 15 agricultural exports which are of interest to Africa, only three have been the subject of agreements. After so many promises, so many consultations and so many negotiations, such a situation requires no comment.\n251.\tIn the sector of industrialization, the fate which the developing countries have met is hardly more enviable. The institutional framework for the implementation of the decisions and recommendations of the Second General Conference of UNIDO was defined almost five years ago. Nevertheless, the negotiations on the various components of that framework are foundering in the uncertainties and mysteries of a deliberate desire to maintain a certain monopoly, while the panoply of protectionist measures directed against our countries is being reinforced. In those circumstances we cannot see how the industrialized countries intend to fulfil the commitment to bring up to 25 per cent the participation of developing countries in world industrial output.\n252.\tIn connexion with all these points it may be said that necessary adjustments are in fact being studied; that corrective measures will have to be taken in a certain order of priority and that with time they could become part and parcel of the new international economic order.\n253.\tWe might still harbour illusions but we have to understand that the economic security for which we are, after all, plainly responsible, cannot be guaranteed simply by the proliferation of special funds, by the redefinition of the ways and means of aid and by the increase of direct transfers under public assistance for development.\n254.\tNor can it depend on a third strategy which is only a reflex of the first two and which is the outcome of the former system. We have to have the honesty and the courage to recognize that, in order to ensure the success of the new strategy, in order to offset the effects of the world economic crisis and, above all, prevent its recurrence, it is essential to bring about as soon as possible fundamental modifications required by the institution of the new international economic order.\n255.\tThe establishment and strengthening of world economic security, which remains one of our major concerns because of its implications for the maintenance of international security, will depend on such action. What we need is no longer rhetoric or to see1 to demonstrate on every occasion that our countries share common interests, because if we try to insist on it too much we often finish by\nproving the contrary. The crisis is upon us, gentlemen. The developing countries are not responsible for it.\n256.\tThere is not a single delegation that is aware of the interdependence of our problems that can fail to recognize that the security of the world is indivisible. This notion, which has progressively but irreversibly become self-evident, might in certain cases not satisfy all the requirements that have been engendered by national or international constraints.\n257.\tHowever, it cannot be denied that almost everyone now agrees-albeit in a provisional manner\u2014that it is necessary to preserve a dynamic equilibrium between security, development and disarmament; and this was recently borne out at the tenth special session of the General Assembly.\n258.\tWe will not rehearse the various aspects of disarmament which we analysed during that session. Some items do, however, deserve to be stressed, in the light of the Declaration and the Programme of Action, and particularly in view of the political and moral approach which was favoured by a majority among us in order to face up to the challenge of the arms race\n259.\tIndeed, while We have not been entirely satisfied as far as concerns the commitment of the military Powers effectively to bring about general, complete and immediate disarmament under international control, we should welcome the fact that finally the concept of world security has prevailed over the needs of national security and so-called policies of deterrence and superiority. \n260.\tIt seems, therefore, that we have, in different degrees, agreed to work for the advent of a world civilization that will be free from the constraints of war, of weapons and of the arms race. However idealistic it may be this vision can and must be part of the disarmament strategy that we have drawn up. The positive aspect of certain principles which have been advocated for the implementation of this strategy is rather encouraging.\n261.\tIn particular, we should refer to the central role to be played by the United Nations; the balance of responsibilities between the nuclear and non-nuclear States; the integration of partial or parallel measures in negotiations on a disarmament treaty; the fact that qualitative factors have to be borne in mind; the search for a universal acceptance of bilateral and multilateral agreements; and, in particular, the recognition of the close relationship between disarmament, the relaxation of tension, respect for self-determination and independence, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the strengthening of international peace and security.\n262.\tWhatever may be the virtues of this strategy, the most urgent task remains the elimination of the threat of a nuclear war. Collateral steps have been taken or planned, whether we refer to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] the draft World Treaty on the Non-Use of Force in International Relations, the tripartite draft of a complete\nprohibition of nuclear weapons or the creation of denuclearized zones.\n263.\tIn this connexion, the Declaration that emerged from the tenth special session of the General Assembly recognized the legitimacy of the concerns expressed by non-nuclear States about their own security. It is therefore quite logical that the provisions of the Treaty on non-proliferation are no longer regarded as adequate, and that we should seek for more appropriate legal guarantees. It is in this context that we support the Soviet initiative on the conclusion of an international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States [see A/33/241].\n264.\tThe progress that we make in carrying out the measures advocated, in the disarmament strategy will undoubtedly help to strengthen detente and to improve the atmosphere of trust that is so essential for conducting international relations.\n265.\tWe find it difficult to agree that detente should be confined to one single area or should remain the monopoly of certain Powers. Detente, in order to be acceptable and to produce its full effect, should be an irreversible and generalized process, and should thus induce all States, without exception, to make a contribution to safeguarding and maintaining international peace and security.\n266.\tDetente can no longer be regarded as an end in itself, because we must recall that our world is, in essence, a world of confrontation, and that to try to make this disappear immediately would probably smack either of Utopianism or of an unavowed desire to impose on others our own individual attitudes and policies.\n267.\tIt is distressing, however, to note that detente has been used as a pretext in order to foster confrontation, in order to justify intervention and interference, which has meant that there has been a real reversal of values which can only be prejudicial to genuine co-operation among States.\n268.\tThe severity with which we have come out against this regrettable, tendency in international relations is a result of the fact that quite recently certain parts of the world, including Africa, have been selected in order to test a policy that smacks of. something we have always denounced\u2014that is, of domination, exploitation and the search for spheres of influence and interest-a policy that is designed to make us forget that the struggle that has been waged for the total liberation of Africa and for the preservation of processes freely accepted by our people should be pursued by all means in our power and should brook no concessions.\n269.\tWhen we speak of collusion between neo-colonialism and imperialism, some may be offended; but we would not have reached that conclusion had the principles of noninterference and mutual respect been strictly applied.\n270.\tHow often have we issued a warning against the unfortunate effects of certain principles that have been put forward in the search for solutions of those problems that are of direct concern to Africa? Whether it be in Namibia,\n' in Rhodesia, in the Sahara, or in South Africa, apparently sometimes certain realities are deliberately overlooked; there is a tendency to remain unaware that the legal and political framework laid down in the United Nations essentially meets the aspirations of the peoples concerned.\n27L. But since the principles of the United Nations are not always easily or universally accepted, an attempt, is being made to think up all sorts of half-measures in order to appease the swelling indignation of the Africans and to maintain the direct or indirect hold of imperialism over our future.\n272.\tAfter the arrogant reactions of Pretoria and Salisbury, it is easy to disclaim responsibility for the failures in Namibia and in Rhodesia over the racist minority regimes, as if we were hot already aware of the limits of their good faith. Rather than asking the Security Council to draw the necessary conclusions by applying Chapter VII of the Charter in its entirety, once again we will have to ask the liberation movements to make concessions.\n273.\tA sense of-moderation makes it imperative, I think, that all these so-called internal agreements should be irrevocably condemned, and since we are here in the United Nations it must be seen that only the resolutions of our Organization are valid and that a return to the principles set forth in Security Council resolution 385 (1976), which are very far removed from the principles put forth by the five Western members of the Council, is the only way to have the rights of the Namibian people respected.\n274.\tWhy must we let the situation in Rhodesia deteriorate even further in the search for a so-called multiracial and democratic society, whereas the Europeans in Rhodesia no longer believe this and are leaving in order to pitch their tents elsewhere?\n275.\tWe could ask so many questions, which, unfortunately, would receive evasive replies because the West is imprisoned in its own machinery, in which South Africa is a major cog. It is a fact that the territorial integrity of Namibia has been sacrificed to strategic considerations. There will continue to be a modest turning away from the iniquity represented by the policy of territorial separation, and there will be a continuation of ritual pronouncements about the immorality about the practice of apartheid at a time when this problem remains an eminently political one, quite apart from any humanitarian and economic considerations, and to the extent that it has to be regarded in terms of liberation and social progress, which is something to which the peoples of South Africa are quite naturally entitled.\n276.\tMembers will therefore understand our indignation in the face of the numerous manoeuvres which have been designed to save the illegal and racist minority regimes.\n277.\tWe are tempted to believe that the same policy of force in the case of the Sahara, Cyprus and Korea has not laid down its arms but is striving to maintain confusion in order to make prevail interests which unfortunately are contrary to those of the peoples directly concerned.\n278.\tOur position on the Sahara has always been unambiguous. We were the first to recognize the Saharan Arab\nDemocratic Republic. We have always denounced in all forums the collusion between the Spanish, former colonial Power and ..the Moroccan-Mauritanian annexationists, and the sham juridical arguments which have been put forward have in no way convinced us.\n279.\tIt is claimed that there is now a new situation, conducive to a reasonable approach to the problem. We are aware of what interests certain international circles intend to preserve, and to speak of reason when the fate of a people is at stake seems to be most improper. That is why, whatever initiatives are taken in the OAU, we are of the opinion that the United Nations, which has particular responsibilities to the Saharan people, has a duty to take up this problem, which remains above all one of decolonization.\n280.\tIn Cyprus the lack of progress in negotiations has been imputed to the bargaining between the two communities. But is it not also true that this bargaining is further aggravated by the internal contradictions inherent in a military alliance which, since it has no idea of non-alignment, is using Cyprus as a hostage and by its veering is in no way conducive to an honest search for a lasting solution acceptable to all? It is high time for us to react to this laissez-faire and to request that alliance to put an end to its seesaw tactics and give proof of its desire to respect the sovereign choice of the Cypriot people.\n281.\tThe Korean people is still the victim of a policy of presence and of ideological dissuasion which is both-obsolete and illusory, and also of the so-called realism exhibited by certain interested Powers more interested in the requirements of their military and industrial complexes than in making it possible for the Korean people to live in peace and regained unity. Any action along these lines has encountered dilatory manoeuvres provoked and sustained by an alienated regime. For us, the only solution which is worthy of being discussed necessarily involves the independent reunification of the country of Korea without foreign interference, and the implementation of the principles laid down in the joint communiqu\u00e9 of 4 July 1972.\n282.\tIn Palestine - a martyr country if ever there , was one \u2014in our desire for peace we find ourselves witnessing an attempt to put the people of Palestine once again under trusteeship, without regard for the years of suffering, sacrifice and struggle. It has not been enough to deny their very existence: they have had also to be stripped of their most legitimate aspirations and humiliated by having imposed on them a form of unprecedented and unusual colonialism. We cannot see any settlement of this question without the effective participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the only authentic representative of the Palestinian people. The international community has affirmed and reaffirmed the existence of the inalienable rights of these people to return to their homes and to achieve self-determination, independence, and national sovereignty. Any efforts, any agreements, which overlook these fundamental principles or try to subordinate them to other considerations can only be doomed to failure.\n283.\tFinally, in the Indian Ocean it is with great concern that we have witnessed the rivalry among the major Powers.\nFar from becoming an area of peace, demilitarized and denuclearized, the Indian Ocean remains an amphitheatre of various manoeuvres and the struggle for influence.\n284.\tAs regards the Comorian island of Mayotte more particularly, we reaffirm that that island belongs to the whole of the Comoros and we desire the rapid application by the interested parties of the relevant resolutions of the OAU and the United Nations. The withdrawal of all foreign bases from this nerve-centre of the world will contribute to a reduction of the tensions which are already being maintained by the conflicts taking place in southern Africa.\n285.\tAt a time when we are celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we can see how the rights of peoples are overlooked or are even subject to flagrant violations over which, for many reasons, people are anxious to draw a modest veil. We could maintain a lengthy discourse on the distinction to be drawn between the rights of peoples and those of the individual, on the priority to be attached to a particular right and on the need for the United Nations particularly to look after their implementation. We should not shirk this discussion or question anything, since we have freely adhered to various covenants on civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. However, we must remove any misunderstanding resulting from the \\\"morality race\\\". May we be permitted to express doubt about the sincerity of certain reactions, particularly when they come from sectors which have fought against the granting of civil rights and which are prepared to show the greatest spirit of conciliation regarding the unreasonable demands of the racist regimes, which have denied entire peoples their right to live in peace according to their choice and their own principles, and which have even been guilty of genocide. O temporal O mores! But if so, why seek to have all societies in the same mould? Why impose on societies like ours, in which the community traditionally takes precedence over the individual, attitudes and conduct which are contrary to our view of human and social relations? Much-vaunted universalism may be a form of Pharisaism, and that is the precise danger for those who seek at all costs to guide our consciences.\n286.\tThere is no reason to oppose the effective enjoyment of human rights, but it will be pointless as long as the rights of peoples are neither assured nor respected, as long as the social and economic rights of those peoples are not satisfied.\n287.\tAt the beginning of my statement I tried to define the purposes of our annual meetings, in order to meet the need to organize our world and to give some pattern   our reflections and our actions on subjects which are universally accepted. We wish to remain faithful to the spirit of the Charter. Nevertheless, we must acquiesce in certain realities imposed by agreements, by regional alliances, by a regrouping of interests and also by the affirmation of differing ideologies. It is therefore inevitable that our exchanges of views should sometimes and in certain areas take on the aspect of veritable confrontations, which will not have been pointless to the extent that everyone will have been able to gain in truth and sincerity. We do not preclude the possibility of looking for areas of agreement in order to harmonize our actions. However, it must be admitted that\nconfrontation is not always a sterile exercise. It should enrich our debates. It can awaken in us a sense of responsibility and put the United Nations in a more realistic perspective.\n288.\tBecause of the limitations which I referred to previously, we should not fear that the United Nations will reflect our differences. The essential point is that, in strict respect for the aims and principles of the Charter,, we should be able to discuss anything, without any exception, both honestly and openly.\n289.\tWhen we reach that stage, we shall perhaps realize that the solutions to the problems involved in disarmament, development and the rights of peoples were within our grasp, and that we have let go of peace and security because we neither wanted, nor knew how, to profit from a certain form of confrontation, concomitant, it is true, with dialogue.\n290.\tThe Democratic Republic of Madagascar is very pleased to present here its warm welcome and its wishes for success and prosperity to Solomon Islands, which we have just welcomed as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of our Organization.\n291.\tI should be remiss in my duty were I not, on behalf of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar, to convey to Mr. Lievano our congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of this session. We are quite certain that he will put at the service of the Organization with which he has been associated for some years now the statesman-like qualities that are one of his distinctive attributes.\n292.\tTo his predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, we would express our gratitude for the laudable way in which he directed the work of four sessions of the General Assembly. Finally, we should like to reiterate to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, our deep felt appreciation for the way in which he is discharging his mission which has become more and more delicate and more and more difficult in a world which is more and more troubled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n340.\tMay I first congratulate the President most warmly on his election to preside over the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. His merits, which are well known to all of us are a true guarantee that this session will perform its work effectively under his distinguished leadership.\n341.\tI also wish to express to the outgoing President, Mr. Mojsov, my deep appreciation of his very valuable and skilful work during our last regular session, as well as during three special sessions of the General Assembly in the course of this year.\n342.\tI should like also to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Waldheim, for his dedicated and untiring efforts and his invaluable contributions to the attainment of our common goals. I wish to assure him of my country's full support.\n343.\tAs a member of the United Nations Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, we find it particularly gratifying to extend a warm welcome to Solomon Islands on the occasion of its admission to the United Nations. My delegation is looking forward to fruitful co-operation with it within this Organization.\n344.\tMankind has always longed for peace, freedom and well-being. But human history is strewn with wars, suffering and poverty. After unspeakable tribulations which culminated in the Second World War, the United Nations became the embodiment of the great ideal of co-operation among nations for the creation of a better life for all people on our earth. We sometimes meet with seemingly insurmountable obstacles a our work at the United Nations  They must, however, never discourage us from hoping that progress can be made towards attaining this ideal. The United Nations has the potential to serve as an invaluable instrument in our efforts to create a better world. The result will depend on our will to use this instrument and on how we use it.\n345.\tBut we see how conflicts and repression are still causing terrible suffering in various parts of the world. Racial oppression in South Africa is still a disgrace to the international community. The guns still speak in the Middle East and in many other areas. All over the world people are being, persecuted, imprisoned and tortured on account of their opinions. Billions of dollars are being wasted on armaments while hundreds of millions of people are living m deepest misery. A large proportion of our earth's limited resources is being used to increase the affluence of the wealthy. At the same time mass poverty is constantly spreading.\n346. The dark side of the picture is only too obvious. But it must not overshadow the brighter features which in fact exist and which we must protect and develop. International co-operation both within and outside the United Nations is more nearly universal, more intensive and more diversified than ever before. A web of international co-operation is slowly being woven.\n347 Nowadays everyone condemns the use of war as a political instrument. The realization that the detente process must continue and broaden is gaining an ever stronger foothold. A new awareness is emerging that we all, small nations and large nations, poor and rich, are dependent upon each other. After all, we live in one and the same world. This has opened up new perspectives for peace efforts and for the management of the world's resources, as well as for international solidarity and the defence of fundamental human rights. Here we all share a common responsibility.\n348.\tTo be sure, it is the major Powers that dominate the international political scene, and this places the heaviest burden of responsibility upon them. But the small States, too, can play an important role in the work for peace, non-intervention, detente and equality. The close co-operation between the five Nordic countries has developed and grown in spite of the fact that our countries have chosen different policies of national security. This proves that peaceful and vigorous common action can take the place of the antagonisms and wars of earlier centuries.\n349.\tThe Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975, is another manifestation of this endeavour to replace old antagonisms by new co-operation. Much remains to be done before this goal is reached, but a framework has been drawn up that makes it possible to tackle even controversial questions in an open and direct way. A widespread exchange of views has been set in motion. Future co-operation must lead to a comprehensive discussion of all the areas dealt with in the Final Act. The Swedish Government attaches great importance to this. We shall be taking an active part in the preparatory work for the next meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, to be held in Madrid in 1980.\n350.\tSolidarity and co-operation must build on respect for the right of every people to shape its own future, choose its own way. The strong have always been tempted to use force, threats or other means to impose their will on the weak. History abounds in examples of this kind. The small States can play a role as a counterweight to the strength of the great. We must not hesitate to use the means we have at our disposal to support a people which stands out against oppression and the violation of human rights. The goal of solidarity and co-operation must always be the well-being of the individuals. For instance, the principle of non-intervention must never be taken to mean a limitation of the right to call attention to breaches of fundamental United Nations principles.\n351.\tRacial discrimination must be fought wherever it arises. Symptoms of racial discrimination are present all over the world. We must all be constantly on guard against such tendencies. But there is one country where not only\nare flagrant and shocking violations of human rights tolerated, but racial discrimination has become the basis of an ideology and of law. South Africa's apartheid system is an affront to all mankind. Removing a few petty superficial signs of racial segregation cannot change the ugly face of apartheid. The grim reality is that black people have no political or economic rights. They are forced to live in deplorable conditions in an unjust economic system. Innumerable Africans have to live away from their families. They are tortured and sentenced to death for offences which do not even exist in other countries. History should teach the backers of apartheid that attempts to silence a majority by force only strengthens its will to resist.\n352.\tThe purpose of the apartheid system is to protect the white minority and its privileges. Rhodesia and Namibia are being used as ramparts for this policy. The latest events in Namibia must be seen in this light. Once again the international community has been slapped in the face by Mr. Vorster. By its threat that it alone will proclaim and carry out elections in Namibia, the South African Government has disclosed its real intentions. Obviou5ly it fears the results of a free election in which SWAPO, the leading national movement, would be given the opportunity to participate on equal terms. Talk of the people's free elections at a time when South Africa maintains an overwhelming army of occupation in Namibia is a hollow mockery. Vorster is holding out a ballot paper on the point of a bayonet. The leaders in South Africa are taking upon themselves a heavy responsibility by sentencing the inhabitants of Namibia to renewed and prolonged suffering.\n353.\tWe share the deep disappointment which the United Nations and other States must now feel. It seems that the considerable efforts made to arrive at a peaceful solution have been nullified or, at least, gravely jeopardized. Our response to Pretoria that its latest manoeuvre is unacceptable must be clear, unambiguous and unanimous. Even if the prospects today seem to me to be slight, no avenue must remain unexplored for reaching a peaceful and democratic settlement. In this all the parties in Namibia must be able to participate on equal terms. We remain firm in our preparedness to assist the United Nations in its efforts to exert its responsibility as regards Namibia.\n354.\tIn the present situation it is urgent that the Nationhood Programme for Namibia be implemented. My Government, together with the other Nordic Governments, is prepared to pledge shortly a substantial contribution to this Programme. We hope that other countries will also support this Programme and thus assist in preparing Namibia for its full independence.\n355.\tThe Smith regime in Rhodesia should also by this time have been given unequivocal proof that a continuation of its confrontation policy will bring Rhodesia to disaster. Ever since Smith illegally proclaimed his so-called independence in 1965, one of his key political principles has been to gain time. The \\\"internal settlement\\\", as it is called, the last in a long succession of stratagems, has proved a fiasco. The same fate awaits every measure that does not imply a definitive acceptance of the principle of one man, one vote. Only solutions which are worked out with the full participation of the people of Zimbabwe can be lasting, stable and viable.\n356.\tThe external pressure on the Smith regime must be stepped up and the weapon of sanctions be put to effective use. It is deplorable that a number of large multinational oil corporations have betrayed their international duty by circumventing the United Nations sanctions. If all the States Members of the United Nations had observed the Security Council resolution on sanctions, Smith would have been forced to accept an independent majority-ruled Zimbabwe a long time ago.\n357.\tEvents taking place in Namibia must not make us forget the fateful drama being enacted in South Africa. The States Members of the United Nations must agree on measures to assist the people in South Africa who are struggling for freedom and justice.\n358.\tThe Nordic Governments have for their part agreed on a joint programme of action against South Africa. This includes measures against new investments and sports co-operation, extended assistance to refugees, and the introduction of compulsory visas. The programme will be extended step by step.\n359.\tSweden and other Nordic countries will continue pressing for a Security Council resolution against new investments in South Africa. Sweden has already taken some action in this respect and is now considering legislation. We shall also explore avenues for winning broad support for other steps, such as stopping financial loans and the transfer of nuclear technology and equipment to South Africa. We shall continue working for binding decisions against all trade, not least in oil, with South Africa.\n360.\tThe year proclaimed by the United Nations as International Anti-Apartheid Year is now running. Let us with concerted efforts make it a turning-point in the struggle against this system. This ideology of injustice must now be consigned to history's chamber of horrors.\n361.\tIn other parts of the world, major hotbeds of unrest are still unresolved. Millions of people have been driven from their homes for one reason or another. Their suffering continues. We must all seek to alleviate their hardships by means of generous development assistance and refugee policies. The problem is growing and creates an increasingly heavy burden on the many poor countries that have to receive these people. It is the poor and the unprivileged groups in society that suffer most when human and material resources are wasted on war instead of being used for economic and social progress. Therefore, we all share the heavy responsibility of ensuring that the quest for peaceful solutions of these conflicts be intensified.\n362 The Middle East has long been afflicted by conflicts and antagonisms. The meeting in Camp David and the peace efforts of President Carter, President El-Sadat and Prime Minister Begin deserve our respect. We sincerely hope ;hat their efforts will initiate a process that ultimately can lead to a comprehensive and lasting settlement in the Middle East.\n363. The Swedish Government reiterates its view that the principles contained in Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) must be the basis for a final settlement. These principles must be supplemented with the\nrecognition of the right of the Palestinian Arabs to decide their own future. This includes also the right, if they so wish, to establish their own State living in peace side by aide with Israel.\n364.\tPeace in this region can only he durable if it is founded as much on mutual trust as on military security considerations. Otherwise, a settlement can never be more than a cease-fire which compels the peoples to live in continuous anxiety with the constant threat of war breaking out. Israel's existence as a State and its right to live within secure and recognized borders cannot be called into question. Let me add that we emphatically repudiate all attempts to equate Zionism with racism. Such attempts benefit no one.\n365.\tIsrael's settlements policy is a grave obstacle to an agreement. We hope that the Sinai settlements will lie evacuated. We also hope that this will mark a change in Israel's settlement policy in the other occupied areas. The principle that territories may not be acquired by force must apply unconditionally.\n366.\tThe tragic events in Lebanon are a serious reminder to us. They show the urgent need to reach a comprehensive and lasting solution in the Middle East, including a settlement of the Palestinian question.\n367.\tIt is extremely important that all parties now exercise restraint. The world must lie spared a new spiral of violence, which can definitely shatter the hopes for peace.\n368.\tIn the Middle East we see how the development of military arsenals aggravates an already intolerable situation. At the global level the disarmament situation, or rather the arms race, continues to cause serious concern. The tenth special session on disarmament focused world-wide attention on the discrepancy between the arms race and the efforts to achieve disarmament. The arms race gathers momentum, and disarmament efforts have yielded meagre results.\n369.\tOne important decision of the special session was to initiate an in-depth study of the relationship between disarmament and development A first report  has already been delivered to the Secretary-General by the expert group appointed by him.20\n370.\tThe special session has given us new machinery. No institutional arrangements can, however, replace decisive efforts for disarmament by the two leading military powers. Their special responsibility is explicitly confirmed in the Final Document of the special session.\n371.\tThis situation as regards the nuclear-arms race and non proliferation is grave. Therefore, a more concrete programme of action from the special session\thave been required. An acceleration of the nuclear-arms race may in fact be imminent. New technologies tend to erode feeds results and prospects of our disarmament efforts. New methods and fresh initiatives to solve problems  must continuously be explored. Progress in nuclear disarmament will require the prompt negotiation of far-reaching\nqualitative and quantitative disarmament agreements. This is clearly stated in the Programme of Action of the special session.\n372.\tThese tasks have proved difficult in the past. So far it has not been possible to negotiate the renunciation of weapons systems which are available to one super-Power but not to the other. The price of inactivity is rising at an accelerating rate in both political and economic terms. The trends in technology and deployment of nuclear weapons in sensitive regions are increasingly counteractive to detents.\n373.\tThe two leading military Powers must reconsider their positions in the disarmament negotiations. The concessions they make may have to be of different types. The strategic positions, political systems and alliance patterns of the two leading Powers and the military blocs differ considerably. Technology restraints and verifications measures are two crucial areas. Decisive and truly constructive action by these Powers is now urgently called for. A follow-up of the Programme of Action adopted at the special session should in our view include the following seven items regarding the arms race.\n374.\tFirst, a comprehensive test-ban treaty is urgently called for.\n375.\tSecondly, an agreement at the second series of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks must be reached without further delay.\n376.\tThirdly, the speedy follow-up of the second series of the Talks by a substantial third series agreement is required.\n377.\tThe following points are designed to combine political and disarmament measures in the pursuit of real nuclear disarmament.\n378.\tFourthly, those nuclear-weapon systems which fall outride the Talks must gradually and, if necessary, selectively be included in the framework of existing negotiations. These grey-area systems, as they are called, have been insufficiently dealt with in multilateral negotiations, including Vienna talks on mutual and balanced reduction of forces in the Central Europe. There are great risks inherent in the continued development and deployment of this large group of nuclear weapons. Among these the neutron weapons and the SS 20 missiles are two worrying examples.\n379.\tFifthly, efforts to achieve force reductions in central Europe must be intensified. Limitations on the peacetime disposition of military forces and other constraints would constitute important parts of a first-stage agreement in the Vienna talks. Such measures would contribute to longer-term efforts to reduce nuclear weapons in Europe.\n380.\tSixthly, these efforts should be linked to the attempts to reach agreement on improved confidence-building measures in Europe. This is an important item for the next follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to be held in 1980 in Madrid.\n\n381. Seventhly, it is vital that the leading military Powers start reorienting their military research and development to projects which lend themselves better to arms control. This could substantially facilitate the achievement of negotiated agreements. It could also pave the way for unilateral decisions to observe restraint during periods when negotiated agreements remain out of reach.\n382.\tArms control assessments of planned new weapons might be more closely related to the international disarmament process. They could in that case facilitate the introduction of relevant weapon issues in different negotiating contexts at the stages of research, development, production and deployment.\n383.\tLet me add that none of these points requires any new negotiating machinery.\n384.\tOur evaluation of the disarmament situation after the special session leads us to propose that the United Nations initiate a new thorough study of nuclear weapons. The study should cover the technical as well as the political aspects of such weapons. It should also include available qualitative as well as quantitative information and factors regarding geographic deployment. Nuclear weapons continue to be the greatest threat to mankind. The appalling spectre of their possible use haunts the minds of people everywhere. The nuclear weapons of a few States affect the security of all States. That is why a new comprehensive study of nuclear weapons is imperative.\n385.\tSweden's strong and unswerving support for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is well known. We maintain an active interest in any measures which can increase support for the Treaty and the international non-proliferation regime. The prospects of these efforts will largely depend on what happens in the field of nuclear disarmament. A complete test ban and agreements on control and on real reductions in strategic weapons and nuclear weapons could together be seen as important steps to prevent- proliferation. The risk of the proliferation of nuclear weapons is also closely linked with the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Therefore, effective full-scope IAEA safeguards and adequate levels of physical protection are important.\n386.\tAll States have the right to decide how they can best ensure their energy supplies. Advantage should be taken of the possibilities now provided by alternative sources of energy and improved energy conservation techniques.\n387.\tThe issue of conventional weapons and international arms transfers was rightly given more attention at the special session than ever before in the United Nations. We are glad that this issue is now on the agenda and thus can be the subject of serious discussion in the United Nations.\n388.\tThe first Preparatory Conference for the United Nations conference n particularly inhumane conventional weapons concluded recently in Geneva. The results justify a reasonable hope that meaningful restrictions on use can be achieved for such categories of weapons. Examples are incendiary weapons, land-mines and perhaps also small calibre projectiles. This opportunity must not be missed by the international community. My Government pledges its full support for continued progress in this field during the coming year.\n389.\tMeasures must be taken to increase confidence among States. This would improve the prospects of real reductions of the enormous military arsenals of the leading Powers. This is particularly important considering the present development of the arms :ace. Greater openness about military budgets is one such measure.\n390.\tThe use of enormous human and material resources for military purposes is a grotesque waste and it concerns us all.\n391.\tThe earth is the common heritage of all mankind. It could provide us with all the necessities for our health and well-being. We are therefore in duty bound to manage its resources wisely. If we squander these stored resources, we impoverish our descendants. If we poison natural assets with our pollutants, we destroy the very foundation of our existence. As long as the few consume more than their fair share, the majority are consigned to poverty.\n392.\tWe cannot claim that we are good stewards of our heritage. Those of us who belong to the privileged few are mainly responsible for the present pollution of the environment and the waste of resources.\n393.\tBut many developing countries also are forced by their very poverty to make great inroads into natural assets. The wise management and more equitable distribution of the earth's resources is one of the most pressing tasks facing the international community. This will be made easier by increased employment and a more harmonious growth of the world economy.\n394.\tThe world-wide debate on energy sounded the first warning that a new approach to the use of resources is necessary. We know that today's large sources of stored energy-such as coal, oil and uranium\u2014are limited. These sources are also combined with great hazards for the environment and human health. Whole-hearted efforts to improve energy management and find new, environmentally safe and renewable sources of energy are therefore essential. We shall be forced in the future to discuss many other resources in the same way.\n395.\tThe United Nations international conferences on food, population and the environment have played a prominent role in drawing the attention of world opinion to these issues. We look forward with great interest to the work now to be done to increase our knowledge of the relationship between population, resources, environment and development. More light needs to be thrown on this. Alternative growth concepts, the sharp rise in resource consumption and the relationship between conservation and waste in the industrialized and developing countries must be dealt with. As part of this work Sweden is prepared to consider financing a United Nations seminar to delineate and give priority to the fields where international expertise is now inadequate. We recommend that the Economic and Social Council should without delay devote special effort to the question of the management and the recycling of natural resources. Broad support for implementing Economic and Social Council resolution 1978/61 on convening a conference on new and renewable sources of energy at the earliest possible moment is also essential.\n396.\tThe distribution of resources is as important and urgent as the management of resources. Unfortunately, it is already apparent how little progress in this respect has been made during the Second United Nations Development Decade.\n397.\tWe must now seriously start discussing perspectives for the 1980s and thereafter. The substance of a new development strategy still has to be worked out, but the objective is clear: a more equitable distribution of the fruits of the earth's resources between and within States, Awareness of our dependence upon one another must lead to action.\n398.\tFew tasks are more vital for the United Nations than the creation of decent living conditions for till people. But the achievement of this is still remote. According to recent assessments, at least 800 million human beings are living in absolute poverty. That is a frightening figure, but it must not be allowed to give rise to defeatism.\n399.\tReal advances towards satisfying the pressing development needs of the developing countries have, however, bean painfully few.\n400.\tThe work of clarifying and implementing the concept of a new international economic order must be carried forward. The Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 has as yet not found the role it is to play. Even its September meeting was a disappointment. It is essential that together we find ways for resuming work in the Committee.\n401.\tThe undertakings made at the Conference on international Economic \\\"o-operation must not be betrayed. Negotiations on the common fund for commodities must produce results. In the past year, some industrialized countries have given specific undertakings to write off the debts of the poorest countries. It is essential that all industrial countries join in this action.\n402.\tThe transfer of resources to the developing countries must be substantially extended. We must try out new ways of doing this, based on the interdependence of the economies of the industrial and the developing countries.\n403.\tToday's economic problems in the industrialized world must not block the efforts to change the international economic systems. On the contrary. We must realize that positive economic development in the poor countries can promote efforts for economic recovery in the industrial countries, too. We should regard the surplus capacity in world industry as a means of satisfying the urgent development requirements of the developing countries, and not only for increasing consumption among the already affluent.\n404. A more equitable distribution of resources between countries is essential. So, too, is the more even distribution of resources within the countries. That means between various parts of a country, between town and countryside, between different population groups and between men and women.\n405. Human resources are a country's greatest asset and must be used in the right way. We have often been given\ngratifying proof of this. Unemployment in the developing countries is one of the gravest and most rapidly growing problems in the world. Increased employment requires an adaptation of technology, among other things. Nothing will be gained by uncritically transplanting economic and technical structures or cultural patterns from industrialized countries to the developing countries.\n406.\tDevelopment assistance must benefit both men and women. Women have far too often been forgotten in development programme,,. Women in the developing countries have gained specific knowledge and experience from their work in farming the land and in providing for their families. That must lie made useful, Women must be given equal opportunities in education, in health care and other development projects. Preconceived ideas about sex roles must not be allowed to put obstacles in the way of development. An improvement of the situation of women in the developing countries is essential to global justice and solidarity and to economic and social development.\n407.\tThe work of preparing a convention on the elimination of discrimination against women must yield positive results without delay. It is essential to create equality between men and women, both in the developing countries and in the industrialized countries.\n408.\tWherever there is war, poverty and social deprivation, the children are the ones who suffer the most. Improving their lot is one of the most important tasks in our efforts to create a better world. The International Year of the Child in 1979 must be the beginning of a determined campaign with a lasting effect concentrating on the children of the world.\n409.\tThe United Nations celebrates the thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights this year. We are forced to admit that gross violations of this Declaration are committed in many countries. The United Nations Charter and the Declaration oblige us to work together to promote respect for human rights. The wrongs done to individuals or groups within a country cannot, therefore, be regarded as the concern only for the authorities of that country. Here at the United Nations we must strive to develop a system for surveying how Member States fulfil their commitments in this field. Chile is one example of countries where the United Nations must vigorously continue its work to protect human rights.\n410.\tThe provisions of the Declaration have gradually been given greater force as its principles have taken the form of conventions that are binding on States. But the fact that States ratify these conventions is not enough. We must also make sure that States honour their undertakings. The international bodies charged with monitoring the observance of conventions therefore fulfil a particularly important function. The Commission on Human Rights has a key role here, of course. It is gratifying to note that the Commission has recently been more willing to discuss specific cases of violation of human rights.\n411.\tWe must also work for the ever stronger legal protection of human rights. At this juncture, the highest priority should be given to drawing up a convention against\n412.\tThe unanimous support given by last year's session of the General Assembly to the resolution on the protection of political prisoners [resolution 32/121] was gratifying. One category of such prisoners who suffer greatly in many countries are those who are imprisoned on grounds of trade union activity. In our view, these must be treated on equal terms with other political prisoners. The alleged offences committed by many of these prisoners are that they have been active in trade unions. A free and independent trade union movement plays a key role in the struggle for better working conditions and a more deeply-rooted democracy.\n413.\tWe must avoid creating a false conflict between civil and political rights on the one hand, and economic, social and cultural rights on the other. The energies of the United Nations should be directed towards strengthening both simultaneously.\n414.\tWe realize that it may be difficult for many poorer countries to create a situation in which both individuals and groups can enjoy economic, social and cultural rights to the full. A low level of economic development, however, must not be taken as an excuse for a weakened protection of fundamental civil and political rights. Among these are the right to one's life, safeguards against torture and the arbitrary deprivation of freedom. It is the individual who has to be protected. Anyone who is tortured suffers just as much no matter in which country he may be.\n415.\tThe defence of human rights is an important part of the United Nations efforts to build up an international legal order. The prevention of armed conflicts, the creation of greater economic justice for all peoples, the fight against racism, colonialism and other forms of oppression -indeed, all the work of the United Nations to further co-operation and solidarity serves the same purpose. The obstacles may sometimes seem insuperable. The rule of law and justice are easily swept away by violence and power. But a promise and a hope lie in the very fact that awareness of our interdependence has grown, that arduous work is being done and that some achievements are being recorded. Perhaps we can nevertheless believe in a future in which co-operation, justice and solidarity reign. Perhaps one day mankind's perpetual yearning for peace, freedom and well-being can be satisfied.\n\n"

Likewise, we share a wide spectrum of ideals, approaches and objectives within the framework of the United Nations which lead to proximity of policies and attitudes in our common striving towards their fulfilment.\n68.\tI wish you, Mr. President, every success in steering this session to a satisfactory conclusion.\n69.\tI wish also to pay the highest tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov of friendly Yugoslavia, whose outstanding achievements as President of the four sessions of the General Assembly during 1977 and 1978 have earned him profound acknowledgement and respect.\n70.\tI need hardly reiterate Jordan's complete endorsement and support of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his dynamic, courageous and untiring efforts and initiatives in upholding the principles, objectives and resolutions of the United Nations in circumstances which can be described only as exacting, agonizing and oftentimes downright frustrating.\n71.\tJordan is happy to extend a warm welcome to Solomon Islands on its admission to the family of nations as a sovereign, independent State. We wish it every success in contributing to the work of the United Nations.\n72.\tIn assessing the world situation as it has unfolded over the past year, it requires a good deal of cynicism to express any meaningful optimism, or even to subdue the profound sense of unease and pessimism that pervades the world at large and sensitive areas of it in particular. This appraisal is almost as true globally as it is regionally or sub region ally. In any objective diagnosis of world issues\u2014including the all-important issue of war and peace, wild economic turbulence, military balances and imbalances, detente as a positive element contributing to friendly and universal coexistence and not merely as a negative mechanism, hot spots, and stalled dialogues over unresolved but fundamental issues\u2014all these and more leave no room for doubt that we are living in a troubled and divided world unable or unwilling to seek and attain real and realistic remedial action. The world is far from achieving its aspirations; to the contrary, it seems to be compounding its already perennial and inherent difficulties and to be drifting helplessly and complacently without positive and articulate direction, notwithstanding all the rhetoric and symbols to the contrary.\n73.\tA reading of the items included in the agenda of this thirty-third regular session is impressive indeed in the breadth, depth and pervasiveness of the issues which our world Organization is assiduously striving to tackle and resolve. These represent the Utopian's dream of a world organization of member States working towards transforming itself into a world community, with all the ramifications which such a transformation would bestow, exact and regulate in the variegated walks of life.\n74.\tThe aim is laudable and so are the persistent efforts which Member States, large, medium and small, are exerting through the numerous conferences and the even more massive preparations which the executive branches, the specialized agencies and experts of Member States are shouldering to enhance their chances of success. But a meaningful break-through has so far eluded those efforts, and a great deal of time and endeavour is needed to attain the avowed objectives and aspirations of our world Organization. -\n75.\tIn specific areas of paramount importance,\\\" the question of measured and gradual disarmament leading ultimately to general and complete disarmament under effective international control must be accorded pride of place, because, in the absence of progress in this field, the fate of the world will continue to be in precarious jeopardy. World-wide consciousness of this inescapable fact and the failure of the Disarmament Decade, solemnly declared in 1969 by the United Nations, prompted the convening at the highest level, of the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament, from 23 May to 30 June of this year. In spite of differences in approaches, it emerged clearly that a consensus had been achieved and that consensus was embodied in a Declaration, a Programme of Action and recommendations concerning the international machinery for disarmament negotiations [resolution S-10/2, sects. II, III and IV].\n76.\tWe must acknowledge with deep satisfaction the following areas of consensus: first, an emphatic recognition that a continuation of the arms race in the nuclear age is much more a threat to, than a protection of, the future of mankind; secondly, that there has not been any real progress that might lead to the conclusion of a treaty on general and complete disarmament; thirdly, that security, peace and gradual disarmament are inseparably intertwined with the efforts, to accelerate the establishment of the New International Economic Order; fourthly, that appropriate machinery in which the United Nations system should play a pivotal role is imperative; and lastly, but most important, the existence of the political will of Member States, particularly the major States, to open a new chapter which, as all agree, would be to the advantage of mankind as a whole.\n77.\tNo miracles were achieved at the special session, nor were any anticipated, but to kindle a light is far better than to curse the dark and the special session devoted to disarmament may well turn out to be that flicker of light.\n78.\tThe imaginative and timely perception enunciated at the sixth special session [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S- VI)] of the General Assembly concerning the creation of a New International Economic Order based on a more equitable system of international relationships has still to witness the take-off stage in the vital subject of the transfer of resources in real terms, including the transfer of technology. We must express our appreciation of the serious efforts exerted by the developing countries at the Conference held in Argentina in the latter part of August and through mid-September.3 Those commendable efforts on the part of the developing countries were deployed in co-operation with UNDP in scientific and technological sharing and dissemination of the benefits of technology.\n79.\tHowever, as a member of the Group of 77 representing the developing world, Jordan shares the serious disenchantment at the very slow pace which has characterized the dialogue in the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 to bring about significant structural changes between the relatively small group of the rich and affluent and the two thirds of mankind who are poverty stricken, downtrodden and deprived. It had been hoped that the Committee, supplanting the small forum outside the United Nations system at the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation, would reflect the urgency, commonly agreed upon, of bringing about fundamental structural changes in the global economic system which would be consonant with the cherished new economic order. Unhappily, that has not proved to be the case, in spite of all the strenuous efforts made during the year.\n80.\tIt would be redundant to repeat that a healthy global economy must have global dimensions in which the deprived two thirds of mankind can be transformed into dynamic producers and consumers of goods and services. It is only the short-sighted and the downright selfish who fail to see the benefits that would inevitably accrue to the developed as much as the developing countries in the wake of a real structural transformation of the world economic system.\n81.\tIt is the earnest hope of my delegation that at this current session we shall resolve the stalemate which seems to have immobilized the dialogue of the Committee and enable it to fulfil its assigned task.\n82.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, an equally formidable challenge, is still bogged down on many vital issues, as reflected at both the New York and the Geneva sessions. Its eventual success will require patience and persistence. In the meantime, and pending agreement, it is mankind's earnest hope that Member States will refrain from stampedes and scrambles. The sea should be a unifying factor, and not a divisive factor of discord. It has always been an artery for co-operation among nations. Let us not turn it into a new arena of struggle.\n83.\tLast year at the thirty-second session my delegation expressed the fervent hope that at this session we would all welcome into our midst a sovereign, independent Namibia and a sovereign, independent Zimbabwe. The hopes and expectations of this body have been thwarted by the racist regime of South Africa which, in addition to its abominable policy of apartheid, continues unlawfully to occupy South West Africa, and by the equally obdurate and reprehensible usurpation of the racist minority Smith regime in Southern Rhodesia.\n84.\tWhile the considerable efforts made by the five Western members of the Security Council, which culminated in an accord in Luanda on 12 July 1978 between the South West Africa People's Organization and the five Western countries,  are appreciated, it is clear that racist South Africa is trying to subvert and circumvent that accord. It is universally agreed that at this eleventh hour failure can result only in plunging the peace-loving peoples of Africa into indescribable destruction and untold suffering.\n85.\tJordan unreservedly endorses the resolutions on Namibia adopted at Khartoum by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, at its fifteenth ordinary session from 18 to 22 July, as well as the resolutions of the Council of Ministers of the OAU at their thirty-first ordinary session from 7 to 18 July.\n86.\tAs for friendly Cyprus, it is the earnest hope of Jordan that the two Cypriot communities and the citizens of Cyprus will speedily work out a modus vivendi which would be acceptable to both parties within a framework of the territorial integrity and independence of the island and a mutual recognition of the basic rights of the two communities.\n87.\tLebanon, over the past three years, has suffered an absolutely catastrophic tragedy. Lebanon has one, and only one, legitimate Government under the presidency of Mr. Elias Sarkis.\n88.\tAll the efforts which the President of Lebanon has been exerting, with the support of the overwhelming majority of Lebanon's peace-loving citizens, are being thwarted by a multiplicity of covert Israeli acts of interventions, which have nullified efforts to heal the deep wounds that have been inflicted on Lebanon and its people.\n89.\tIn spite of the Security Council's categorical and unambiguous resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978), which have been reaffirmed recently by the Security Council, Israel persists, in the presence of UNIFIL, to frustrate the efforts of the legitimate Lebanese authority through its armed forces to restore its sovereignty over the whole of Lebanon's national soil; these efforts, if successful, would have paved the way for Lebanon's return to what we have always known it to be: a land of love, fraternity and prosperity.\n90.\tAt the same time, we feel in duty bound to appeal solemnly to all Lebanese leaders and citizens to rally behind their lawful Government and to give it their full endorsement to enable it to carry out its historic responsibility to settle the manifold internal conflicts and restore security, stability and prosperity lo Lebanon. We are unanimous in requesting that an end be brought to Lebanon's tragedy, which has persisted for so long that it has become impossible to keep silent about its prolongation.\n91.\tJordan's position concerning the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East is inspired by principles and basic rights which cannot be compromised. Since 1967 Jordan has been striving to achieve a comprehensive settlement and the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the region. Jordan participated in 1967, in the most- trying conditions, in the adoption of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and has worked incessantly for its implementation in the international arena as well as within the Arab area. It had done so prompted by the urge to spare the region the calamities of continuing wars and to enable our people to live in peace within the framework of a peaceful settlement based upon reciprocal obligations. In accordance with those obligations, Israel would withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories and the people of Palestine would exercise their right to self-determination, in total freedom, in exchange for the termination of hostilities, the establishment of peace and the establishment of mutual security guarantees, with the support of the international community, which has repeatedly called for such guarantees. But Israel, as revealed through its practices over the past 11 years or more of occupation and the repeated declarations of its leaders, has rejected the principle of withdrawal and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. On the contrary, it has actively pursued a policy of \\\"planting\\\" colonies in the occupied lands and has striven assiduously to erase the Arab Identity of the occupied Arab lands, particularly in holy Jerusalem, the heart of the Palestinian cause, the focal point of all the faithful and the symbol of Arab rights and faith in peace, goodness and fraternity.\n92.\tThe practices of consecutive Israeli Governments have changed the connotations and meaning of the term \\\"occupation\\\" as laid down unambiguously in international law, because Israeli occupation, compared with military occupation by others, is far more devastating and ominous, in that it has been accompanied by a deliberate, calculated and continuing policy of colonizing the remnants of what remained of Palestine in the aftermath of 1948.\n93.\tThe Government of Jordan has repeatedly declared its support for a just peace and a comprehensive settlement based on clear objectives and substantive issues. It should include categorical indications that Israel has genuinely altered its real policy concerning withdrawal, the cause of the Palestinian people and the prerequisites for a just peace. We seek an honourable peace with which we can live and with which future generations can live too.\n94.\tWe support any reasonable formula for common Arab and international action, which is acceptable to all the parties concerned during the coming decisive phases, including the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. We say this to the world community, at whose behest the Security Council adopted resolution 242 (1967) and gave it its correct interpretation. It is the interpretation which stems from the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by means of occupation by force. It is incumbent upon this international community to impose its will, halt aggression, prevent any breach of international law and precepts and, furthermore, implement the resolutions of the United Nations.\n95.\tJordan reiterated anew after the publication of the results of the Camp David talks that it stands for a just peace and supports all efforts designed to achieve a comprehensive settlement.\n96.\tJordan has also expressed to the President of the United States, Mr. Carter, its deep appreciation of his courage and his persistent efforts and perseverance in the cause of peace. The Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has studied most carefully and with an open mind the agreements  which emerged from the Camp David meetings, to which it was not a party and to the results of which it is not committed. It wishes to reiterate anew the principles which will determine Jordan's position in assessing the results of the Camp David meetings in their totality and in taking whatever steps and positions flow there from. Those principles are the following.\n97.\tFirst, Jordan believes in a comprehensive settlement which tackles the manifold dimensions of the Palestinian cause and the Arab-Israeli conflict to which it has given rise. It should also ensure the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people over Palestinian soil, as well as Arab rights in a comprehensive form, on all fronts and with the participation of all the parties concerned.\n98.\tSecondly, any forthcoming final settlement must be based upon complete Israeli withdrawal from all the Arab countries occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, Gaza and Golan, and the restoration of Arab sovereignty over Arab Jerusalem. It must also include the right of the Palestinian people to determine their fate in total freedom, and the attainment of security and peace by all the parties.\n99.\tThe Jordanian leadership was recently visited by Mr. Cyrus Vance, the Secretary of State of the United States of America. There were frank and useful exchanges of view in the course of which the American Secretary of State explained the agreements which had emerged from the Camp David meetings and the United States interpretation of them. The Jordanian side, in turn, sought clarifications on a number of basic issues relating to total withdrawal from occupied Arab lands, the future of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the restoration of Arab sovereignty over Arab Jerusalem, the principle of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, the cause of the Palestine refugees, the presence of Israeli colonies in the occupied Arab lands and other issues connected with a peaceful settlement.\n100.\tJordan will not close any doors which might lead to the termination of occupation, but will continue to knock on - all doors in order to deliver our people from their bondage. We wish to reiterate that we shall not sacrifice our principles and our national rights. And, while Jordan regards the people of Palestine as the principal party in the issue, it will not shirk or evade its national and international responsibilities in the cause of peace.\n101.\tJordan stands for a just peace and will continue its dialogue with the Government of the United States with a view to finding a modus vivendi for co-operation in the peace efforts, which ensure the achievement of a comprehensive and just settlement in accordance with the principles which we have outlined. Jordan will also conduct parallel, extensive and comprehensive talks within the Arab and the international arenas, in pursuit of these avowed objectives.\n102.\tAs we witness the region of the Middle East entering a new and most delicate phase in the process of peacemaking, we cherish solid hopes and strong faith that Jordan's clear-cut basic position will meet with a positive response from the international community and that this will bring to an end the prolonged agony of the Palestinian people, ensure security and stability for the peoples of the Middle East and contribute to peace in the world as a whole.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n128.\tMr. President, it giver me great satisfaction to congratulate you most warmly on behalf of the Government of Argentina on your unanimous election to the presidency of this General Assembly. Your election, which is a clear recognition of your personal and professional\nqualifications, has a special significance for Argentina, since you belong to and are an outstanding representative of a country bound to my own by close links of brotherhood and understanding. We are certain that your presidency will be an important factor in the advancement of our work and the achievement of the best results. My delegation wishes to extend to you the assurance of its fullest co-operation in your difficult task.\n129.\tI wish to take this opportunity to express our profound gratitude to Mr. Lazar Mojsov, of Yugoslavia, for his excellent and hard work during the last regular session and this year's three special sessions of the General Assembly.\n130.\tI should also like to emphasize my Government's satisfaction concerning the official visit that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, paid to my country. His opening address to the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries enhanced the prestige of that significant event and contributed to its success.\n131.\tThe spirit of universality that inspires our Organization is evident now with the presence of Solomon Islands, a new Member of the United Nations to which we extend a heartfelt welcome.\n132.\tThe intense work of the Organization, as summed up in the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization [A/33/1], and a review of the matters that concern us show a picture of the world situation that is hardly encouraging.\n133.\tWe are again called upon to examine international situations in which the United Nations plays a preponderant role, particularly in relation to one of its fundamental purposes, the maintenance of international peace and security.\n134.\tAs we review the events that have taken place since the previous general debate, we cannot help noticing the seriousness of certain situations and the existence of growing tensions in critical areas, the persistence of which threatens world peace. In this context, we are concerned by the turn taken in relations between the super-Powers, in which elements characteristic of the cold war era have reappeared, thus slowing down the process of detente initiated not long ago. Judging from the bilateral negotiations on the limitation of strategic arms, we could say that it has not yet been possible to achieve an agreement that would warrant the hope of lasting peaceful coexistence. But this assessment is applicable not only to the strict framework of relations between the most powerful States, but also to other bilateral relations, where certain Powers follow conditional and restrictive practices, particularly when they deal with developing countries.\n135.\tIn our review of the critical areas of the world, we are prompted to start with the question of the Middle East, where a complex set of circumstances combines to pose one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.\n136- We remain convinced that the principles contained in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)\nprovide the guidelines that inevitably will have to be followed as the basis for negotiations leading to the establishment of peace in the area.\n137.\tThe initiative of the President of the United States seems to have opened new ways to the negotiations. We can but hope now that the arrangements to be concluded will adequately take into account the rights and interests of all the peoples of the Middle East, in an effort to make possible a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.\n138.\tArgentina, which maintains with Lebanon close links of blood and culture, cannot fail to express its deep concern for the human and material losses that unbridled violence has provoked, with no end in sight. We solemnly call on all the parties involved in the conflict to do everything in their power to put an end to this sad bloodshed.\n139.\tIn southern Africa, the situation has alarming features, particularly if we consider the difficulties faced by our Organization as a consequence of non-compliance with its resolutions by those who rule the territories there.\n140.\tThe situation in Namibia gives rise to doubts even now as to the future of that Territory. Firm in our conviction that colonial questions have to be solved through negotiations, and firmly believing in support for the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, we reiterate our hope that goodwill and a sense of responsibility will prevail among the parties, so that this problem may be solved peacefully and in accordance with those decisions.\n141.\tWe particularly wish to see the prompt realization of those adjustments that are indispensable for the implementation of the proposals of the five Western members of the Security Council, proposals that embody an initiative that was endorsed by that body.\n142.\tArgentina wishes expressly to state its intention, if these proposals are actually carried out, directly to cooperate in the actions to be undertaken by our Organization in the process of Namibian independence. Those actions will need the support of all the parties directly involved and that of the international community as a whole.\n143.\tA last, unavoidable reference to the situation prevailing in southern Africa leads us to mention one serious problem outstanding in the area. I speak of the persistence of discriminatory practices that are an offence not only to the peoples of Africa, but to the conscience of all mankind.\n144.\tThe Argentine Republic, which has invariably rejected racism and discrimination in all its forms, cannot but express once again its concern over the continuation of the policy of apartheid, and therefore we reiterate the call to put an end to a system incompatible with contemporary ethical and social values.\n145.\tIt was because of this concern that we participated in the World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, which was held in Geneva last August.\n146.\tIn our time, it is very difficult seriously to think of a secure and lasting peace when the efforts to halt the arms race continue to be hampered by barriers erected with senseless blindness.\n147.\tIt is premature as yet to make a full evaluation of the results of the tenth special session of the General Assembly, which was devoted to disarmament. Yet it is possible to identify some positive elements in its proceedings and decisions. Among the assets, we can essentially point to its sound conceptualization of the principle of non-proliferation and to the fact that, as a result, it put the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) on the same plane with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. However, it must be pointed out that while the former is not of a discriminatory nature, the latter is.\n148.\tThe full participation in the deliberations at the special session of the People's Republic of China and of France opens up a new era in the disarmament negotiations, and warrants our fervent hope that in this field, too, the United Nations will achieve universality, which is a necessary pre-condition for its effectiveness.\n149.\tThe composition and organization of the new Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, as well as the reactivation of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, are in themselves no substitute for the indispensable political will that the big Powers should display in order to start on the road towards nuclear disarmament, but they do create a suitable framework, so that if that will exists it can be channelled in accordance with the interests of other nations.\n150.\tThe support given by the Assembly to the inalienable right of developing countries to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and to carry out their national programmes in this field according to their national priorities, interests and needs, constitutes a step on the road to the elimination of restrictive and discriminator practices that, unfortunately, have characterized international co-operation in this sphere.\n151.\tArgentina has recently been designated one of the co-ordinating non-aligned countries on questions related to the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. We will exert our efforts to the best of our ability and capacity so that co-operation in this field among developing countries may be as efficient as possible and be smooth and flexible enough to ensure mutual benefits.\n152.\tThe outline and consolidation of the declared principles that should govern international relations have made it possible to achieve better coexistence in the world. However, new obstacles seem to emerge periodically, threatening the march along the road to peace and solidarity.\n153.\tIn this context, I cannot but refer to the unscrupulous and formidable menace which the world now faces: that of criminal terrorism.\n154.\tThis phenomenon constitutes one of the greatest perils threatening the modern State: the irrational violation\nof the citizen's right to life and the permanent threat to collective security.\n155.\tThe international community must categorically condemn this indiscriminate violence, channelled through criminals under no flag, who are thus clearly unconnected with the struggle for freedom and national independence waged by peoples affected by various forms of colonialism, with whose struggle they claim to be identified.\n156.\tArgentina has suffered, and is still sporadically suffering, from the bitter consequences of this display of violence, and in the exercise of their right to self-defence, my Government and people have striven to re-establish order and guarantee the existence of full security.\n157.\tUnfortunately, other sectors in the world do not react appropriately to terrorist minorities that perpetrate criminal acts, depriving innocent people of their freedom of their lives. On the contrary, they seem to be welcomed in some European capitals as if they were the victims of an unjust social order. This indicates an overt and deliberate, politically motivated lack of understanding.\n158.\tIt is high time that the principles of law became actual practice. We should not limit ourselves to establishing elaborate mechanisms for faits accomplis. That is why I appeal to the universal conscience to recognize the need to establish suitable bases for ending this scourge. In this connexion, we recall the proposal of a European country according to which \\\"States have an obligation not to tolerate on their territory those terrorist associations which premeditate and carry out such acts. We cannot ignore the danger to the normal development of relations between States that the presence of these groups on their territories entails.\n159.\tEqually serious is the attitude adopted by some States which, being totally unaware of the problems of others, arrogate to themselves the right to stand in judgement of the behaviour of other States and of realities which they do not understand, seeking to monopolize the cause of human rights. Reluctant to respect the basic principles of international law, such as that concerning the internal sovereignty of a State, they point an accusing finger and resort to methods of political and economic coercion on the basis of subjective selectivity.\n160.\tIn such cases, as we have said on other occasions, the international community is faced with a deplorable abuse of power the consequences of which cannot be ignored, for its danger lies not only in the resentment it provokes, but also in the great damage it can cause to entire populations for the moral responsibility awakened by those acts should be no less important than that evoked in the defence of human rights.\n161.\tArgentina considers this question to be of special significance. But I hasten to reiterate that our country feels that the genuine defence of those rights can only be carried out if we begin by abandoning sterile recriminations and strive together to undertake an exercise in honesty and mutual respect.\n162.\tWith regard to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, we view with concern the attempts\nto reopen questions that have already settled, which only serves to hold up negotiations.\n163.\tOne threat to the negotiating process, though not the least, lies in the present drafts of unilateral legislation which would allow certain industrialized countries to exploit the international sea-bed, in total disregard of the resolutions of this General Assembly, which expressly provide for the exploitation of the sea and ocean areas by an international regime for the benefit of the entire community of nations.\n164.\tIt is encouraging to see that the United Nations has directed its most vigorous and positive action to the field of decolonization. This was not an easy task. In the first place, we must remember that the fact that each Territory is a separate entity with its own distinctive features made it advisable not to adopt a fixed set of rules for mechanisms and principles to govern the actual decolonization process.\n165.\tThe fact that those very specific features of each Territory have been adequately dealt with in the decisions of the General Assembly and the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples constitutes definite proof of the seriousness and efficiency with which this work has been conducted.\n166.\tThe Republic of Argentina, true to its origin as a country born to full independence after a long struggle, has invariably given its firm support to those decisions of United Nations bodies aimed at putting an end to colonialism. This position is compatible with its status as a country still suffering from the usurpation of part of its territory by a foreign country.\n167.\tArgentina reaffirms its sovereign rights over the Malvinas Islands, and reiterates its firm determination to secure their effective restitution. It also reaffirms its political will to solve the problem created by the illegal British occupation of the islands through the peaceful means of negotiation.\n168.\tNegotiation is, moreover, the means chosen by General Assembly resolutions on the Malvinas Islands, which, it should be recalled, were adopted by an overwhelming majority of votes.\n169.\tOn the basis of our attachment to the principle of negotiation and to the recommendations of the General Assembly as contained in resolutions 2065 (XX), 3160 (XXVIII) and 31/49 the Government of Argentina has undertaken bilateral negotiations with the British Government. These negotiations began in Buenos Aires in February 1977 and have continued through three new rounds, which have revealed some areas of understanding.\n170.\tI cannot help mentioning that they follow a pace that is not in step with the importance that my country attaches to this question, and are far from responding to the sense of urgency given it by the General Assembly. However, we are confident that with the good sense and political vision shown by the United Kingdom in other instances we shall be able to arrive at a just settlement of this conflict, which is now more than a century old. Still on\nthis question, we must make a final and very special reference to the non-aligned movement which, at the Belgrade Conference, once again reiterated its firm support for the just Argentine claim to those islands and urged the parties to continue negotiations with a view to reaching an early solution to the dispute. My country expresses its gratitude for this new show of support for its position and trusts that such a categorical pronouncement, coming as it does from a group representing practically two thirds of the international community, will not be ignored by the British Government.\n171.\tMy country is deeply concerned about the way the economic components of international relations have been evolving recently. Inflation, accompanied by a regressive process, affects not only developed but also developing countries and the measures taken by the former to combat some of its consequences have created a new source of world-wide tension.\n172.\tWhile the economically powerful countries try to bolster the employment levels of their countries by applying protectionist measures to their foreign trade, the weaker countries, thus prevented from increasing or even maintaining their export earnings, have to resort to a greater degree to foreign indebtedness.\n173.\tThe ever more apparent trend of the industrialized countries to resort to import limitations is a sad feature of the present times and it is aggravated by the fact that such protectionist measures are rarely applied among those countries themselves for fear of launching a trade war, so that the whole burden is unloaded mainly on the least economically developed countries. They, because of their inherent weakness and lack of joint action, cannot take reprisals to defend their legitimate interests, or, if they do take them, they are not significant for the industrialized countries.\n174.\tThus, those countries, while proclaiming in every forum their spirit of solidarity, the need to help the underprivileged nations and their support for criteria that take into account the power and national wealth imbalances in international economic relations, in fact apply a policy devoid of all those considerations and vitiated by the mistaken belief that in a closely interrelated world they can overcome the economic crisis by exclusively taking care of interests within their borders.\n175.\tThat is why Argentina considers that it is necessary firmly to reject this protectionist trend among the developed countries. Naturally my country hopes that what was a fact a few years ago, the practice of a gradually wider and freer world trade, which has apparently been partially discarded now, will be re-established, because we deem it to be most appropriate to the interests of every nation, irrespective of its degree of development.\n176.\tAnother fact that worries Argentina is the recent failure of the negotiations conducted in the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, which resulted in the adjournment of the session. That prompted a feeling of general frustration which does not augur well for the dialogue between developed and developing countries.\n177, The economic relations established on a world-wide level in the post-war period played a significant role in the evolution and development of all countries. However, if we consider the present condition of those relations and the problems besetting them it is possible to conclude that the life cycle of many of the elements in that framework of relations has come to an end and that therefore it is necessary to readjust the structure of international economic relations to present-day realities. That aim is nothing other than the establishment of a new international economic order, and that entails the need to undertake progressive and profound reforms.\n178.\tA definitive failure of the negotiations in the Committee would constitute a serious blow to the prospect of substantive understandings among nations in different stages of development. Argentina will continue to participate actively in the decision-making process with a view to reactivating the dialogue among all nations because we consider it to be the sole valid system to solve the problems that the present situation poses for international co-operation.\n179.\tIn May 1979 the fifth session of UNCTAD will be held in Manila. This uniquely important event will constitute a significant stage in the negotiations directed to the establishment of a new international economic order, and in those leading to the formulation of the international development strategy for the decade of the 1980s. My country will do its utmost to see to it that the meeting does not disappoint the developing countries, which expect a great deal from that international gathering, and to ensure that it shall produce the guidelines needed to solve the serious problems which affect trade and development today.\n180.\tTo that effect we consider it necessary that all States at Manila should strive with clear political determination to achieve positive results and prevent the resolutions to be adopted from becoming mere expressions of good will.\n181.\tWe believe that that is possible. We consider that world conditions, albeit difficult, can lead to a consensus that can be implemented in practice. This position does not reflect an empty optimism. Only a few days ago, at the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, of which my country had the honour to be the host, we found that a consensus of that kind could be achieved.\n182.\tIn the course of that Conference the countries of the developing world had the opportunity to establish mechanisms to extend the links that existed among them already in part with a view to co-operating in the fields of technology and, therefore, in culture and economics, as an expression of a sovereign assertion of individual and collective self-reliance as the basis for development. I will not now review the results of that Conference in detail; suffice it to say that the quality of the debates, the political and intellectual stature of the delegations that participated and the intensity of the negotiations which led to positive and satisfactory results for all countries, irrespective of their stage of development, must be a source of satisfaction to all\nparticipants. In fact, the Buenos Aires Plan of Action - as it came to be known -represents significant progress for the entire international community since it proves the existence of a genuine interest in making of the United Nations system an effective instrument for the well-being of. the developing countries.\n183.\tWe consider that the unanimous support of the developed countries for the decisions taken is proof of their awareness of the global benefits that this new dimension of international co-operation can generate.\n184.\tI would not wish to end this brief review of the main economic factors of international relations without referring to a practice which my country wishes to condemn once again on this occasion.\n185.\tI am speaking of a powerful new weapon by which certain industrialized countries try to exert pressure bilaterally as well as at the multilateral level, namely, the tying of financial operations to the circumstances of the domestic policy of recipient countries.\n186.\tMy country maintains that international credit which, after export earnings is the second source of development financing, should be free from political ties of whatever kind, and that the only acceptable parameters for granting or refusing development aid should be purely economic. To admit other factors would simply mean to legitimise the use of economic power to serve the ends of political hegemony.\n187.\tThe international community must consider that there are no conflicts or disputes that cannot be solved through co-operation and an open exchange of ideas if there is real political will.\n188.\tThat is why, on behalf of my Government, I wish to reaffirm before this Assembly our conviction that peace among men and nations will be attained only when we are ready for a free and open dialogue based on the principles of justice, equality and mutual respect, which are the pillars on which the Argentine Republic has built it actions throughout all its history.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n1.\tMr. President, may I extend to you on behalf of my delegation and myself our warm felicitations on your unanimous election as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. Your elevation to this high office is as much a tribute to your diplomatic skill and eminence as it is a recognition of the constructive role played by your country, Colombia, in world affairs.\n2.\tWe are glad to welcome on this occasion the Solomon Islands as the one hundred and fiftieth and youngest Member of the United Nations. We have every hope that this newest partner of the family of nations will make a useful contribution to the work of this world body.\n3.\tEnduring peace, the maintenance of which is one of the principal purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, is the age-old aspiration of mail. It is one of the abiding yearnings of the common man in all parts of our planet. It is both an elemental urge, like freedom from starvation and want, and the ultimate objective of every society. It is the yardstick with which to measure the excellence of any social organization; a happy society is where peace reigns supreme. That is why the prayers of all, irrespective of religion and belief, end with an invocation to peace.\n4.\tAnd yet, in spite of centuries of care and nourishment bestowed upon it, world peace still remains a tender plant buffeted by occasional whiffs of cold war, threatened by injustice and inequity, and dwarfed by the indignities that are still heaped by man upon man.\n5.\tEven though the clouds gathering over the international horizon have lifted of late and the process of detente,\n6.\tOne of the principal causes of the continuing threat to peace is that world politics, as well as the world economy, are dominated by the interests of a few countries. That is not a new phenomenon; it has its roots in history. The compulsion to gain strategic advantages and the propensity to exploit differences continue to characterize the international climate. Institutions of multilateral militarism are being maintained and the urge to deploy them for sectarian purposes is growing instead of diminishing. Some of those institutions are known to have lost their relevance or usefulness, yet the political courage to bury them is lacking.\n7.\tThere is no doubt that the big Powers could do a great deal more to improve the international atmosphere by exemplary behaviour and by displaying greater understanding of each other's legitimate interests, but that understanding must be within the framework of an equitable international order in which smaller and medium-sized countries would enjoy assured peace, equality and justice. Without a genuine acceptance of the principle of peaceful coexistence, the desire to live and let live and the determination to convert cold-war confrontation into competitive co-operation, the process of detente will not show the desired results.\n8.\tDetente is only a first step in creating the climate for finding long-term solutions to problems with a view to achieving durable peace. We welcome The process of detente because of its multiplier effect, if it is pursued in the right spirit. We have therefore been urging its extension to all fields of activity and to all parts of the globe.\n9.\tEach member of this body is endowed with its own national genius and its distinctive national personality and ethos. Each follows its own socio-economic system and has its specific pattern and strategy of development. Any attempts to impose conformity based on ideological and other considerations and to reduce the rich diversity of nations \n to a common denominator will not only divest this world of its infinite variety but also pose serious threats to peace.\n10.\tThe Charter prohibits the use of force save in self-defence or in the common interest and requires the settlement of disputes by peaceful means, yet nations have resorted to force against each other, quite often aided and abetted from outside with the consequent dangers of exploitation and domination. We have seen that, while such conflicts may sometimes be brought to an end as a result of external intervention, the cessation of hostilities is seldom followed by genuine peace. The root-cause of the conflict often remains unresolved while the strategic interests of outside parties become deeply entrenched.\n11.\tIn the long run, disputes and conflicts can be amicably settled only through mutual understanding and accommodation. By building solid foundations, of mutual cooperation, nations can develop a stake in peace, stability and good neighbourliness which will be impervious to the outbursts of momentary differences, which are bound to apse from time to time,\n12.\tAs recommended in the Declaration of the Conference of Ministers, for Foreign Affairs, of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Belgrade in July 1978 [A/33/206, annex I], governments involved in disputes should themselves make every, effort to reach a peaceful settlement through bilateral negotiations. Some regional organizations, as well as the United Nations, itself; provide- mechanisms for conciliation, although their efficacy obviously den-ends on the spirit, goodwill and mutual accommodation that the parties themselves, can show,\n13.\tPeace continues to be endangered also because the resolution of major international disputes has been delayed or neglected for far too long. Differences among nations, as among, individuals, if not resolved expeditiously, tend to erode trust, which is the basic pre-condition for resolving them.\n14. By far the most potent threat to world peace is the continuing arms race, particularly in nuclear armaments. It militates against the fundamental objective of the United Nations \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\\\". The arms race undermines the sovereignty and stability of nations. It goes against such principles of the Charter as refraining from the threat or the use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes. It is contrary also to the objectives of the international community to establish a New International Economic Order. We must keep reminding ourselves of the relationship between disarmament -- which could save up to 400 billion annually of unproductive expenditure - and development, which is chronically hampered by the lack of funds.  The contrast is unavoidable and the irony is inescapable. There is no greater distortion of resource allocation at the global level than that of those devoted to the arms race. \n\n15. Decades of efforts have yielded only a few arms limitations measures, such as the prohibition of certain kinds of nuclear tests, the agreement on the limitation of strategic arms and the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. \n\n16.\tIn spite of three rounds of talks on the Indian Ocean between the United States and the Soviet Union, there is no perceptible movement towards the goal of implementing the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. What is ironic is that the littoral countries, which are affected most by the big-Power rivalry in the Ocean, are not directly involved in those talks. We have been told that the talks will be resumed shortly and we trust that this will lead to the speedy elimination of big-Power rivalry and military presence in the Indian Ocean, thereby facilitating the implementation of the General Assembly resolution declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace.\n17.\tIn the field of nuclear disarmament there has been little real progress. That is indeed disturbing because of the threat that nuclear weapons pose to the very survival of mankind. The nature of the current negotiations and their direction are not such as to assure mankind that the probability of a nuclear war will be reduced, even if not removed. We, the non-nuclear-weapon States, are entitled to that assurance, for the right to survival is basic to all other rights. We cannot, therefore, be indifferent to the outcome of the current negotiations. On the contrary, we would expect them to take fully into account the aspirations of the overwhelming majority for peace and security in a world free of weapons of mass destruction.\n18.\tIndia believes that partial measures such as the creation of zones free of nuclear weapons comprising the nuclear \\\"have-nots\\\" are not likely to generate any genuine feeling of security unless there is, at the same time, significant progress towards nuclear disarmament. Surely, the more urgent task is to reach agreement on measures for the non-use and the phased reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons and on a moratorium on all nuclear tests pending the conclusion of a genuine and non-discriminatory comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. It was with this in view that at the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, India took the initiative of submitting two draft resolutions covering these two aspects of disarmament.3\n19.\tThe final objective must of course be to bring about general and complete disarmament under effective international control,, to which we, all subscribed in the historic resolution adopted by the General Assembly in November 1959 [resolution 1378 (XIV)]. It was obvious, then as it is obvious now that, disarmament should, be general in the sense of its universal application and it should be complete in the sense of its covering all weapon systems.\n20.;\tWe. continue to believe that all aspects of disarmament both nuclear and conventional, are important. Yet, it has been our consistent, policy that nuclear disarmament must be given the topmost priority. The foremost task facing, humanity is to dismantle and to destroy nuclear weapon. The . concept of a security system of which nuclear weapons, represent the most dangerous and totally unacceptable component must be abandoned.\n21.\tWe. must recognize and accept the primary role of the United. Nations in this field, It is a matter of great\nsatisfaction to us that the special session succeeded in bringing disarmament deliberations and negotiations squarely within the United Nations.\n22.\tIt is the considered view of the Government of India that if we are to make progress in moving towards our goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control, we should implement the following six measures: first, the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear weapons, including, in particular, the early conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty, pending the achievement of which there should be a moratorium on the further testing of nuclear weapons; secondly, the cessation of the production of nuclear weapons and of fissionable material for nuclear purposes; thirdly, the reduction and eventual elimination of existing stockpiles of nuclear weapons within an agreed timeframe; fourthly, the conclusion of a convention oh the non\u00abuse of nuclear weapons under any circumstances; fifthly, the elimination of all other weapons of mass destruction; and sixthly, the limitation and gradual reduction of armed forces and conventional weapons within the framework of a comprehensive programme of disarmament.\n23.\tApart from the disarmament problem, there are other major issues of global concern which, if not resolved expeditiously and in a just and fair manner, could tear asunder the fragile fabric of world peace.\n24.\tIn the Middle East there are at present some new moves and counter-moves and in the current fluid situation, when the parties themselves are engaged in reassessing developments, it would be premature for us to pronounce any judgement. Suffice it to say that Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) and the relevant General Assembly resolutions on the Palestine question constitute a principled basis for a comprehensive and lasting peace settlement. We should like to reaffirm in this connexion certain principles that are fundamental for the establishment of enduring peace. These are  the non-acquisition of territory by force and the vacation of Arab and Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967; the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to a nation-State of their own; and the right of all States in the Middle East to exist in security and peace within internationally recognized boundaries.\n25.\tThe situation in Lebanon is a source of continuing concern for all of us. Here is an unfortunate country which has fallen prey to the power politics of the Middle East and where at the moment, by a strange twist of fate, Arabs are killing other Arabs, encouraged and assisted by outside forces. There is no doubt in our mind that, first and foremost, national reconciliation in Lebanon must be achieved in order to immunize the country from external pressures. I am glad that the parties concerned have responded positively to the Security Council's call for an immediate cease-fire. It is important that the cease-fire should be scrupulously maintained. I hope that initiatives for a just and honourable reconciliation will be supported by all peace-loving peoples.\n26.\tAlthough the situation in divided Cyprus has remained peaceful during the past year, chiefly due to the presence of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus, there\nhas been no progress either in regard to the withdrawal of foreign forces or in the search for an agreed basis for the resumption of the intercommunal negotiations. The dimensions of the Cyprus problem, both the external and internal aspects, are such that the problem can be solved by peaceful means provided that the parties concerned recognize the legitimate rights and interests of each other and are willing to display a spirit of mutual accommodation. However, no solution will last unless it respects the unity, sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and non-alignment of Cyprus.\n27.\tThe Preamble of the Charter reaffirms \\\"faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations, large and small\\\". This objective is directly related to the purpose of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security. For peace does not He in a mere cessation of hostilities or a containment of conflicts, or even in disarmament measures concluded in a general environment of violence, coercion and subjugation. As Gandhi said: \\\"The way to peace is the way to truth.\\\" Truth lies in equality and justice. An individual cannot pursue truth, the highest urge of his soul, unless he is able to exercise his fundamental freedoms and human rights.\n28.\tNothing is more degrading to human dignity than the practice of discrimination on the ground of race. Similarly, a first step towards ensuring equality among nations is to take the process of decolonization to its logical conclusion.\n29.\tIn southern Africa we continue to witness the most pernicious combination of colonial domination and racial discrimination. The minority white regime of South Africa, in a bid to preserve its privileges, has been subjecting the majority population to the worst forms of human degradation, including torture, brutal repression, slavery and the denial of all fundamental freedoms.\n30.\tThe United Nations has been seized of this matter since India raised it for the first time in the first session of the General Assembly in 1946.4 Since then, the South African Government has openly and flagrantly flouted all United Nations resolutions, decisions and sanctions. It has done so partly e cause of the supporting defiance of United Nations resolutions by other countries. We must not let our reiteration of opposition to this racist policy become a mere ritual at annual sessions of the General Assembly. The international community cannot evade its responsibility for taking effective measures to liquidate the dehumanizing practice of apartheid.\n31.\tWith the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on 29 September there is some hope that the illegal occupation of Namibia by the South African Government can be ended peacefully. Namibia can emerge as an independent country with majority rule, not through the sham internal settlement whose promotion is sought by the South African regime, but only through full implementation of the Security Council resolution. If the South African Government rejects the plan approved by the\nSecurity Council5 and reverts to its familiar path of intransigence and defiance of world public opinion, the armed liberation struggle is bound to be intensified. The Security Council would then be fully justified in invoking the application of measures under Chapter VII of the Charter.\n32.\tWe believe that the present stalemate in Zimbabwe is largely due to the ambivalence of some Powers on the question of the internal settlement.6 The only effective way to end the stalemate and perpetuation of the illegal regime of Ian Smith is to transfer power to the elected majority on the basis of \\\"one man, one vote\\\", and an agreed plan for the transition to a genuine independence. Meanwhile we should continue the sanctions against the racist regime, widen their scope and apply them more rigorously.\n33.\tDecolonization, the elimination of racism and racial discrimination, and the economic liberation of peoples are essential pre-conditions for securing the fundamental rights of peoples and for the promotion of human dignity and the free exercise of human rights. Equally important is the need for national Governments to assume primary responsibility for safeguarding and promoting the fundamental freedoms of the individual.\n34.\tThe historic mandate of the Indian people in favour of fundamental freedoms left no doubt regarding the deep-seated and basic commitment of our people to human values and human rights. We therefore attach great importance to the activities of the United Nations devoted to this important issue of our times.\n35.\tWe cannot achieve a durable and just peace until there is a transformation of the very quality and structure of the present world order. Characterized by glaring inequalities and imbalances among nations and the widening chasm between the rich and the poor countries, the existing order works inexorably against the interests of the poorer countries.\n36.\tThe prevalence of mass poverty among a sizeable portion of the world's population living in developing countries-as many as 800 million persons\u2014is in large part attributable to the inequities of the present international economic system. Poverty breeds tension, debases human personality and makes a mockery of the achievements of science and technology.\n37.\tRecent developments have shown that basically there is an unwillingness on the part of the major developed countries to begin serious negotiations to restructure the world economic order. The Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, also known as the Committee of the Whole, was expected to be the supreme United Nations body to monitor, supervise and impart momentum to negotiations on major development issues in all United Nations forums. But, almost a year after its creation, it has not even got off the ground. We hope that\nfollowing a discussion of this subject in the plenary meetings an agreement will soon be reached enabling the Committee to resume its work on the basis of its original mandate.\n38.\tThe developed countries have till now not agreed even to discuss at the international level the question of bringing about structural changes in their economies to achieve optimal utilization of world resources and specifically to facilitate increased imports from developing countries.\n39.\tSome of the developed countries have recently refused even to reiterate their commitment to attaining the target of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade (resolution 2626 (XXV)] of providing 0.7 per cent of their gross national product as official development assistance to developing countries.\n40.\tThere is, on the other hand, a resurgence of protectionism in the developed market-economy countries in the form of an increase in the incidence and scope of selective non-tariff barriers as well as of anti-dumping duties.\n41.\tThe measures that the developed countries are prepared to adopt are still in the nature of tinkering with the present world economic order and hesitant ad hoc concessions.\n42.\tThe developed countries have sought to justify these retrogressive actions as a means of dealing with their admittedly real problems of unemployment and \\\"stagnation\\\". It should, however, be obvious that these short-term and short-sighted measures, apart from having disastrous consequences for the development prospects of the developing countries, are neither conducive to healthy growth of the world economy nor in their own long-term interests. No lasting solution to the malaise afflicting the world economy can be found until a concerted effort is made to provide adequate purchasing power to two-thirds of the world population. It is therefore incumbent upon the developed countries to adopt a global, comprehensive and long-term approach to deal with their present economic problems.\n43.\tThis Assembly's call for the ushering in of a new era of international economic relations has given rise to worldwide expectations. We therefore cannot afford the present stalemate in the negotiations between the developed and the developing countries. We must exercise our collective will to continue the onward march towards our common goal. It is necessary: first, to conclude, well before the fifth session of UNCTAD, the ongoing negotiations to establish the common fund, adopting a code of conduct for the transfer of technology to developing countries for the extending of special preferential trade concessions to developing countries within the framework of the multilateral trade negotiations; secondly, to arrest the present protectionist trend by strictly adhering to the commitment not to raise fresh barriers, to dismantle existing protectionist barriers and to take positive steps to improve the access of the exports of developing countries to the markets of the developed countries; thirdly, to commence negotiations within a time-bound framework on other key issues having a vital bearing on the restructuring of the international economic system, such as concluding a comprehensive series of commodity agreements, ensuring an adequate flow of financial resources on a dependable basis and on the softest of terms and conditions, evolving a multilateral framework for debt renegotiation, reforming the international monetary system, formulating a code of conduct for transnational corporations, and so on; fourthly, to initiate negotiations with a view to adopting an international programme to set in motion an adjustment process in the world economy and to bring about structural changes in the economies of the developed countries geared to utilizing fully the development potentialities of the developing countries; fifthly, to formulate a new international development strategy conceived within the framework of the New International Economic Order embodying a set of consistent and interrelated goals and objectives and commitments to adopt time-bound means of attaining these objectives; and, sixthly, and finally, for the developing countries to go ail out to utilize the vast potentialities of mutual co-operation by strengthening existing links and forging new links of economic, commercial and technical collaboration.\n44.\tThe negotiations which have been going on for about five years at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea have far-reaching implications for the efforts of the international community to evolve a new world order. While it has been possible to make headway on certain important issues, the main problem, that of establishing a regime for the exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed area lying outside the limits of national jurisdiction, remains unsettled. This is mainly due to the persistent hesitation of the major developed countries to recognize fully the legitimate interests of the developing countries in this common heritage of mankind. It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that the work of the Conference comes to a successful conclusion as expeditiously as possible. If, at this critical stage of the work of the Conference, any State adopts unilateral mining legislation, it will seriously affect the future negotiations to the detriment of the interests of the world community as a whole.\n45.\tOn all these important issues, the non-aligned nations have always adopted a consistent and principled approach. From a small beginning in 1961, this movement has grown, within the span of two decades, into a mighty force, encompassing almost two-thirds of the countries of the world. The non-aligned movement not only has enabled the newly-independent nation's to consolidate their political freedom but has also given them the strength to resist all forms of foreign domination, overt and covert, obvious or subtle. It has thrown its weight in favour of international peace and justice.\n46.\tIt is indeed heartening to note that some of the big countries that earlier used to frown upon the movement now recognize its role and its validity. The movement has been able to preserve its unity\u2014despite multitudinous diversities of geography, race, language and religion, differing social and political systems and varying stages of economic development-because of its strict adherence to the principles of the equality of nations, large and small, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of others, and non-interference in the internal affairs of others.\n47.\tAs a signatory of the United Nations Charter and as a founder member of the group of non-aligned nations, India has assiduously tried to conduct its international relations in a manner Intended to promote peace, understanding and co-operation throughout the world. India has taken a number of significant initiatives towards stability and peace in the South Asian region. In this we have accorded the highest priority to improving the climate of co-operation with our neighbours. We sincerely hope that our endeavours will ultimately overcome the old suspicions and irritations, thus paving the way to undertaking new ventures of mutual co-operation. With the vast majority of the developing countries we have joined hands in trying to shape a world free of want and injustice.\n48.\tOur policy is to develop bilateral relations with a11 nations on the basis of the imperative of close economic co-operation and shared ideals. It is our firm belief that the tapestry of world peace can be woven only with the strands of such bilateral relations.\n49.\tWe are in favour of an ever-expanding role for the United Nations and of bringing within its purview all issues of universal concern so that it may be instrumental in the promotion of international peace, justice and co-operation. We reaffirm our commitment to making this body a more effective instrument for bringing about a qualitative change in the world situation. We attach great importance to the role of the United Nations as a forum for formulating, negotiating and supervising the implementation of global development strategies. We may not, in the foreseeable future, be able to establish a world government; but we can at least move towards the realization of the goal of one world by devising and implementing, under the aegis of the United Nations, international development plans and programmes - both overall and for as many sectors of human activity as possible.\n50.\tWe must build, on the foundations of the United Nations, a better world for all of us. Modern science and technology have opened up immense opportunities which can either be used for jeopardizing the very future of our planet or be harnessed to bring about progress and prosperity. Instead of wasting our energy on petty squabbles and frittering away our resources on the piling up of arms, we must employ them for wiping every tear from every eye and eliminating every ache from every heart. I trust that in the critical years ahead of us we shall demonstrate our determination, realism and sagacity to realize the dreams of our saints and savants for universal peace based on freedom and justice. I should like to conclude by reciting a quotation from Thiruvalluvar, one of the most famous ancient poet-saints of South India:\n \\\"Where there is no terrible famine, no cruel pestilence, no foreign enemy to invade and ravage, where peace always reigns, that is the ideal land.\\\"\nHail one world!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff46.\tBarbados conveys to you, Sir, sincere congratulations on your election as President of this thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your distinguished record of achievement eminently qualifies you to guide the deliberations of this body and my delegation pledges its full support to you as you discharge the responsibilities of your high office.\n47.\tFully subscribing to the principle of universality of membership in the United Nations, Barbados warmly welcomes the admission of the Solomon Islands to membership iii this Organization. The independence of this new State is but another manifestation of the inexorable process of self-determination and decolonization, which represents the most outstanding achievement of the post-war era and of the United Nations.\n48.\tBut there is still much left to be done to rid the world of colonialism in accordance with the landmark resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960. The situation in southern Africa continues to be a deadly threat to world peace. There, particularly in South Africa, minority governments without the support of millions of Africans continue to maim and murder and commit acts of repression against their citizens, both black and white. Time and time again that conduct has met with the verbal disapproval and condemnation of all reasonable people in our community of nations, as shown by the various resolutions of the United Nations. Yet, year after year, the United Nations is thwarted in its attempts to rid the world for all time of these senseless acts of criminality and this deliberate defiance of the conscience of the world.\n49.\tIf the world is to be rid once and for all of the evil doctrine and practice of apartheid, then we must change from being a forum for talk and inaction to being an Organization fully intent on enforcing all the provisions of the Charter. As part of our programme we must be prepared to impose full economic and military sanctions against South Africa and the illegal regime in Rhodesia. Over three decades ago, Barbados was first among the nations of the world to show in a practical way its abhorrence of the doctrine of apartheid by invoking total economic sanctions against South Africa. We continue to enforce such sanctions and we urge all Members of this Organization to follow our example.\n50.\tNothing that has happened within the past year convince j us that the racist Government in South Africa will willingly desist from its uncivilized course of action. We must reflect that it is only the continued pressure exerted by international opinion and by the five Western members of the Security Council and the courageous efforts of the liberation fighters under the leadership of SWAPO that have forced the South African Government reluctantly and half-heartedly to concede the right of the United Nations to participate in bringing Namibia to independence.\n51.\tThe Government of Barbados is in complete agreement with the establishment of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and the appointment of a United Nations Special Representative to ensure that free and fair elections on the principle of adult suffrage should take place as a preliminary to Namibian independence. The Security Council should not hesitate to use the full strength of the enforcement provisions of the Charter to ensure that South Africa fully complies with the decisions agreed upon by the Council for the early independence of Namibia. Barbados repeats its call, uttered a year ago, for the imposition of economic sanctions against South Africa.\n52.\tThe Western Powers especially have a duty to the international community not to resile from principle in their approach to this matter. Too often the impression is given by those countries that morality in world affairs takes second place to their own economic interests and advantages. Barbados is fully aware of the importance of South Africa as a major source of supply of mineral resources for some of the Western industrialized nations. Their reliance on that country, based as it is on purely economic considerations and naked self-interest, should not provide a pretext for an abandonment of principle and for delaying the true independence of Namibia and the final liberation of the black people of South Africa.\n53.\tIn the case of Zimbabwe, too, Barbados feels equally strongly that pressure must be brought to bear on the illegal Smith regime so that early independence can be achieved. The Anglo-American plan  still offers a real hope for the achievement of genuine majority rule. Here, too, the Western Powers have a duty to ensure that a satisfactory solution is achieved. For our part we will continue, wherever possible, to give support to the front-line African States and the Patriotic Front in their heroic struggle for the eradication of colonialism from Zimbabwe and the establishment of genuine democratic government and fundamental freedoms there.\n54.\tThose of us who do not resile from principle in the conduct of foreign relations must be deeply disturbed by the implications of yesterday's announcement that the Government of the United States has decided to issue a visa to the Rhodesian rebel Ian Smith to enter the United States. It is to be hoped that that is not the first step towards compromising the rights of the people of Zimbabwe. That decision constitutes, in our view, a grave departure from Security Council resolution 253(1968) and is another instance of the contradictory behaviour of great Powers which are critically placed to bring an early end, if they so choose, to acts of illegality and treason in Rhodesia.\n55.\tBarbados continues its principled support for the struggling Maubere people of East Timor. We deplore the decimation of large segments of the population of East Timor by Indonesia. As a small State, Barbados feels a special abhorrence at the way in which a more powerful country is trampling upon the rights of the people of a small and weaker one. We are appalled that so many people, so many nations, have chosen to be silent regarding the plight of the people of East Timor on grounds of political expediency. We are confident that the people of East Timor by their courage and pertinacity will emerge victorious from their grim struggle for independence. Barbados calls on Indonesia to adhere to General Assembly resolutions 3485 (XXX) of 1975 and 32/34 of 28 November 1977 and Security Council resolutions 384 (1975) and 389 (1976) and to terminate the invasion of East Timor at once.\n56.\tIn other areas of the world, manifestations of colonialism still continue. In the Caribbean, for instance, we witness the wilful obstruction of the independence of Belize by Guatemala. The Government of Guatemala persists in its intransigent postulation of a spurious claim to the Territory of Belize, in defiance of world opinion and United Nations resolutions. The Government of Barbados cannot concede that Guatemala has a right to so much as a square inch of the Territory of Belize. There is grave danger that the yielding to Guatemala of any part of the Territory of Belize, no matter how small, would trigger a plethora of other territorial claims in Latin America resulting in instability and threats to the peace and security of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n57.\tWhile some colonial Powers have at last accepted the historical imperative to push forward with plans to lead Territories under their administration. to independence, there are others which hesitate to recognize the right of self-determination. Some also persist in acts of recolonization, while others maintain the illusory position that overseas Territories are part of their metropolitan centres. Those attitudes are prevalent in the Caribbean. They pose the danger that that area, which was first on the path to decolonization with the attainment of independence by the Republic of Haiti, may well be the last bastion in the world to be rid of colonialism.\n58.\tThis Assembly should not be lulled into believing that the seeming semblance of somnolent tranquillity in the sunny Caribbean is a sign that the area is truly free and rid of the inevitable tensions arising from colonialism. Those of us who live in the Caribbean must renew our call to the colonial Powers and the neo-colonialists as well to hasten\nthe process of decolonization in the area and to desist from attempting to re-establish or perpetuate areas of influence which undermine genuine democratic freedom for Caribbean peoples.\n59.\tVery often when countries achieve formal independence they inherit institutional structures bequeathed by the departing colonial Power\u2014structures which the ex- colonial Power continues to use to manipulate the decision-making of its erstwhile colony. These imperialist and neo-colonialist structures often stunt the economic development of third-world countries. Proposals for a transformation of these structures have been made and discussed at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the United Nations, at UNCTAD and at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation, and, recently, in the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, otherwise known as the Committee of the Whole.\n60.\tBarbados deplores the lack of progress in those bodies and attributes this to a dominance of obsolete mercantilist thought. We cannot accept that relations among nations should continue to be conducted on the basis of a \\\"zero-sum\\\" principle, which assumes that the extent of a country's increase in the enjoyment of goods and services is equal to the loss of goods and services enjoyed by other countries. These assumptions, while dismissed by modern economic thought, still continue to motivate the behaviour of negotiators from the developed countries.\n61.\tDeveloped countries, in the negotiations for a new international economic order, are still preoccupied with looking at quantifiable variables. Consequently they conclude that, since the relationship between the developed and the developing countries is asymmetrical, with a preponderance of economic power weighted in favour of , the developed countries, then it is possible to continue ad infinitum an international system of dependency without full and fair participation by the developing countries of the third world.\n62.\tThis myopic view amounts to a serious miscalculation on the part of the developed countries. Harvey Leibenstein in his book Beyond Economic Man  has reminded us of Tolstoy's -critique in War and Peace of those military experts who predicted the outcome of battles by looking at the quantifiable elements of the strength of the opposing systems only. Historically, however, it has been proved that in such situations fighting spirit and morale often prove to be the more decisive factors.\n63.\tBy the same token, developing countries, fired by the desire for better living standards, will ensure by their efforts that there is a transformation of the world economic order; but it will be a transformation whereby the terms of trade are more equitable, whereby technological development becomes the common property of all mankind and whereby those countries now overburdened by debt\u2014the result of a system which places producers of manufactures in a superior position to the producers of primary products and raw materials\u2014will be relieved of their anxieties. We third-world countries must ourselves,\\\" however, recognize\nthat we cannot wait for some deus ex machina to yield the result which is so anxiously sought by all of us in the developing world. We must renew our commitment to examine the problems thoroughly and to work patiently and systematically towards achieving at the earliest possible moment our goal of a new international economic order. Self-reliance and third-world solidarity and economic cooperation are important planks on which to build the strategy and foundation for such an order. Any division in the ranks of the developing countries will only be used by the industrialized nations for maintaining the wide and dangerous \\\"economic divide\\\" between North and South and between the industrialized and the non-industrialized.\n64.\tThe Government of Barbados acknowledges the inestimable benefits which the presence of the United Nations in a troubled world has brought to all the peoples of the world. Its role in preventing another international conflagration within the past three decades is well known and recognized by all. Its specialized agencies have rendered yeoman service which has not attracted the same attention and publicity as certain political issues which the United Nations has been seized. The Government of Barbados believes that, despite these achievements, there is still room for improvement and that the specialized agencies of the United Nations could have been more effective in solving certain problems permanently had different approaches to the allocation of technical assistance been employed.\n65.\tAs is well known, the quantum of assistance which a country receives is largely determined by its gross national product per capita. This results in a totally artificial and unrealistic evaluation of a country's wealth, with the absurd classification of certain countries with vast natural resources as poor and others with limited resources as wealthy. The application of this criterion to countries such as Barbados militates against the achievement of relative self-sufficiency, since, on the attainment of a certain level of development, vital assistance is withdrawn or inadequately distributed.\n66.\tBarbados recognizes that the financial resources at the disposal of the United Nations agencies are not boundless, but my Government contends that they may be more efficaciously and rationally used if criteria such as the size of the country, its potential for development and the finite nature of the problems confronting small island developing countries are properly taken into account in determining the quantum of assistance a country receives. Let us concentrate on curing, and not merely on alleviating, problems.\n67.\tLike other small island countries which have spoken before us, such as Iceland, Barbados places the greatest emphasis on the importance of the sea to the future of its economic well-being. The sea constitutes one of our most vital resources. That is why the Government of Barbados, despite a heavy financial burden and limited human resources, has faithfully participated in all sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. It is therefore cause for regret that progress at that Conference has been slow. Too many issues still remain undecided.\n68.\tThe position of Barbados is and always has been that the resources of the sea beyond national jurisdiction represent the common heritage of all mankind and that the exploitation of the sea-bed must not be conducted in a chaotic fashion, with multinational corporations engaged in a predatory scramble for the lion's share of the wealth of the sea. The development of sea-bed minerals must be regulated by a regime of law that reflects the just interests of all the peoples of the world. The resources of the sea-bed must be placed under an international authority so that the benefits may be shared by all, for the equitable distribution of the wealth of the sea-bed is another important element in the establishment of a new international economic order.\n69.\tBarbados accordingly supports the view of the Group of 77 expressed during the resumed seventh session of the Conference on the Law of the Sea,  which pointed to the dangers of uncoordinated action by individual countries. Barbados therefore categorically rejects plans now being hatched in the legislatures of certain developed and industrialized countries to take unilateral action in exploiting the resources of the sea-bed. We reiterate our conviction that the current deadlock between parties to the negotiations on the law of the sea must be ended to the satisfaction of the peoples of the world if we are to move one step further towards the achievement of an environment of peace and security.\n70.\tThe appropriate specialized agencies of the United Nations also have a duty to assist small disadvantaged States to prepare adequate plans and take appropriate steps for policing and safeguarding the limited resources within their national jurisdictions. Many States in the developing world have passed legislation for the regulation of fishing and the exploitation of other resources within their territorial waters and exclusive economic zones and yet are unable to enforce such laws because of the absence of machinery to monitor adequately the areas of national jurisdiction.\n71.\tWithin the Caribbean, we have had to stand idly by while rich nations, such as Japan, exploit our scarce sea resources without making any contribution to the economic well-being of the region and without any regard to the ecological and environmental damage to the area. We urge all Caribbean countries to take cognisance of the urgency of devising adequate combined protective measures to ensure the proper exploitation of the region's resources for the benefit of the region's peoples. We call on the world community to assist us in these endeavours.\n72.\tBarbados welcomed the convening of the tenth special session of the General Assembly, which was the largest and most representative meeting ever convened to consider the problem of disarmament. That session demonstrated the recognition that the arms race is a problem for all mankind and that its solution requires the widest range of inputs from every region in the world. This principle must be applied with vigilance, for all too often there will be the temptation to treat the problems of armaments as a private matter between nuclear States. The Final Document emanating from the tenth special session took cognisance of the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament, although it represented a potpourri of suggestions reflecting divergences of opinion among the countries participating in the tenth special session.\n73.\tDespite the high-sounding words uttered at the special session, some nations are still proceeding with a build-up of arms. This gives cause for grave concern. The policy of Barbados is and always has been that disarmament should be general and complete, so as to create a situation where resources now wasted on non-productive military activity can be used for purposes of development.\n74.\tBarbados believes that the establishment of the Disarmament Commission as a deliberative body and subsidiary organ of the General Assembly is a significant advance towards the achievement of the goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control. A blueprint for general and complete disarmament must be implemented without delay. This requires a supreme act of statesmanship on the part of the countries of the world. We must work through the United Nations to rid the world of the kind of insecurity that propels nations into the arms race under the misapprehension that the more arms they acquire the greater the security they will enjoy.\n75.\tMany developing countries have unfortunately been caught in the vortex of a race for the acquisition of armaments, albeit conventional. A major cause of the arms race in the developing world is the attempt by superior Powers to treat developing countries as spheres of influence. It behoves us all in the United Nations to strive to eliminate outdated geo-political concepts, such as the theory of the spheres of influence, by ensuring that the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of countries is respected.\n76.\tIn this connexion, small States, such as Barbados, must view with alarm the proliferation of mercenaries recruited from abroad, sometimes with the connivance of a foreign Government, to disrupt and dislocate governmental functions in other countries. Barbados deplores the use of mercenaries in certain parts of Africa and in Nicaragua not only as unwarranted interference in the affairs of those countries but as an attempt by undemocratic and unwanted regimes to silence the voices fighting for human rights and true liberation.\n77.\tWe in the developing world should ourselves be aware that the sale of conventional arms is another means by which the transfer of resources is effected from the undeveloped to the industrialized and developed world. It is the self-interest of the latter group of nations that continues to lead to the misuse of scarce resources and to a still greater widening of the gap between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\". Developing countries should not mistakenly continue to believe that their true interests are served by ready access to military assistance. For these reasons, we support the initiative of the Government of Mexico in undertaking a study of the. build-iv of conventional arms in an effort to arrive at a convention for their limitation.\n78.\tBarbados believes that nations cannot fulfil the aspirations of their people in an atmosphere of violence, and that is why the Government of Barbados has resolutely supported action to eliminate international terrorism of all kinds. Barbados therefore subscribes to the Montreal, Hague and Tokyo Conventions, which were designed to create an orderly international environment. However, Barbados feels that the international environment can be secure only if the rule that there is \\\"no safe haven\\\" is applied to international criminals. We recognize that small countries, while subscribing to the principle of aut dedere aut judicare, might not have the capacity to implement this principle effectively. In such cases bigger countries must be prepared to assume responsibility for bringing international criminals to justice, thus assisting the smaller countries, which do not have the capacity to do this, to comply with international law without sustaining reprisals from criminal groups with greater resources than the small States themselves.\n79.\tThere are other areas of the world where the attainment of peace and security is still an intractable problem. I now make mention of two in particular.\n80.\tIn the Middle East, disorder remains of the kind that can easily spread to the rest of the world. The Government of Barbados believes that negotiations should take place between all the parties involved to bring a just, comprehensive and lasting peace to the region. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) constitute the basis of any such solution.\n81.\tBarbados applauds the efforts made at Camp David by Egypt and Israel, because we are convinced that any dialogue helps to increase the possibility of understanding between the protagonists in the Middle East. However, the Camp David talks in themselves cannot bring in the region the peace that is hoped for, for just as it is unrealistic to talk of a solution that does not include the recognition of the right of Israel to exist within secure boundaries, so it is equally idealistic to contemplate a solution that does not recognize the rights and aspirations of the millions of Palestinians at present forced to live in other countries, on the West Bank and in Israel, without a real homeland of their own. Barbados believes that the Palestinians and their just claims cannot be wished out of existence, and that their right to determine their destiny is inalienable and must be respected.\n82.\tI am sure that everyone in this Assembly who listened this morning to the eloquent and moving speech by Mr. Kyprianou, the distinguished President of the Republic of Cyprus [22nd meeting], must have been moved by the sincerity of his remarks about his country's problems. His challenge to the world community to assist in re-establishing a demilitarized Cyprus, with its independent sovereignty intact, is one that this Assembly should accept. Barbados regrets that that country remains occupied by foreign troops, with its two great communities still locked in antagonistic - postures. Barbados supports the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus and hopes that negotiations between the two communities will lead to the development of an understanding that will result in the early withdrawal of foreign troops from Cypriot territory, for only in this way will tension be eased and peace and security in this area secured.\n83.\tThe Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization [A/33jl] stresses the importance of a highly efficient impartial international civil service, when; men and women of ability from every region perform their duties with impartiality and integrity. Barbados subscribes to this ideal, but we should be completely disingenuous if we did not assert clearly and unequivocally that we are a long way from attaining the ideal wished for by all countries. My delegation also wishes to point out that the weaknesses evidenced in the structure of the Secretariat are not limited to the external political pressures adverted to in the report. To be sure, Barbados deplores the unseemly pressure exerted by certain States and the sometimes veiled intimidatory tactics that are employed.\n84.\tBut within the bureaucracy itself the lofty principles adumbrated .in the Secretary-General's report often seem not to be applied. There are far too many Secretariat employees who tiptoe in fear around the corridors of the United Nations whispering that they are victims of racism -and sexism but are afraid to seek redress because they are terrified of any reprisals that such action may incur.\n85.\tThe Secretary-General's report refers to difficulties in recruiting women at senior levels in the Secretariat and explains that the problem stems from finding \\\"suitable and available women candidates\\\" [see A/33/1, sect. XI]. Barbados is flabbergasted at this claim, inasmuch as my Government has submitted the names of well-qualified Barbadian women to the United Nations Office of Personnel Services during the past year and up to now there has been no positive action taken by the Secretariat to recruit these women. Barbadian and Caribbean women have successfully completed their studies at some of the most reputable universities in the world, work in all of the professions in our countries and have demonstrated the capacity to shoulder responsibilities as well as any man. I make bold to say that there is no work in the Secretariat for which vacancies exist that women in the Caribbean cannot undertake.\n86.\tMy Government believes that the time has come for the United Nations to work our precise guidelines to be used in the recruitment of women and other persons from developing countries in order to ensure the elimination of the cultural bias which has historically minimized the chances of candidates from the developing world. The Government of Barbados stands by the principles in General Assembly resolution 32/17 B of 1977, which Barbados took the initiative of sponsoring at the thirty- second session of the General Assembly, as the most effective way of ensuring that regional imbalances in the Secretariat are corrected and the principle of equitable geographical distribution fully implemented.\n87.\tWith these qualifications, my Government thanks the Secretary-General for the excellent report he has produced. The world is grateful for the characteristically outstanding services he has rendered throughout the past year.\n88.\tLet me, in conclusion, restate some of the principles which my country applies in the conduct of foreign affairs. Small as we are, we are irrevocably committed to morality in international affairs. We reject duplicity, double-talk and subterfuge as constituting a primitive approach to diplomacy. The practice of primitive diplomacy is one of the major obstacles to the solution of the world's problems.\n89.\tWe call on this body to make a new start at this thirty-third session of the General Assembly and to rededicate and recommit itself to fairness, equity, rationality and truth in world affairs. This is our inescapable obligation to the millions of diverse peoples whose hopes depend on decisions made here in this United Nations. History will never absolve us for failing them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_name": "DNK_33_1978.txt",
        "file_text": "\ufeff250.\tMay I first of all congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of  the General Assembly of the United Nations. I wish him every success in his high office and assure him of my delegation's full co-operation.\n251.\tSecondly, I take great pleasure in joining previous speakers in extending a most cordial welcome to Solomon Islands as the one hundred fiftieth and newest Member of the world Organization.\n252.\tRepresenting my Government here for the first time, I should like to point out that the foreign policy of Denmark is solidly based on a broad parliamentary majority reflecting a deep belief in the basic values and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\n253.\tOur membership in the United Nations is therefore regarded as a corner-stone of Danish foreign policy, and we see the world Organization as a unique instrument for bringing us closer to the overriding goal: a world at peace based on greater respect for the individual and his fundamental needs.\n254.\tIn. this connexion I wish also to stress the great importance we attach to the role of the Secretary-General and his. staff.\n255.\tThe United Nations was founded upon a recognition of the joint responsibility of the great Powers for the maintenance of peace in the world, and, although the trend today is towards the increased involvement of the whole world community, the role of the world's most powerful States is still crucial. The general recognition of this is clearly brought out by the attention which all nations devote to the development of the relationship between the United States of America and the USSR. The Danish Government is pleased to note the increased co-operation between the two in many all-important fields. For obvious reasons we are, however, observing with particular interest the efforts to control and reduce the ongoing arms race. It is our sincere hope that an agreement resulting, from the second series of SALT can be concluded in the very near future, and that it will be followed by an agreement concluded as a result of the third series and involving a true reduction in the weapon arsenals of the two military super-Powers.\n256.\tDeliberate efforts to achieve detente have had an important impact on the easing of the tensions between East and West stemming from the Second World War. We are satisfied that the process of detente is developing. But we must admit that progress has not been as marked as we had hoped it would be and that certain problems have emerged in the development of detente.\n257.\tIn the area of arms control little progress has been achieved, and that includes the talks on mutual and balanced reduction of forces in Central Europe, although we have recently noted certain openings in those talks. Further progress in the military field is of the utmost importance if we are to keep the detente process going. This, was one of the main reasons for the active Danish participation in the United Nations' tenth special session on disarmament and our strong emphasis on the follow-up of that high-level meeting.\n258.\tIt is essential that the process of detente be of significance to the individual citizen. As the process, of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe goes on, Denmark will continue its efforts to this end.\n259.\tThe East-West conflict must not spread to continents and countries, which had nothing to do with its origin. Such an extension not only undermines detente and its credibility in general, but also is, harmful to the countries concerned, since it prevents, a genuine, solution of the urgent problems of the third world. I am, therefore, in full agreement with the views, expressed on this point by the Secretary-General in his, annual report on the work of the Organization [A/33/1, sect II]. In my. view, solutions to these problems, must be found on a regional level without intervention from outside. But world peace cannot be secured only by the super-Powers; all nations have an important responsibility in this, respect. It is of particular importance that the People's Republic of. China is taking an increasingly active part in-international co-operation within the framework of the United Nations and elsewhere. Denmark has, always tried to develop a positive cooperation with all countries,\tirrespective of their, political,\neconomic, and social systems. We arc, therefore, most pleased every time we sec yet another nation Intensifying its participation in international co-operation. We view such a development as a useful and constructive attitude towards the problems which we nil face, and which can be solved only if we work together without fear, suspicion or resentment.\n260.\tThe world scone should not, however, be viewed only in political terms. Economic problems are gaining Incensing prominence. When last year the General Assembly adopted resolution 32/174 it was felt that a framework had been provided for the continuation of the North-South dialogue within the United Nations system, is most regrettable that at the outset of this session we must face the fact that the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 has not been able to function as we had expected. What has gone wrong? Did we expect the Committee to do too much at a time? Did we try to find compromise language where, no compromise did in fact exist? These are among the questions to which we must try to find the answers during this session. A prerequisite for solving the problems surrounding the- Committee is, however, that all parties demonstrate the necessary political will.\n261.\tThe Danish Government finds if of overriding importance that solutions be found to the grave economic problems of the developing, countries. In this context, my Government remains of the belief that effective management of the process towards the establishment of a new and more equitable international economic order is essential.\n262.\tThe continuing world-wide economic stagnation has made progress towards a new international economic order more difficult, but not less, urgent. The developing countries have; been affected even more severely than the industrialized countries. However, the growing recognition of interdependence in the world economy offers new hope for intensified international co-operation for the benefit of all nations, taking, into consideration, of course, the national differences in economic capability and the special needs of the developing countries.\n263.\tViewed in this perspective, it is the achievement of concrete results of the North-South dialogue which is of importance. The progress made during the past year should therefore not be overlooked. I find it very positive that it proved possible at the meeting in March of the Trade and Development Board, at ministerial level, to reach agreement on a resolution on the debt and development problems of developing countries [see A/33/15, port two, annex I, resolution 165 (S-IX)].\n264.\tIn this , connexion I should like to underline that the Danish. Government made it clear already at that time that we were prepared to enter into negotiations with individual developing countries-concerning adjustment of the conditions, of past official development assistance with a view to finding the most appropriate solution in each. case.\n265.\tOther important aspects of the North-South dialogue will be taken up in the near future.\n266.\tIt has become widely accepted that stabilization of commodity prices would strengthen the economies of\ndeveloping countries and at the same time facilitate the planning and production policies of the importing countries. Price stabilization would thereby contribute to renewed economic growth for all countries. I sincerely hope that the negotiations of the common fund which are to be resumed in November of this year will lead to positive conclusions of the important elements and thereby give renewed impetus to the negotiations under the Integrated Programme for Commodities. Denmark has already expressed its support of the principles that financing of the common fund must include direct government contributions, and that the fund must have capacity to assist in financing not only stocking but also \\\"other measures\\\".\n267. Science and technology play an important role in the development process. Next year's United Nations Conference oft Science and Technology for Development should aim at intensifying the international co-operation in this area. One important aspect would be to strengthen the scientific and technological infrastructures of developing countries so as to enable these countries to develop a technology reflecting their own needs and priorities.\n26k. The economic recession has increased the pressure for protectionism to the detriment of all nations participating in world trade, developed and developing countries alike. It is, therefore, extremely important to reach an early and successful conclusion of the multilateral trade negotiations within GATT. A successful outcome would mean a confirmation of our commitment to maintain an open world trading system. It would also make for a better Integration of the developing countries into this system on the basis of special and preferential treatment.\n269,\tIn our opinion there should be a special set-up within the United Nations framework for discussion of global energy issues. We are convinced that such a dialogue would be of benefit to both developing and developed countries. We have therefore noted with interest Economic and Social Council resolution 1978/61, which recommends to the General Assembly that it convene a conference on new and renewable sources of energy at the earliest possible date.\n270,\tDuring its last session the Trade and Development Board was able to approve a provisional agenda for the fifth session of UNCTAD. My Government is prepared to participate constructively at that session with a view to broadening the area of understanding and reaching agreement on as many as possible of the important issues which are to be discussed in Manila.\n271,\tIt remains a fact that for many years to come the poorest developing countries in particular will have to rely strongly on external resources in the form of official development assistance. When the present International Development Strategy was adopted, [resolution 2626 (XXV)] a target of 0.7 per cent was set. At tins juncture, when we are approaching the end of the Second United Nations Development Decade, there seems to be very little basis for optimism concerning the possibility of meeting the target. As expressed in the communiqu\u00e9 of the ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, held in June, we have noted with much regret the disappointing over-all recent level of aid flows. Denmark, for its part, finds that very regrettable, but we are determined to fulfil the 0.7 per cent commitment and expect to meet the target by 1979.\n272.\tNew and interesting proposals on how to increase non-concessional flows from developed to developing countries, in particular through private investment, have been brought to the attention of the international community during the past year, but it is important to emphasize that efforts to that end should in no way detract from the efforts of developed countries to augment their official assistance.\n273.\tA significant part of Denmark's development assistance is channelled through UNDP. We appreciate the extremely important work which is being carried out by UNDP and so we welcome the recent increases in the contributions of some major donors. We feel, however, that we are still far from equitable burden-sharing in contributions to UNDP. We feel also that a more stable resource basis should be ensured for the programme by way of contributions over a multiyear period.\n274.\tTurning to some of the more specific political problems before the General Assembly, the conflict in the Middle East continues to be one of the most serious issues, if not the most serious one. That is due both to the human suffering involved and to the dangers which the conflict poses to world peace. By the General Assembly's adoption in 1947 of the partition plan for Palestine [resolution 181 (II)], the world community assumed a commitment to the existence of the State of Israel. At the same time it also assumed a responsibility towards the Palestinians. Against that background the Danish Government has throughout the years advocated a just and lasting over-all settlement of the Middle East c inflict, taking account of the rights and concerns of all the interested parties. Peace cannot be secured through the acquisition of territory or solely by military means. It requires of all parties concerned foresight and a bold reappraisal, mutual understanding and a will to co-operate.\n275.\tTogether with our Western partners, the Danish Government supports the ongoing peace efforts in the Middle East. We hope that the outcome of the Camp David meetings, courageously convened by President Carter, will be a further major step on the path to a just, comprehensive and lasting peace and that all parties concerned will find it possible to join in the process to contribute to that end. Denmark w3I lend its strong support to all efforts to achieve such a peace.\n276.\tThe situation in Lebanon also presents a very serious problem. Together with our partners in the European Community, Denmark has whole-heartedly supported President Sarkis's persistent efforts to safeguard the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon, as well as efforts to re-establish peace and security in the country.\n277. Denmark has for a long time been deeply committed to the attainment of independence for all former colonies and to the elimination of racial discrimination, and we have worked actively for those goals in the United Nations and elsewhere. It is thus a matter of great concern to my country that the problems in southern Africa remain unsolved- These conflicts often manifest themselves in horrible and repugnant human suffering. Such acts of violence must be condemned, but they will not disappear until the fundamental causes behind the conflicts have been eliminated.\n278.\tIf the present regime in Salisbury does not realize very soon that time is rapidly running out, it is hard to see how a dangerous escalation can be avoided. It is our hope that the Anglo-American initiative, together with the efforts of African States, will bring all the. flies to the negotiating table, because only there can a peaceful, balanced and internationally acceptable solution be worked out.\n279.\tAt the same time we noted with relief the apparently very positive and important developments with regard to Namibia, which made us believe that there was substantive cause for optimism and hope. In fact we expected Namibia to provide evidence that peaceful settlements of conflicts stemming from colonialism and racism were within reach. Security Council resolution 431 (1978) of 27 July 1978 appeared to clear the way to the implementation of the proposal worked out by the five Western members of the Security Council [Sj12636] in close collaboration with the parties directly involved. It would indeed be deplorable and condemnable if South Africa really chose to revert to a policy of confrontation with the United Nations in this matter. It would indeed be irresponsible and dangerous to promote an arrangement which would not be internationally acceptable. Certainly Pretoria cannot have said the last word in this matter.\n280.\tWe are still eagerly waiting for the implementation of the proposal of the five and for. the report of the Secretary-General /Sj12827] to be carried out promptly and correctly and Denmark is ready, in accordance with our traditional principles, to provide personnel to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group. We are prepared also to support an internationally accepted, independent Namibian its economic build-up and development.\n281.\tI should like to pay a tribute to the efforts of the African States, and peoples concerned aimed at supporting negotiated and internationally acceptable solutions for Namibia: and Zimbabwe. Without their constructive efforts, prospects. for peace would have been rather bleak.\n282- Denmark continues to condemn the policy of apartheid of the Government of South Africa, and we find it necessary to bring increased pressure to bear on South Africa with the aim of eliminating the apartheid system. The historic, decision of the Security Council in its resolution 41&(1977) on a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa met a long-standing Danish desire. But it is hardly sufficient to convince the South Africans that they must accept a non-racial system with equal rights for all. Their apartheid system not only violates all our\nprinciples and ideals; it is also dangerous and a threat to international peace. The Danish Government put the mandatory arms embargo into force a long time ago and, together with our Nordic neighbours as well as with our partners within the European community, we have taken steps to intensify our pressure on the South African regime.\n283.\tBefore turning to the last point of my statement, 1 should like to underline Denmark's strong support of all efforts to suppress international terrorism. My Government fully supports all realistic initiatives taken within the United Nations or in other forums to prevent and to combat international acts of violence, hijacking of civil aircraft and the taking of hostages by which human life is endangered.\n284.\tFinally. I want to comment on a matter which is intimately linked to the work of this Organisation. I am referring to the thirtieth anniversary this year of the adoption by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [resolution 217 A (III)] which recognizes:\n\\\". . . the inherent dignity and . . . the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world\\\".\n285.\tDuring these 30 years the implementation of human rights has attained increasing prominence in international politics and international co-operation, and is now being considered a continued task at the national, as well as regional and international levels. It is also generally accepted that improvements in this respect are badly needed. Daily reports of repeated and gross violations of human rights in many countries all over the world testify to that.\n286.\tIt is noteworthy, however, that Governments as well as international organizations, non-governmental\norganizations and individuals, are showing increasing concern about violations of human rights, be they civil and political rights, on the one hand, or economic, social and cultural rights on the other.\n287.\tThe fact that economic, social and cultural rights have been recognized on a par with the traditional civil and political rights implies, in the view of my country, a human outlook that not only respects the right of the individual to assert himself; it also implies genuine obligations towards fellow men. Both categories of human rights need to be guaranteed as essential parts of- an integral whole where human beings enjoy simultaneously freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want.\n288.\tHaving touched upon only a few important issues, I cannot help thinking of the many other problems which likewise demand our attention. We may have different priorities, different approaches and different proposals for solutions, but we have to be realistic. We have to acknowledge publicly that we may only be able to solve a few of those problems before we meet here next year. We cannot continue to use inflated rhetoric thereby implying that this year there is somehow, miraculously, cause for special optimism. If we continue to speak like that we shall lose, the confidence of the public. Action is needed if the public is not to grow cynical about the United Nations and its possibilities of solving problems. That, in our view, would be disastrous.\n289. We must not forget our goals and objectives, and we must always fry to accomplish them. In that spirit of realistic idealism I should like to pledge that Denmark will do its utmost to assist in promoting the principle that conflicts and disputes must be solved through a constructive dialogue and peaceful negotiations, and in fin ding realistic ways to eliminate injustice, inequalities and outdated privileges among the peoples of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff35.\tMr. President, the delegation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics wishes to congratulate you on your election to the post of President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and to wish you full success in that high office.\n36.\tIt has become customary for representatives of practically all States to expound the views of their Governments concerning the crucial issues of war and peace at regular sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. Indeed, the United Nations, the most representative international forum, is the right place to raise in their full dimensions issues on whose solution largely depends the future of mankind.\n37.\tThe United Nations was established specifically for that purpose. It emerged immediately after the fiery steamroller of the Second World War had driven over Europe and a considerable part of the rest of the world. Today, memories of those days are still fresh in our minds. Words fail to describe fully what that war visited upon mankind.\n38.\tBoth the generation that had to live through the war and the present generation realize that the victory won over the forces of fascism and aggression is of historic world significance. It changed the political image of the planet and brought to an unprecedented pitch the activities of forces working for peace, national liberation and social progress. The sword of justice smote those who had instigated the aggression. Such are the lessons taught by history itself-history, the most authoritative teacher.\n39.\tLooking back over the path traversed in international affairs over the post-war decades, including the troubled years of the \\\"cold war\\\", peoples, Governments and political figures\u2014unless of course they are laymen in politics\u2014cannot afford to ignore the major imperative of bending every effort to prevent another military catastrophe which would be even more disastrous for mankind than the two world wars taken together.\n40.\tThe fact that it has proved possible to avoid a major war for almost a third of a century is undoubtedly a great achievement of the peoples. They are increasingly showing that they hate war, reject and curse it as a means of resolving international disputes and controversies.\n41.\tRepresentatives of the Soviet Union, speaking in various international forums on behalf of our people and of the Communist Party, which is the nucleus of the political system of Soviet society, have always emphasized the theme of peace, and will continue to do so. The fundamental law of the Soviet State, its new Constitution, declares: \\\"The USSR steadfastly pursues the Leninist policy of peace and stands for strengthening the security of nations and broad international co-operation.\\\"\n42.\tWe are implementing that policy, hand in hand with our friends and allies. The recent meeting in the Crimea of Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev with the leaders of fraternal parties and States has shown with new strength that the socialist community firmly follows the course of peace, detente and international co-operation.\n43.\tThe fraternal socialist States are justly proud of the fact that through their consistent activities year after year, month after month, almost day after day, they are making no small contribution to preserving peaceful conditions for the life and creative work of peoples on earth.\n44.\tYet it would be naive to deny another thing: peace will not become more durable, detente more reliable, unless the efforts of socialist States are reciprocated by other countries. That in turn calls for a willingness, despite differences in social systems, to resolve controversial issues at the negotiating table, without seeking unilateral advantages.\n45.\tThe participants in this General Assembly session will probably agree that we have not gathered here merely to express our satisfaction at the fact that, so far, peace has been preserved. What is much more important is to mobilize additional efforts and find new possibilities of shielding the peoples from aggression and from a world conflict in the future as well.\n46.\tThe will of the Soviet people and the policy of our State was expressed in a penetrating and meaningful manner by Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev in these words:\n\\\"The major thrust of our struggle for peace in the present conditions is to lessen the risk of another world war, of the mass annihilation of people through the use of nuclear weapons.\\\"\n47.\tIt is indeed true that all peoples are inspired by one idea, one aspiration: peace. Yet the situation in different parts of the world is taking shape differently, for the world is full of contradictions and the influence exercised by those forces which are working for stronger international security and the freedom of peoples and that exercised by those who on the contrary are attempting to encroach on them is felt differently in various parts of the world.\n48.\tThe continent of Europe has made the greatest headway towards establishing durable peace. It is in Europe that major moves towards peace on a collective and bilateral basis have been accomplished in recent years. Several hurdles have been surmounted, one after another, in improving relations between countries with opposing social systems. The political climate in Europe today is clearly healthier than before.\n49.\tThe results of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe have been a fresh and considerable impetus. It is no secret that from time to time attempts are made to put the durability of those results to a test. However, detente has been and continues to be the dominant trend in European international life. And surely this is demonstrated by the development of relations between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries on the one hand and France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Finland and the Scandinavian and many other States on the other.\n50.\tEurope now appears to have reached a stage where the opponents of detente are hard put to it to reverse the course of events. However, this does not mean that (he fruits of improved relations between States will fall by themselves into the hands of the peoples. On the contrary, sustained efforts are required, and. provided States are on the side of detente, they have great opportunities for mutually beneficial co-operation in the most diverse fields. For its part the Soviet Union will spare mi effort to this end.\n51.\tClose attention is riveted today on the continent of Africa. Africa, with its 400-million population, is seething, Newly-liberated States are in the process of self-assertion, shedding the last shackles of colonialism. Following the adoption by the United Nations in I960 of the historic Declaration oil the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples almost all of them hare gained their national freedom almost all, but not all. The colonial order still persists in Rhodesia, Namibia and the Republic of South Africa, with its barbaric forms of racial discrimination.\n52.\tHow many words and how much paper are wasted in casting aspersions on the policy or the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in connexion with the situation in some parts of Africa. And who is doing all this'? Those who are clinging to the remnants of colonialism and racism. Aware that what they are doing is hardly popular, to say the least, they are attempting to cover up their neo-colonialist moves and to deceive the peoples. Apparently such devices will be resorted to m the future as well. Yet, deceit will get no one very far; the peoples will know how to tell the truth from a lie.\n53.\tColonialism and racism must be fully and irrevocably eliminated from the African continent too. Those who want to preserve the racist regimes, which are so odious to the peoples of Africa, must realize that their cause has been lost, and lost irretrievably.\n54.\tAs in the past, we make no secret of the fact that our sympathies are tin the side of the peoples fighting for their national independence and social progress. But we are not seeking any advantages fur ourselves either in Africa or in the developing countries in other continents. The Soviet Union does not covet political domination, concessions or military bases.\n55.\tWhen the States of Africa or other parts of the world request aid to repel aggression we repeat, aggression or an armed attack, they have every right to expect support from their friends. Or perhaps the provision of the United\nNations Charter on the \\\"inherent right of individual or collective self-defence\\\" is no longer valid?\n56.\tThe objective, inexorable laws of historical development will prevail. The day is not far off when the hour of independence will strike for the peoples of southern Africa, too. and when the entire African continent to the last inch will become free.\n57.\tThere is an area at the crossroads of three continents which could be described as a \\\"powder keg\\\", as the Balkans once used to be called. That area is the Middle Hast. Hardly anyone would dare to say that the situation in the Middle East is not fraught with the danger of another explosion.\n58.\tWhat is the root-cause of such a situation? It lies in the fact that 10 years after the aggression its consequences have still not been eliminated, while the aggression itself goes unpunished. Israel continues to hold sway over territories it has seized. Unfortunately, even in the Arab world there are some politicians who display no concern about Arab lands and who are inclined to neglect the legitimate rights of the Arabs, especially the Palestinian Arabs, and to cringe and surrender to the demands of the aggressor and those who protect him.\n5V. The Soviet Union has repeatedly stated its willingness to play a part in ensuring peace in the Middle East and to participate in the most stringent international security guarantees for alt States of that area. Israeli spokesmen contend that they have no use for international guarantees. This is no more than empty polemical bravado. If Israel genuinely cared for its security - real, not illusory, security it would seek a political solution. For the fact is that with existing means of warfare the distance from the borders to which a neighbouring State has withdrawn its guns is of little consequence. What is required here is a radical breakthrough towards a situation in which the guns would be altogether silent.\n60.\tOnly a solution that would guarantee the right to independence and security of all States and peoples in the Middle East, including the Arab people of Palestine, who are fully entitled to a national home, a State of their own, can lay the foundations for a lasting peace in that part of the world.\n61.\tAll the accumulated experience, particularly recent experience, indicates that a radical and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East can be achieved only oil the basis of joint efforts by all the parties directly concerned. Separate deals at the expense of the Arabs have only side-tracked the solution of the problem.\n62.\tAnd such, precisely, is the nature of the understandings reached at the recent three-sided meeting at Camp David. If one looks at things realistically, there are no grounds for believing that they, as claimed, bring a Middle East settlement closer. On the contrary, what this is all about is a new anti-Arab step making it more difficult to achieve a just solution of this pressing problem. That is why a campaign of artificial and affected optimism can mislead no one.\n63.\tThere is machinery specifically established to achieve peace in the Middle East, and that is the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. The sooner an end is put to attempts to keep it in a state of paralysis, the nearer will be the moment when the solution of the Middle East problem can be tackled with a chance of success.\n64.\tFor many years, many decades, the peoples of Asia, the most heavily populated continent in the world, have been concerned about how to ensure peace, security and possibilities for development and progress in that area. The key to this, in our view, lies in joint action by all Asian States without exception. This is particularly urgent in the present conditions when developments in Asia are revealing certain disquieting traits. It is not fortuitous that among Asian countries there is a growing realization of the fact that conflicts, crude pressure and interference in internal affairs, which not so long ago went so far as to assume the dimensions of military intervention, and attempts to pit Asian States one against the other should give way to a stable peace.\n65.\tIt is in this perspective that the creation of a unified Viet Nam, which had expelled the aggressors from its territory and is today pursuing a peace-loving policy, is of tremendous importance. The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, which has heroically lived through all the hardships of a long and bitter war, is now courageously defending its sovereignty. From the United Nations rostrum the Soviet Union once again declares its solidarity with Viet Nam and states that the hegemonistic claims with which it is being confronted are totally inadmissible.\n66.\tThe Soviet Union favours good relations with those Asian States which in turn seek mutual understanding and good-neighbourly relations with us. Such are our relationships with most Asian States, and in several cases they go back a good many years. Along with equal and mutually advantageous co-operation based on the principles of mutual respect, strict observance of sovereignty and the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs, we are united with those countries by our common concern for strengthening peace and security in Asia, our joint struggle against the designs of the forces of imperialism, colonialism and racism.\n67.\tOne striking example of multifaceted friendly cooperation, of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems, is the relationship between the Soviet Union and India. This relationship, with long-standing traditions of good-neighbourliness, is steadily on the rise, in its development on the firm basis of the Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Co-operation.  It is consonant with the vital interests of the peoples of the two countries and constitutes an important and effective factor for peace on the Asian continent and throughout the world.\n68.\tIf we do not have such relationships with all Asian States, the responsibility for that is not ours. It rests squarely on those who persist in following a hostile line with regard to our country, a line which is hostile to the cause of peace in general. Those who, while themselves pursuing hegemonistic aims, try to peg the label of hegemonism on others are making a travesty of the facts.\n69.\tOf course, it is not immaterial to the interests of peace in the Far East and the Pacific to note what policy is followed by Japan. Unfortunately, its policy has been showing some disquieting trends. One may well wonder whether that country might not eventually step on to the path that has led in the past to enormous sufferings for other peoples and plunged Japan into catastrophe. I should not like to draw any final conclusions; yet serious attention should be paid to all this. We believe that our concern is shared by many.\n70.\tOur policy with regard to Japan has been and will remain a policy of principle. We stand for good relations with that country, for genuinely good-neighbourly relations. However, appropriate moves by Japan are also required.\n71.\tLet us now turn to another continent, Latin America. Its role in world affairs is on the rise, and what is particularly noteworthy is that Latin American countries increasingly seek to have an independent voice. Accordingly there are growing opportunities for co-operation between those countries and States in other parts of the world. This is a positive and important factor of international life. The Soviet Union wishes the countries and peoples of Latin America nothing but good.\n72.\tDuring the current session of the General Assembly another independent State, Solomon Islands, has become a Member, the one hundred and fiftieth Member, of the United Nations. Oceania is very far from us, but we wish to maintain normal and, where possible, friendly relations with the countries of that area as well. Here, too, we regard with sympathy the aspirations of the peoples to gain independence and to free themselves from foreign tutelage, in both the literal and the figurative meaning of the word.\n73.\tIn this connexion, one cannot ignore the actions of the United States in respect of Micronesia in a bid to lay its hands on a Territory which is temporarily under its trusteeship and to make those islands serve its own military and strategic plans in violation of the United Nations decisions and in circumvention of the Security Council.\n74.\tWhat follows from this review of the state of affairs in the world, brief as it is? First of all, despite the contradictory nature of the current world developments, the international situation on the whole is better than, say, 10 or 15 years ago.\n75.\tAt the same time, it is clear that the international situation does not depend solely on the state of affairs in this or that area of the world. There are international problems which it is difficult or even impossible to fit into a geographical framework. The most crucial, most burning and most truly global problem affecting all countries and peoples is the ending of the arms race and disarmament.\n76.\tThe truth which is recognized today by all is that enormous resources are being spent to manufacture engines of destruction. It is indeed a fact that in this time of peace more than 25 million men are in military uniform; and there are many more people who are directly or indirectly engaged in military production. All this represents a colossal drain on the material and intellectual resources of mankind.\n77 There are those who may say that something is nevertheless being done to contain the arms race. Recently, for example, a special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament was convened. It reflected the determination of peoples to do away with the arms race and to direct the course of events towards disarmament and eventually general and complete disarmament. The session did adopt a comprehensive Final Document [resolution S-10/2/ which on the whole is a good one.\n78.\tThe Soviet Union can note with satisfaction that many ideas that it proposed became an organic part of the Final Document. Like all those who are not merely paying lip- service to disarmament but are actually seeking disarmament, we believe that the decisions taken at the special session must be translated into the language of practical deeds by States, failing which they will remain empty phrases.\n79.\tIf one is to take a sober view of things, one must recognize, however, that the arms race has not diminished one whit. A group of States and everyone knows which- has decided to earmark huge additional appropriations for an arms build-up over many years to come. The decision taken by the North Atlantic Council session of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Washington and the subsequent steps to intensify military preparations in a number of countries can only be interpreted as a challenge to those who are working for disarmament.\n80.\tRegardless of all the attempts of the instigators of the arms race to make things look as if the security of States will be all the more reliable the bigger their military arsenals are, the facts are quite different. As the number of weapons grows, as new and ever more destructive types of weapons emerge, the risk of war also increases. People will not accept any excuses such as references to a \\\"threat from the USSR\\\". Such references are completely spurious.\n81.\tWho but the Soviet Union is making one proposal after another designed to halt the arms race, to check it from this or that angle, and to prevent the development of new means of warfare? And who is rejecting these proposals out of hand0 The opponents of disarmament are doing this.\n82.\tBy now and Western statesmen recognize this-there exists an approximate equality or parity in weapons. The Soviet Union-and we reaffirm this does not intend to change this correlation in its favour. What is more, we have been and are proposing now that the levels of military confrontation be reduced that is, that the security of each and every one be ensured with lesser quantitative and qualitative parameters of armaments and armed forces.\n83.\tAs was clearly emphasized by Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev, \\\". .. there is no type of armaments, and above all weapons of mass destruction, that the Soviet Union would not be prepared to see limited and banned reciprocally, in agreement with other States, and then eliminated from the arsenals\\\".\n84.\tOur country has a comprehensive programme for curtailing the arms race. Our proposals were put forward here in the United Nations only a few months ago. It will be recalled that they will remain the subject of further discussion in various bodies dealing with disarmament. We shall never tire of taking such initiatives, and they will not become tarnished because of this, since the need for specific action in all the sectors of the struggle for disarmament, for the prevention of another war, is increasing rather than diminishing.\n85.\tIn circumstances where the arms race is being stepped up and the world is sliding downhill in this respect, the first thing to do is to stop completely and further quantitative and qualitative build-up of arms. Clearly, this applies above all to States with large military potentials.\n86.\tIt will be recalled that on a practical plane the Soviet Union has urged the discussion of a set of sweeping measures which could be carried out within a. specified limited period; cessation of the production of all types of nuclear weapons; cessation of the production, and prohibition of, all other types of weapons of mass destruction; cessation of the development of new types of conventional armaments of great destructive capability; renunciation by the permanent members of the Security Council, and by countries which have military agreements with them, of the expansion of their armies and the build-up of their conventional armaments. We expect those proposals to be treated seriously and to be examined in practical terms.\n87.\tThe greatest threat to peace-and this is something that is now recognized everywhere-stems from the nuclear- arms race. Consequently, priority should be given to nuclear disarmament. On this matter we see eye to eye with most States of the world, including the developing countries.\n88.\tWhy is it not possible to couch in treaty language an obligation by States to discontinue the production of all types of nuclear weapons so as to move then to a gradual reduction of their stockpiles, and all the way to their complete destruction? But such obligations cannot materialize out of thin air; they are produced in the course of negotiations-and we have been insisting on the necessity for such negotiations.\n89.\tIn the opinion of the Soviet Union, what is required is that all the nuclear Powers as well as a certain number of non-nuclear States get together at a conference table and that an exact date for the beginning of the negotiations be set And this session of the General Assembly should have its say in this regard and make an appropriate appeal to all the nuclear Powers in the first place.\n90 Any major task, and particularly that of nuclear disarmament, calls for maximum realism once you have begun to tackle it. In the world of today it is inconceivable that such a task can make any headway unless action is taken at the same time to strengthen political and international legal guarantees for the security of States. In this connexion, the proposal to conclude a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations is becoming ever\nmore urgent.\n91.\tWhile emphasizing as a great achievement of the peoples the fact that peace has been preserved for more than a third of a century now, we should not forget even for an instant how great are the dangers that lie in wait for mankind. Fully to deliver the peoples from the threat of nuclear war: this is what underlies our proposal.\n92.\tThe same purpose is served by concrete initiatives of the Soviet Union, and today we are stressing them again, expecting that they will elicit the understanding and support of the General Assembly.\n93.\tWhat is involved here in the first place is the strengthening of security guarantees for non-nuclear States; and secondly, the non-stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of States where there are no such weapons at present.\n94.\tIt will be recalled that recently our country has taken a step conducive to instilling among non-nuclear States greater confidence in their security. The Soviet Union has declared that it will never use nuclear weapons against countries which renounce the production and acquisition of nuclear weapons and which do not have them on their territory.\n95.\tFollowing our lead, the United States and the United Kingdom, for their part, have made declarations to the effect that they would not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States. On the whole, this could be regarded as a positive fact, were not such declarations replete with all kinds of reservations rendering them valueless.\n96.\tThe Soviet Union has not confined itself to a solemn declaration regarding the non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States which renounce the production and acquisition of nuclear weapons and do not have them on their territory. We have expressed our readiness-and this still stands\u2014to enter into special agreements to that effect with any of those countries. The USSR calls upon all the other nuclear Powers to act in a similar manner and to assume corresponding obligations.\n97.\tAt the same time, it is clear that, if the problem of safeguarding non-nuclear States from the use of nuclear weapons against them is to be tackled in the most effective manner, agreed guarantees on the part of the nuclear Powers and a multilateral arrangement are required. In other words, it is necessary that we have an international agreement based on a pledge by those Powers not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States parties to such an agreement provided the latter do not produce, acquire or have such weapons on their territory. A similar obligation could be extended to armed forces and installations under the jurisdiction and control of non- nuclear States\u2014that is, to make it even more sweeping in scope.\n98.\tDo non-nuclear States stand to benefit from their participation in an international agreement of this kind? Of course they do. They would be provided with security guarantees universally formalized in international law, whereas they themselves would not be required to do anything but strictly to observe their non-nuclear status. At the same time, this would be to everyone's advantage, for the threat of a nuclear conflict would diminish, and the climate throughout the world would improve.\n99.\tTaking all this into consideration and in response to a relevant appeal of the United Nations General Assembly at its tenth special session, on disarmament, the Soviet Union has proposed the inclusion in the agenda for this session, as an important and urgent matter, of an item entitled \\\"Conclusion of an international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States\\\" [A/33I241 J. Seeking to put things on a practical footing from the outset, we have also submitted the draft text of such a convention [ibid.].\n100.\tWe feel that one of the merits of our initiative is that, given the goodwill of States, and of course of the nuclear States above all, it may yield practical results fairly soon. Following discussion on this question at the current session of the General Assembly, the Committee on Disarmament could immediately proceed to negotiate the text of the convention so that it would as soon as possible be open to signature by all States of the world.\n101.\tI should like to turn now to our second proposal, concerning the non-stationing of nuclear weapons on the territories of States where there are no such weapons at present. It can hardly be disputed that this is a reliable way to prevent nuclear weapons from spreading all over the globe.\n102.\tHere, too, we take into account the point of view expressed by a large group of States. Many countries are becoming increasingly aware of the risks stemming from nuclear weapons and they are not at all eager to have them on their territories.\n103.\tIn our view, this could be achieved through an international agreement to be based on a clear and simple pledge by the nuclear Powers not to station nuclear weapons on territories where there are no such weapons at present. Such an obligation would cover all types of nuclear weapons\u2014warheads, bombs, shells, mines and so on\u2014 whether deployed as combat systems or kept in depots and storage facilities. At the same time, non-nuclear countries would formalize their intention to refrain from any steps which directly or indirectly could lead to the presence of nuclear weapons on their territories.\n104.\tIf all the nuclear Powers were to agree not to station nuclear weapons where there are no such weapons at present\u2014and our country has already declared its willingness to do so\u2014it would not be too difficult to reach international agreement. The Soviet Union would like to hope that the United Nations General Assembly will respond favourably to its proposal.\n105.\tThe implementation of the initiatives which we are putting forth at this session would also result in a much stronger regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons without affecting in any way the possibilities of using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. By the same token, our proposals, which are consonant with the idea of creating nuclear-free zones, provide even greater leeway for putting these ideas into practice through the collective or individual efforts of States.\n106.\tThe need to prevent the development of new types and new systems of weapons of mass destruction is being increasingly felt. Upon our initiative, the Committee on Disarmament has started negotiations to that effect; but these negotiations are proceeding very slowly. The Soviet Union is in favour of the reaching of agreement on this extremely important matter and of the stepping up of the preparation of special agreements on individual types of weapons wherever necessary.\n107.\tThis applies first and foremost to such inhuman weapons as the neutron weapon. The situation would become much more dangerous if the plans for its production, stockpiling and deployment materialized. It is in the interests of peace that those plans be irrevocably abandoned.\n108.\tRapid progress in military science and technology- this frenzy of armament, so to say is increasing the risk that a point could be reached beyond which it would become absolutely impossible to verify compliance with the existing arms limitation agreements or those in the process of preparation.\n109.\tWherever disarmament negotiations are taking place and whoever the participants arc, our line is directed towards achieving concrete results. An early conclusion of the Soviet-American talks on limiting strategic offensive arms is of particular importance. The essence of the problem lies in setting limits for the deployment of the most dangerous and destructive types of armaments, to be followed by negotiations with a view to a substantial decrease in their levels.\n110.\tIt is to be hoped that a sober-minded and well- considered line in United States policy with regard to this extremely important matter will prevail, because a new agreement is needed equally by the Soviet Union, the United States and the world at large.\n111.\tMany countries on various continents welcomed the beginning of negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States on certain questions related to the problem of disarmament and the cessation of the arms race, including the talks on the limitation and subsequent reduction of military activities in the Indian Ocean and on the limitation of the sales of conventional weapons.\n112.\tPositive results could have been achieved long ago at the talks concerning the Indian Ocean. However, ever since last February they have been \\\"frozen\\\" -through no fault of ours. This is giving concern to many States which cherished hopes that the talks would help turn the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace.\n113.\tWhat is required, in the first place, to limit the sales of conventional armaments and their transfer to other countries'' The political basis for solving this question is to be found in criteria of international law which would take care both of the task of limiting arms sales and of the legitimate interests of peoples fighting against aggression, for their freedom and independence.\n114.\tOf late, some progress has been achieved at the negotiations between the USSR, the United States of\nAmerica and the United Kingdom on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. It has been agreed that the treaty under preparation must impose a ban on any test explosions of nuclear weapons in any environment. It is all the more important to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion. But for some reason or other our negotiating partners are stalling,\n115.\tIt is in all earnestness that the Soviet Union has been raising the question of limiting conventional armaments and armed forces. Even today the role of conventional armaments is quite important, while the efforts by States to limit them are insufficient.\n116.\tNo real headway has yet been made at the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. Throughout the talks we have witnessed one and the same line pursued by our Western partners: \\\"You socialist countries\\\", they say, \\\"should reduce more and we less\\\". Of course there is no proof\u2014there could not possibly be any proof-that such a unilateral approach is justified. This is nothing but an artificial piling up of obstacles.\n117.\tOur position is simple: without effecting any changes in the correlation of armaments and armed forces, their level should none the less be reduced by both sides. Some people who want to inflict damage on the socialist countries by changing the ratio of forces in favour of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ought to curb their appetites.\n118.\tThe socialist countries have recently put forward in Vienna new proposals whose constructive nature is recognized even in the West. We are expecting a practical and positive response to them.\n119.\tIn connexion with the problem of disarmament, it is appropriate to stress how acute are the problems of economic development of many countries which are asking for assistance. They are compelled to overcome great difficulties. Suffice it to say that according to United Nations data 1.5 billion people, that is to say over one third of mankind, are deprived of elementary medical attention, while some 700 million people suffer from systematic malnutrition. At the same time, enormous amounts of money, unprecedented in history, are being wasted on war preparations. And, what is more, military appropriations continue to swell.\n120.\tThe Soviet Union has for a long time been proposing that military budgets, primarily those of the States which are permanent members of the Security Council, be reduced by a certain percentage, and that part of the funds thus saved be used to provide assistance to developing countries. This would be a major step of tremendous importance. Yet, what are we told in reply is that before cutting down military budgets they should be made the subject of study. But such a study could last for decades, and go on and on. To reduce means to reduce military budgets without any red tape-even under a pseudo- scientific cover. This calls for a political decision.\n121.\tIn order to overcome the stalemate, we propose that an agreement be reached on the reduction by States having \na large economic and military potential of their military budgets, not in terms of percentage points but in absolute figures of analogous magnitude. Such reduction could begin as early as in the coming fiscal year and cover a period of three years, with 10 per cent of the funds released as a result of reductions being channelled towards increasing aid to developing countries.\n122.\tIt must be emphatically stressed that the reduction of military budgets is being given priority not only as an urgent task but also as one which can fairly easily lend itself to solution\u2014provided, of course, there is a desire to solve it.\n123.\tThe peoples of the whole world would heave a sigh of relief if the burden of taxation were reduced. Today, many are reflecting upon the causes for which some States - and not least the economically developed ones-are experiencing economic upheavals. Our answer is as follows: instead of throwing away immense material values on the conveyers which are continuously producing missiles, tanks, planes, guns and other means of killing people, these resources should be diverted to peaceful purposes. The resources thus released could be used to improve the living standards of the peoples of the world, to satisfy their primary needs such as housing, better medical care, education and science, and finally simply to combat famine.\n124.\tAll this emphasizes the great responsibility for solving the problems that face mankind in the field of disarmament, a responsibility which rests primarily with those who determine the policies of States and their line in international affairs.\n125.\tSo, from whatever angle one views the problem of ending the arms race and of disarmament, the Soviet Union is ready to seek appropriate international arrangements. We have submitted concrete proposals to that effect. Naturally, we shall be willing to consider the proposals of other States, too, aimed at achieving this historic task.\n126.\tThe Soviet Union appreciates the efforts by non- aligned States to help get the disarmament problem off the ground. The activity of the non-aligned countries in this direction, just as in other areas of the struggle for peace, is growing, and that is a positive phenomenon in international life.\n127.\tThe General Assembly can do a good service to peace if it facilitates the convening of a world disarmament conference. It is at such a forum that decisions binding on States could be adopted.\n128.\tIt is all to the good that the United Nations is now more actively involved with questions of disarmament. This helps to put the relevant talks more in the limelight of public opinion. Let those who are spurring on the arms race, contrary to the will of the peoples, feel ill at ease. Everywhere in the world a moral atmosphere should be created which would make the opponents of disarmament feel pilloried.\n129.\tThere is no people that does not crave peace. As to the Soviet people, we can say with full responsibility that it does not seek war, nor will it start one. This applies fully to our friends and allies as well. But outside the socialist community, too, there is no people that does not want peace. We are convinced of that. In States that pursue a militarist course the watershed lies not between the peoples themselves, but when the peoples, on the one hand, and the leaders at the helm of policy-making in these States, who have sold their heart and soul to the interests of small groups which are deriving profits from military production.\n130.\tStates are faced with a great many international problems, whose number and complexity are unlikely to diminish with time.. But what are the conditions and what is the atmosphere in which it is easier to solve those problems'? Clearly, it is easier in the atmosphere of detente in the world, not in conditions of an aggravated situation, in a heated atmosphere. This is proved by the experience of many years.\n131.\tThe principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States, no matter what contrived pretext is used to violate it, has been and remains a corner-stone of international life, of the further progress of detente. Every people that respects itself and every State with self-esteem has given and will always give decisive rebuffs to such attempts. The Soviet Union has not tolerated and never will tolerate interference in its internal affairs.\n132.\tThe course of Soviet foreign policy for peace, detente and disarmament is a firm course. It stems from the fundamental requirements of the social system of our State, expresses the will of the entire Soviet people, and translates into reality the directives and principles adopted by congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n133.\tDespite the complexity of the international situation, the Soviet people are looking to the future with optimism. Our confidence rests on the fact that the will of the peoples for peace is indomitable, that the forces favouring the maintenance and consolidation of peace prevail over those who would like to turn the course of world events in the opposite direction.\n134.\tAssessing world developments in this manner, we ourselves are ready to work without respite, and we call upon all other States to be ready to do the same, notably within the walls of the United Nations, to bring all peoples closer to a reliable peace and to make impregnable and invincible the buttress built against war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\n140.\tMr. President, I wish to extend to you my warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly and to wish you success in your noble mission. The delegation of my country will co-operate in every way in ensuring the success of the activities at this session.\n141.\tI wish also to commend Mr. Lazar Mojsov for the constructive role he played as President of the thirty-second session and for handling the work of that session and the three special sessions with such ability, flexibility and wisdom..\n152,. I also welcome the State of Solomon Islands, which has been admitted as a new Member to our international Organization, and wish it prosperity and progress.\n153.\tDuring the one-year period between the present session and the previous one, many significant changes and developments have occurred and some serious international problems have persisted. The world has witnessed some set-backs in the process of international detente and the emergence of tendencies to revive some aspects of the cold war, the continuous spiralling of the arms race and a deterioration in the situation in some areas of the world, as is happening in the Middle East. The main reason for this new phenomenon is the lack of progress in solving the most important international issues by the eradication of their causes. This international Organization must therefore deal with such problems and phenomena, which constitute a real threat to international peace and security. The policy of easing tensions can be neither stable nor fruitful unless just solutions are found for the crises and problems by eliminating their causes, and unless detente becomes comprehensive and universal and is developed so that it may be a positive factor in creating a more equitable order in international relit ions covering all areas of the world and all aspects of international relations. This cannot be achieved without the full and strict application of the United Nations Charter and the participation of all States, on an equal footing, in resolving key international issues, because just and durable solutions for such issues can be found only through the joint efforts of the international community as a whole. The General Assembly could play a key and effective part to this end since it is the only international body qualified to play such a great role.\n154.\tThe main causes of the tensions threatening international peace and security are the activities and practices of the forces of imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, Zionism and foreign domination in all its forms, which seek through pressure and threats or the use of force to slow down the political and economic liberation of the developing countries and maintain the existing relations, based on inequality and injustice, which govern the international community, thus denying the peoples of the world their inalienable right to freedom and self- determination.\n155.\tThe tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament, attracted the attention of world public opinion, which clearly reflects the wish of the international community as a whole to undertake a large-scale international move through the United Nations to check the arms race and start a process of real disarmament, in particular nuclear disarmament. The world has welcomed the principles agreed upon to govern future deliberations and decisions on disarmament while allowing the participation therein of all States. In this connexion, we find it imperative to express our concern and regret at the fact that the arms race, especially the nuclear arms race, is still continuing, thus constituting a grave danger to mankind and jeopardizing its future. We must also emphasize that the evils resulting from colonialism, racism and Zionism are the main causes of this drive to continue the arms race.\n156.\tIt has been proved that full and comprehensive disarmament, which is the desired objective, can be realized only when all peoples enjoy security based on justice and equality, and are assured of respect for their territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty, their right to self-determination, and their right to choose the system they wish to have, and only after the elimination of all manifestations of aggression, exploitation, colonialism, occupation, domination, racism and Zionism.\n157.\tMy country reiterates its full support and unreserved backing to the granting to the peoples of South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia of their right to self-determination, independence and national sovereignty. If we review the struggle of the African continent to rid itself of colonialism and racism, we find that the enemy is persisting in its obstinacy and manoeuvres. The racist regimes in those territories continue to apply policies of aggression, apartheid and racial discrimination, as well as terrorism, which make that region one of the hot-beds of acute crisis in the world. They are thus directly jeopardizing the security and independence of the African continent, particularly that of countries of confrontation. The conspiracy of colonialism and racism becomes more obvious when the racist regimes consolidate their relationship and co-operation in various fields with the racist Zionist regime in occupied Palestine. It is certain that these regimes could not have survived and persisted in their oppression and aggression were it not for the political, military and economic support that they receive from certain Western States. We are confident that the peoples now suffering under the yoke of racism will be victorious and that the peoples of South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Palestine will be liberated.\n158.\tCyprus still lives in a state of tension and disquiet. It is necessary to expedite the search for a negotiated solution between the two communities under the aegis of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions, within the framework of respect for the sovereignty of Cyprus, its independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment.\n159.. What is said about the situation in Cyprus also applies to the situation in Korea, which remains a dangerous hot-bed of tension. This prompts us to reaffirm the need for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea, for the dissolution of the United Nations Command and for a permanent peace agreement to replace the present military Armistice Agreement. It is necessary also to start a dialogue between the two sectors of Korea to bring about the peaceful reunification of the country.\n160. The problem of economic relations in our contemporary world is characterized by a sharp contradiction between what has been laid down by the United Nations and the attempts of certain forces to place obstacles and difficulties in the way of the restructuring of world economic relations. This indeed is one of the main and most crucial problems facing our Organization. We were of the opinion that the New International Economic Order, the basis and principles of which were laid down by the General Assembly, would solve this problem. However, the practice of some of the major economic Powers and their adverse policies have prevented the implementation of what has been agreed upon. Thus the crisis has become more complicated. More difficulties have hampered the growth and development of the world economy. The developing nations were and still are the first victims of such policies, while the advanced nations are continuing their exploitation of the developing nations. This prompts us to deal with this dangerous situation, because the solution of international economic problems contributes greatly to the achievement of international prosperity and stability, and consequently to the maintenance of peace and security in the world. We find it imperative to stress that the solution of these problems can be found only through the equal and full participation of all States, and that it is necessary to effect a basic change in the structure of present economic relations through the establishment of a New International Economic Order.\n161.\tThe main feature of the present international situation is the struggle for the full political and economic emancipation of peoples, for the unfettered development of the peoples who struggle against all forms of exploitation and dependence. Hence, there is a constant intensification of efforts to establish new democratic relations in the world, based on respect for the right to self-determination of peoples still under colonialism, occupation and foreign domination, and on safeguarding freedom and basic human rights. In this connexion, we wish to stress that human rights cannot be enjoyed in conditions in which the use of force, oppression and the practice of colonialism and racial discrimination prevail, or in conditions that deny human beings their homeland and their homes. The most striking example is the suffering of the African under the racist regimes in South Africa, Rhodesia and Namibia, and the suffering of the Palestinian under the Zionist racist regime in occupied Palestine and in exile.\n162.\tVery recently the Middle East region has witnessed serious developments of a sort that violate the principles of the United Nations Charter and resolutions, and contradict international justice and legitimacy, whereas it is our urgent duty to promote compliance with the Charter and to strengthen the role of the United Nations in order to save humanity and to preserve international peace and security.\n163.\tBy this, I mean those developments that started with the visit of President Anwar El-Sadat to occupied Jerusalem and have continued lately with the Camp David meetings. At those meetings, a series of inequitable negotiations took place under the shadow of Israeli occupation of Palestine and Arab territories and while the Palestinian people are living in exile or under occupation. Therefore, the documents and memoranda signed by the Egyptian President, Anwar El-Sadat, are inequitable and marred by surrender to the fait accompli. They are also devoid of any basis in the resolutions of this international Organization and the rules of international law. They are in contravention of the basic interests of the international community and the parties directly concerned in the conflict, and are contradictory to the decisions of the Conferences of Arab Heads of State or Government, which President El-Sadat committed himself to adhere to.\n164.\tThere is no doubt that under the conditions and circumstances that prevailed throughout the negotiations at Camp David, no agreements could have been achieved that did not run counter to the principles of the United Nations and ignore all legal and political developments cherished by humanity. The principles that were ignored at Camp David were the recognition of the right of peoples to self- determination, the territorial integrity of sovereign States, the rule of law and justice, resistance to aggression, the rejection of occupation, the eradication of racism, the inadmissibility of rewarding the aggressor for his aggression and the necessity of isolating him from the international community..\n165.\tIn the documents that emanated from the Camp David meetings all those noble principles are trampled underfoot and an attempt is made instead to do with various issues, but not with the substance of the problem for which the conferees claimed to have met\u2014namely, the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and withdrawal from the occupied territories. These documents, instead of going to the heart of the problems, have erected a curious structure on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, which is described as \\\"autonomy\\\". It is based on the system of terror and relies on the bayonets of occupation by the use of which the aggressor carries out its administration and maintains security. It justifies the maintenance of the occupying forces, thus equating the invading intruder and the legitimate owner. It ignores the Palestinian people and its national identity, allowing the aggressor to continue to create settlements, and change the demographic and other features of the occupied territories.\n166.\tPresident El-Sadat has signed documents laying down obligations that are supposedly to be assumed by other sovereign and legitimate parties. That contravenes the principles of international law, President El-Sadat has no right to claim to represent the Palestinian people or the Syrian Arab Republic. Therefore, what has been agreed upon at Camp David should be considered null and void from the point of view of international law.\n167.\tThe documents of Camp David, while violating international norms, in effect recompense the Israeli aggressor by granting him his gains, the inalienable rights of the victim of aggression that he usurped. The authors of the agreements, in order to reduce the impact of these violations and transgressions, have described them as a framework for negotiations rather than final peace. One wonders why there is any need for a framework for negotiations when the resolutions of the United Nations, both in the Security Council and in the General Assembly, have clearly defined the appropriate framework for negotiations.\n168.\tIn resolutions 338 (1973) and 344(1973), the Security Council created a clear structure for negotiations with a well-defined objective, which was referred to as \\\"a peace conference on the Middle East\\\", granting the United Nations Secretary-General a particular role and conferring upon him the chairmanship of its meetings. The relevant aspects and methods of work were clarified in the exchange of letters between the Permanent Representatives of the USSR and the United States of America on the one hand and the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council on the other. Those letters, dated 18 and 19 December 1973, are contained in Security Council document S/11161,'5\n169.\tI have referred in some detail to those documents in order to show that the Camp David meetings were outside international legitimacy, since they did not take place under the aegis of the United Nations. They did not include all the parties concerned; and, above all, they ignored the components of peace while substituting for them a so-called special concept of peace. This is a peace of occupation based on the subjugation of the will of the Palestinian people Peace based on such components cannot be just, comprehensive or durable.\n170.\tThe Camp David documents are outside the framework defined by the international community and thus are in violation of international legitimacy. Therefore it is not surprising that they should permit one of the parties to speak for other sovereign peoples and States, to lay down rules of behaviour and means of negotiation on their behalf and to place limitations and restrictions on their national soil. The Camp David documents have violated the essence of the Charter, namely, the principle of equality among sovereign States. Once this fundamental principle has been violated, what is left of the international order?\n171.\tThe policy of the Syrian Arab Republic will not be affected by this set-back since it is permanently based on international justice and the resolutions of the United Nations. Syria is proud of the support of the international community, which upholds the principles of the Charter on which the security of the Members and their protection against aggression and expansionist ambitions depend. The policy of Syria is based on the following basic principles: the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force; the right of peoples to self-determination; and the inadmissibility of rewarding the aggressor for his aggression.\n172.\tIn light of these principles and in view of the will of the international community as most widely represented in the General Assembly of the United Nations, Syria still calls for and strives towards a just, lawful and comprehensive solution in all seriousness and sincerity. Such a solution would be based on the fundamental principles I have already enunciated, and in practice would entail complete withdrawal by Israel from all Palestinian and Arab territories, recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and the exercise by the Palestinian people of these rights, and first and foremost the right of return, the right of self-determination and the right to establish an independent State on its national soil.\n173.\tIn this connexion and in reaffirmation of the components of the desired solution, namely, comprehensive\n\nand all-embracing legitimacy and justice, Syria called for the convening of the Third Summit Conference of the National Front for Steadfastness and Confrontation, which met in Damascus from 20 to 23 September. The Conference condemned the Camp David agreements and adopted certain decisions in order to overcome the setback, spare the region a cold war and ensure that the problem and its solution would remain within the framework of the United Nations and its principles, aims and resolutions.\n174.\tThe Camp David agreements outlined a way to consecrate the fruits of occupation. They included solutions likely to protect expansionist practices and contravene the principles of the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations as well as the resolutions of the non-aligned countries, the Islamic Conference, the Organization of African Unity and the Arab summit conferences. It is therefore incumbent on the General Assembly, this international body in which the States and peoples of the world are represented on the widest scale, to define the means of implementing the resolutions of the United Nations concerning the question of Palestine and the Middle East problem in both procedure and substance. It should safeguard the rights of the Palestinian people against usurpation and loss, and reaffirm the principle of withdrawal from territories occupied by force and aggression. This principle is non-negotiable and its application cannot be postponed. It is inadmissible for the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories to remain the hostage of the Israeli aggressor, who tries thus to impose his own conditions. If the Assembly does not follow this course it will contribute to setting mankind back to the era of invasions and colonialism, war and destruction.\n175.\tWhile on the subject of the Middle East it is also necessary to mention the situation in Lebanon, where the civil war continues to have a deep impact on the Lebanese people. Syria went to the assistance of that brotherly country and provided forces within the framework of the Arab deterrent force in order to stop the fighting and re-establish security. It has furnished all possible assistance to the legitimate authorities there. However, certain foreign circles, primarily Israel, have tried to exploit the Lebanese situation. Israel, as a result, invaded the south of Lebanon. Following the withdrawal of the Israeli forces, Israel encouraged, and still continues to incite and protect, certain outlawed armed elements near the southern Lebanese frontier. It has thus prevented the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978). Moreover, Israel incited its agents inside Lebanon to aggravate the security situation and carry out acts of provocations against the Arab deterrent forces in order to force clashes with them. They were thus hoping to spread chaos and confusion in order to impose their domination on the whole of Lebanon, obstruct national reconciliation and prevent the legitimate Lebanese authorities from carrying out their constitutional functions.\n176.\tWe cannot but reaffirm in a most determined and clear manner the need to protect the unity of Lebanon and the independence and sovereignty of its territory, and the importance of enabling the constitutional legitimate authorities to carry out their functions, particularly with the aim of bringing about national reconciliation and rebuilding the institutions of the State over the whole country. It is\nimperative that any attempt at partitioning Lebanon or creating sectarian entities within Lebanon be firmly resisted.\n177.\tI have already outlined before this Assembly the current situation and its salient features, showing the dangers to which the Charter of the United Nations and peace and security in the Middle East are exposed and the effects they could have on international peace and security. I am certain that the General Assembly will adopt all the necessary measures to preserve the principles and objectives of the Charter and to spare our region and the rest of the world any unforeseen crises, with their destructive and untoward effects.\n178.\tIn conclusion, I should like to repeat that Syria will continue to struggle by all means provided in the Charter to recover its usurped territory. The Palestinian people will continue to struggle, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, to recover its inalienable national rights.\n179.\tWe draw our strength in this struggle from the Charter and its principles and therefore we are confident that this struggle will earn the blessing and support of this body.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff142.\tI am addressing this General\nAssembly of the United Nations at its thirty-third session on behalf of the President of the Central Committee of the Single National Labour Party and President-for-life under the Constitution of the Republic, our great comrade Masie Nguema Biyogo Segue Ndong. On behalf of the delegation that I have the honour to lead, and on my own behalf, I wish to congratulate Mr. Indalecio Lievano on his well-deserved unanimous election as President of the Assembly at this session. His competence and experience in the field of international affairs are strengthened by the profound ideals of his Government and people, which are bound to mine by the historic links of a colonial past. We are convinced that in the debates on the items on our agenda we shall reach just decisions reflecting and affirming once again the important task of implementing the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security.\n143. Through you, Sir, we wish to congratulate also all the members of the General Committee, who, we trust, with their competence and skill in the management of international affairs, will decisively contribute to our efforts to solve the serious international problems afflicting the world today.\n144  Noting the large number of items before us, which my delegation trusts that the Assembly will be able to examine objectively, we believe that, because of the importance and urgency of some items, it is essential that the Assembly should give priority to questions relating to decolonization and in particular the elimination of its last vestiges in southern Africa, the maintenance of peace and security in the world, the establishment of a new international economic order that would be just, and equitable, international co-operation to promote and implement civil, political, economic and cultural rights, and the elimination of racial discrimination and apartheid. These are our main objectives.\n145.\tWhen the Charter was signed at San Francisco in 1945 the United Nations had only 51 Member States. The 33 years since have been devoted completely to reaffirming unequivocally the devotion of the Organization to the implementation of one of its founding principles, namely, the right of all peoples of the world to freedom, self- determination and independence. The present number of 150 Member States, including the fledgling State of Solomon Islands, gives a forceful demonstration of the efforts made of the United Nations in the field of decolonization since it came into being. At this time I am pleased to reiterate most sincerely the congratulations of the Government of Equatorial Guinea to the Government of the new State of Solomon Islands and its people on their accession to independence and their entry into the great family of the United Nations. In accordance with the spirit of our Organization, there is no country in the world that is small or large in the world. That is why we believe that the entry of this new State, besides reaffirming the universality of the United Nations, also strengthens its role in the establishment of a world of peace, security, justice, equity and social well-being.\n146.\tWe are also pleased to know that, without any further impediment, the island of Tuvalu has acceded to independence on, the first day of this month. We most sincerely congratulate the new Government and the people of Tuvalu and wish them a new era of peace and prosperity.\n147.\tNevertheless, despite these efforts by the United Nations to eliminate colonialism throughout the world, it is deplorable and even disconcerting to note the persistence of the colonial system in some parts of the world, particularly in southern Africa which, despite the attention focused upon that area by the United Nations since its foundation, remains at the centre of our concerns.\n148.\tBearing in mind that the world is closely concerned with the evolution of nations that are free and nations that are not, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea defends the right of each people to self-determination. We have come to this Assembly convinced that we shall find here guidelines for our struggle to establish new methods for militant solidarity with and support of the peoples in Africa and in the rest of the world who are fighting for their national independence and human dignity.\n149.\tThe efforts made by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, to secure independence for Namibia by 31 December next constitute the basic elements for the self-determination and independence of that African territory under the auspices of the United Nations. The People's Revolutionary Government of Equatorial Guinea, consistent with its democratic principles, resolutely supports the independence of Namibia, including Walvis Bay as an integral and inseparable part of its territory, and the transfer of power to the Namibian people under the direction of SWAPO, on 31 December of this year. Accordingly, we reject any manoeuvre intended to detract from the process of securing the independence of Namibia in accordance with the plan established by the United Nations.\n150.\tIn reaching this important decision on the immediate independence of Namibia, I need hardly refer in this Assembly to the unyielding attitude of the South African racist Government and the various manoeuvres it has attempted for some years in defiance of the international community. We consider that the time has come to put an end to this state of affairs, which constitutes open disregard of the African countries and is an insult to the international community.\n151.\tAlso within the framework of the serious problems which affect this zone of southern Africa is the question of Rhodesia, where a white minority oppresses millions-of blacks, with the complicity of the large Western capitalist monopolies, and despite the efforts made and sanctions imposed by the United Nations, little progress has been effected. My Government considers once again that it is the duty of this Assembly to arrive at adequate solutions at this session. We energetically condemn the military incursions of the South African racist aggressors and Rhodesians into neighbouring countries. These incursions constitute a threat not only to the peace of the region, but also to international peace and security.\n152.\tEquatorial Guinea, in advocating the genuine independence of the people of Zimbabwe, expresses its concern over manoeuvres introduced, promoted and attempted by the illegal regime of Mr. Smith with the aim of setting up a\npuppet government in Zimbabwe with the sole and deliberate purpose of having his interests prevail in that African Territory. In this respect my Government resolutely supports the struggle undertaken by the Zimbabwe Patriotic Front as the legitimate representative and defender of the real aspirations of the African people of Zimbabwe.\n153.\tThe valiant brother people of the Sahara are deprived of their sacred rights to self-determination and independence because of the manifest complicity of the colonialist policy of Spain. In this context the position of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea is clear. We resolutely support self-determination for the Saharan people and their genuine, authentic movement, the Frente POLISARIO, in accordance with United Nations resolutions and resolutions of the- OAU, which provide for a summit meeting of the heads of State and Government of Africa, which would determine the status of the present situation in that region, and we are certain that the parties concerned will strive to arrive at an agreement that will make the independence of Western Sahara possible.\n154.\tSpecifically, the Popular Revolutionary Government of Equatorial Guinea lends its total support to the process of decolonization and, as we have indicated earlier, the United Nations has made a major effort to eliminate the major centres of colonialism in the world. We therefore completely and unconditionally support all Territories which are still under the colonial yoke and are struggling for their independence.\n155.\tAnother of the burning problems of our planet which for 30 years now has been threatening the maintenance of world peace and security is the question of the Middle East.\n156.\tIn this respect, taking into account the parties concerned, my Government considers, and has always maintained, that any settlement or negotiation on this conflict should be carried out within the context of the Security Council resolutions, with the direct participation of the parties concerned, including the PLO, as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We confirm that a just and lasting peace in that conflict cannot be obtained without Israeli withdrawal from all the Arab territories which were occupied after 1967, and without the attainment of the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine, particularly their right to return to their country and establish their own State, in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967. Any solution of this conflict should not ignore the existence of a Hebrew State with secure and recognized, frontiers, in accordance with United Nations resolutions. On the other hand, the situation in Lebanon should be linked to the general situation of the Middle East. The United Nations must continue its peace-keeping efforts in Lebanon.\n157.\tIn considering the review of the problems which affect peace and security throughout the world, I cannot fail to mention the concern of my Government over the question of the peaceful reunification of Korea and the question of Cyprus. It is our hope that in these parts of the world order, peace and tranquillity will prevail. Furthermore, we maintain that the Chinese province of Taiwan is an integral part of the People's Republic of China and should be restored to its legitimate Government. Its illegal \n\noccupation is a focus of tension and a threat to peace in the region.\n158.\tThe disarmament question is another of the fundamental problems to which this Organization should devote special attention, because of the harmful effects of the arms race both for the maintenance of international peace and security and for world economic development. Indeed, complying with the principal requirements of the United Nations Charter\u2014namely \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\u2014means, first and foremost, striving to halt the arms race.\n159.\tDisarmament is the task which, in our opinion, is within the competence of the great Powers in particular, and of all mankind in general. The vast material and intellectual resources of mankind have been spent so unproductively in creating means of mass extermination against the human species itself. The international community is perfectly aware of the present needs of millions of human beings, and those needs-for food, medical assistance, education, housing and so on\u2014should not be allowed to go unmet because of the arms race, while huge amounts of money, up to as much as $400 billion a year, are invested in this absurd programme to do away with man himself.\n160.\tThe problem of disarmament is of singular importance and significance for the African continent in our efforts for the denuclearization of Africa. In its resolution 3261 E (XXIX) of 9 December 1974, the General Assembly, after recalling its resolutions 1652 (XVI) and 2033 (XX), reaffirmed its call upon all States to consider and respect the continent of Africa as a nuclear- free zone and reiterated its call upon all States to refrain from testing, manufacturing, deploying, transporting, storing, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons on the African continent. In this respect, my delegation denounces before this General Assembly the programmes undertaken by the racist South African Government intended to establish nuclear bases on the southern part of the African continent, as well as the co-operation being given by other Western countries which produce nuclear bombs.\n161.\tGiven the growing tensions recently created on our continent, the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea in this Assembly appeals to all members of the international community to take note of the grave situation in Africa caused by the constant endeavour of the great Powers to dominate the \\\"continent, maintaining enormous military installations there, and by their desire to encourage the creation of military blocs and supply nuclear materials to certain African countries, all of which is a clear violation of General Assembly resolution 32/18 of 12 December 1977 on the denuclearization of Africa. We demand strict observance of that resolution so as to save the peoples of our continent from the danger of a thermonuclear war and the use of military bases established in Africa for aggressive purposes.\n162.\tAs regards the world economic situation, my Government expresses its concern about the effects of world inflation, monetary imbalances and the persistent-injustice in international economic and trade relations. It is our hope that the results of the first United Nations Conference on\nTechnical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held recently in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, which adopted the Programme of Action of Buenos Aires, will be fully complied with, so as to ensure balance in economic and technical relations among developing countries.\n163.\tAs regards economic relations between the industrialized and developing countries, new principles of justice and equity should be affirmed, as advocated for the new international economic order. My Government regrets the stagnation in the North-South dialogue resulting form the lack of political will on the part of the developed countries to attain the objectives sought by the establishment of a new international economic order [see resolution 3201 (S-V1)].\n164.\tIn the field of our economic relations with all the countries of the world, I should like to mention a shameful attitude against my country adopted by large Western capitalist companies which, in the middle of the twentieth century, have had recourse to piracy in their effort to strangle our national economy and thus weaken our democratic institutions. A United States company, owned by Messrs. Allotey, took from my country more than 1,000 tons of commercial cocoa\u2014and the operations were endorsed by the then United States Ambassador in . Malabo-valued at more than $US 3 million. A Dutch company, the property of a Mr. Fobman, also took out a cargo of more than 500 tons of commercial cocoa valued at more than $US 2 million. And, finally, a small capitalist company of imperialist Spain named El Goriaga carried out\na similar operation of commercial fraud in the piracy of some 500 tons of commercial cocoa. All those thefts committed in my country by those large Western companies have been made brought to the attention of the respective Governments and in the courts even high representatives of my Government have been present, but there has been no reaction from those large developed countries.\n165.\tIt is my Government's hope that the Governments concerned will take the measures necessary to recover the value of our products removed by their citizens. In the light of all this, we consider that the system applied by those countries against my country is not in accordance with the assistance framework that they advocate in this world Organization.\n166.\tInternally, I wish to point out that since the triumph of our revolution on 5 March 1969, which marked the beginning of the era of the colossal beginning of our total independence, when our great popular leader frustrated the attempt at a coup d'etat made by Spain and its Guinean lackeys, we have become masters of our own destiny, which has recorded revolutionary social transformation and radical changes in the colonial socio-economic structure of our nation and the life of our people, giving high value to the dignity inherent in the human being, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n167.\tAt this stage it is fitting to mention that the Government of Spain, resenting the colonial interests it lost\nin our country, has undertaken an international campaign - of discredit and defamation, completely lacking in any \nsubstance, against the People's Revolutionary Government of Equatorial Guinea, giving assistance to its unsuccessful Guinean lackeys, training them on their territory with the main objective of disturbing the peace and harmony of our people and continuing their anti-governmental activities against our regime.\n168.\tAfter the creation of our people's movement of the revolutionary masses, the Single National Labour Party, the fundamental task at the present stage of the combat which our heroic people are undertaking in accordance with our revolutionary policy is essentially to consolidate our independent policy, create national awareness for creative Work, defend our country, ensure the total and systematic elimination of all methods of exploitation, sabotage and blackmail of our vast natural resources, and conquer freedom, dignity and a genuinely African personality for the Guinean people which had been trampled underfoot by the Spanish colonial system for the purpose of perpetrating its domination and exploitation of our people.\n169.\tOur great people's movement of the revolutionary masses has established the bases for equality between men and women. In this respect, our Government welcomed with satisfaction the Convention on the Political Rights of Women [resolution 640 (VII)], Women in Equatorial Guinea have the same rights and duties as men and carry out their activities under the sponsorship of the National Organization of Women of Equatorial Guinea, called the Feminine Revolutionary Section.\n170.\tSenior Government officials of Western countries, Western newspapers and information media and private organizations have distributed throughout the world false reports, devoid of substance, that my Government does not respect the human rights of its own people. In this respect, although we know that they can say nothing in favour of our Government because they are incapable of coexisting with our revolution, I should nevertheless like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the following facts. First, the Popular Revolutionary Government of Equatorial Guinea has chosen its revolutionary course, which of necessity implies radical changes and in no way means disregard for the fundamental rights of human beings. Secondly, those who claim to defend human rights in our country are none other than those who oppose our revolutionary policy because they have had to give up their selfish interests and can no longer dominate our beautiful country. They cannot demand that we change our revolutionary course, which constitutes the reason for our popular aspirations, just as we cannot demand of them that they abandon their covetousness and their desire to dominate and exploit the \\\"world.\n171.\tNevertheless, we understand the reasons why terrorists pass themselves off as protectors of human rights in Equator id Guinea, since their political outlook is so totally divergent from that of our Popular Revolutionary Government. We understand them perfectly, because they cannot conceive of the idea that the Government of Equatorial Guinea is linked with countries of every political system and tendency- We are the friends of all, and we are opposed to those who oppose us.\n172.\tMy country welcomes with great satisfaction the celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of .Human Rights. We shall work for international co-operation to promote and respect civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. I wish to make it quite clear that in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea there are no problems of human rights and far less any persistent violation of them. The Constitution of Equatorial Guinea, which rules our country, guarantees in article II the equality of rights of all Guineans without discrimination for any reasons of race, sex, ethnic origin, religion or social status.\n173.\tIn conclusion, my Government confirms its loyalty to the purposes and principles of the United Nations as embodied in its Charter. The United Nations, despite the enormous difficulty of the problems it faces, has achieved many positive results in the maintenance of international peace and security and the elimination of colonialism and apartheid. We express our satisfaction that the United Nations has stood the test of time, has achieved quasi-total universality and has focused its attention on the primary needs of mankind, such as a change in the present injustices in international economic and political relations and the bringing about of a new system of world relations based on peace, justice and the equality of all countries and peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Bolivia, a country that has experienced the vicissitudes which characterize the history of the countries of the third world, has maintained and continues to maintain effective solidarity with all peoples that struggle against colonialism, covert foreign exploitation, neo-colonialism, racial discrimination and its\nmost repulsive manifestation, the inhuman system of apartheid.\n336.\tBolivia is, in fact, a non-aligned country. This is shown by its behaviour in defending the principles recognized by the international community and enshrined in the United Nations Charter.\n337.\tOn behalf of my Government and of the delegation which I lead, I wish to extend my congratulations to that illustrious humanist, Indalecio Lievano, on his election to guide the work of this Assembly and to express my thanks to Mr. Lazar Mojsov for the tact with which he conducted the deliberations at the previous sessions. Similarly, I wish to convey the gratitude which we all owe to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the devotion with which he puts his exceptional intellectual gifts at the service of the United Nations.\n338.\tA new Member has joined this Assembly and I welcome Solomon Islands, freed from the darkness of colonial domination, to work with us for a better world.\n339.\tBolivia, until now regarded rather negatively as a country with many contacts because of its situation in the centre of South America, is now something more since it emerges as a country of many attractions, such as catchments areas, communications systems and a system of economic integration which, if they are to gain strength and dynamism cannot, and must not, function without Bolivia which, despite its relative limitations, has great importance for the unity, peace and progress of the continent.\n340.\tEven countries outside the continent should consider these characteristics of Bolivia. In a world which is moving towards crisis because of the imbalance between population growth and the diminished production of food-stuffs and raw materials, Bolivia, if given the proper infrastructure, could be an exceptional provider and a centre of communications between north, south, east and west.\n341.\tThe continental importance of Bolivia is also reflected in its problems. Among them is its geographical position as a land-locked country, which is the result of a war of conquest which led to an ominous period of 100 years of limited sovereignty and development and material and psychological harm.\n342.\tIt would seem that, as if seeking to dispel that American nightmare and in order to awaken to a new century shining with honour and equity, the countries of Latin America, the United States and other countries throughout the world have given us support and a word of encouragement in our determination to recover the sea. I wish to take this opportunity at this rostrum to thank them on behalf of Bolivia and on behalf of America, because the Pacific conflict, which directly involves three countries, also affects the peace, integration and development of the entire continent.\n343.\tThe ideal of understanding among countries must be accompanied by minimum conditions agreed to\\\" by the parties in order to guarantee that it will not be left to the will of my one of them to make the decision with respect to fee goals and timing of the negotiating process.\n344.\tThe Government of Bolivia began its dialogue with Chile prompted by goodwill and the desire for co-operation. Contrary to the historical imperative which demands reparations equivalent to the damage done, Bolivia agreed to negotiate on the problem and strive to find a solution to it by a new approach that would be free from the resentment and the offence that divide peoples; to search in a pragmatic manner free of any mental reservation for a kind of intellectual and emotional understanding which would not mean further sacrifice of the territorial heritage of Bolivia.\n345.\tUnfortunately, we did not meet with the same spirit on the part of Chile, and the Government of my country was forced to end the negotiations in the face of a rigid, arrogant and dilatory attitude.\n346.\tBolivia has just emerged from a critical period in its hazardous democratic development. Dependency and under-development do not only affect the economy but also the political, cultural and social superstructure of the country.\n347.\tWe have a legal electoral system under which everyone is entitled to vote, but we do not have that degree of culture which would mean that everyone is capable of voting with due independence and awareness. Every era has had its contradictions, and the present is no exception.\n348.\tThe present Bolivian Government is unable-as indeed would be any other Government\u2014to force the pace of cultural development and maturity. What it can do is eliminate the legal defects and the corrupt practices which sully elections. It will do so, and has invited all political forces to take part in drafting the new legal texts. It is our wish and our hope that this determination will be received with equal sincerity by all sectors taking part in the next elections. We want world public opinion here represented to be assured that in Bolivia there will be an electoral process which will not only be clean but will be independent of foreign pressure and outside funding, without observers who, because of their commitments, add partiality to the elections. .We want Bolivian elections for the Bolivians.\n349.\tPresident Juan Pereda Asbun is the standard-bearer of national unity and democracy. That is what he has said, and that is what he does. He wishes to infuse an element of justice into national unity, and to give democracy an objectivity which will make it possible to eradicate sectarianism and demagogy. His Government has abrogated all oppressive decrees concerning the state of siege, compulsory civil service and the law of state security. He has restored to regular justice it usual independence. He has re-established the effectiveness of the political Constitution, and consequently the right of trade union organization and assembly.\n350.\tThe universities have been reopened and in complete sovereignty and independence, are electing their own authorities.\n351.\tSocial security has just been set up for rural and farm workers in order to help the most populous sector. There will be real rural and farm workers on the Administrative\nCouncil, thus carrying out the official promise to give the working classes participation in the steering and leadership bodies at the level of decision-making in State enterprises.\n352.\tThe armed forces of Bolivia are drawn from the people and share their ideals of unity and support the patriotic intention to build a real democracy.\n353.\tThe Council of Ministers is made up almost entirely of civilian representatives of major political forces.\n354.\tBolivia observes the most strict respect for human rights. It has supported and will support any measures necessary to preserve those rights. Human rights are enshrined in the very heart of the community: rights to food, housing, clothing, health, education, security, trade union organization and political organization are inseparable. If the nation as a whole does not enjoy independence or prosperity, it will be difficult for it to guarantee a balance between sovereignty and freedom, between public order and discontent.\n355.\tWhile contempt for human rights is unpardonable in poor countries, it is even more so in the rich countries which do not respect those rights on their own soil and do not offer the conditions for them to flourish elsewhere. Hence the distant origin of contempt for human rights should be sought in the rich countries. A just and sincere respect for human rights cannot but be accompanied by an attitude on the part of the most powerful countries in the world that indicates their renunciation of relationships which consolidate the dependence of the periphery on the centre, in other words, an attitude that must yield to a new world economic order.\n356.\tThe Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States Resolution 3281 (XXIX), together with the Declaration and Programme of Action designed to promote the establishment of an effective new international economic order (resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)], must be translated into effective measures to reduce as soon as possible the tremendous economic differences existing between the various countries and that furthermore contribute to the accentuation of the inequalities within any given country.\n357.\tWe have to create factors for development which make it possible for the low-income and medium-income countries to themselves meet the basic needs of their population without having recourse to paternalism, and therefore without being subjected to even greater dependence.\n358.\tCan the over-developed countries understand that their own stability is jeopardized if they do not help to create a new world economic order? There are indications of such an understanding, without doubt, but are they sufficiently encouraging?\n359.\tBolivia is taking part in many programmes of action for economic co-operation among countries. It understands the special importance of co-operation among countries with the same level of under-development and little technology, which is linked to a greater need to use manpower and the meagre capacity for accumulating capital which characterizes such countries.\n360.\tLike other rather backward nations, Bolivia is experiencing anxiety and dissatisfaction and is expressing this in forums, conferences, congresses and assemblies. It spends considerable sums of money and creates a lot of documentation\u2014as many other countries present here must also do\u2014, but the benefits which it obtains from this are not commensurate with the efforts made. There is still a great gap between theory and practice.\n361.\tWe cannot, nor do we wish to deny that we receive co-operation from American, Asian and European countries, which we really appreciate. Some programmes are programmes of support, but there are other very important programmes designed to change our economic structure and increase productivity, to find import substitutes and, what causes us the greatest concern, to increase exports, but to increase exports in terms of gainful trade free from distortions imposed by the central countries\u2014sometimes those already mentioned-which in the trading process easily retain the majority of the profits generated with great difficulty and at great cost by the raw-material-producing countries.\n362.\tThis happens in Bolivia, with an economy which is principally based on the export of minerals, the price of which is under pressure, both materially and psychologically, as a result of the presence of stocks built up during the Second World War to bolster a democracy which today is threatening to strangle us.\n363.\tOwing to the simple announcement in the House of Representatives of the United States of America of an authorization for the General Services Administration to put on the market part of 35,000 tons of tin from its strategic reserves, the price of tin has been radically affected because of the fear of a drop in the price such that Bolivia's economy will be adversely affected and its income reduced by something in the order of $20 million a year. How else can we describe that unilateral action of such a highly industrialized State towards a developing country except as economic aggression?\n364.\tA drop in income such as that diminishes the capability of the State to meet the needs of its people and, consequently, to provide for human rights. That is confirmed by the fact that the rich countries, which are always recommending respect for human rights, are those which cause the conditions that vitiate such rights.\n365.\tBecause of Bolivia's experience in this matter, we maintain constant solidarity with the third-world countries that are defending their natural resources in order to benefit from them, to exploit them for their own peoples and to obtain from them remunerative prices that will enable them, using their own efforts, heritage and patrimony, to meet the development challenges.\n366.\tGenerally speaking, the industrialized and financially powerful countries are not contributing, as it was hoped they would, to the over-all solution of serious economic problems that affect 80 percent of mankind. To try simply to amortize the effects of the present system they paralyse the process of negotiations, as happens in the case of the North-South dialogue.\n367.\tThe rather discouraging results of such negotiations are showing that there is still a lack of political will on the part of the great Powers significantly to increase the net transfer of real resources to the developing countries; in other words, to give back to them the contribution that they made to the progress of the great Powers. Furthermore, at a time when countries' economies are being weakened by lack of such contributions, they need that help and assistance to progress and survive; otherwise the world situation will become more dangerous, and even explosive, resulting in internal crises that can make for a serious threat to peace throughout the world,\n368.\tWe are sure of the importance of investments for countries with little internal savings. But we wish to reiterate that we categorically reject those practices of transnational corporations that have been described as corrupt in General Assembly resolution 3514 (XXX).\n369.\tBolivia gives priority to studies being carried out within the Economic and Social Council for the elaboration of a code of conduct for such companies. Among the standards and regulations we attach greatest importance to those conditions which are of a binding nature and must be established for the transfer of technology.\n370., Matters such as the breaking up of the technological package for the transfer of technology on advantageous terms for the developing countries, efficient international co-operation in adapting technology to the conditions peculiar to each country, and the development of intermediate technology must be regarded as of the highest priority - unless we want the gap between rich and poor countries to widen.\n371.\tThe benefits that could be derived from efficient official co-operation disappear because they go back to the countries of origin, favouring transnational companies. Monetary devaluation, escalation in prices and, in general, the effects of the crises fell on the poor economies. Because of the rising cost of financing particularly that of financing technology, very often excessive external indebtedness overwhelms us. None the less, we are deliberately paying a high price for the need to give impetus to our development.\n372.\tTechnology is a cultural asset accumulated throughout history. It is the outcome of the effort of mankind as a whole and, therefore, belongs to world patrimony. As such it should not be a subject of buying and selling. The United Nations should open a bank for the deposit of technology, available to as many countries as wish to use it for progress and peace.\n373. In this same conviction, we are aware that the sea offers wealth that can be the common heritage of mankind. Therefore, Bolivia has taken part with special interest in various meetings of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. It is sure that the convention which is being drafted in that body will make it possible to have an equitable participation for land-locked and otherwise geographically disadvantaged States in the profits of the exclusive economic zone and the sea-bed, which has been described as the common heritage of mankind.\n374.\tLatin America viewed with satisfaction the ratification of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) and it was my honour to sign it in Mexico on behalf of Bolivia. The denuclearisation of Latin America represents the first attempt at sanity and reasonableness in order to do away as soon as possible with a direct threat of nuclear war.\n375.\tOwing to the difficulty of creating useful instruments in favour of countries which do not have nuclear weapons, the international community has shown its fear for the power of potential destructiveness held by a few States and for the risk that faces all mankind because of those weapons.\n376.\tThe recent special session devoted to disarmament did not help to resolve the problem. Meanwhile, local wars not only do not disappear but are multiplying. New areas of tension are emerging even in our America, so that stable, active and solid peace seems to be drifting away, causing even greater misfortune for mankind.\n377.\tThere is also the persistently acute problem of the Middle East. We cannot but express our concern for the Arab territories which are still in Israel's possession as a result of armed conquest. We cannot but express also our concern for the just right of the Palestinian people to have a land in which to work for their own happiness; and we cannot but regret any difficulties and obstacles being placed in the way of Israel, as a member of the international community, being fully recognized as a State, something which should be achieved through co-operation in the praiseworthy attempt to give the Jewish people a sphere in which to have their own traditions, develop their own culture and forge their own progress. We express the wish that the Camp David agreements will finally result in a happy solution.\n378.\tWe are also concerned at the liberation struggle of the African peoples. We have invariably expressed our support for the independence of Namibia and Zimbabwe. We want to see real self-determination for those peoples which are still struggling against racism and neo-colonialism, so that Africa can achieve full sovereignty and freedom.\n379.\tWe are concerned also at the situation in Nicaragua. With the consensus of friendly countries we shall strive to re-establish peace, acting within the principles of the American regional system and the mandate of the United Nations Charter. But today our concern is even greater: the President of Costa Rica has denounced the violation of his country's territory. On behalf of Bolivia, I can do no less than strongly to condemn this fact.\n380.\tWe, the underdeveloped peoples, view with anguish the fact that we do not always have the power to decide for ourselves between war and peace. But our fate is dependent on change\u2014change which unfortunately cannot be discerned\u2014of an industrial structure based on the manufacture of weapons and subject to unilateral decisions of the large countries.\n381.\tWhatever positive results may have been achieved by the special session devoted to disarmament have been eroded by the virtual veto of the major nuclear Powers,\nsince they arrogate to themselves the power to seek prior consensus on the five new members to be elected to make up the new Committee on Disarmament.\n382.\tWe view with anguish and astonishment the increase in defence budgets year by year until they achieve fantastic proportions. Meanwhile, there are whole peoples in the world suffering from the scourge of famine and disease. Millions of children are condemned to death without having fully perceived the gift of life.\n383.\tSuch a situation could be alleviated if the United Nations established machinery to prevent conflicts which threaten peace. Potential problems would be foreseen and controlled before crisis point was reached. The capacity of the Organization would be strengthened to examine cases which do not always come to the surface but which cause insecurity, that in turn inclines Governments to spend money, ill-advisedly, on the acquisition of weapons with resources that are indispensable for peaceful development.\n384.\tI should like to point out that, despite this armaments race and the extravagant sums spent on war materiel, Bolivia devotes 30 per cent of its budget to education at all levels.\n385.\tUnarmed and situated in the midst of mountains, barred from access to the Pacific as a result of usurpation imposed against every principle of civilized co-habitation, Bolivia feels all the more strongly the threat of an arms race which is ever increasing.\n386.\tThe great Powers have the primary responsibility for creating the conditions necessary for the world to work in peace, without fear of total annihilation. At least part of the resources which are spent on the arms race\u2014$400 billion every year-should be set aside for co-operation to overcome backwardness, poverty, misery, disease and ignorance.\n387.\tThose are our principles, which are reflected in our present international conduct. This year we have reaffirmed in the Security Council our faith in the human race and our conviction that all men have the right to well being and freedom.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff69.\tMr. President, the annals of United Nations history show a long list of distinguished representatives of the Latin American group of nations who have made important contributions to the progress and development of our Organization. The current session of the Assembly has now, by electing you as its President, added another eminent name to that already impressive list. Your election, Sir, is indeed a manifestation of our high esteem for your outstanding qualities as a statesman and scholar, and this Assembly should indeed\ncongratulate itself for having you to guide its deliberations. My delegation would like to assure you of our full co-operation in the execution of the tasks entrusted to you in your high office.\n70.\tWith one regular session of the General Assembly and no less than three special sessions, the past year has indeed been a highly active and demanding one, not only for the Members of the Organization but particularly so for the outgoing President, Mr. Lazar Mojsov of Yugoslavia, who has discharged his responsibilities with great skill, patience and leadership, and has contributed substantially to whatever has been achieved during the past year. Mr. Mojsov's contributions will long be remembered with great appreciation by all who participated in those sessions.\n71.\tAs we enter the final decades of this century, we find ourselves at a crucial juncture in history. This is a time of rapid and often baffling changes, coupled with strenuous efforts for adjustment. It is a time of anxiety and disorientation, on the one hand, and opportunity and hope, on the other. In the midst of all this upheaval, the United Nations has not remained static; it has grown in size and complexity, and expanded its activities.\n72.\tThe growth of the United Nations towards universality was given additional emphasis by the accession of Solomon Islands to membership in our Organization. Indonesia would like to congratulate the people of Solomon Islands once again on the attainment of their independence and warmly welcome them to membership in the United Nations. Solomon Islands is one of our close neighbours in the south-west Pacific and we look forward to mutually fruitful co-operation between our two countries within and outside the United Nations system.\n73.\tIn the face of the rapidly changing world situation and the ever-increasing political and economic problems that the Organization is called upon to solve, the present machinery of the United Nations has often proved less than adequate. While recognizing the short-comings of our Organization, I would be the last to say that it is nothing but a list of unsolved problems; nobody can deny that the United Nations has its problems, but it is far from being a failure. Apart from its role in peace-keeping in various parts of the world, mention must be made of the numerous achievements of the United Nations in the field of peace-building, especially its operational activities for development. None the less the fact remains that it is time to undertake concerted and comprehensive efforts towards adapting the United Nations to the increasingly heavy demands placed upon it.\n74.\tAs we begin the work of another session we find ourselves confronted by many lingering problems and the sudden re-emergence of old issues long thought to have been resolved. The general feeling that 1978 could be a year of progress in such crucial areas as the Middle East, southern Africa, the implementation of the New International Economic Order, and negotiations on the law of the sea has not been fully realized as yet. Although some progress has been made, further delay in solving those and other problems not only makes finding solutions to them more difficult, but could also create serious consequences for the international community.\n75.\tAt the same time we cannot but view with dismay additional problems which have recently reappeared on the international horizon, such as the revival of bloc politics, the deterioration of detente and the return of certain aspects of the cold war. In short, the international situation today is fraught with grave uncertainties, thereby threatening the already fragile structure of international peace and security. In that light my delegation would like to underline the efforts of the non-aligned movement to overcome bloc divisions and to help create conditions more conducive to international peace, security, and general progress, as was again manifested by the results of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries held in Belgrade last July. The important contribution of the movement in convening the tenth special session, which was devoted to disarmament, and the results achieved at the session also merit mention.\n76.\tThe resurgence of a situation of conflict and tension in South-East Asia is a matter of grave concern to the region, which for more than one generation has been plagued by terrible bloodshed and immense suffering caused by a war inflicted upon it by outside Powers. After a short-lived peace another conflict has now emerged, this time between some countries in the region itself. It is in the interests of all nations in the region that peace should soon be restored so that they can devote their efforts to the task of national reconstruction and development.\n77.\tIt is my Government's sincere hope that all the nations in South-East Asia will soon be able to join hands in building a stable and peaceful region, in an atmosphere of peace, free from foreign interference and free from great-Power rivalry, so as to allow their peoples to progress together in freedom, dignity and common prosperity.\n78.\tThe South-East Asian scene is fortunately characterized not only by conflict but by other more propitious developments as well. The efforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] to establish a firm foundation for common action to accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development in its member countries have met with a large measure of success. ASEAN can now claim with justification that it has become a constructive force in the region. It has emerged as a dynamic entity which strives for peace, prosperity and stability, capable of opening new horizons for South-East Asia and the world at large.\n79.\tThe most important objective of ASEAN is the attainment and preservation of peace and stability in the area as a prerequisite for a continued and unhampered process of development in the region. It is within that framework that ASEAN member countries have reaffirmed their determination to continue their efforts towards establishing a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia. They have extended their hands in friendship and for mutually beneficial co-operation to their neighbours in the region.\n80.\tThe Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace was an important step in our efforts to reduce great-Power rivalry and tension in the various regions of the world. Since its adoption in 1971 the Declaration has received growing support from the Members of the United Nations. To our regret, however, no progress has been made towards its realization. Indonesia will continue to participate in the efforts made to achieve the implementation of that Declaration.\n81.\tThe tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament drew international attention to the problems of disarmament and reflected the desire of the international community to undertake measures through the United Nations to halt the arms race and to initiate the process of genuine disarmament.\n82.\tAs the Final Document of that session [resolution S-10/2] makes clear, mankind is confronted with a choice; either we halt the arms race and proceed to disarmament or we face total annihilation. It is nuclear weapons that pose the greatest danger to mankind and to the survival of civilization. Therefore, the immediate goal is the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and the beginning of effective measures aimed at nuclear disarmament. Efforts must be intensified at the current negotiations to achieve the complete cessation of the testing of nuclear weapons. The resolution of these issues by the newly-constituted Committee on Disarmament, with the participation of all nuclear Powers, would contribute significantly towards solving other issues of nuclear disarmament and arms control. At the same time that would pave the way towards establishing control of conventional arms which have lately become increasingly sophisticated and lethal and approach the destructive capacity of nuclear weapons.\n83.\tIn considering questions related to disarmament, we should be mindful not only of the physical and spatial aspects of the problem, but also of motivational ones. It will be necessary also to focus our attention on the' fundamental issues concerning the resolution of human conflicts. Through such an integrated approach, the process of disarmament can be dealt with in several of its aspects.\n84.\tThe situation prevailing in the Middle East still remains dangerous and highly explosive, posing a serious threat to international peace and security. That state of affairs is due to the persistence of Israel in its flagrant' denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people as recognized by the United Nations.\n85.\tIt is my Government's established position that the question of Palestine constitutes the core of the Middle East problem. There can be no just and lasting peace in the Middle East unless the Palestinian people can exercise their legitimate rights, including the right to return to their homeland and their right to self-determination and to establish a national State. In that respect, my delegation strongly supports the recommendations of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People [see A/33/35J. It is regrettable that the Security Council did not endorse them.\n86.\tAn additional problem of concern to many members of the international community is the status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, as well as the status of the holy shrines in Palestine. Because of its significance to three major world religions, Israel must respect the religious and historical status of the Holy City as well as its special characteristics. Jerusalem must be restored to Arab Islamic custody.\n87.\tAs regards the Cyprus question, my delegation hopes that an acceptable settlement will result from negotiations which recognize the legitimate aspirations of the two communities. We further hope that renewed efforts can be made towards the achievement of a peaceful settlement that would preserve the territorial integrity and independence of Cyprus as a non-aligned country in which the two communities can live together in peace and harmony.\n88.\tThe situation in Namibia continues to warrant our grave concern. Our hope that at last the Namibian question was within sight of a peaceful solution appears to have been premature. South Africa's rejection of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia is another in a long series of condemnable acts by the Pretoria regime aimed at frustrating the achievement of genuine independence by the people of Namibia. My delegation condemns this act of South Africa aimed at nullifying the progress made by the United Nations so that it can continue its domination and exploitation of the Territory. Indonesia will continue to support the struggle of the Namibian people, of which SWAPO is the authentic representative, for sovereignty and independence within the entire Territory of South West Africa, including Walvis Bay.\n89.\tEqually disturbing is the worsening situation in Zimbabwe, where the illegal Smith regime remains adamant in the face of the changing realities in that territory. It is in this light that I reiterate Indonesia's support for Security Council resolution 423 (1978)-endorsed by the OAU, the front-line States and the Patriotic Front-condemning the so-called internal settlement. The settlement of the problem of Zimbabwe should be based on the relevant United Nations resolutions, which provide for free and impartial elections on the basis of universal suffrage, United Nations supervision of such elections and the participation in them of all groups. In this context I should like to call upon the international community to tighten and expand existing economic sanctions in force against the Smith regime. I should also like to remind the international community that the struggle in Zimbabwe has forced thousands of people in that Territory to flee to the surrounding States, a fact that has created financial hardships for the States bordering Zimbabwe.\n90.\tThe situation in South Africa has continued to worsen as the apartheid regime in Pretoria has continued to carry out its policy of institutionalised racism. Indonesia would like to reaffirm once again its support for the people of South Africa in their fight for their right to self-determination and against apartheid. Indonesia supports any and all positive steps directed at the isolation of the Pretoria regime, in particular, arms and economic embargoes. My delegation calls upon South Africa to cease all persecution of opponents of its apartheid policy. Furthermore, Indonesia would like to reaffirm its support for the United Nations Trust Fund for South Africa.\n91.\tThe Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea constitutes one of the most delicate and complex international endeavours yet undertaken. The Conference's mandate is to lay down a new and just international legal order of the oceans to be contained in one comprehensive convention. Indonesia, as an archipelagic State, situated at the cross-roads between two continents and two oceans,\nattaches great importance to the successful outcome of the Conference.\n92.\tThe seventh session of the Conference ended a few weeks ago. Since the second session in Caracas in 1974, results have on the whole been positive, and significant progress has been made in many areas. Of course, certain hard-core issues have yet to be resolved, and we hope that the forthcoming session, to be held in Geneva next year, will complete the informal negotiations in order that we may proceed with a formal text.\n93.\tMy delegation wishes to express its full support for the statement made by the Chairman of the Group of 77 during the last session of the Conference concerning unilateral legislation on the exploitation of deep sea-bed resources,5 because such an attempt would only jeopardize the conclusion of the convention as a whole.\n94.\tAs the work of the Conference on the Law of the Sea is nearing its final stages, the time has now come to give more serious attention to the problems relating to outer space. In the context of rapidly developing technology, the peaceful uses of outer space have assumed growing importance against the background of increased activities and continued advances in the exploration of outer space. Several of these activities have extended the frontiers of space. This has resulted in a number of problems with far-reaching implications for the international community. Among them is the question of geostationary orbits, which arc- of great importance not only to space Powers but also to the equatorial and other States. While progress has been achieved in some areas, agreement on other outstanding issues has continued to elude us. Indonesia regards international co-operation as the only way to promote the peaceful uses of space and space technology and an enhanced role for the United Nations as the focal-point of such co-operation.\n95.\tIt has become a truism that the changes and portents that beset the world's political sphere will affect in an equal manner the world's economic scene. In view of the interrelationship and interplay of major global problems, there can be no lasting peace so long as economic imbalances and injustices prevail. The challenge of redressing these injustices has become a task of urgent relevance, since it will have a critical bearing on the fate of mankind.\n96.\tThe world has come to realize that the demands of equity and justice require fundamental changes in the international economic system to assure the developing countries of fuller participation in international economic activity and an equitable share of its benefits. This perception found its expression in the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)]. For more than four years the international community has been engaged in negotiations concerning the fundamental restructuring of international economic relations. These negotiations have produced only\n5 See Official Records of the Third United Nations Conference or the Law of the Sea, vol. IX (United Nations publication. Sales No. E.79.V.3), 109th plenary meeting.\nmeagre and limited results. While there has been a growing realization of the interdependence and mutuality of interest and the need for structural changes, this has not been matched by commensurate practical action on the part of the developed countries.\n\n97.\tWe are witnessing a slowing down in world economic activities and world trade along with the re-emergence of protectionist policies in some major industrialized countries. These inward-looking policies have rendered the process of negotiation more difficult and made the attainment of the goals of negotiations set out at the seventh special session elusive.\n98.\tIt was therefore with a particular sense of disappointment and genuine concern that we noted the failure of the resumed session of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, also known as the Committee of the Whole, to agree on the mandate and the functions of the Committee, which has precluded its finalizing its work in the area of the transfer of resources. My delegation would like to reaffirm the importance it attaches to the involvement of the United Nations system in the negotiations on economic issues of a global nature and the need for providing them with a central body which would serve as a negotiating body for the adoption of guidelines on central policy issues and the achievement of agreement on the resolution of fundamental and crucial issues related to international economic relations. It is our earnest hope that the General Assembly will be in a position to confirm in an unambiguous manner the right of the Committee to negotiate with a view to reaching agreements without in any way pre-empting the functions of other United Nations bodies. The supremacy of the United Nations system in regard to all negotiations relating to the establishment of the New International Economic Order should also be affirmed.\n99. We are heartened to note that this concern is shared by a large number of countries in the United Nations. We are on the threshold of important negotiations which will have a critical bearing on our endeavours towards the successful creation of a more just and equitable world economic order. The UNCTAD negotiating conference on the common fund6 will be resumed shortly, and the multilateral trade negotiations have reached their final stages. It is of vital importance that these negotiations be concluded successfully in order to bring about a substantial improvement in the international trade of the developing countries. The successful conclusion of these negotiations would not only facilitate the work of the forthcoming fifth session of UNCTAD in Manila in May 1979 but would also have a very positive impact on its outcome and on the North-South dialogue in general.\n100. Other important tasks that immediately lie ahead of us are, among others, the preparation of the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development, to be held in Vienna in 1979, and the further preparation and elaboration of the new international development strategy which will impinge on our efforts to realize the New International Economic Order. While much\nof the substance and approach of the previous strategy remains valid, the new strategy should have as its conceptual framework the establishment of the New International Economic Order and the promotion of collective self-reliance.\n101.\tIt is our strong belief that the United Nations is, with all its present inadequacies, still the only Organization which can bring peace, prosperity and progress in our present-day imperfect world. For this purpose the entire membership of the United Nations should unite its efforts towards making the Organization a more effective vehicle for the pursuit of our common purposes and for keeping alive our faith in a better future for mankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Our general debate provides us with the opportunity to reiterate the faith of the Mexican people and Government in the world Organization as the ideal instrument for maintaining peace, to formulate a periodic appraisal of how the international community has complied with the principles embodied in the United Nations Charter, and to examine new methods or correct our course in order more effectively to address ourselves to the changing challenges of our modern world.\n91.\tIt is with satisfaction that we see an illustrious son of Latin America, Mr. Indalecio Lidvano Aguirre, presiding over our work, especially since until a few days ago he was the distinguished Foreign Minister of our sister Republic of Colombia, with which Mexico maintains traditional as well as close ties of identity.\n92.\t\\\"International relations in our time constitute the art and science of the survival of mankind\\\"\u2014these words are by Karl W. Deutsch of Harvard.\n93.\tThe signs of our times appear to be contradictory. Speed and mobility give man unprecedented perspectives. We are constantly amazed by our progress in science, which geometrically widens our present and future. But as human beings, we have as yet been unable to dominate the art and science of survival without violence, terrorism, repression, injustice and exploitation.\n94.\tWe constantly hear expressions of peace in international forums, but the truth is that each day man prepares himself more for war, both nuclear and conventional. Instead of peace, we enthrone aggression.\n? Much propaganda is made for the unity of mankind, but in- reality people continue to divide themselves by area, region, power and economic and social level. We live submerged in the search for solutions to age-old problems, but we neglect to use truth as an instrument in that search. This ambitious and insincere attitude prevents us from finding the formula for putting an end to misery, hunger, sickness, injustice, violence and terror.\n96.\tThe truly as yet unstudied continent is that of man himself, and he has been unable to channel or sublimate his aggressiveness. Even more, science and technology, which should .be the servants of mankind, continue to be perfected for man's destruction.\n97.\tThis situation is even more disturbing when we realize\nthat in just over 21 years we shall be entering a new\ncentury, the twenty-first, that is unrelentlessly approaching\nwithout us having found solid, collective solutions. How\nshall we meet it? What problems will we have to resolve?\nAre we on the right road? Must we urgently correct our\ncourse, especially here in this universal forum? \n98.\tIf we cannot influence the course and future of our lives, and in so doing improve upon the legacy we ourselves inherited, we shall doubtless have failed.\n99.\tThe challenge that man must meet is not only to change the reality surrounding him, but to obtain the collaboration of every human being in the solution of national and supranational problem. In this sense, we are all the solution. No one can be isolated from what happens to another human being elsewhere on our globe.\n100.\tTherefore, we must formulate a programme and a strategy to meet the challenge, identifying a series of effective, successive and, if necessary, parallel measures which can lead us to our final goal: the achievement of a world in which peace with justice, physical and mental health and the self-realization of man in liberty and justice, individually and socially, all prevail, in short, a world in which our children can enjoy life to the full with peace and without anguish. This is the supreme, and perhaps a Utopian, human ideal.\n101.\tThat is why our impatience grows. We are fully convinced, as the Constitutional President of Mexico, Jose Lopez Portillo, has said, that it is very important to avoid war, but that is not sufficient; we must win peace in the dynamic rather than passive sense, and resolve the vital needs of the development, nutrition, health, education, employment, housing, and security of man. These problems, according to our President, become even more serious when we observe that the great Powers, having solved their basic problems of survival, are interested only in expanding their spheres of influence, thus provoking conflicts or manipulating them according to their whims and convenience.\n102.\tIn this important task of winning peace, we have never expected the entire responsibility to rest exclusively with the world Organization nor with the international community as a whole. Rather, we recognize and accept the simultaneous obligation each country has to take adequate measures in order that the ideals of peace and social justice to which we all aspire may become reality.\n103.\tLast year we were privileged to outline for this body' some of the major reforms to the Mexican governmental system which President Lopez Portillo announced upon taking office on 1 December 1976. It is with satisfaction that I can now inform you that the \\\"Alliance for Production\\\" programme, which I described in my statement last year, is well on its way towards guaranteeing the minimum social benefits and services needed by my country; that the political reform has widened the representation of my people; that the administrative reform has begun the process towards complete reorganization; that the economic reform, including a fiscal reform to redistribute income, has established new wage, profit, price, credit, savings and monetary policies; that we have given priority in our development plans to food and sources of energy; and that all these changes, both proposed and achieved, constitute in sum the social reform fought for in the first social revolution of this century, the Mexican\nRevolution, the aspirations of which are embodied in the \\\"Magna Carta\\\" currently guiding my country.\n104.\tTo sum up: Mexico is one of the few countries of our continent with a democratic system in which freedom prevails, with a stable Government, and with great human and natural resources.\n105.\tOur daily production of crude oil and derivatives is already 1.4 million barrels and the amounts of our reserves indicate that they have increased proven reserves to 20 billion barrels; probable reserves to 37 billion barrels; and potential reserves to 200 billion barrels. This constant increase in our resource inventory has obliged us to make rapid changes in our short-, medium- and long-term oil programmes.\n106.\tThese important hydrocarbon reserves, which fully guarantee Mexico's present and future, constitute energy giving Mexico solid international credit and confidence. In this sense Mexico uses its petroleum not only as a guarantee for its development and financing, but, rather, in order to explore, manage and carefully safeguard these energy resources which were nationalized by President Lazaro Cardenas in 1938 and which are now, according to article 27 of our Constitution, the exclusive property of the Mexican people.\n107.\tMexico's international relations stand on solid ground. This is the result of the confidence which reigns in Mexico, both internally and externally and, as we have repeated on numerous occasions in this forum, of our support and respect for the principles of self-determination, non-intervention, sovereign equality and the peaceful settlement of disputes. We offer friendship and co-operation to all peoples of the world and, in accordance with the golden rule of human relationships, we shall never ask of another nation that which we, in equal circumstances, would not be willing to give.\n108.\tOur bilateral relations have increased at all levels. In particular, the President of Mexico has received and visited several heads of State and will shortly be travelling on state visits to the People's Republic of China and Japan. Of the 150 States Members of this Organization, Mexico maintains diplomatic relations with 134 and we are constantly in the process of revising the mechanisms and agreements which link us in order to see what has been done and evaluate what new possibilities exist for their improvement.\n109.\tWe, who are a part of Latin America feel deeply everything that happens to its peoples. We are involved in its economic, technological, communications and development problems. We are hurt by its suffering, needs, oppressions and miseries. That is why we must try to unite Latin America in substance, eliminating where possible our differences and emphasizing our common interests; because of similar languages, historical affinities and sociological coincidences, we must eliminate the mental reservations that separate us.\n110.\tWe are convinced that Latin America's common destiny is to become a zone of peace in which beings may enjoy well-being in freedom and justice, as a global strategy that imposes, through a process of\nconviction, rights and obligations on all States. In the struggle towards this goal, our nations have had to confront a series of very uneven forces. For three centuries we suffered under colonialism and even once independence had been attained Latin America continued to be dependent and to be exploited by new forms of hegemony. Other problems, some of which have degenerated into conflicts, derive from geographical proximity and living together, and sometimes from alien interests that foster our disunity. Even the way in which certain differences have been resolved in the past has planted the seeds of injustice. Latin America has had to meet problems of definition, during which violence has become part of a vicious circle of governmental oppression provoked by violence, which, in turn, engenders more violence and the polarization of interests and ideologies.\n111.\tAnother phenomenon which appears to hold true for Latin America is that we are not given the importance we deserve; we are not well understood and we understand ourselves even less. Our communications of all kinds are deficient, and we are seldom taken into account. This is our fault: we must ring our own bell, especially in the positive aspects.\n112.\tNonetheless, the results seem positive. Latin America has given signs of political will in its efforts towards integration, of willingness to resolve its common problems in an open dialogue and settle its disputes by peaceful means. We have been able almost totally to eliminate the economic blockade against a penalized sister nation, and we have made the decision to keep our territories free of nuclear weapons through the Treaty of Tlatelolco10 and the recent Latin-American initiatives to impose restrictions or limitations on the transfer and use of certain conventional weapons.\n113.\tIn these efforts we have had the active participation of the Caribbean group of countries, which in recent years has shaken off the yoke of colonialism. Our cultural, linguistic or idiosyncratic differences have not been an obstacle to our sharing the desire for peace, which we are determined to make a reality in our region.\n114.\tFor unforeseen or other reasons, our ties of friendship and co-operation with these countries have not been as strong as we should have liked. According to the guidelines established by the President, Mexico is determined to strengthen even more the links of brotherhood and friendship which happily exist between our peoples and Governments with new initiatives designed to establish a closer and more fruitful framework of co-operation.\n115.\tTo sum up: Latin America is an important continent with 300 million inhabitants, an enormous potential market, incredible natural resources, tourism, wide open spaces, jungles, oceans, culture, handicrafts and history. We are missing only one thing: unity, to defend our common interests and live in peace.\n116.\tWe have historical and intimate ties with our sister nation of Nicaragua. Its tragedy during the past few weeks, its violence, the loss of innocent lives, the mass violations of\nhuman rights according to several sources- and of the fundamental rights of civilian populations during armed conflict, have affected us as if they were our own. Mexico deplores and censures these acts and would like to see a democratic, tree and socially just expression of the will of the people of Nicaragua, as it would for those of all countries of the world.\n117.\tIn the Nicaraguan situation we have acted, and will continue to act, according to the fundamental principles of our foreign policy, notably the obligation not to intervene in the internal affairs of another State and the need to respect the right of all peoples to self-determination. However, the strict observance of these principles must not and cannot be interpreted as implying or meaning indifference, or lack of sensitivity to the anguish and suffering of the Nicaraguan people.\n118.\tIn addition, within the OAS, we have presented proposals aimed at stopping the bloodshed and re-establishing peace in this sister Republic. All this has been done within a strict legal framework, in the search for mechanisms aimed at giving civilian populations adequate protection in times of armed conflict and respecting individual guarantees recognized by several international instruments.\n119.\tAnother problem which worries Mexico is the future of Belize. We maintain our conviction that resolution 32/32, adopted by the Assembly last year by an overwhelming majority, is the best legal basis for any solution. In it, express recognition was given to the obligation of the States directly involved to consult with other interested States in the area so that the people of Belize can achieve, through peaceful means, their self-determination and independence, with full respect for their territorial integrity, which is the best legal basis for any solution. Mexico has shown a special interest in what occurs in this neighbouring Territory and will continue to participate in any consultations, guided by the principles and purposes of our Organization and by the principles of good neighbourliness and brotherhood that link us to Guatemala.\n120.\tAs a gesture of solidarity with the Panamanian people, Mexico's President accepted an invitation from the Chief of the Junta of Panama' to attend the ceremony at which the instruments of ratification of the Panama Canal treaties were exchanged. On that occasion, the Chief Executive of my country reiterated Mexico's support for the Panamanian people in their struggle to exercise unrestricted sovereignty over their entire territory.\n121.\tAn important area of world conflict in which all the principles incorporated in the United Nations Charter\u2014self-determination, non-use of force and peaceful settlement of disputes-are now involved, because of hegemonic, territorial, natural resources and ideological interests, is the problem of the Middle East, which still constitutes the gravest threat to international peace.\n122.\tFor this reason, our Organization has an inescapable and basic responsibility to keep the problem under constant review and to attempt to resolve it by formulating recommendations leading to a stable peace in the area on just and equitable foundations.\n123.\tHaving said this, we should not in any way be inhibited from supporting parallel efforts which may be made outside the United Nations in the search for a solution which, obviously, will be viable only if it takes into account the interests, of all the parties directly involved. It is based on resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the United Nations Security Council and other resolutions adopted by the United Nations relating directly to this question, on which Mexico has clearly explained its position and which must not remain a dead letter.\n124.\tWithin this strict context and recognizing that all efforts towards peaceful settlement of disputes are worthy of praise, we consider that the Camp David framework agreements of 17 September may constitute an important step towards the common objective of achieving a more peaceful and just world, as long as they fulfil the requirements I have mentioned.\n125.\tCyprus is one of the concrete examples of the weakness of the international Organization in reaching a just peace, and constitutes proof of the need for us to address ourselves to changing the situation. It is a country whose territory continues to be under partial occupation by foreign troops, with a consequent displacement of its inhabitants, in disregard of a concept valid long before the San Francisco Conference, which created this Organization: conquest does not give rights.\n126.\tAlthough my Government would have preferred that negotiations on Namibia be conducted within the framework of the United Nations, we have respected those efforts that did not meet this requirement because we felt that they were useful in leading to rapid self-determination for the Namibian people. It is with sadness that we today take note of their failure. Notwithstanding the significant concessions made by SWAPO in order to achieve a peaceful solution, the South African Government has once again rejected any solution based on the free self-determination of the Namibian people.\n127.\tWe profoundly regret that, as a result of the intransigence of the Republic of South Africa, these efforts have proved in vain. My Government is ready to support all measures, including sanctions, that this Organization may consider in order to put an end to the illegal occupation exercised by South Africa over this Territory.\n128.\tThe prospects offered to the people of Zimbabwe are not those of peaceful transition. All efforts towards this end have failed, given the constant hair-splitting of a privileged minority. My Government ratifies its strict observance of the sanctions imposed by the Security Council against the minority regime, as well as the resolution adopted by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples on this item, which is aimed at strengthening and widening them. \n129.\tWorld peace cannot be based on a balance of terror, nor does any national or supranational economic or political instrument hold the key to the future, or h' the right to exercise trusteeship over history or constitute elf as our planet's guardian.\n130.\tWe make an appeal to the super-Powers to continue to seek agreements among themselves which will contribute to the strengthening of world peace within a process which can be identified as peaceful coexistence, reduction of tension, detente or simple plain common sense. It would seem that this process of mutual understanding has recently been weakened.\n131.\tLet us always remember that it is man's survival that is at stake, and not only that of their respective peoples. Let us ardently hope that their dialogue is fruitful and is channelled through the United Nations.\n132.\tIn the Yalta Agreements of 1945 the super-Powers gave the United Nations a specific task in the maintaining of peace which they now seem to regret. Mexico thinks that we must adopt a course of reason and not one of alienation which may lead to universal destruction.\n133.\tThe Government which I am honoured to represent maintains among its objectives the attainment of internal economic and social justice, and strives towards its achievement internationally. This goal will be met only with full compliance with the new international economic order as defined by the United Nations. For this we require both the political will of the developed nations, as well as the efforts of those which, like my own, are still in the development process.\n134.\tEconomic justice has several definitions: it is both individual and social, as well as political justice; it is peace, respect, tranquillity and stability. We can no longer live in a world of rich and poor, of exploiters and exploited, of North and South. The strong must understand that their own survival depends on the respect for other's economies.\n135.\tWithin this process we have identified priorities, programmes and strategies for our development as follows: We have maintained our immutable desire to give raw materials their real value. We are not, and never will be undermined by those who, like ourselves are struggling toward this end. It is a fundamental part of the New International Economic Order for which we are fighting. Mexico's position clearly shows our determination to continue in the search for world justice and equity.\n136.\tWe participated enthusiastically in the process leading to the adoption of resolution 32/174, which created the Committee of the Whole entrusted with supervising the Implementation of the new international economic order. We regret that to date this effort has failed.\n137.\tIn the light of that situation, I avail myself of the opportunity given me by the highest organ in the United Nations system to launch a strong appeal to the Governments of developed countries to heed the just demands of the overwhelming majority of countries, and thus comply with relevant agreements by giving new life to open negotiation, in good faith, aimed at eliminating the obstacles that still prevent the full introduction of order in economic relations and the attainment of the justice so desperately desired by mankind.\n138.\tIn other areas of social interest we have continued simultaneous efforts both within and outside my country. \nshould like to make special mention of the support we have given to the preparatory activities for the International Year of the Child, for which we have established a Mexican Committee composed of members at the highest level of the three branches of the Mexican Government. We reiterate our commitment to support these efforts internally through the activities undertaken by the National System for the Integral Development of the Family.\n139.\tWe consider that the results of the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament mark the beginning of a new phase of United Nations efforts in this field. For the first time in its history, the General Assembly gave the question of disarmament the exclusive attention and importance it deserves.\n140.\tThe Final Document adopted at that session must be implemented, and, based on it, agreements relating to the prohibition of all nuclear-weapon tests, chemical warfare and reduction of offensive strategic weapons, the second and third series of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, must be worked out. In addition, other nuclear-weapon-free zones must be established on the basis of agreements freely arrived at between States of the region concerned, and taking into account the Latin-American experience with the Treaty of Tlatelolco.\n141.\tThese measures, together with a reduction in military budgets and the reallocation of such resources to meet the developmental and nutritional needs of the peoples, will have to be included in a comprehensive disarmament programme, the negotiation of which should now begin and on which Mexico has already made a proposal.11 In addition, several important improvements have been made in the disarmament negotiating machinery, including something long advocated by Mexico, the abolition of the co-chairmanship, which we had tried for a decade to bring about. We express the hope that they will mean, in the near future, the participation of China and France in the newly-created organs.\n142.\tAs a decisive step towards general and complete disarmament under effective international control, progress must also be made in the field of conventional weapons. In this respect, it is with satisfaction that I inform you that, following instructions of my country's President, Jose Lopez Portillo, Mexico has undertaken several concrete initiatives on this matter, which have been well received.\n143. As for the regional field we can point to important progress with respect to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, leading to the signature by the Soviet Union, during my President's visit to that country, of Protocol II to the Treaty, and the announcement of its early ratification by the Soviet Union. That step, together with France's declaration that it will soon sign Protocol, means that our international instrument, which for several years seemed only a dream, is now a reality and an example to the rest of the world.\n144.\tThe Treaty is now in force for 22 States of the region, and Protocol I, which establishes the obligation of States with territorial possessions in the area of application not to introduce nuclear weapons therein, has been ratified\nby the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and has been signed by the United States of America. Protocol II, which contains the obligation by nuclear Powers to respect the Treaty itself, is in force for the People's Republic of China, the United States of America, France and the United Kingdom.\n145.\tWe wish to make a fraternal appeal to the only remaining country in Latin America which, by its express political will, has neither signed nor ratified it yet and to that nation which has signed but not ratified it, to re-examine their positions and allow us, once the Treaty is fully enforced, to begin the second stage: the development of regional nuclear energy for exclusively peaceful purposes on the basis of the Treaty of Tlatelolco. In this connexion, the Organization for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America has already requested an inventory of our countries' nuclear technology needs.\n146.\tFurthermore, basing themselves on the recommendations of the special session on disarmament, 20 Latin-American countries have begun a historic effort, inspired by the Declaration of Ayacucho13 and by the desire to share a common destiny in peace. Responding to an invitation from my Government, scarcely a month ago they met in Mexico City in order to identify a series of basic questions on which this important dialogue should continue, and it was decided to recommend to our respective Governments, among other measures, the establishment of flexible consultative machinery open to the participation of all States from the Latin-American and Caribbean region. This machinery would permit, inter alia, studies and recommendations on the possible limitation of the transfer of certain types of conventional weapons to Latin America or the Caribbean, as well as among the countries of the area, in addition to studies and recommendations concerning the establishment of limitations and/or prohibitions on the use of certain types of conventional weapons which are considered excessively harmful and/or are of an indiscriminate nature.\n147.\tAs can be seen, Mexico has gone ahead with the \\\"first Tlatelolco'', military denuclearization, and is now going on to what we might call the \\\"second Tlatelolco\\\", conventional weapons, in line with its political commitment to convert Latin America, by common effort, into a zone of peace-that is, riot only the absence of war, but the full development of the region.\n148.\tI should like, however, to clarify that any regional self-limitation does not in any way imply \\\"to disarm the disarmed\\\". It must be part of a global programme implying the adoption of Universal measures on the non-transfer of conventional weapons and the use of others whose effects are excessively cruel and indiscriminate, always based on the concept that the possibility of armed conflict can be reduced by reducing the level of armaments to the point necessary for the internal security of each country. In the past, arming oneself has never been an effective deterrent to avoiding an armed attack; quite the contrary. The excessive concentration of arms can be counter-productive, arousing suspicions and mistrust and provoking an unlimited arms race. The only effective measure to avoid war is, in our\nopinion, to strengthen the confidence of possible opponents and to strengthen security mechanisms.\n149.\tAs a second step in the aforementioned regional efforts, on 12 September of this year, during the Preparatory Conference for the United Nations Conference on Prohibitions or Restrictions of Use .f Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, held in Geneva, the Government of Mexico presented \\\"a preliminary outline of a general and universally applicable treaty on conventional weapons\\\" [A/33/44, annex, sect. H], consisting of a global agreement and a series of optional protocols covering specific weapons. We hope that that proposal, together with those presented jointly by my country and others, which are necessarily complementary, on weapons such as napalm and other incendiary weapons, fragmentation bombs, small-calibre munitions with especially lethal effects, land mines and other weapons, may serve as a basis for negotiations in good faith on this important item. I should like to point to the important contribution made by the Mexican armed forces, through the Ministries of National Defence and the Navy, in the elaboration of those proposals, which we shall continue to pursue tirelessly until they are successfully adopted. In the future, we shall propose certain measures in the corresponding forum regarding the grave problem of arms transfers.\n150.\tOn this occasion we reiterate our firm decision to utilize our resources for development and, under express instructions from the President of the United Mexican States, I commit the Government of my country not to use any resources which we may soon have as a result of our petroleum reserves to acquire or construct any type of weapons, especially those on which we have made proposals regarding prohibition or restriction.\n151.\tOne of the most ambitious United Nations projects which may give mankind some of its greatest benefits is the eight-year-old effort to draft a new law of the sea. Mexico, together with many other countries, is seriously worried about the possibility that this enormous collective effort might be frustrated by the unilateral action of one or more States in allowing the exploitation of the deep sea-bed by their nationals.\n152.\tWe firmly believe that the Declaration of Principles adopted by this General Assembly in 1970 [resolution 2749 (XXV)] represents the true and authorized expression of international law on this subject. The common heritage of mankind can be exploited for the benefit of all only within a regime internationally agreed to by all States; therefore the unilateral exploitation of those resources would be contrary to international law. In addition it would constitute an insurmountable obstacle to a general consensus on the law of the sea. An overwhelming majority of States support that point of view, and consequently we add our voice to the appeal made by all those States in order that any country contemplating such unilateral action should desist from it.\n153.\tBetween 1945 and today mankind has suffered 119 armed conflicts, with an increasing number of civilian victims, despite the prohibition on the use of force except in cases of self-defence.\n154.\tWe firmly believe that international action to regulate activities in case of war is also a way of advancing die cause of the protection of human rights, especially since we cannot conceive of those rights as purely political ones in abstract terms but rather as a body of social, political and economic rights for the true benefit of mankind. Why should we exclude the right not to suffer needlessly in conflict, which is after all the purpose of international humanitarian law, to the development of which we are committed?\n155.\tMexico's historic tradition in the defence of human lights with a social emphasis goes back more than a century and a half, to Morelos. We feel that there are many ways of fighting for the adequate protection of those rights and in this context, in addition to those already begun, several courses of action must be taken in the search for a more just and equitable order. Who can be note deprived of basic human rights than those who lack education, a roof over their heads, or health? Who can have fewer rights than a person who barely survives, in conditions of extreme misery? Are not the right to information, for example, or the rights of workers as well as the right to work, also guaranteed? Are not the human rights of a worker violated when, as a victim of socio-economic conditions, he crosses a border in search of better conditions and is persecuted, and his most elementary human rights are violated?\n156.\tOn other occasions we have spoken of the need to elaborate a code of conduct in which the rights of migratory workers could be set forth. We now present that suggestion to the Assembly in the hope that it also might be useful in advancing the international protection of human rights.\n157.\tDuring the last meeting of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization we reiterated our conviction that we find ourselves at a crossroads. We must decide whether we want our Organization to continue to be viable or not. While some Members consider the United Nations as a static mechanism of conferences convened in order to permit dialogues on conflicts of interest or ideology, supported by a Secretariat which, far from serving the community interests, represents the principal ideologies in the struggle, others, fortunately the majority, conceive of the Organization as a dynamic instrument through which Governments seek conciliation of their, differences, and as the best mechanism for preventing conflicts and resolving them when they occur.\n158.\tThe validity of this assertion is obvious even in our times. The first option becomes even more complicated when we see the apparent apathy on the part of many Member States regarding the work of the Organization itself. This allows many negotiations to become a mere game of personal interests at times. The first hypothesis is based on nationalistic criteria of the past, while the second is based on today's and tomorrow's needs in an ever more dynamic world where there is a daily increase in the number of countries that possess weapons of unknown destructive force.\n159.\tFaced with those alternatives, Mexico has made efforts to strengthen the Organization. We believe that in\nthe Committee on the Charter-and in this we support the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim we should not limit ourselves to mere examination of amendments to that instrument but should also look , Questions that do not require constitutional changes but which can improve the mechanisms for the maintenance of International peace and security. To that end we have introduced a series of proposals among which I should like to emphasize the 11 principles of Mexico for the elaboration of a general declaration on peaceful settlement of disputes as a first step towards the possible conclusion of a treaty on the subject, in which we logically suppose that all the efforts and difficulties faced by the United Nations in that area in the past viii be taken into account.\n160.\tOur proposal was introduced considering that the peaceful settlement of disputes is one of the weakest areas of the activities of the United Nations. That proposal has been complemented by others, among which we can mention the elimination of the so-called \\\"enemy States\\\" clause in Articles 53 and 107 of the San Francisco Charter, a maximum limitation on veto application in the Security Council, an appeal to nations that all matters relating to international peace be dealt with within the context of the Organization, as well as other measures to rationalize working methods which could eliminate the current waste of man-hours and energy.\n161.\tRecognizing the implications of those proposals, we shall invite those States especially interested in the work of the Committee on the Charter to hold consultations before the next meeting of that subsidiary body in order to determine, among other things, the viability of the proposals so far introduced.\n163. Mexico wants to live in peace with all nations on earth, always sustaining its principles with democracy and individual and social justice. Mexico also seeks to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. We reaffirm our faith in the fundamental rights of man, in the dignity and value of the human person, and in promoting social progress within the widest possible concept of freedom.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff153.\tIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate the Foreign Minister of Colombia on his election as President of the General Assembly. He is the representative of a country with which Austria feels linked by manifold close relations of friendship and co-operation. The experience of many years in foreign affairs is the best guarantee of successful work in the coming months.\n154.\tAt the same time I should once more like to convey to his predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, our thanks and high appreciation. His tact, political understanding and tireless personal efforts in conducting the work of the thirty-second General Assembly and the three special sessions left their mark on the activities of our Organization.\n155.\tThe first resolution of this session of the General Assembly concerned the admission of Solomon Islands as . the one hundred and fiftieth Member of the United Nations. We most cordially welcome the representatives of our new Member State. Their presence is fresh proof of our Organization's claim to universality. I should like to add my sincere hope that next year we shall be able to welcome additional new members including, in particular, an independent Namibia and an independent Zimbabwe.\n156.\tHumanity has not yet learned how to resolve its problems and conflicts and how to avoid clashes of interest. The longing for peace and security is deeply rooted in man's nature. This Organization was created as an instrument to achieve that goal.\n157.\tHowever, despite the existence of the United Nations, force is still used as a means to resolve conflicts. History demonstrates that conflicts are and will be part of human life. What we need therefore are effective measures to resolve these conflicts peacefully. The traditional methods of international law for peaceful settlement of disputes, such as arbitration, have very often proved ineffective. New possibilities should be sought.\n158.\tEveryday experience and the evolution of science show that people and social systems can change, and indeed do change. However, such changes take much more time than the Utopians and impatient social critics would want us to believe. To suppose that man is infinitely malleable and ductile is just as untrue as to believe that his behaviour is predestined by nature and that he is incapable of adapting to new insights.\n159.\tFor generations torture was accepted, even as a legitimate means of criminal procedure. Only in the last century has it been legally abolished. We should take this example as proof that the pessimistic outlook about the development of our civilization and culture that is so popular nowadays is not justified, but is merely a confession of lack of courage and imagination.\n160.\tThe recourse to force, nowadays technically sophisticated; is a declaration of bankruptcy of man's ingenuity. With courage and determination man should be able to find and utilize alternatives to the use of force in settling unavoidable conflicts. I believe in man's creative potential. It is one of the priority tasks of this Organization to mobilize this potential.\n161.\tIt is the duty of the United Nations to replace the recourse to the use of force-a crude method of solving conflicts by a different and more refined system for coping with international problems.\n162.\tIn responding to this challenge, the United Nations has established a system for peace-keeping operations. These measures have proved to be effective under specific circumstances. We believe that there is much scope for their further development and for the widening of their field of application. We have therefore listened with great interest to the proposals for strengthening the United Nations machinery for peace-keeping operations which have been put forward from this rostrum by the Foreign Minister of Norway.\n163.\tFurther efforts within the United Nations system to Advise, in addition to peace-keeping operations, alternative and complementary methods for the peaceful settlement of disputes are, however necessary. In this regard the proposal for the establishment of a university of peace submitted to the Assembly yesterday by the President of Costa Rica filth meeting, paras. 106-119] deserves our special interest.\n164.\tIn a world which still regards force as a resort for settling conflicts in a. world which is armed to an unprecedented degree, no effort should be spared to avoid conflicts. The policy of detente has proved an effective means of achieving this goal. In recent years the relations between the most heavily armed States of the world .and their allies have been decisively influenced by this new policy.\n165.\t!t seems to me that, despite various setbacks which are at least partly the result of differing interpretations of the basic premises, the will to continue the process of detente between the East and West still represents a guiding factor for present-day foreign policy. Today the policy of detente seems to me the only realistic way to reconcile conflicting positions, which are unavoidable in our pluralistic world. The Final Act adopted at the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe four years ago was a highlight of this policy.\n166.\tIt cannot be denied that the Belgrade review session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which was held pursuant to that Final Act, has not fulfilled all these hopes. However, it was possible to conclude the Conference with a pledge by all participants fully to implement the Final Act of Helsinki.\n167.\tAs a neutral State at the crossroad? between East and West, Austria has always perceived its role to be that of serving as a balancing and stabilizing element in the international community by promoting this process of detente.\n168.\tI have spoken of the process of detente between East and West. But detente is not a regional problem. It should be placed in a world-wide context. As I see it, the process of detente between East and West must be reflected throughout the world. It is inseparable from the vital challenges our world faces. Its continuation and expansion seems impossible in this interdependent world without the introduction of genuine disarmament measures. In addition, detente will not achieve its goal unless effective steps are taken towards a just international economic order.\n169.\tEfforts to halt the continuing arms race have increased at all levels over the years, and some-but only limited\u2014success has been achieved. But, in recent years we have failed to see significant results. The nuclear and conventional arms race has reached such proportions and has developed such a dynamic of its own that each small step towards arms limitation is by far offset by greater advances in arms technology. The longer we delay effective measures the harder it will become to control these developments.\n170.\tThe essential questions in the field of disarmament today lie in the area of qualitative developments. We must ask ourselves, therefore, whether the community of States can be successful in its endeavours to halt and reverse the arms race if it continues to concern itself mainly with quantitative restrictions.\n171.\tThe tenth special session of the General Assembly, which was devoted to disarmament, was of significance for the struggle for disarmament and arms limitation. It gave a number of smaller States, including Austria, the opportunity to express their profound concern over developments beyond their control.\n172.\tWe certainly recognize the importance of the consensus reached on the basis of the Final Document.\nNevertheless we should not ignore the fact that that document contains for the most part only general statements and procedural decisions.\n173.\tIt is a matter of great concern to me that today, several months after the conclusion of the special session on disarmament, an agreement at the second series of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks still exists only in our expectations. It is also to be noted that there is, unfortunately, little or no progress in the efforts to reach a treaty banning chemical weapons. The negotiations on a reduction of armed forces and armaments as well as related measures in Central Europe have not achieved any substantive success. The same is true in respect of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. It is an illusion to believe that an enumeration of desirable measures can of itself replace those measures. Austria is surrounded by enormous nuclear and conventional weapons potential. Therefore, in our view, concrete measurable steps for disarmament and arms limitation and a realistic approach to the disarmament question are indispensable. It is necessary in this context to recall once more the primary responsibility of the big Powers, and in particular the two leading nuclear-weapon States. We cannot expect any genuine progress towards disarmament at the global or even regional level unless those Powers agree to significant and concrete measures.\n174.\tIn international economic relations we face two possibilities: national egoism and crises connected therewith or with the reconciliation of interests. If we opt for the second alternative, which indeed seems the only acceptable one, then we have to find new forms of co-operation.\n175.\tTherefore it is urgent that agreement be reached at the forthcoming debate in the plenary General Assembly on the functions and the mandate of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174. The continuation of the North-South dialogue in the United Nations is vital, and the Committee must be in a position to carry out the important tasks assigned to it.\n176.\tIn this connexion I should like to refer to the proposals put forward by my country concerning the establishment of a multilateral financing mechanism to promote a massive transfer of resources to developing countries.  The implementation of this initiative would enable those countries to achieve an accelerated development of their infrastructures. We note with satisfaction the increasing interest in this new development scheme. The basic idea of this initiative might provide the terms of reference for a mandate for the Secretary-General to examine and recommend the most appropriate measures for its realization.\n177.\tThe preparations for the fifth session of UNCTAD, which will take place in May 1979 in Manila at the generous invitation of the Philippines Government, also warrant our special attention. We welcome the decision taken a few weeks ago to resume in November of this year the negotiations on a common fund within the framework of UNCTAD.  In my opinion, concrete progress in this field would undoubtedly have a favourable influence, not only on international commodities policy, but also on the continuation of the North-South dialogue.\n178.\tScience and technology also play an extremely important role in the promotion of growth and development within the framework of a new international economic order.\n179.\tThe United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development, which is to be held in Vienna in August 1979, is an excellent opportunity for steps to be taken in this field. Austria is doing its utmost to contribute to the success of the Conference and to ensure the best possible organization of this very important international meeting. I am confident that the General Assembly will give its special attention to the preparation of the Conference.\n180.\tAustria's commitment to the protection of human rights, including the fight against apartheid, is well known. Speaking of human rights, I have in mind political and civil rights as well as fundamental social, economic and cultural rights, which are indivisible. In supporting the cause of human rights it is our primary objective to help the individual. At the same time, we believe that we thus contribute also to the maintenance of world peace. Only in a world in which human rights are protected\u2014and I mean all human rights\u2014only in such a world will peace be guaranteed. It is not least for this reason that respect for human rights is today acknowledged to be an internationally recognized principle, enjoying equal status with other recognized principles governing international relations.\n181.\tToday, the scope and the content of human rights have been largely consolidated and codified. Of course, this fact should not preclude further development in specific fields, such as the campaigns against torture and the death penalty, which we firmly support. Now the time has come to .intensify our efforts to achieve the effective implementation of human rights. In this respect effective procedures and institutions, and also education, play an important role. The International Congress on the Teaching of Human Rights, held in Vienna from 12 to 16 September 1978, at the invitation of UNESCO, endorsed this view and proposed, inter alia, the establishment of a voluntary fund for the furtherance of knowledge in the field of human rights through education and information. The fact that we are celebrating this year the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights offers a very sound reason for translating that proposal into reality.\n182.\tI should like to emphasize Austria's readiness to support the establishment of such a fund and urge all interested parties to endorse the proposal.\n183.\tLast year in the General Assembly, Austria put forward a proposal  designed to increase the security of international civil aviation. That initiative culminated in the General Assembly's appeal to all States that have not yet\n\nratified the Conventions of Tokyo, The Hague and Montreal to do so at the earliest possible date. This resolution was adopted in the context of measures designed to combat the scourge of international terrorism.\n184.\tIn this connexion permit me to make some basic remarks concerning terrorism. Austria has and has always had, great sympathy for all those who are denied fundamental rights. It is the task of the international community to help the oppressed to obtain their rights and Austria will continue to share this responsibility. The use of force is not an appropriate way to secure these rights. Not least for this reason, we believe that there can be no justification for terrorism. As a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism, my country has repeatedly urged that concrete measures be taken as speedily as possible to eradicate this dangerous threat to mankind.\n185.\tI should now like to refer to conflict areas considered by this Assembly.\n186.\tThe efforts to solve the Middle East problem have taken a new and, we hope, positive turn at the Camp David talks. However, we are well aware that those talks have left certain essential questions unresolved. Further intensive efforts and negotiations and the involvement of all the parties concerned will be necessary for the peaceful solution, of this burning problem, a problem which, if it persists, will remain a threat to world peace. We recognize the will of the partners in the Camp David talks to achieve peace. This goodwill has generated new hope. Of course, this hope will only prove justified if negotiations are conducted in a spirit of mutual understanding and with an open mind. A successful outcome Of these negotiations would require the faithful application of the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).\n187.\tIn Lebanon thousands of innocent people have lost their lives and homes, a tragic situation which still continues. These events remind us of the urgent need to establish a lasting peace in the whole region.\n188.\tMy country is also particularly concerned about the fate of Cyprus. It is therefore with disappointment that we have noted that the intercommunal talks have still not produced any result. I appeal to the parties to the conflict to continue to use the good offices of the Secretary-General and to give him every support in his quest for a lasting solution that will guarantee individual safety and the security of the communities.\n189.\tAfter a period of guarded optimism about developments in southern Africa prompted by progress on the question of Namibia, we must acknowledge serious setbacks which endanger a peaceful development in that area. Year after year in this body we have striven to guide Namibia one step further along the road to independence. This year we had thought we could register progress, and cherished the hope that as early as next year Namibia would be a sovereign Member of our Organization. In the light of the regrettable announcement of the South African Government of its intention to hold elections in Namibia without United Nations participation, that hope seems to have been premature. My country supported the proposal for a solution submitted to the Security Council because it was based on democratic ideas to which we are committed. We call on all parties concerned to let moderation and reason prevail, and urge the Government of South Africa to reconsider its decision. We are firmly convinced that the plan before the Security Council still represents a basis on which all the parties could and should unite. At this point, reference must be made to the responsibility, the enormous responsibility, that rests with the Government of the Republic of South Africa for further developments in southern Africa.\n190.\tWe have always advocated that conflicts be resolved by peaceful means, by negotiation between all the parties concerned. Therefore, the developments in Zimbabwe, with the increasing escalation of violence, fill us with the deepest concern. It is imperative that an effort be made, at the eleventh hour as it were, to work out a solution with the participation of all the parties. In the difficult years that lie behind us, the leaders of the front-line States have displayed the wisdom of great statesmen. They and the other parties striving to achieve a peaceful solution carry great responsibility in this increasingly difficult situation.\n191.\tUnited Nations peace-keeping operations are today acknowledged to be the most important means to pave the way for the peaceful settlement of conflicts. As a neutral State, Austria views her participation in these operations as an opportunity for effectively contributing to the attainment of the purposes of the United Nations. It is in the light of this consideration that Austria has declared its readiness to take part in a United Nations operation in Namibia, which I hope is still a real possibility.\n192.\tIn the field of peace-keeping, the Secretary-General deserves our special recognition for his tireless efforts to facilitate peaceful solutions in Cyprus, in the Middle East and in Namibia.\n193.\tOur thanks also go to the troops who, often in difficult conditions, have performed their duty splendidly under the United Nations flag. I offer a reverent tribute to the memory of all those soldiers who lost their lives in performing their duty in the service of the United Nations.\n194.\tMany nations participate in these United Nations operations either directly or with support measures, thereby helping to. enhance the Organization's image and credibility throughout the world. However, the current state of the financing of the peace-keeping operations is a matter for concern. I should like to call on all Member States to make their contributions to the United Nations peace-keeping operations.\n195.\tIn conclusion, permit me to say a few words about two questions of particular and immediate importance to my country.\n19 See Official Records of the Security Council, Thirty-third Year, Supplement for April, May and June 1978, document S/12636.\n196.\tIn accordance with past practice, I should like to refer to the question of the South Tyrol, which is a matter of special concern in our relations with Italy. Concerning this question, on which the General Assembly adopted resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI), I can report that further progress has been possible with respect to increasing autonomy for the South Tyrol. However, we cannot conceal our disappointment that a number of measures, some of them very important, are bull awaiting implementation. We hope that continued efforts will soon lead to the solution of the remaining problems.\n197.\tThe other issue of special concern to Austria is to ensure optimal use of the Donaupark Centre in Vienna. The construction of this Centre is a visible expression of Austria's active engagement in the work of the United Nations. The Centre will be inaugurated in August 1979 and will serve as permanent headquarters for IAEA and UNIDO as well as those units of the United Nations system which, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 31/194, will move to Vienna. It will be up to this General Assembly to adopt, on the basis of this resolution, the final steps to be taken to ensure optimal use of the Donaupark Centre. We are therefore looking forward with interest to the report of the Secretary-General which will be before this Assembly under item 103 of the agenda.\n198.\tAustria is confident that its considerable efforts resulting in the construction of the centre and its rent-free offer to the United Nations will find their recognition in a decision which will guarantee its full utilization by the United Nations system, thus ensuring considerable organizational benefits for the United Nations.\n199.\tOn the agenda of this General Assembly are a great number of very difficult problems which await an urgent solution. I have attempted to elaborate on some of these issues. We see in the United Nations a most valuable and indeed indispensable instrument to meet the great and often interconnected challenges with which the international community is confronted. The General Assembly is probably the only forum where the co-operative efforts of all Member States can unite in order to find an adequate response to these challenges. Austria will continue making its contribution to these joint efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\n2.\tIt gives me great pleasure to extend to you, Sir, warm congratulations on your unanimous election as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. Your country, Colombia, with which my country maintains very friendly relations, has always played a. prominent role in international affairs. Your distinguished record as a statesman gives us the assurance that under your experienced leadership the present session, which has so many important items on its agenda, will be guided constructively and skilfully to a successful conclusion.\n3.\tI should like also to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, for the excellent manner in which he discharged his difficult duties through the regular session of the Assembly last year and the three special sessions this year.\n4.\tI wish to express our very warm welcome to the delegation of Solomon Islands, a fellow Commonwealth member which has joined the Organization at this session as its one hundred and fiftieth Member and with which we look forward to developing close ties of co-operation and friendship.\n5.\tWhen in the general debate we review global problems and international conflicts with reference to the  relevant role of the United Nations it is, I believe, our common\npurpose to contribute to the effective maintenance of international peace and security through the Organization.\n6.\tIn that sense, the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization [A/33/1J is a most significant document. Its review of world developments and its assessment of situations should be given full consideration and attention as a basic premise for discussion in the general debate. The need to make the United Nations central in the policies of Governments is felt more impressively than ever in these turbulent times.\n7.\tIncreasing manifestations of insecurity and near anarchy at the international level threaten the very foundations of human society. To arrest those ominous trends, recourse to the system of legal order and security prescribed in the Charter is becoming a compelling necessity.\n8.\tTo that end, determined steps must be taken to bring into operation the provisions in Chapter VII of the Charter for the effective implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council, thereby giving effect to' its decisions and restoring the authority of the United Nations.\n9.\tIn the face of a sharply deteriorating world situation the Secretary-General in his most recent reports has dealt with this problem in a bold and pragmatic manner. In a reference to the non-implementation, of the Security Council's resolutions, this year's report pointedly notes that this situation has\n. . tended to downgrade the prestige and effectiveness of the Organization... as the ... guarantor of international peace and security... [with the result that of late] some small States .no longer turn to the United Nations as the protector of their sovereign rights.\\\" 10.\tThe Secretary-General warns of the seriousness of such developments and adds that:\n\\\"A more reliable and generally accepted international security system [through the United Nations] is the only logical answer to this fundamental problem.\\\" [Ibid.]\n11.\tIt thus becomes clear that the mere adoption, often unanimously, of resolutions by the General Assembly and the Security Council without their implementation will in fact have the effect of discrediting the Organization and of encouraging the party in default to continue its attitude of contemptuous disregard towards those resolutions. It is high time that the crucial issue of the implementation of Security Council resolutions should, at an appropriate time, be placed on the agenda of the General Assembly for careful consideration and remedial action. I would go a step\nfurther and formally propose the holding of a special session of the General Assembly to deal with this vital issue alone.\n12.\tThe report emphasizes the fundamental truth that:\n\\\"The United Nations was intended, among other things, to be the guarantor of justice and peace for all nations, and most especially for defenceless or small countries which would otherwise have no recourse in a world dominated exclusively by power politics.\\\" [Ibid.]\nThe Secretary-General also rightly stresses that:\n\\\"We must strive to reach a point where the system and the principles of the Charter, and not the rivalries of great Powers, are the decisive and dominant elements of the international order.\\\" [Ibid.]\n13.\tThose observations are indeed very significant. If they could be translated into practical action\u2014and it is up to the States Members of this Organization to do so-they would provide the solution to nearly all the problems facing the world today, whether they be problems of international peace and security, problems of economic relations between States, problems of human rights or problems of international law. It is only through the faithful application in practice of the letter and the spirit of the Charter that the world can be made safer, more just and more peaceful than it is today.\n14.\tWhat adds significantly to the importance of international security through the United Nations is that it is closely linked and interdependent with the burning world problem of the arms race and disarmament.\n15.\tThe convening for the first time of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament demonstrates the frustrations involved in all disarmament efforts. The tenth special session, although it did not fully live up to the aspirations of humanity, was nevertheless a major event in our world Organization. It focused world public opinion as never before on the primary need to deal effectively with the arms race. In the words of paragraph 18 of the Final Document of that session [resolution S-10/2] \\\"we must halt the arms race and proceed to disarmament or face annihilation.\\\"\n16.\tThe special session laid the foundation for an international disarmament strategy which, through the  coordinated effort provided for in the Final Document, aims at general and complete disarmament, thus halting the arms race. It has almost imperceptivity emerged from the special session that there can hardly be any prospect of halting the arms race as long as the security of nations continues to be dependent upon the anachronistic concept of balance of power or, rather, \\\"balance of weapons\\\". The resulting competition to attain or maintain such a balance inevitably spurs on the arms race and leads to its rapid and continuing escalation, as experience for over three decades has amply demonstrated.\n17.\tThe vital prerequisite for the cessation of the arms race, allowing progress towards disarmament, is to provide for the security of nations otherwise than through the\nbalance of weapons. Such alternative security can come only from the effective application of the relevant provisions of the Charter.\n18.\tIn this connexion I wish to reiterate the proposal of my country, made at the special session, for the establishment of an organ of the General Assembly for the peaceful settlement of international disputes that would give meaning and substance to the provisions of Article 33 of the Charter.\n19.\tA positive contribution to the effort to establish international security is the study prepared by the Centre for Disarmament on the interrelationship between disarmament and international security,2 which was presented by the Secretary-General to the special session by virtue of a consensus General Assembly resolution [resolution 32187 C] introduced by Cyprus and sponsored by it and 10 other non-aligned countries.\n20.\tIt is very comforting that in its Declaration, the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, referring to the arms race as a major threat to the survival of mankind, emphatically stated:\n\\\"This situation is mainly due to the lack of adequate international security as provided for in the United Nations Charter, and the failure to replace the outdated concept of balance of power as a means of security \\\" [See A/331206, para. 147.]\nWith reference to the strengthening of the role and effectiveness of the United Nations, strong emphasis is given in the Declaration to the need to apply \\\"a system of international security as expressly provided in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations\\\" [ibid., para. 161].\n21.\tTurning now to the crucial issue of the new international economic order, I would like to observe that the existing inequality between the rich and the poor is constantly growing and has become another source of tension in the world. As a developing country we have long advocated the adoption of a new and fairer international economic order which, seen in the long term, is bound to benefit the developed countries as well. It is very worrying that the ongoing North-South dialogue has so far yielded no significant results. There is an evident need for a reappraisal of the whole situation and for a reorientation not only of specific policies but also of fundamental thinking. We firmly believe that increased co-operation between developing countries should be encouraged as it will not only stimulate and foster collective self-reliance but also positively contribute, to the establishment of the much sought after new international economic order. For our part, in our modest way we have taken concrete steps to promote technical co-operation with neighbouring and other countries through agreements providing the framework for and encouragement of such co-operation.\n22.\tPeace-keeping by the United Nations, in the form in which it has repeatedly been carried out in recent years -- \nthat is, based on the consent of the Government of the State concerned, though this is not expressly provided for in the Charter\u2014has come time and again to provide a temporary answer to situations in which containment is necessary while efforts are under way to solve the underlying causes of such a situation.\n23.\tThe complaint is sometimes voiced\u2014with a considerable degree of justification\u2014that such operations can be counter-productive in the sense that by containing existing conflicts they tend to remove the incentive for the radical solution of the problems which necessitated those operations, with the result that peace-keeping operations of the kind, instead of being temporary palliatives, are converted into near-permanent features of indefinite duration. Yet it should also be borne in mind that peace-keeping operations exist not in a political or legal vacuum but in the context of the Security Council resolutions, the proper implementation of which\u2014by the parties concerned in the first place, and by the Security Council through enforcement action in the last resort if one or more of the parties is unwilling\u2014 would indeed radically solve the problem on the basis of such resolutions and the Charter, thus rendering such operations no longer necessary. It is, therefore, in the failure of the Security Council to exercise its responsibilities under the Charter and to take the necessary steps to implement its own resolutions that the reason for this anomaly exists.\n24.\tTurning to another subject, I wish to express and stress the importance we attach to the successful outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, where for five years a systematic effort has been under way to arrive at a comprehensive and generally acceptable convention. Such a convention should include adequate provisions, on the basis of just and objective criteria, regarding the delimitation of the maritime zones between States the coasts of which are opposite or adjacent to each other, as well as an effective system for the peaceful settlement of disputes arising there from.\n25.\tAs the Secretary-General has pointed out in his report on the work of the Organization, the main, political problems regarding which the Organization has specific responsibilities are the Middle East, southern Africa and Cyprus. All three have common elements, and in all of them the non-implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions has rendered them a threat to inters national peace and security.\n26.\tWith regard to the very sensitive region of the Middle East, we reiterate our firm support for the objective of a just and lasting settlement of all aspects of the Middle East conflict within the framework of the relevant United Nations resolutions. The Palestine Liberation Organization should fully participate in the efforts aimed at a solution based on the United Nations resolutions and on the establishment of a Palestinian homeland, as well as on recognition of the rights of all States in the region to exist in peace and within recognized boundaries.\n27.\tThe sad events in Lebanon give rise to concern and anxiety. We fully support the efforts of the Government of Lebanon assisted by UNIFIL to restore its sovereign rights over ill its territory. The territorial integrity of Lebanon must be safeguarded at all costs.\n28.. Cyprus has been consistent in its full support of the right of the people of Zimbabwe to determine their destiny in accordance with their sovereign will. Cyprus will continue to observe strictly the sanctions imposed by the Security Council against the Salisbury regime until genuine majority rule and true independence have been reached with the agreement of the leaders of the Patriotic Front. I wish also to reiterate our solidarity with the fellow non-aligned countries of Zambia and Mozambique in their determined resistance against repeated acts of aggression by the Smith forces.\n29.\tAs regards Namibia, we express the hope that the Pretoria regime will comply with all Security Council resolutions and no longer impede progress towards Namibia's independence. Cyprus stands firm in its solidarity with the South West Africa People's Organization SWAPO, the legitimate representative of the Namibian people.\t\n30.\tWe unreservedly condemn the policy of apartheid practised in South Africa; and we have, in this connexion, consistently advocated more determined action by the Security Council.\n31.\tThe current session takes place in the course of a year that marks the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. During the last 30 years a comprehensive series of conventions, declarations and recommendations have been developed under the guidance of the United Nations system.3 Thus, human rights standards have been set end the fundamental freedoms of individuals and of peoples have been established in detail, foremost among them the right of peoples to self-determination and to economic and social advancement in greater freedom. Also, the right of every individual to freedom of movement in his own country, his right to own property and his right to choose his place of residence were irrevocably established.\n32. The separation of ethnic groups on the basis of race was deplored, and racial discrimination and the theory of racial superiority were declared scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and politically dangerous. And yet we still see a flagrant denial of human rights and a wanton and declared policy of racial discrimination practised in a number of cases.\n33.\tWhat is needed, therefore, is for the international community not simply to theorize about human values and fundamental freedoms but rather to concentrate on ways and means of implementing them.\n34.\tThat is why we .are gratified that, at long last, the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have become binding through the entry into force of the two International Covenants on Human Rights and the establishment of the Human Rights Committee last year.\n35.\tLikewise, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 A (XX)] provides the necessary machinery for the\npurpose of the application of its provisions in the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination established under article 8 of its provisions. It is noteworthy that\t\ndecisions of that Committee relate to the situation in Cyprus in 1974.\n\n\n36. Before I deal with the Cyprus problem, I wish to\nexpress to the Secretary-General our deep appreciation of\nthe keen interest he has been showing and for his efforts to\nfind a just solution to our problem. Our sincere thanks go\nalso to his collaborators in Cyprus and in the Secretariat. I\nshould similarly like to express our appreciation to all\ncountries that participate with military or police contingents\nin the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in\nCyprus, as well as to those which, through financial\ncontributions, make its functioning possible.\n\n\n37. As was stated by the Secretary-General, one of the\nmost serious problems in the world today is that of Cyprus.\nNo one can disagree with him. Four years have elapsed\nsince the summer of 1974 when an unprecedented crime\nwas committed at the expense of my country, a small,\ndefenceless and non-aligned independent State, a Member\non an equal footing with others of the United Nations.\nCyprus was invaded by Turkey and as a result thousands of\npeople lost their lives, 40 per cent of its territory was\noccupied, and one third of the population of Cyprus\nbecame refugees in their own country having been uprooted\nfrom their ancestral homes and lands by the invading forces\nof the Turkish Attila.\n\n38.. That aggression was described at the time by the Prime\nMinister of Turkey as a \\\"peace operation\\\" aiming,\nallegedly, at the restoration of constitutional order. That\nmost peculiar \\\"peace operation\\\" was carried out with the\nuse of the most brutal methods-cold-blooded murder,\nrape, robbery' and destruction. Forty thousand troops were\nused, with heavy artillery, and for several days the Turkish\nair force bombed the cities and villages of Cyprus with\nnapalm bombs. Repeated resolutions of the Security\nCouncil calling for the cessation of the armed intervention\nwere ignored by Turkey. The atrocities that were committed by the Turkish troops in that infamous \\\"peace\noperation\\\" are beyond description. Those who could have\nprevented that crime did not do so, nor did they do\nanything to stop it.\n\n39. Four years have elapsed since then, but nothing at all\nhas been done to restore justice to the suffering people of\nCyprus. In the meantime, Turkey-as part, I suppose, of\nthis so-called \\\"peace operation\\\" supposedly intended to\nprotect the rights of the Turkish Cypriots-implanted\nsettlers from the Anatolian depths of Turkey in massive\nnumbers in the areas under the occupation of the Turkish\ntroops. Four years have elapsed, and we are still trying to\nfind a way to trace the fate of 2,000 missing persons.\n\n\n40. Four years have elapsed since the General Assembly of\nthe United Nations by its unanimously adopted resolution\n3212 (XXIX) demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops\nfrom the Republic of Cyprus and called for the return of\nthe refugees in conditions of safety to the homes from\nwhich they had been brutally uprooted. That resolution,\nwhich also called for the cessation of the intervention- in\nCyprus and for respect for its independence, sovereignty\nand territorial integrity, was unanimously endorsed by the\nSecurity Council in its resolution 365 (l974). I suppose\n that four years are enough to prove that the intentions of\nTurkey in carrying out its aggression against Cyprus in 1974\nCyprus had nothing to do with the restoration of constitutional \norder. Four years are enough to establish beyond any doubt\nthat the intentions of Turkey were, and still are, the\ndestruction of the unity of Cyprus and the changing of its\ndemographic structure for the purpose of promoting\npartition; and this was officially confirmed by the partition\nproposals of Ankara in April 1978.\n\n41. During all those four years various efforts have been\nmade to find a just and viable solution to the problem of\nCyprus in conformity with resolution 3212'(XXIX) and\nsubsequent General Assembly and Security Council resolutions.\nIt is argued that the Cyprus problem can be solved\nonly through negotiations; and some go further and allege\nthat the Government of Cyprus is not interested in\nnegotiations and that it is not in a hurry for a solution. All\nsuch assertions are wrong and absurd, to say the least.\n42. In fact, during the past four years and in the course of\nthe intercommunal talks under the auspices of the Secretary-\nGeneral, the Greek Cypriot side has tried hard, but in\nvain, to secure meaningful negotiations. It has proved\nimpossible because of the intransigence of Turkey and the\nTurkish Cypriot leadership. Negotiations between the\nGreek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots cannot really be\nfreely conducted, as experience has demonstrated, while\n.. the occupation troops remain on the island. This has the\neffect of making the negotiations nugatory, as has been\nconfirmed by the official proposals prepared in Ankara and\nsubmitted to the Secretary-General in April 1978. These\nproposals render manifest the design of partition and the\nconcern of the. aggressor to legalize the faits accomplis\ncreated by the. aggression. We would have been entitled to\nrefuse any negotiations until the occupation troops were\nwithdrawn from Cyprus in conformity with the United\nNations resolutions. We would have been entitled to refuse\nto talk to anyone until the United Nations resolutions were\nimplemented. We would have been entitled to refuse to do\nanything at all until at least paragraph 2 of resolution\n3212 (X?,IX), calling for the. withdrawal of the foreign\ntroops from Cyprus, was implemented. But in a spirit of\ngoodwill, we did not do so. On the contrary, we went well\nout of our way in our earnest desire to see a speedy settlement to the Cyprus problem, because who would\nreally be more anxious to see a speedy settlement to the\nCyprus problem than the Government of. Cyprus and the\npeople of Cyprus? Who would be more anxious to see an\nend to the tragedy than the victim of the aggression? But\ndespite all our efforts and all our sincere endeavours in the\ncourse of the last four years, there has been no progress\nwhatsoever. And there are still no signs of any change in the\nattitude of \n\n43. Turkey, under whose military control the Turkish\nCypriot leadership operates, does not aim at ensuring the\nindependence and territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus\nas a sovereign and non-aligned State Member of the United \n\nNations, but at its demolition and dismemberment. The two sides, therefore, are at cross-purposes. How can negotiations on such premises succeed? How can the intercommunal talks-or indeed any other talks-succeed as long as Turkey imposes its will on the Turkish Cypriots through the presence of its troops, and as long as Turkey pursues its partitionist policy?\n44.\tAll the resolutions of the United Nations, both of the General Assembly and of the Security Council, have been completely disregarded by Turkey and we have come once again this year to the United Nations to protest this continued violation of the Charter and of the resolutions of the United Nations. The human rights of the people of Cyprus are being continuously violated. And, in this context, I must stress that when I speak of the human rights of the people of Cyprus, I speak of the Human rights of the Turkish Cypriots as well, who now \\\",  conditions of poverty, misery and terrorism, and mercy of the Turkish troops and the settlers from l\u2014key. When I speak of justice and freedom for Cyprus, I speak on behalf of the entire people of Cyprus, whether they are Greek or Turkish or Maronite or Armenian or Latin.\n45.\tIt is no longer a secret that the Turkish Cypriots-with the exception of a few favoured by the invader, as is usually the case-are fed up with the present situation, and we know very well how they feel and what they want: they want exactly the same thing that the Greek Cypriots want. There is a common desire on the part of both the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots for relief from military occupation and for reunification; for deep in their hearts they both feel that security, prosperity and happiness lie in unity and co-operation, and not in cultivated separateness and adversity imposed from outside by military force. There can be little progress towards co-operation and peace unless opportunities for trust through association are freely offered to the ordinary people from both sides. Both such opportunities are denied them by the presence of the occupying forces.\n46.\tThere can be no lasting peace in Cyprus and there can be no happiness for its people unless the occupation forces are withdrawn and unless Cyprus is reunited-and unless t&\u00ab people of Cyprus also are reunited. The stumbling block to a solution to the Cyprus problem is the presence of the occupation troops.\n47.\tDuring the special session on disarmament, I put forward a proposal,5, which I should like to repeat today. I propose that the Republic of Cyprus be completely demilitarized: that all foreign troops be withdrawn from Cyprus, and that all Cypriots, whether Greek Cypriots or Turkish Cypriots, be disarmed and that the security of the citizens of Cyprus be the responsibility of a mixed Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot police force under the supervision, guidance and control of a strong international police force of the United Nations for as long as necessary. Those who want a peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem cannot but see the merit of this proposal, because its implementation would remove all the obstacles to a peaceful solution of the Cyprus problem.\n\n48.\tI wish today to put forward another proposal, in addition to the previous one: if it is considered necessary, we would be willing to accept the establishment of any machinery of international supervision, through the United. Nations, for the protection of the human and political rights of all citizens of Cyprus within the context of a just solution based on the resolutions of the United Nations. A similar proposal was put forward some years ago by the late President of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios, in his desire to provide additional guarantees for the rights of the Turkish Cypriots.\n49.-\tWe are full of goodwill and are anxious for an early and peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem. But we are firm in our position that it must be just and viable, in compliance with the resolutions of the United Nations, which contain all the necessary elements and prerequisites for such a solution, in the true interests of the people of Cyprus as a whole, both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. But Turkey does not seem to be interested in that, and consistently refuses to comply with those resolutions.\n50.\tIt is high time that the United Nations, and in particular the Security Council, considered very seriously what steps should be taken in order to implement-its own resolutions. It is high time for the Security Council to live up to its responsibilities and to meet the test and the challenge. That would be good not only for Cyprus but also for the United Nations, for it would revive, the trust which all Member States should have in the ability of the Organization to deal with situations brought to it on the basis of the principles of the Charter, and would thus justify the hope which small countries, especially, have always reposed in the United Nations.\n51.\tCyprus has always been devoted to the principles of the United Nations, in which it has placed its faith. But four years after the aggression and the violation of these principles, we are, I believe, justified in expressing our deep disappointment at the lack of any progress towards the implementation of the United Nations resolutions. And we are, I believe similarly justified in strongly urging concrete action by the United Nations to obtain the implementation of its own resolutions.\n52.\tThe present situation should not be allowed to go on indefinitely. Turkey has been flagrantly defying the resolutions of the United Nations. Chapter VII of the Charter provides the answer, and it was pointed out also by the recent Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Belgrade, that the Security Council must start considering action in conformity with its provisions and especially Chapter VII, which would include sanctions /see A/33/206, annex I, para. 77]. There is no justification for reluctance to point firmly to the aggressor and compel him to withdraw his troops from Cyprus. Why are the Turkish troops still in Cyprus? If Turkey is interested in the well-being and security of the Turkish Cypriots I am sure it can put faith in the United Nations in conformity with the proposal which we have put forward. The continued presence of the Turkish troops in Cyprus is a threat to international peace and security and it proves beyond any doubt that Turkey wishes through its presence and occupation to impose a solution to its own liking.\n53.\tIt is also high time for those Powers which are in a position to exercise effective influent on Turkey to act decisively, and compel Turkey to abandon its expansionist and partitionist designs. If the Security Council and its members remained idle, it would not only mean condoning the crime against Cyprus, but it would also mean the sacrificing of the principles of the Charter for the sake of expediencies totally alien to morality and justice. There can be no selective morality and there can be no selective justice. There can be no double standards.\n54.\tWe all rejoiced at the determination of the Security Council to act effectively in the case of Namibia, as well as in other cases. And we are entitled, I believe, to expect the same consideration as a Member of the United Nations whose independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity have been and continue to be flagrantly violated by another Member State.\n55.\tI convey to the Assembly the agony of the suffering people of Cyprus. I convey the agony of the thousands of relatives of the missing persons and their demand that effective action be taken to trace the fate of their loved ones. I convey the agony of those who are in enclaves. I convey the voice of the 200,000 refugees and their demand to return to their homes. I convey the voice of the entire people of Cyprus who long for justice, freedom and peace.\n56.\tThe Cyprus problem is not in its essence a difference between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots. The Cyprus problem is a problem of occupation and aggression. It is a problem of freedom, a question of respect for human rights and for the principles and the resolutions of the United Nations. The internal aspects of the Cyprus problem, including the constitutional issue, could easily be dealt with in a manner satisfactory for all under the aegis of the United Nations if the occupation troops were to be withdrawn. Is that so difficult for those who are in a position to take effective action to understand? The arrogant attitude of the aggressor is a challenge to the United Nations. It is a test case for all those who would like to be regarded as the champions of freedom and justice and for those who wish to uphold the principles of the United Nations and of human rights.\n57.\tThe Cyprus problem is not a problem of details. The very survival of Cyprus is at stake. The basic human rights of its people are at stake. I appeal to all of you to listen with understanding to the voice of a suffering people. I appeal to all of you to do whatever you can in order to achieve a solution to the Cyprus problem as quickly as possible in conformity with the resolutions of the United Nations, the resolutions which you all have voted for and endorsed. I appeal to all of you to consider the Cyprus problem as your problem and take all necessary steps to remove the injustice done in Cyprus. I appeal to you not to allow any expediencies and short-sighted considerations to override the urgent need for a just solution in conformity with the resolutions of the United Nations. I appeal to you ill not to permit any attempt to legalize the results of the aggression and thus deny to the people of Cyprus their inalienable rights. I appeal to you not to tolerate any more the immense crime which has been committed against one of your small fellow Members. I appeal to the non-aligned countries and to all other small countries to accelerate their\nefforts to help Cyprus at this, its critical time. I appeal to the great Powers to do whatever they can, in co-operation with each other or otherwise, to contribute effectively to the implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations. Tolerating the aggression is tantamount to upholding it.\n58.\tFor our part, we are always ready to consider any constructive suggestion as long as it is within the framework of the resolutions of the United Nations. We also, as we have repeatedly declared, support the suggestion for a representative international conference under the auspices of the United Nations to deal with the Cyprus problem. But, as I said at the beginning, four years have elapsed since the time of the aggression and the occupation still continues. We realize that there are other problems also in the world that need the attention of the international community. But four years is a long time for the international community to be so ineffective in the case of Cyprus. We know and we can understand that its members cannot all fuel the way we do. But, on the other hand, we all have the same responsibility if we all really believe in the necessity for international order and in the principles of the Charter.\n59.\tI would like to express our sincere appreciation to all countries that have been supporting our just cause, but also bur deep disappointment to those who have not been doing so because of expediencies totally irrelevant to morality and to their obligations under the Charter, or interests based on short-sighted considerations.\n60.\tThe rights of Cyprus and of its people are at stake, but as we see it, the authority of the United Nations is also at stake. The people of Cyprus are determined to continue their struggle for survival, freedom, justice and human dignity. Will the United Nations live up to their expectations? This is the big question.\n61.\tWe are often asked, What do you expect? Why do you hope? Why have you placed your faith in the United Nations? We do want to believe in the-United Nations, and despite our disappointment we repeat our appeal to you because we believe that the Security Council is in a position to take the necessary action to remove the injustice which has been done to Cyprus. The Security Council is in a position to discharge its responsibilities because, as the Secretary-General has stated, Cyprus is the direct responsibility of the United Nations.\n62.\tCyprus is a very small country. It does not possess the means to achieve its-goal-of complete freedom and justice or to achieve the restoration of its rights by the use of force. It is Unable to achieve its goals through any but peaceful means. We want a peaceful solution of the Cyprus problem. We want all the people of Cyprus-Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriote-to be free, and to enjoy their human and political rights in freedom, in conditions of security and in conditions of equality before the law and before the State.\n63.\tCyprus can become a happy island for all its citizens if it is left alone. Cyprus can be a place of peace and not a source of permanent friction. The responsibility of all the countries of the world, and especially of the great Powers,\nto see to it that division does not become entrenched and that division is removed is great, because the division of Cyprus can only lead to the destruction of Cyprus and can only be to the detriment of the people of Cyprus, both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. At the same time it will be the source of conflict in the area. The sooner the division is removed and the sooner justice is restored to Cyprus the better for the entire world and for the United Nations.\n64.\tI appeal to all of you. You may not consider the Cyprus problem critical, because there is no bloodshed at this moment. Therefore, we do not have Cyprus in the newspapers and Cyprus does not get the headlines in the newspapers. But the problem is there. The problem exists. The problem is serious for the future of Cyprus and for the prestige and authority of the United Nations. I appeal to all of you to consider it an urgent issue, before something worse happens. I appeal to you to do whatever you can to prove that when we speak from this rostrum of principles, of morality, of justice, of freedom, of democracy, of human rights, we mean what we say; that when we speak here of the necessity of the United Nations' being effective, we mean that; that when we speak of the necessity of adherence to the Charter of the United Nations and of the implementation of resolutions, we mean what we say.\n65.\tLet us at least try. Let the Security Council discharge its responsibilities. The agony of the people of Cyprus must be understood, must be felt, by the entire international community. That the people of Cyprus suffer such agony is a crime in the twentieth century, reminiscent of crimes in the past. It is an unprecedented crime that has been committed. Anything that tends to legalize this crime should be avoided. The United Nations must reply to the big question in the affirmative. The United Nations must give the answer that it will do what it can\u2014and it can do a lot through the Security Council\u2014to restore justice to Cyprus.\n66.\tWe in Cyprus want to continue to believe and to place our faith in the United Nations. I hope that the. United Nations will not fail in its responsibilities towards one of its small Members; otherwise a dangerous precedent will have been created for all small countries in the world.\n67.\tI appeal to all of you to understand us and to do whatever you can, so that justice may be restored to Cyprus and so that the people of Cyprus may live in peace and harmony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n1.\tWhat is most emphatically required of us in the light of the urgency and immensity of certain of the items on the agenda of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly is above all compelling, clear and incisive speech. This new, responsible attitude must take us away from the customary conformity and ineffective rituals which keep us constantly in a closed world, a world of setbacks and resignation, as if the basic problems of our time were fossils and were based \u25e6n an insurmountable fatality of the human condition.\n2.\tHere we are dealing with the breath of life of the nations and peoples of our world. Politics deal with life. In that final analysis it does not matter whether life is larger than politics. The daily lives of peoples, international life, and the whole of human history since the beginning of time for thousands of years has shown that the life of man unfolds in the form of politics.\n3.\tThe United Nations is not a ritual institution. It must not seek anonymity behind sacrificial rites. Its very heart and soul is political, as are its historical roots.\n4.\tIf only briefly, we. must emphasize this first, most elemental and fundamental, layer of significance of the United Nations.\n5.\tOur position is that we need to save the lives of whole peoples, the lives of mankind. Death, even when made into something divine, does not produce life. Everything is linked by logic and essence to life, which is a fundamental fact.\n6.\tWhat is creative and fruitful, indispensable and superior, is life, concrete and multifaceted, which enables man to be the master and possessor of his own thinking, his own abilities, his own awareness, in his ambition to know all things so as to understand all things.\n7.\tThe profound message of the October Revolution, which has illuminated the major current of international life in an indisputable way, testifies against the falsification of the lives of men. The immense sacrifices made by that Revolution are the sacrifices which laid the foundation for a new stage of human history.\n8.\tToday's tragedies may herald profound changes which mankind will experience in tomorrow's world in its evolution towards a higher form of life for the whole planet.\n9.\tBut, meanwhile, the imperialism that continues to be faithful to gratuitous violence, and advocates it, spreads terror, distress, misery and the logic of brute force everywhere. The international situation, when read attentively, shows clearly that mankind in its entirety is determined to strike hard at imperialism, and that imperialism itself will no longer prove able to camouflage this subjective and revealing feature of our period. The political efforts of the United Nations, undertaken on behalf of the world community, are of concern to us all because we must all together try to devise a viable collective future.\n10.\tThe world is not in crisis. The paradox of these words is only an apparent one. What characterizes, today's world is a state of break-down. The world is in such a state of break-down. The world crisis, which is global in its essential aspects, is only one symptom among many other clues which indicate the current break-down.\n11.\tMankind must destroy the old human order of things and prepare and herald a new era of the long history of man even in the midst of today's state of break-down.\n12.\tThis break-down is a struggle. We endorse this struggle with all the hope and promise that it contains. No true accomplishment can take place without efforts, without tenacious struggle.\n13.\tToday, at the dawn of the third millennium, which merges with the last quarter of the twentieth century, the world-wide sensitivity of man and the general political movement indicate that the essence of this combat for life is crystallized in the idea of a new international order bringing together the economic, social and cultural dimensions of the States and peoples of the world, around notions as simple as that of the right of peoples to self-determination, fruitful co-operation among all the peoples of the earth; and, lastly, universal peace and security.\nA/33/PV.12\n14.\tThe world today is precisely that. Its rejuvenation is more than ever an urgent necessity among the significant problems of our time. The present crisis is not superior to \nthat primordial requirement of the contemporary world. The crisis is a structural one and the requirement is a moral, or rather, a political one. The political contemporary awareness must cut the Gordian knot of so many contradictions which underlie the general uneasiness of the present day.\n15.\tThe adjective \\\"revolutionary\\\" is the only one which conveys objectively the true nature of the world set of problems as they stand today.\n16.\tWhat is still lacking is additional effort. Without always being complete, the analyses of contemporary problems which are made are none the less lucid. But the precise moment of the denouement seems to recede indefinitely through a lack of temperate moral and political courage at the level of international organizations. The lives of men and peoples and mankind are not bringing forth the necessary sense of commitment.\n17.\tInstead of endlessly recycling old ideas here in our international debates, we believe that the immense task today consists of not hiding the essential problem of political affairs fully grasped in all its scope, as the desire to found new international relations.\n18.\tIt is politics, it is revolutionary commitment, which is truly capable of better serving the profound aspirations of the world's peoples.\n19.\tIn the name of what political philosophy known to man can one talk about \\\"human rights\\\" while at the same time having systematic recourse to powerful means of terror, to unprecedented economic \\\"pressure and to the reinforcement of monopolies and multinational corporations; all this with the aim of destabilizing regimes that have been freely chosen by their peoples, of boycotting the principle of the sovereignty of States over their natural resources and of practising the domination and the exploitation of man by man?\n20.\tIn the name of what political philosophy known to man can one talk of \\\"human rights\\\" while at the same time giving protection to South African fascism, arming and financing mercenaries, inflaming regional conflicts, ensuring for oneself all kinds of privileges and outlets, and encouraging the squandering of the resources of the planet?\n21.\tIn the name of what political philosophy known to man can one talk of \\\"human rights\\\" when one's fundamental attitude to the major problems of decolonisation, disarmament and development is, to say the least, ambiguous\u2014a moral attitude that deliberately clouds over and aggravates the true nature of the facts?\n22.\tTo tell the truth, it is nothing but a huge wager, this of a great new policy that is not one of arrogance and indefinite postponement but of the truly collective responsibility of mankind proclaimed throughout the world and destined to prepare a radiant future for man.\n23.\tHumility is therefore necessary to give this policy and desired sense of commitment a human face, which can only be by imbuing it with dignity.\n24.\tWe must, however, be truly perspicacious so that cunning and its old idols will not create new myths and new lies and play craftily on short-term circumstances to hide their true purposes.\n25.\tThe world-wide political responsibility for a better future for mankind is equal for all. How can we not congratulate you, Mr. President, on your explicit dedication to such an idea, which ranks among the noble ideals of the United Nations? The homage I pay you is evidence of the great friendship we have for your country, Colombia, and all the peoples of Latin America, which are so close to the African continent and show such solidarity with it.\n26.\tLet me now turn to what is happening on that continent.\n27.\tWhen the will of an entire people is thwarted, as is the case in Western Sahara, when the African masses of Namibia and Zimbabwe are not regarded as being capable of making their own history in the present-day world, when fascism, apartheid and racism cruelly oppress 72 per cent of the South African population, when the great Western Powers give technological and financial aid to South Africa to help it produce \\\"its own\\\" nuclear weapon, when struggle is spreading and becoming more deeply entrenched in southern Africa, given the gravity of this persistent situation, it is necessary to break out of our habitual political restraint in order to see that the most immediate right\u2014the right to life\u2014is being massively and daily flouted in Africa, in Western Sahara, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa.\n28.\tThat is why the problem of the total decolonisation of Africa and the security of the peoples of Africa as a whole ranks among the prime problems of concern to the Congolese people, its progressive party, the Parti congolais du travail, its Government and its President, General Joachim Yhombi Opango.\n29.\tIn the People's Republic of the Congo we feel that our revolution would be incomplete if we were not to help the other peoples, particularly our brothers in southern Africa, to free themselves from objective conditions that constitute true obstacles to the affirmation of their humanity and their right to existence.\n30.\tWhat the Africans of southern Africa are being denied is not just liberties in the Western sense of the word, or certain rights such as the right to work and the right to culture. What is being denied is the very right to life.\n31.\tWe must therefore no longer look at apartheid from the wrong point of view. The odious system of apartheid must be fought as a system that takes the very lives of millions of men, women and children.\n32.\tIt is my duty to be more explicit because South African propaganda defines the immense moral imposture that is apartheid as \\\"an attempt to protect the identity and historical and constitutional rights of the white nation by at the same time providing the black nations with the means to develop politically\\\".\n33.\tThe lie implicit in such a definition is colossal. First of all, the famous \\\"historical and constitutional rights\\\" of the\nAfrikaners are without foundation. All the black populations of Transvaal, Orange, Natal, Transkei and the Cape obviously occupied the south of the continent well before the white migrations. The testimony of African history in this regard is indisputable. The Sothos, for instance, had been established in the Transvaal since the fifth century- 1,200 years before the first Dutch, German and French settlers, the ancestors of the Boers or Afrikaners, set foot there.\n34.\tWe must make it clear that the whites of South Africa settled in that region of the continent after a long military conquest that involved numerous acts of resistance on the part of the indigenous blacks. That was a colonial conquest and was point for point similar to those the other European Powers formerly engaged in Africa.\n35.\tApartheid is based on misrepresentation, usurpation and arbitrariness. Apartheid is the relegation of the South African blacks to land lacking resources. Apartheid is a policy of humiliation and permanent frustration. Apartheid is a specifically South African phenomenon whereby all the economic, financial, social and cultural wealth of South Africa belongs exclusively to a white minority, which thus lives off the forced and free labour of the black South African proletariat.\n36.\tBut since 16 June 1976 the awakening of Africans in the extreme south of the continent has heralded the advent of a new world. This light is that of a major conflagration, which is bursting forth from a centuries-old crisis. This glow is that of a creative dawn. The blood of the children of Soweto, the blood of Steven Biko, the blood of thousands of Africans killed by the master of South African politics, Vorster, can- only be the blood of the new alliance, the blood of liberty proclaimed, the blood of liberty achieved at last.\n37.\tThe iniquitous system that has always denied the blacks of South Africa the right to own land, the right to choose a job, their trade-union rights, the right to free movement, the right to vote, the right to good education\u2014 in a word, the right to existence\u2014is now tottering.\n38.\tThe African demand for universal suffrage\u2014one man, one vote\u2014will eventually prevail.\n39.\tThe material, social and moral existence of my brothers of South Africa can only be described in tragic terms. To their courage and their struggle I pay an unbounded tribute from this rostrum of the United Nations, addressing the international political conscience of mankind, which must do everything so that on the subject of this painful problem of apartheid we finally abandon the mechanical and anodyne statements we are used to making.\n40.\tIt is laudable that on 21 March 1978 the Organization declared the commencement of International Anti- Apartheid Year.\n41.\tSanctions against South Africa must be extreme. Any collaboration with the South African regime must be considered a grave violation of human rights.\n42.\tEconomic, financial and military interests cannot cause us to forget the right of all human beings to life-and\nI mean all the aspects of that right: biological, political, economic, social and cultural.\n43.\tI find it sad to see these cynical, violent and \\\"all-too-human\\\" traits evidenced in civilizations whose fundamental philosophy is precisely humanism. Mankind must not waste any propitious opportunity to put an end to the system of apartheid. First, we must prevent the extension of this odious political and economic system.\n44.\tIndependence for Namibia would constitute a major victory for the forces of progress over fascism and racism. The People's Republic of the Congo has always given unconditional support to the arms struggle of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPOJ for the national liberation of Namibia. In so doing, my country has been following the great internationalist teachings of the immortal President Marien Ngouabi, who was an indefatigable fighter for freedom in Africa and the rest of the world.\n45.\tThe evolution of the situation in the international, political and diplomatic spheres leads us to believe that 1978 will be the great year for Namibia. All has gone well at the level of the international community and has resulted in unanimous, unprecedented support for the just cause of the Namibian people.\n46.\tIn 1966 the United Nations General Assembly decided to withdraw South Africa's mandate over Namibia [resolution 2145 (XXI)]. Ten years later, at the beginning of 1976, an international Conference on the Namibian problem was held in Dakar  following the general collapse of the Portuguese empire in Africa. In May 1977 another international Conference was held in Maputo.  That Conference gave a new dimension to the support enjoyed by the Namibian people in the world. In the same year, 1977, the General Assembly, at the thirty-second session, decided to convene a special session devoted to the question of the decolonization of Namibia. In April 1978 the General Assembly held a special session, its ninth, on Namibia. Two decisive texts of unique historical significance were adopted, namely a Declaration and a Programme of Action [resolution S-9[2J, which placed due emphasis on the essential point\u2014the independence of Namibia with its territorial integrity.\n47.\tThese great dates mark so many political and diplomatic victories for SWAPO, the only Namibian organization recognized by the international community.\n48.\tThese great events reaffirm the essential principles which bind us together; SWAPO, militant Africa and the world community as a whole. This is an unmistakable reaffirmation of the direct responsibility of the United Nations until the accession to independence of the Namibian people, whose legitimate right to self-determination and freedom is total. This is an unequivocal condemnation of South Africa for its anachronistic persistence in attempting to annex Walvis Bay. It is an explicit condemnation of South Africa, which constantly uses intimidation, prepares false electoral lists and attacks SWAPO bases set up in African States neighbouring Namibia. Thus the Namibian problem has largely been settled at the political and diplomatic level. We must now proceed to action. South Africa must be made to respect the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. Should South Africa try to evade its responsibility, there will be no option but to apply Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter with the utmost strictness and adopt the strongest sanctions against the Pretoria regime. The prestige of the United Nations is at stake.\n49.\tAt the dawn of what one may well call the national and international birth of free Namibia, in other words, at the moment when a vast future is beginning for the African people of Namibia, it is only loyalty to pay a tribute to our host, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his tireless efforts.\n50.\t1 would say, in the interest of the history which is being made so favourably for Namibia and SWAPO that President Joachim Yhombi Opango will put no limit on the human and material resources which we in the Congo make available to emphasize, as in the past, our fullest solidarity with the brother people of Namibia.\nSL The struggle for life which is being fought bitterly in South Africa and Namibia is taking place in a similar manner in Zimbabwe. Ian Smith has succeeded in ritualising armed violence. He has created a world of brute force, dividing in order to rule. But around him as well as within him there is nothing but fear, which explains the constant escalation of violence in Zimbabwe. Ian Smith is moving ever deeper into the impasse created by his racist and reactionary policy. What is certain is that Ian Smith is more than ever overtaken by black despair as the colonial right in Zimbabwe nears its end. His desperate attacks on Mozambique and Zambia prove this.\n52.\tThe efforts of the various parties\u2014the Patriotic Front, united and alert in the face of the divisive manoeuvres of Ian Smith, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which recognizes only one representative of the people of Zimbabwe, the international community\u2014must necessarily be combined. They must all be aimed at establishing the majority regime in Zimbabwe.\n53.\tThe Anglo-American plan,  with its undeniably absurd aspects, will have served for no purpose at all. That was evident from an analysis of the information before us. Only the strict application of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, in particular Security Council resolution 423 (1978) of 14 March, can guarantee the true decolonization of Rhodesia.\n54.\tDecolonization is an irreversible historical and universal process. In this matter these are no small peoples and no large peoples. The principles to which we subscribe freely in this Organization must clearly be applied generally and universally. The Saharan people, the Palestinian people, the Puerto Rican people and the people of East Timor cannot be left beyond the bounds of freedom or denied the right of peoples to self-determination and the fundamental right to a dignified and responsible life.\n55.\tThat is why the Congo will always support the principle of self-determination for the Saharan people, the withdrawal of the Hebrew State from all occupied Arab territories, and the recognition of the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to a country. Any negotiation based on mythology and passion and which fails to take account of the dialectic imperatives of history would be an illusory kind of negotiation, doomed to failure. Nothing can justify the negotiation of the rights of a people: the risk would be too great not to be measured or assessed fearfully, without a victim complex, as it were. Any definitive and equitable solution to the Middle East problem requires that all the parameters of the problem be taken into account.\n56.\tWe also think that there are questions of which a correct settlement could have been found with a minimum of goodwill. This is particularly true of the Korean problem. It is high time that the United Nations promoted actively the peaceful reunification, without foreign interference, of the great Korean fatherland. We welcome the tireless efforts made in tills direction by the industrious people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n57.\tThe insistence with which the Congolese delegation has spoken of decolonization in South-East Asia, the Middle East, northern and southern Africa and Latin America hardly requires a word of justification, since this whole question is directly linked to the most elementary human rights.\n58.\tAt the end of the twentieth century mankind carries within itself a great wound which humiliates and weakens it. It is this world-wide tendency to have systematic recourse to interference, brute force, institutionalised violence, racism, apartheid and the use of mercenaries to perpetuate in the world a policy of aggression and the exploitation of man by man.\n59.\tLike disarmament, decolonization is an acute problem of today's world.\n60.\tWe must emphasize with some optimism that the tenth special session of the General Assembly, initiated by the non-aligned movement and devoted to disarmament, was one of the high points in the history of this Organization.\n61.\tWhat should be considered is not the results\u2014which were of necessity limited, given the balance of forces in the world and the interests involved\u2014but the awakening of international awareness brought about by that event. The debate, which lasted for more than a month and which enabled Governments to address themselves to this vital question reflected clearly the considerable anxiety caused throughout the world by the permanent threat of widespread war resulting from an excessive accumulation of weapons of all kinds.\n62.\tThus, thanks to the special session on disarmament, world public opinion was able to obtain a wealth of information on the incalculable dangers of over-armament.\nThat is a positive, rather than a negative result. Efforts must continue, gradually, progressively but consistently, so that the Governments of the world community are led to take the measures necessary to achieve peace. There is no interest, either human or political, in the perpetuation of a situation tantamount to self-destruction.\n63.\tThe problems of decolonization and disarmament involve, in the literal sense of the word, the very foundation of tomorrow's world. The other pillar of that foundation is the problem of development, which is no less vast and complex \n64.\tDecolonization, disarmament and development are therefore the three essential axes of international life today. The ninth special session of the General Assembly, on Namibia, and the tenth, on disarmament, like the recent. United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries in Buenos Aires were major events which bring us back to the great challenges of the present time, which is a period of break-down, of difficult transition', a period which will give birth to a new political and mental structure at the world level, a dynamic structure which will serve and at the same time preserve the lives of men on our planet.\n6$. Development signifies for us the access for all peoples to historical significance and to social, economic, cultural, scientific and technical progress.\n66.\tOur epoch is characterized by a truly prodigious increase in man's knowledge, and the requirements of life are becoming more and more formidable. The urgent problem is therefore to work towards the enrichment of the positive heritage of mankind. That is what we understand by development: that is, this capacity of the masses of the people on our entire planet to struggle against the narrow mercantile spirit, wastage, plunder and imposed poverty.\n67.\tIn its highest sense, development is a colossal effort by mankind as a whole, harnessed to the creation of the necessary material and cultural conditions for the building of a new world society. Here development bears within it the highest moral values of mankind.\n68.\tInternational co-operation, whether horizontal or other, is more than a necessity of our time. It is not even a question of restoring health to international monetary and economic relations; even less is it a question of reducing the material inequalities among the nations of the world. Profound philosophy is necessary in order to see and understand that, in the last analysis, what is involved here is the great historical gulf which separates before our eyes the old order, which is definitely in a state of crisis, from the new order, whose outlines we see on the horizon of contemporary history.\n69.\tBy way of conclusion, I should like to offer to other delegations as food for thought the root-problem of the very survival of our species in the world it has so far produced.\n70.\tI would say merely that humanity awaits the greater miracle referred to by Lenin.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff203.\tAlmost a month ago, with the solemnity and fervour that have become customary, the United Nations General Assembly opened its thirty-third regular session in order to seek solutions to the complex problems afflicting our universe, so diverse in its constituent elements, but so uniform in its aspirations for collective peace and international security.\n204.\tMy first words, therefore, will be to convey to this Assembly the wishes for all success in its work addressed to it by His Majesty Bokassa I, Emperor of Central Africa.\n205.\tHaving said this, since this is the first time that I have spoken I cannot refrain from bowing to tradition and custom by expressing, on behalf of the Central African delegation, my warmest congratulations to Mr. Indalecio Lievano Aguirre, the Foreign Minister of Colombia, who was unanimously elected to the presidency of this Assembly. This tribute while being offered to Colombia, the melting-pot for over a thousand years of an immortal Latin-American civilization, is also paid to an enlightened diplomat and a true son of the third world which has inspired our Organization and finally man himself with a new faith and tolerance, similar to the tolerance and faith that prevailed at San Francisco after the horrors of the terrible ordeal through which the world had passed. The experience of a man of such calibre is the guarantee of a successful outcome of our session.\n206.\tTo Mr. Lazar Mojsov I should like to convey my warmest congratulations and gratitude on the brilliant way with which he so successfully conducted the General Assembly sessions over which he presided.\n207.\tAs for the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, I beg him to accept here the renewed expression of the gratitude of the Central African people and Government for the discretion and efficiency with which he has discharged his important and delicate duties, as well as for the ever- increasing vigour that he has always imparted to our Organization. I take this opportunity to assure him of the moral support of His Majesty Bokassa I, Emperor of Central Africa, who is so profoundly committed to peace.\n208.\tThe admission to membership in the United Nations of Solomon Islands has enlarged the circle of our family and expanded the frontiers of the United Nations in the direction of universality. I should like, while expressing my gratification at this fact, to express the hope that the tenacity, maturity and dignity with which Solomon Islands has taken its place in the Concert of nations may always be characteristic of its participation in the common life of this institution.\n209.\tI have just referred to the deep underlying motive that has guided you, the representatives of the States of the world who make up the General Assembly, in your meetings here in this city, that of re-examining the future of mankind.\n210.\tWe should note one thing. In the light of past sessions, this re-examination, after so many others, seems to me to be blighted by dangerous uncertainties in the realm\n\\\" of world political and socio-economic relations.\n211.\tThe political democratization of relations, the basis of which is a legitimate redistribution of responsibilities for the benefit of all nations, unfortunately continues to come up against the privileges of the past.\n212.\tThe prospect of an era of mankind when decisions concerning questions of planetary interest common to all will cease to be reserved to a limited circle of privileged States recedes further every day.\n213.\tInstead of responding more effectively to the needs of the day, the United Nations is unfortunately continuing to reflect, if not to protect, the static interests of a former time.\n214. The new international economic order so ardently desired by all the impoverished peoples in the south of the planet is still the subject of unjustified delays by the North, which is affluent and selfish.\n215.\tSeparating them from their socio-economic environment, those with nothing but lessons to give to others continue to engage in blackmail and absurd bargaining on the values that man holds most sacred: his right to liberty and to physical, moral and intellectual integrity.\n216.\tWhen will people finally become aware that a harmonious equilibrium between States remains a primary condition of true peace in our world?\n217.\tWhen will it finally be understood that nothing lasting can be achieved in this forum, the supreme forum for our deliberations, without a total commitment to the defence-not selective, but global-of the most fundamental rights and values of all men, whose quest for an ever brighter tomorrow should constantly be identified with the demands for equality, liberty, justice, security and peace?\n218.\tMay I now engage in a retrospective examination of the most recent developments in international events, which reveal the uncertainties and dangers that I have.- just mentioned.\n219. In so doing I should like to associate myself whole-heartedly with those analyses made with such perspicacity and generosity by so many speakers before me, and with their desperate demands that the night of time, the shadows of history, may finally be replaced here and outside this building not by the illusory harmony of expediency, but by the collective and constant awareness of the destiny of man throughout our meetings.\n220.\tAfrica, that vast and troubled continent of renewal, has recently become the theatre of the aggressive resurgence of the cold war.\n221.\tWith its very survival threatened, with its fragile equilibrium threatened, mainly because of the tormented dawn of its early years of independence, Africa is the subject of all kinds of rivalries in many places. Attempts at destabilization, sometimes armed and violent, sometimes subtle and insidious, marked by hotbeds of tension here and there, have been increasing, cleverly maintained by Powers outside Africa short of new spheres of influence.\n222.\tI should like at this rostrum to speak against those actions because, as His Majesty Emperor Bokassa I of the Central African Empire once said: \\\"Africa does not need weapons or ideologies that change its character and damage it, that divide its sons and hinder its development.\\\"\n223.\tThese actions, even during the present period of calm, are essentially harmful to the effective exercise of the will, liberty, peace and non-alignment of the African continent. Furthermore, they severely curb the determination of the peoples still under colonial domination in the struggle for liberation in keeping with their deepest aspirations.\n224.\tIn southern Africa the obstinate champions of the forces of barbarous oppression should today, by examining their own consciences, take the measure of their own degree of responsibility for the dangerous survival of the vestiges of colonialism and racism that so gravely infringe the right of the peoples to emancipation, peace and security.\n225.\tThe last turning-point in the history of decolonization, which we are experiencing with such intensity, compels us more than ever before to accept the imperative duty to be credible in this forum. We cannot simply continue to make declarations and to produce peace plans. We cannot continue to finance, arm and support blindly those who perpetuate all those factors that are detrimental to peace. We cannot set ourselves the ultimate goal of the liberation of peoples while delimiting in advance the contours of such liberation.\n226.\tIt is for these reasons that, as regards Zimbabwe, the Central African Government wishes to express through me its deep concern at the obstinacy and manoeuvring of Ian Smith, who, since 1965, strengthened by the complicity of his allies, has been defying international opinion and sowing confusion and discord within the national liberation movements.\n227.\tI denounce the discredited rebel regime of Ian Smith, not simply because of his defiance of the international community but also because he constitutes one of the evils and one of the causes of shame with which history so regularly confronts the human conscience. I denounce that regime, which, knowing itself to be condemned without hope of reprieve, has succumbed to a murderous folly that is causing it to commit repeated acts of aggression against neighbouring States.\n228.\tThat is why my Government remains convinced that at this crucial time, when the people of Zimbabwe finds itself at the crossroads of its destiny, the only path for it to follow is that leading to the total transfer of power to It. To achieve this, public opinion and the United Nations should maintain their pressure until a majority Government comes to power and there is true independence in Zimbabwe, under the banner of the Patriotic Front.\n229.\tNamibia is without doubt the Territory hi which in recent times the realities of decolonization have become particularly clear, for the initiatives being sponsored now by the United Nations and its Secretary-General clearly show the logical end of the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa and the rejection of its attempts to dismember the Territory by annexing Walvis Bay, which is an integral part of it.\n230.\tIt is for this reason that, in accordance with the Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the ninth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to Namibia, as set out in resolution S-9/2, my Government will spare no effort to support the initiatives which are being taken within the United Nations, in particular under Security Council resolution 435 (1978), to enable the Namibian people to realize its legitimate aspirations to self-determination and independence, with national unity and territorial integrity.\n231.\tWe cannot fail to note that the example of Southern Rhodesia teaches us that neither recourse to rigged general elections nor the possible preparation of an \\\"internal settlement\\\" excluding SWAPO can constitute viable solutions.\n232.\tI can attest whole-heartedly to our support for and solidarity with the five front-line African States which, despite their national development requirements, have accepted the heavy financial, material and human burden of the liberation struggle in Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa so that the torch of liberty can be held ever higher in the skies of southern Africa, and so that institutionalized racial discrimination can be forever eliminated from that part of the African continent.\n233.\tOn the question of Mayotte, let us hope that the renewed friendship between the peoples of the Comoros and France will provide an appropriate framework for a solution in keeping with ,the age-old humanist traditions of France and the wishes of all the peoples of the Comorian archipelago.\n234.\tAs to the so-called question of Western Sahara, may I be allowed to express my joy and optimism over the emergence of signs of an easing of the situation between the parties to that conflict. I would venture to hope that nothing will be done to extinguish that feeble flicker of hope or do anything to entrench the sides in their positions.\n235.\tThe Central African Empire affirms the primary responsibility of the OAU in the settlement of that tragic issue. We therefore wish to stress forcefully the inappropriateness of any debates which may be held at this session, since the conciliation mission entrusted to the ad hoc committee of five African Heads of State20 has not yet reported its conclusions.\n236.\tThe elimination of all these situations of conflict- whereby wisdom and political maturity will ultimately triumph in both the northern and eastern parts of Africa\u2014 as well as the completion of decolonization in the southern part of that continent and the protection of the continent, its seas and adjacent oceans from futile ideological and military confrontations, remain, for my country, the essential pre-conditions for peace and security in that part of the world.\n\n237.\tAnother source of concern to the Government of the Central African Empire remains the Middle East, the destiny of which proves each day to be so closely bound up with that of Africa.\n238.\tIndeed, after 30 years of absurd warfare, intransigence and legitimate frustrations which have not yet produced in people's minds and hearts the necessary changes towards a return to calm and the restoration of genuine, just and lasting peace, we can only hope that the highly constructive initiatives of Camp David will make irreversible the process now under way towards equitable peace for all the parties in conflict, on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\n239.\tThere is no need for us to proclaim once again that the restoration of the national rights of the Arab people of Palestine remains the key to a settlement of that conflict, by which Israel, reassured by recognized guarantees of its independent existence, would have to return to the pillaged Arab States all of their land which was conquered in 1967.\n240.\tFinally, Lebanon, that erstwhile prosperous land and oasis of peace, but today a white-hot source of warfare, can recover security within its frontiers only to the extent that the road to peace which has been finally found in the Middle East will create conditions favourable to reconciliation among all Lebanese national communities.\n241.\tIn the Eastern Mediterranean, the prospects for peace do not seem particularly promising at the moment. On the contrary, everything seems to be frozen in a dangerous state of putrefaction. Cyprus continues, because of its strategic geo-political situation, to be a pawn being vied for by foreign Powers.\n242.\tThat is why, in the view of my delegation, more intensive and sustained efforts should be undertaken by the United Nations so that, on the basis of General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX) of 1974 and 3395 (XXX) of 1975 negotiations may resume between representatives of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities, on an equal footing and without outside interference, with a view to reaching an agreement acceptable to all parties, thus preserving .the independence, territorial integrity and non- alignment of Cyprus.\n243.\tIn the Far East, procedures for the settlement of the Korean problem remain among the major preoccupations of my country, which maintains with the Governments of both sides relations of friendship and co-operation.\n244.\tThat is why my Country urges them to work tirelessly towards restoration of an atmosphere of confidence, which alone can lead to a resumption of dialogue and, in turn, to the independent, peaceful reunification of Korea, free from foreign interference, in accordance with the principles laid down in the joint communique of 4 July 1972,  in the interests of and by the freely stated will of the people of Korea.\n245.\tTurning now to \\\"the distressing problem of the arms race, I wish to voice my country's satisfaction with the\nProgramme of Action adopted at the tenth special session of the General Assembly [resolution S-10/2, sect. Ill], devoted to general and complete disarmament, which was convened at the initiative of the non-aligned countries.\n246.\tEven if that Programme of Action proves limited in scope and ultimately falls short of the desired results, it none the less remains an expanded framework for dialogue among the Powers\u2014large, small and medium-sized-because the ever-more sophisticated and deadly atomic weapons possessed by a few States expose not only those States but the whole universe as well to possible annihilation.\n247.\tThat is why the process which that session helped make available for the reduction if not the actual elimination of the arms race in the interests of development should be explored forthwith.\n248.\tAt a time when stupendous sums of money are being spent on the conquest of space and on the arms race, it is inconceivable and intolerable that three-quarters of mankind should still be suffering from poverty, disease, starvation and illiteracy.\n249.\tHow can we continue to put up with a situation in which 70 per cent of mankind lives in squalor, while a minority which possesses 70 per cent of the world's income lives in opulence and extravagance?\n250.\tDespite the numerous United Nations resolutions on the establishment of a new international economic order based upon equity, equality, interdependence and cooperation among all States, the international economic situation remains unchanged and constitutes a permanent source of concern for the developing countries.\n251.\tWe continue to witness a constant deterioration in the terms of trade, marked by a growing decline in the export prices of raw materials in the face of soaring prices for manufactured goods.\n252.\tTo the deficit in the balance of payments of third-world countries, which is something which is only getting worse, we should add the burden of their external debt-.\n253.\tFurthermore, we note with bitterness and pain that the undertaking by the rich countries to devote 1 per cent of their gross national product to the transfer of resources by way of official assistance for the development of the third world is far from being realized.\n254.\tWe should add to this picture, which is already gloomy enough, the food problem, which has become critical in so many developing countries.\n255.\tIt requires no further demonstration that the primary responsibility for that situation lies with the developed countries, which persist in doing everything in their power to maintain the status quo in order to preserve the enormous advantages they have succeeded in gaining for themselves, to the detriment of the poor countries..\n256.\tThese few aspects of the world economic situation today make it absolutely clear how important and urgent it is for the international community to carry out the tasks incumbent on it in order to establish a new international economic order which can ensure more reasonable and more just conditions of prosperity and dignity for the whole of mankind.\n257.\tIt is from this standpoint that the developing countries, in various international meetings, have constantly proposed concrete measures and precise programmes of action in order to define and put into effect the type of international economic relations that would make it possible to eliminate injustice, domination, exploitation and poverty.\n258.\tI should like to take this opportunity, therefore, to reaffirm solemnly in this Assembly the total commitment of my country, the Central African Empire, to all measures or decisions genuinely designed to promote the economic development and social well-being of the peoples of the third world in general, and in particular those countries that have been categorized as less advanced, land-locked or island countries.\n259.\tThus, the Central African Government firmly supports the declarations and programmes of action adopted at Manila  and Colombo  and all the relevant resolutions of the United Nations to which I have just referred.\n260.\tAs a land-locked country, listed by the United Nations among the 29 poorest countries in the world, the Central African Empire feels most keenly the effects of economic disorder. That is why the Central African delegation, through me, would like once again to appeal urgently to the industrialized countries and international organizations concerned to put all these decisions into effect without delay so as to arrive at rapid and appropriate solutions to the problems which are of so much concern to developing' countries.\n261.\tThe access of products of developing countries to the markets of industrialized countries is being impeded by the real obstacles constituted by the protectionist and discriminatory policies pursued under the present commercial system.\n262.\tLike the Ministers for\\\" Foreign Affairs of the non- aligned countries, according to their statements in the course of their recent Belgrade meeting, my delegation attaches exceptional importance to the success of the multilateral trade negotiations going on within the framework of GATT, the purpose of which is to ensure a greater measure of liberalization and restructuring of international trade.\n263.\tFirmly convinced that international trade is inseparable from the need for local manufacturing processes in the countries which produce primary commodities, the Central African delegation believes that it is indispensable that a particular effort be made not only to provide easier access for manufactured and semi-manufactured goods from the developing countries to the markets of the developed countries, but also, and above all, to increase the industrialization capacity of those countries.\n264 To achieve this, the countries which possess technology must accelerate the process of the transfer of technology to developing countries in accordance with the Lima programme.34 It is understood, of course, that such technology should be adapted to the actual needs of the requesting countries.\n265.\tIn this regard, permit me to stress that the Central African Empire attaches the greatest possible importance to the convening of the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development, which is scheduled to be held in 1979 in Vienna.\n266.\tWithin the framework of preparations for that Conference a national committee has been created by the Government under the aegis of the minister in charge of higher education and scientific research, and that committee has prepared a document of which copies have already been transmitted to the United Nations. \n267.\tWith regard to the common fund, my delegation can only express its disappointment at the reluctance of certain developed countries to establish and put into effect the operation of this fund. I hope that at the forthcoming negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations the developed countries which are now reluctant will modify their position so as to permit this fund to become operational as soon as possible.\n268.\tWith regard to the exceedingly distressing question of external debt, we are pleased by the consensus which emerged from the ministerial meeting of the Trade and Development Board convened last March in Geneva [see A/33/15, part II]. Nevertheless, my delegation believes it is urgent for the rich countries to convert these debts into gifts, as has been done by certain countries such as Sweden, Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Finland.\n269.\tThe restructuring of the present international economic system would be incomplete without the establishment of a new rational monetary system which would be equitable and universal and in the functioning of which the developing countries would participate on an equal footing with the rich countries.\n270.\tInternational co-operation, be it vertical or horizontal, should in my opinion be viewed from the standpoint of the interdependence of nations.\n271.\tThus it would appear indispensable for the developing countries to increase their solidarity and promote concrete co-operation among themselves in all fields.\n272.\tTherefore the Central African delegation wishes to express its pleasure at the encouraging results of the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries, held in Mexico City in 1976, and also at the results of the recent United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, which ended on 12 September last in Buenos Aires, inasmuch as those results constitute a major step forward in the search for concrete co-operation among the nations of the world,\n273.\tSimilarly, my delegation would like to take this opportunity to express its satisfaction at the appreciable technical and financial assistance which the European Economic Community has been giving to associate countries.\n274.\tUnfortunately, we have to note that certain rich countries refuse to recognize this reality, with the tacit purpose of preserving solely for their own benefit the advantages they already enjoy.\n275.\tA major problem which is of concern to the Central African Empire is that of the law of the sea. I am sure that it is easy to understand the reasons for this concern when it is realized that my country is land-locked.\n276.\tIn this context, the position of my country, which is motivated by principles of equity, remain unchanged, namely: that all countries have the right to freedom of transit an1 access to the sea; that, the high seas being open to all States whether they be coastal or land-locked, the resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the exclusive economic zones constitute the heritage of mankind; and that the development of these vast resources should be undertaken not solely for the benefit of those countries which possess advanced technology but for the well-being of the whole of mankind.\n277.\tSuch progress as has been achieved in the course of the work of the seventh session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is a source of satisfaction for my country, which very much hopes that the negotiations which are scheduled to take place in Geneva next year will be even more successful so as to permit the adoption of an international convention on this subject in the near future.\n278.\tAs I have just stressed, my country, because of its geographical situation, has been encountering tremendous difficulties in the exporting and importing of products.\n279.\tThus, because of the difficulty of gauging rainfall and the silting up of the Ubangi River, which provides the easiest access to the sea, we failed to earn 12 billion or more CFA francs in the second half of 1977, which is an enormous loss for a developing country.\n280.\tMy country wishes from this rostrum to issue an urgent appeal to the international community and the specialized agencies of the United Nations to come to the aid of the Central African Empire and help it to overcome the difficulties it encounters every day in its economic and social development efforts.\n281.\tTo supplement its national effort, my country places tremendous hopes in the building of the Bangui-Ocean railway and the trans-African Lagos-Mombassa road.\n282.\tWhile the principal objective of the United Nations is the maintenance of international peace and security, the fact remains that it must also aim at and achieve the economic, cultural and social development of the human being-in a word, the happiness of mankind.\n283.\tThere is no need of any lengthy demonstration for us to understand that human rights arc of extreme importance for peace and good relations among peoples.\n284.\tThe establishment of a new international economic order and the formulation of a new global development strategy surely consist essentially in a raising of the standard of living of the poorest, most underprivileged sectors of our societies for the advent of a better world.\n285.\tThe recognition of the dignity of man, of his inalienable rights, constitutes the very foundation of freedom and justice.\n286.\tFailure to understand and take account of those rights is in itself repugnant to the human conscience.\n287.\tIt is therefore essential to encourage the development and strengthening of friendly relations among countries in order to ensure universal and effective respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of men and women.\n288.\tThe Constitution of the Empire, adopted on 4 December 1976, solemnly proclaims the fundamental rights and freedoms inherent in democracy. It stresses that the human person is sacred and that all agents of public authority have the absolute obligation to respect and protect all individuals. Everyone has the right to free development, provided he does not violate the rights of others or infringe constitutional order. Everyone has the right to life and to physical integrity. The freedom of the individual is inviolable and his rights cannot be infringed except pursuant to law.\n289.\tIt is the aim of the long, devoted struggle which the Central African people, united behind His Majesty Bokassa I, Emperor of Central Africa, has carried on for the last 12 years.\n290.\tFurthermore, our great Party, the Movement for the Social Development of Black Africa, which has been given fresh impetus, reaffirms the adherence of the Central African Empire to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the fundamental principles of democracy.\n291.\tAll the international conferences held in recent years on problems of general interest, such as those of population, education, health and culture, have largely contributed to the search for better understanding among peoples. Never since the creation of our Organization has attention so unanimous been paid to the condition of man and the means of improving it.\n292.\tThis analysis of the current political, economic and social international situation, marked for the most part by so many complex problems, all of which constitute challenges to mankind, should encourage the United Nations to bring about changes in order to respond to the needs of our time. The dominant features of that time may be summarized as scientific and technical progress undreamt of but also beyond all control; a desire for peace constantly confronted by aggressiveness and violence; a will for unity conflicting everywhere with the existence of spheres of influence, and with political, military and economic rivalry, as well as racism and racial discrimination.\n293.\tIt is for changes corresponding to the needs of such times that the Central African Empire since its inception has worked and intends to work, along with all the States of the world which love peace and justice, in order to maintain relations based on the strict principles of non- alignment, self-determination, non-intervention, reciprocal equality and the peaceful settlement of disputes, thus contributing to the establishment of a new international economic order.\n294.\tThose principles in essence correspond to the noble ideals which led to the foundation of the United Nations. Let us hope that this session will bring us even closer to the spirit of San Francisco. The interests of peace and the survival and happiness of man demand that of us. My country has faith, confidence and optimism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

My delegation deems it a high honour to have the opportunity of participating in the deliberations of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and to share with other representatives our thoughts on some of the challenging problems facing the world community.\n148.\tIt is with special pleasure that I extend to Ambassador Lievano our warmest congratulations on his election as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. It gives my delegation particular satisfaction to work under the wise guidance of a representative of Colombia, a nation with which Bangladesh has many close ties, not the least of which are our common hopes and aspirations as members of the developing world. We have no doubt that the qualities of leadership and the wealth of wide-ranging experience that he brings to bear on his high office will be of immense value to this Assembly in achieving some concrete and fruitful results during the term of his office. We assure him our fullest co-operation.\n149.\tThe Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, deserves our sincere appreciation of his continuing efforts to serve the world community. The dedication and impartiality with which he has pursued the objectives and ideals of this Organization have evoked the admiration of all, including the people of Bangladesh.\n150.\tBangladesh warmly welcomes the admission of the sovereign and independent State of Solomon Islands as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of the United Nations. It was a great honour for Bangladesh to join in sponsoring the draft resolution leading to its admission to membership. Bangladesh looks forward to working with Solomon Islands in close co-operation.\n151.\tBangladesh mourns with the rest of the world the death of two outstanding personalities. Pope Paul VI enjoyed world-wide respect and esteem for the great concern that he showed for moral and human values and also the contribution he made in promoting understanding, tolerance and peace among peoples of the world. President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, a great leader and statesman, symbolized the spirit of resurgence in new Africa. The examples of courage, sacrifice and vision that he set as a freedom fighter and a nation-builder will remain a source of inspiration for generations to come.\n152.\tAs we survey the crowded agenda before this session we are acutely conscious of the crucial issues before the world community: how to safeguard peace and resolve smouldering conflicts by peaceful and just means; how to achieve a disarmed world free from interference and spheres of influence; how to accelerate social and economic development, redress gaping disparities and move rapidly to a more stable and equitable international economic order; how to ensure world-wide respect for basic human rights \u2014.economic, social and political; how to promote the fundamental right of self-determination and genuine independence; and, finally, how to foster recognition and respect for the rule of law and universal norms of conduct.\n153.\tFor 33 years the United Nations has been grappling with those problems in their varying forms and aspects. Implicit in the search for their solution is the conviction that peace is indivisible. While the awareness grew that humanity did not necessarily share a single approach to this search, it was also recognized that peace through intimidation or peace through purchase was ephemeral. If there is any theme to which we in Bangladesh are wedded it is the basic one that only peace through justice can endure.\n154.\tFor over three decades the United Nations has sought to manage the unprecedented changes in the political, military, economic, social and technological circumstances of our planet. This period has seen the thawing of the cold war, the dismantling of colonial empires, innovative efforts to contain potential and existing conflicts and pioneering initiatives to meet a vast array of global problems ranging from problems of population, industrialization and trade,- to the status of women, an order for the world seas and the utilization of scarce water resources. The most important challenge, however, lies ahead: how to harness and consolidate the willingness of nations to serve the long-term interests of all humanity and uphold man's positive and nobler goals.\n155.\tIt is to that high ideal that the Government of Bangladesh is firmly committed. We believe that the United Nations constitutes a vital catalyst in the evolution of a new awareness in the international community. In early years the dominant influence governing international relations stemmed from the tension between the great Powers. Today that has been eroded and in its place has emerged the equally disturbing phenomenon of unequal relations among States posing a threat to peace, security and progress. Today, the United Nations are also vitally concerned in forging that necessary instrument of co-operation capable of harmonizing the national policies of 150 States. The challenge lies now in achieving that amalgam between national and international interests so that they may coincide, rather than conflict, in the larger interests of all mankind and in the undoubted recognition of their interdependence.\n156.\tFor Bangladesh, this process of evolution has a crucial significance. Our commitment to the United Nations goes far beyond the mere formalization of the sovereign independent status inherent in our admission to United Nations membership. Adherence to the principles and obligations of the United Nations Charter is enshrined in our Constitution, and around it we have developed the fabric of our foreign policy. We cannot overlook the fact that the United Nations benefits the developing nations most of all, for the essential motive force of the Organization is safeguarding the interests of those countries through the generation of a greater sense of collective responsibility and the strengthening of collective capacity to deal with world problems. It is therefore imperative that the developing countries have an effective voice in the decision making organs of the United Nations.\n157.\tAnother corner-stone of Bangladesh policy is its strict adherence to the principles of non-alignment. Bangladesh lays special emphasis on freedom from subjugation and exploitation, however subtle their form, the right of peoples to govern their own national destiny without pressure, intimidation or interference, the freedom to retain independence of judgement and, above all, the fostering of peaceful coexistence among all nations irrespective of differences of ideologies or socio-economic systems. The end objective is the creation of an environment of peace in which people could harness all available resources to combat the scourges of poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy, so that economic freedom could be secured without sacrificing political freedom and economic growth could be achieved without jeopardizing social justice.\n158.\tIt is in the broad context of these principles that we turn now to some of the specific issues on our agenda, particularly those which have a special bearing on international peace and security and, hence, call for urgent global co-operation.\n159.\tDespite several peace initiatives taken during the year, the international political situation continues to remain disquieting with many more crisis spots appearing on the political horizon than was the case a year ago.\n160.\tThe Middle East continues to remain an explosive area of tension. If there is any substance to peace with justice, then three cardinal precepts must be recognized and enforced. No country can be permitted to enjoy the fruits of aggression. Secondly, no people can be denied their inalienable right to their homeland. Thirdly, no country can be allowed to embark on a policy of conquest and expansion through force to alter the political, demographic and cultural character of territories so occupied. There can thus be no lasting peace in the Middle East without Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, including the Holy City of Jerusalem, and the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to establish a State of their own in consonance with the resolutions of the United Nations.\n161.\tBangladesh views with deep distress and dismay the fact that southern Africa still continues to bleed under the repressive rule of racist minority 'regimes. We express our total solidarity with the brave African people and reaffirm our full and unequivocal support of their heroic and legitimate struggle in Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azania for independence and the immediate transfer of power to the true representatives of the majority people. Bangladesh believes that independence in these last remaining bastions of colonialism can and must be achieved without concessions to the principles already embodied in the resolution of the United Nations.\n162.\tThe task of finding a workable balance between national fears, suspicions and preoccupations on the one hand and the long-term interests of the world community \\\"on the other is clearly contingent on the pace of progress towards disarmament.\n163.\tThe non-aligned movement can take justifiable pride that its overriding concern and incentives on this critical issue were to lead to the first historic special session of the General Assembly devoted exclusively to disarmament, and to the adoption by that session of a consensus document [resolution S-10/2] in spite of ingrained difficulties and deeply entrenched positions. It is difficult to measure the achievements of that historic session in terms of any tangible progress towards the limitation or reduction of arms. Nevertheless, the. most important success was a moral one\u2014the initiation of a process of continuing dialogue and the acceptance of a comprehensive approach towards determining the essentials of a new strategy for disarmament\u2014a strategy setting out goals and priorities governing future negotiations within a prescribed framework. Of crucial importance were the agreements of the machinery for such negotiations, particularly through the improvement of the United Nations deliberative and negotiating bodies on disarmament.\n164.\tBangladesh's position on these issues is clear and unequivocal. Our endeavours must be directed along two parallel fronts: the first would aim at a warless world through a series of comprehensive measures not merely for the stabilization of armaments but for the substantive reduction and elimination of such arms through a phased programme with the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament; the second would involve simultaneous progress towards an adequate system of world security to fill the void-a system based on the rule of law and on the collective responsibility of all nations for maintaining peace, renouncing the use of force and settling disputes through peaceful means. We believe that increasing and overriding attention must be devoted to strengthening the capacity of the United Nations in this direction, particularly through the effective implementation of the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n165.\tBangladesh has been unflinching in its efforts to promote peace and stability in the South Asian region through the creation of a climate of trust, understanding and co-operation on the basis of mutual respect for sovereign equality and non-interference in one another's internal affairs. Progress made in this direction is demonstrated by, first, the agreement with India on the 25-year old problem of sharing the Ganges waters; secondly, the agreement with India and Nepal on the use of the overland route through India between Nepal and Bangladesh; and thirdly, the agreement with Burma on the repatriation of the Burmese refugees. These agreements reflect the statesmanship of the leaders of these countries and their faith in the principle of peaceful settlement of all problems. Our friendly relations with our other neighbours in the region- Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Bhutan-continue to grow in strength.\n166.\tWe have always considered Bangladesh as a bridge between South and South-East Asia and have sought by all means to strengthen the traditional ties of friendship and co-operation between Bangladesh and the countries of South and South-East Asia and the Pacific.\n167.\tInternally, Bangladesh is passing through an important phase of political and economic transition. The first presidential election was held in June this year on the basis of universal adult suffrage. The elections to the local bodies were held earlier and the elections to the National Parliament are scheduled to be held this coming December. The 19-point programme of President Ziaur Rahman envisages far-reaching political, administrative and economic reforms. The reorganization of the administrative and services structures is now under way with a view to gearing them for economic and social development. The two-year approach plan for economic and social development it also now under implementation and will be followed by a five-year plan within the frame of a 20-year perspective plan. Top priority has been assigned to achieving economic self-sufficiency through increasing agricultural production, rural development and population control. A key development strategy is to decentralize the planning machinery and generate the self-reliant efforts of the people through their direct participation in the formulation and implementation of development plans at local levels. A nation-wide campaign has been mounted for the mobilization and harnessing of the country's vast human resources for productive efforts.\n168.\tBangladesh's experiences in the field of development, however, indicate certain constraints embedded in global factors which call for closer co-operation among the nations of the world.\n169.\tIt has now become more abundantly clear than ever before that the problems of poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy that plague the developing countries cannot be effectively resolved as long as those countries remain shackled to an economic order built during colonial times and oriented essentially to subserve the colonial system of production and trade. The existing economic system is both unjust and outdated. It is stifling the growth of the developing countries of the third world and impeding their progress in attaining their development potential by denying them fair access to world resources, world markets and world trade. It deprives them of a fair opportunity of, deploying their vast manpower for productive employment. It continues to widen the inequalities between the rich and the poor nations.\n170.\tThe iniquitous character of this system and the grotesque distortions it produces in the growth pattern will be evident from the following illustrative facts. First, despite the development efforts extending over two decades and a half, the world population living in absolute and abject poverty has risen to 800 million and constitutes 40 per cent of the 2 billion population of developing countries, according to a recent World Bank report. Secondly, for 1 billion of the world's population the annual per capita income remains as low as $US 150 in terms of 1976 prices\u2014which will be much less in real terms\u2014compared to the per capita income of over $US 6,000 for the population of the industrialized countries. Thirdly, the share of developing countries in world industrial production, which was a mere 8 per cent before, has now declined to 7 per cent. Fourthly, the debt liability of the low-income countries rose to 200 per cent of their export earnings in 1976 and the total external indebtedness of developing countries today stands at $US 220 billion. Fifthly, ironically enough the international assistance programme under the existing scheme of things also has a colonial flavour inasmuch as it is resulting in a net outflow of resources from the poor to the rich countries,\n171.\tPrisoners of this anachronistic economic system, the industrially rich countries are being increasingly driven to protectionism through tariff and non-tariff barriers in their agonizing struggle against inflation, recession and unemployment, with its deleterious effect on the quality of life of their people.\n172.\tThe existing world economic order is, therefore, clearly unsuited to contemporary world needs. It is detrimental to the interests of both the poor and the rich countries. The restructuring of the existing economic system is, therefore, an imperative in the global interest, since the search for peace and political stability is intimately bound up with the settlement of the crucial economic issues of our time.\n173.\tIt cannot be overstressed that the new international economic order aims at raising the quality of life of the peoples all over the world; its aim is certainly not to undermine the quality of life in the rich countries. To say this, however, is not the same as equating the quality of life with a life-style based on wasteful consumption, the predatory depletion of non-renewable resources, the pollution of the human environment and the creation of \u00b0n ecological imbalance.\n174.\tDespite two decades of persistent endeavour through dialogue and negotiation and the adoption of such significant instruments of co-operation as the International Development Strategy to the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)], the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)] and the consensus achieved at the seventh special session of the General Assembly [resolution 3362 (S-VI1)], only inconsequential progress has been made in meeting the crucial needs of the third world. Burgeoning hopes for a settlement engendered by the historic North-South dialogue have now all but receded on virtually every front, first in the 18-month long negotiations in Paris and subsequently in their resumption through the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174. Wide divergences continue to be reflected as between the pronouncements and actions of developed countries.\n\n175.\tIn renewing our commitment to the establishment of a just and new international economic order, we in Bangladesh have a vision for the future. It is a vision which embraces all nations. It is a vision of a world free of hunger, disease and illiteracy, a world free of fear. We believe that we can achieve such a world in this century. But this can come about only if all of us work in concert and with determination towards this goal. If we believe that peace is indivisible, we have to bear in mind that peace and prosperity are also indivisible. It has become more essential than ever before that the world community collectively prepare for the future and commit itself to a rational use of world resources, keeping in view the priorities on a global basis.\n176.\tWhat, then, are some of these priorities for the future? First, Bangladesh believes that a cardinal imperative is to ensure that sovereignty and genuine freedom of action should not be compromised by external interference from any source whatsoever. Secondly, we must together carry the unfinished revolution forward so that the great majority of people may emerge from bondage into freedom, from exploitation to economic emancipation, and from dependence to self-reliance. Thirdly, we must seek the integration of all nations into the decision-making process. No society, whether national or international, can ignore even its weakest link without affecting its cohesion. Fourthly, we must work for the consolidation of our unity and mutual co-operation, not merely by the affirmation of principles, but also by meaningful and practical programmes of action and the will to translate them into reality. Finally, it is our collective task to use our combined national power so as to create and not to destroy, to enter into dialogue and not confrontation, to build peace and 10 abjure war, and to advance human welfare instead of aggravating human suffering.\n177.\tBangladesh believes that, among the essential elements that need to be incorporated in any future plan for the evolution of a new world order, specific attention must be devoted to the following factors. We believe that these factors are particularly relevant to the formulation of the international strategy for the third United Nations development decade.\n178.\tThe first is scrupulous respect for the rule of law and the non-use of force in international relations, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations.\n179.\tThe second is strict adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter by all Member States, and the observance of the resolutions of the United Nations.\n180.\tThirdly, basic human needs must be satisfied in the comprehensive sense through the eradication of poverty, hunger, disease and Illiteracy, and the highest priority must be assigned to this task for concerted action by the international community.\n181.\tFourthly, developing countries must strengthen their capacity for greater self-reliance, both individual and collective, not only in terms of self-sufficiency but with a view to broader diversification of resource use and as part of an integrated strategy to secure the transfer of resources and technology. The results of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held recently in Buenos Aires, cannot be overemphasized in this connexion.\n182.\tFifthly, the wasteful use of resources, including the mounting expenditure on armaments, must be eliminated and such resources must be diverted to developing countries for productive investments.\n183.\tSixthly, international policy governing the transfer of financial resources  must be redefined with particular attention paid to the needs of the least developed countries and the most seriously affected developing countries. Crucial priority must be assigned to resolving the problem of the third world's accumulated debt, among other things by rescheduling existing liabilities and by tying debt repayment to real resource transfers and the conversion of outstanding debts into grants.\n184.\tThe seventh factor is the need to find ways and means to improve the export-earning potential of developing countries through their own efforts and through the expansion of trade with each other as well as by giving them greater access to the markets of developed countries through the progressive liberalization of tariff and non- tariff barriers. Of primary importance is the stabilization of their earnings from the sale of raw materials by means of commodity agreements and the establishment of a common\nfund. Equally important is the need to strengthen the arrangements for financing the balance-of-payments difficulties of the least developed countries by granting less rigorous terms and helping them to meet long-term trends, and particularly through the solution of structural problems. Finally, an important activity in this field is the facilitating of the growth and diversification of their export trade in manufactured and semi-manufactured goods.\n185.\tThe eighth factor is the application of science and technology, which also lies at the root of the developmental process. The proper training of personnel to identify, select and manage future technology, the building of institutions adapted to indigenous technology and the transfer of appropriate technological processes are crucial priorities in this field. Of particular importance will be the preparations for and the holding of the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development, scheduled for 1979.\n186.\tNinthly, there is the vital need to harness and mobilize the vast human resources of the developing countries for productive use, thus generating more employment and more production of goods and services to be shared by the world community and thereby enriching the quality of life of people throughout the world.\n187.\tTenthly, socio-economic structures must be transformed, with particular stress on agrarian and rural development, the distribution of wealth and the means of production through greater decentralization at the grassroots level to ensure the democratization of the political and economic decision-making power and the promotion of self-management and local leadership.\n188.\tIn the eleventh place, adequate emphasis must be placed on the role and status of women and on their full participation in national development and in the decision making process.\n189.\tTwelfth, there is a need to increase the availability of and access to food-stuffs through appropriate structural transformation and technological innovation. While the\nv creation of the International Fund for Agricultural Development has been a remarkable achievement in the provision of necessary assistance to increase production, an area of major significance is the attainment of food security through the establishment of world-wide food and grain reserves, which could be tapped at times of sudden production short-falls and price increases.\n190.\tIn the thirteenth place, international co-operation must be strengthened to prevent and alleviate natural calamities. The United Nations should explore the possibility of converting the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator into a full-fledged international disaster relief agency.\n191.\tFinally, the fourteenth factor is the expansion of international co-operation in the field of energy resources through both policy measures and institutional arrangements.\n192.\tIn reaffirming our support for and commitment to the United Nations Bangladesh has submitted itself as a\ncandidate for election as one of the non-permanent members of the Security Council. We have done so in all humility and in the belief not only that the United Nations serves the interests of the developing countries but also that the latter have a conscious duty and a responsibility to contribute to the furtherance of its objectives. We also believe that the fundamental principle of sovereign equality stipulates that all countries be given equal opportunity to be represented in the organs of the United Nations.\n193.\tOn this occasion Bangladesh reiterates its most genuine desire to participate constructively in the process of forging true co-operation and understanding, to maintain the most open and fruitful relations with all nations of the world and to strive together in the common task of ensuring for all countries\u2014small as well as large, poor as well as rich\u2014peace, security and progress based on the principles of freedom, justice and equality.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\n1.\tIt is with dismay that the delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the United Nations has received word of the demise of His Holiness Pope John Paul I. Permit me to express my sincere condolences to the Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations.\n2.\tMr. President, I congratulate you on your election to your responsible office, and I extend to you and to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, best wishes for successful work. You will always find the representatives of the German Democratic Republic by your side when the purposes and principles of the United Nations are to be promoted.\n3.\tComplicated and even contradictory international developments require both sober judgement and determined action. Never before have the chances of a lasting peace been so good. But at the same time the arms race is assuming unprecedented dimensions. Certain progress towards detente cannot be overlooked. Yet in the face of ever sharper attacks against their living together in peace\n\nthe peoples are concerned about whether detente can be pursued further and be made durable or whether there will be a return to the cold war. They rightly place high hopes in the United Nations, whose activities are committed to peace.\n4.\tThe German Democratic Republic has been a Member of the United Nations for five years now, and it has always considered the maintenance of world peace and the safeguarding of international security to be the crucial tasks. It is a reliable partner to all those who pursue the same goals and who work for the good of man.\n5.\tPeaceful coexistence is the driving force of the United Nations, and universality is its special feature. Permit me to extend cordial congratulations to Solomon Islands on its admission as the one hundred and fiftieth State Member of the world Organization.\n6.\tThe United Nations can effectively fulfil the tasks entrusted to it if it commits all its authority to unrestricted observance of the principles enshrined in its Charter. Strict observance of the sovereignty of States, non-interference in their internal affairs and respect for their territorial integrity and their frontiers are indispensable, as are renunciation of force, arms limitation and disarmament, the peaceful settlement of international disputes and the safeguarding of the right of peoples to self-determination.\n7.\tIt is no accident that attempts are being made by the forces opposed to detente to undermine these very cornerstones of the peaceful living together of States and peoples. In view of this, the present session of the General Assembly cannot remain passive. It is, rather, called upon to match its practical action to its declarations of intent and to take vigorous steps to strengthen detente, to make world peace more secure and to ensure that the road towards a world without war and without colonial and racist oppression will not be abandoned but will be easier to follow.\n8.\tIn Europe, the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference has had a beneficial effect on the living together of States having different social systems. This living together develops as the Final Act meets with growing recognition and application as the code of peaceful relations among States. It is equally obvious that all attempts at interfering in the sovereign affairs of other States contrary to the agreed letter and spirit are bound to block the further progress of detente and, what is more, amount to a reckless gamble with the destinies of the peoples. We are prepared to work together with all those who sincerely endeavour not to change the existing situation unilaterally. However, the \ndelegation of the German Democratic Republic has reason, and not for the first time, categorically to reject the stereotyped attempts to the contrary, both presumptuous and dangerous, that have been renewed here.\n9.\tIt remains the declared objective of the Government of the German Democratic Republic to work towards a situation in Europe where peace is lastingly assured on the basis of the irrefutable realities of post-war development, where peaceful coexistence governs the life and conduct of States having different social systems and where the people of the German Democratic Republic can pursue its peaceful work of socialist construction free from outside interference or even threat. The States of Europe can and must agree upon a future in peace. Whoever continues to oppose that and to pursue unrealistic and adventurist designs jeopardizes the life of the peoples. Whoever is serious about co-operating in easing the international atmosphere, resolving common vital issues of our time and assuring peace and good-neighbourliness has ample opportunities to prove it by a sense of reality, goodwill and constructiveness, and, above all, by deeds.\n10.\tThis would be to the benefit of everyone. As is well known, in taking part in the work of the United Nations and in firmly adhering to its Charter, the German Democratic Republic is guided by this very endeavour.\n11.\tAn example of how peaceful coexistence can promote the fruitful co-operation of States is the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. There have been joint research programmes among socialist States, as well as between socialist and capitalist States. Their results have benefited all. The German Democratic Republic is a member of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and has been co-operating for many years in joint programmes among the socialist countries. It has now joined those countries whose citizens participate in manned space flights. Our people is proud of that, and grateful to the USSR, whose pioneering exploits have made it possible.\n12.\tIt is exactly 50 years now since the Kellogg-Briand pact  was signed in Paris. In spite of all inadequacies inherent in that pact, the USSR acceded to it and was the first State to ratify it. It was the first time that an international treaty, which was open for accession to all States, proscribed war and prohibited it as a means to settle international disputes as an \\\"instrument of national policy\\\".\n13.\tAt that time, contrary to the hopes of the Soviet people and all other peoples, the pact could not prevent the outbreak of new wars and conflicts. The short-comings of the pact, such as the lack of disarmament measures and of sanctions to be imposed in case of breach of the peace and no provisions for the forces of peace to enforce the observance of peace, had disastrous consequences. Today, that pact should remind us\u2014the States of the United Nations, whose founding was an essential result of historical lessons\u2014of our commitment to peace.\n14.\tThe conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force would be highly significant for the security of the entire world and for stabilizing peace all over the world. The German Democratic Republic, a State situated at the boundary line between the world's two most powerful military alliances, takes a keen interest in such a treaty.\n15.\tThe cessation of the arms race and disarmament are the key issues of the world today. Awareness of that prevailed at the tenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly. The Final Document of the Tenth Special Session [resolution S-10/2] constitutes a solid platform for joint action. It sets standards for the attitude of States and for the activities of the United Nations.\n16.\tA world disarmament conference as a result of which States would assume binding obligations would logically be the next appropriate step. It could be taken, given the good will of all. Regrettably, the situation is being complicated by the current spurred arms drive of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]. And, the more dangerous and sophisticated the weapons become, the more difficult will it be to control and finally ban them.\n17.\tPriority must be given to measures to curb the arms race where atomic and other weapons of mass destruction are concerned. It would be widely appreciated if the nuclear Powers were now to seek agreement on the prohibition of the manufacture and on the reduction of their stocks of nuclear weapons.\n18.\tAn extremely grave threat to the lives of human beings is the neutron bomb. The German Democratic Republic advocates the irrevocable prohibition of the manufacture and deployment of that; offensive weapon. Its introduction would send the arms race spiralling up again, but would not substantially change the existing correlation of military forces.\n19.\tThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1968 [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex J has been conducive to strengthening confidence among States.\n.Also, it has considerably promoted international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We would wish all States to accede to that treaty. As a European State, the German Democratic Republic has an obvious interest in the early conclusion of the overdue arrangements subsidiary to the safeguards agreement between IAEA and the European Atomic Energy Community.\n20.\tThe German Democratic Republic is interested in lasting security. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR, Andrei Gromyko oh 9 September submitted to the United Nations a draft international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States [Af33/241, annex, addendum]. The conclusion of such an international accord with a legally binding obligation not to use nuclear weapons against States which do - not manufacture or acquire such weapons, or have them on their territories, would substantially reduce the risk of nuclear war and effectively enhance international security. Also, the draft Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in Peace as proposed by the Polish People's Republic [AlC.1/33/2, annex] meets this concern and has our approval.\n21.\tAs a member of the Geneva Committee on Disarmament, the German Democratic Republic has joined in the efforts to conclude a treaty on the cessation of all nuclear-weapon tests. We have closely followed the negotiations between the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom, and hope that they will soon be concluded successfully. However, this will certainly require the willingness of all nuclear-weapon States to assume the necessary obligations.\n22.\tThe German Democratic Republic welcomes the efforts of the Soviet Union in the negotiations with the United States to agree on effective measures for the limitation of strategic armaments. It is obvious that the early conclusion of such an agreement would be an encouragement for further moves towards the cessation of the arms race.\n23.\tThe course of the Vienna talks on the reduction of forces and armaments in Central Europe has been unsatisfactory. With their recent compromise proposals-I stress the word \\\"compromise\\\"\u2014the States signatories of the Warsaw Treaty have opened up new possibilities of achieving substantial progress at last. Regrettably, this spirit of accommodation has not so far met with a constructive response.\n24.\tWe have followed with concern the tensions persisting in the Middle East. Israel's aggression against Lebanon was bound to cause further aggravation. Current attempts to provide sham solutions by way of separate accords are playing with fire. As is generally known, the problems of the Middle East have a strong bearing on the international atmosphere. It is evident that this explosive hotbed of conflict can really be eliminated and that the long-hoped- for lasting peace can be brought to the peoples of the Middle East only if a solution is found which is based on the relevant United Nations resolutions and which guarantees the independence and security of all States and peoples in the area, including the Arab people of Palestine, which must have the right to self-determination in a State of its own. To achieve this, all parties concerned-not only the Soviet Union, other socialist States, Arab States, and the Palestine Liberation Organization as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people\u2014should make efforts for the resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East.\n25.\tTurning to the question of Cyprus, the peace and security of the Cypriot people require that this Mediterranean island must not be made into the marshalling ground of a military pact. It is only if the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of that island Republic are respected and if there is no outside interference that the Cyprus conflict can be settled. We consider the convening of an international conference on Cyprus within the framework of the United Nations to be the best way to achieve this.\n26.\tPeace and stable security demand not only the elimination of existing sources of conflict; it is also incumbent on the United Nations, as well as on each and every one of its Member States, to forestall new situations of conflict. The German Democratic Republic supports all appropriate ideas and proposals for guaranteeing security in\nAsia. For this very reason it has been concerned to see recent developments in the Far East and in South-East Asia, where the peoples of Viet Nam and Laos again have to defend themselves against aggressive acts and outside interference.\n27.\tThe German Democratic Republic also supports the demand of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that all foreign troops, together with their weapons and equipment, be withdrawn immediately from South Korea \\\"o that the Koreans can settle their problems themselves.\n28.\tInternational security and peaceful coexistence among States having different social systems are neither conceivable nor feasible without the elimination of colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism and apartheid.\n29.\tWe resolutely condemn the terrorism in South Africa and all attempts to maintain that bastion of colonialism and racism. The growing aggressiveness of the racist regimes calls for the strict enforcement of a total arms embargo. It is just as necessary to put an end to economic collaboration with the racist regime in South Africa.\n30.\tAs regards the people of Zimbabwe, the German Democratic Republic considers its right to self- determination to be legitimate. It opposes attempts aimed at perpetuating the domination of any colonizers whatsoever. It works consistently for the full independence of Namibia and unreserved respect for that country's territorial integrity.\n31.\tThe policy of the German Democratic Republic regarding the nationally liberated States is based on the principles of equal rights, respect for independence, and active solidarity.\n32.\tEverybody can see that the same forces which extend comprehensive political, economic and military assistance to the racist regimes seek to recover lost sources of profit and raw materials in the African region. They stop neither at boycott and blackmail nor even at direct armed incursions.\n33.\tI think I may say that in the course of this debate it has repeatedly been recalled that the actual attitude of States towards the racist regimes in southern Africa is another indication of who is serious about the implementation of human rights. By no means all of those who pretend to care about human rights have acceded to international instruments such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 A (XX)], in force since 1969, or the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [resolution 3068 (XXVIII)], in force since 1976.\n34.\tMan's most important right is the right to life in peace, free from Fascist, colonialist, racist or other forms of oppression.\n35.\tIn the German Democratic Republic, as well as in the other socialist countries, this decisive human right is implemented and established by law. The right to work, equal rights for men and women, the right to education and leisure for everyone and the right to special protection of marriage and family are living, everyday reality. Social security and political co-determination form part of the very nature of socialism.\n36.\tSome States have been claiming for some time that human rights are the supreme guideline of their policy. But this is just not the case. Their assertion is designed to conceal the fact that their system is based on the violation of human rights. For the same reason they claim the right to be the sole judges of right or wrong. That is neither new nor ingenious. Who would not know that this is to substantiate a \\\"right\\\" to intervention on what are alleged to be humanitarian grounds and to justify, for example, the creation of the post of a so-called United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. So far, this has always proved to be a mere pretext for suppressing the sovereign rights of other States and distracting attention from unresolved problems at home. Such a policy can only engender tensions and foment conflicts.\n37.\tThe criterion of credibility where human rights are concerned remains the situation at home rather than postulates addressed to other countries.\n38.\tThe socialist States have long since implemented what was laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 30 years ago. The United Nations has a definite responsibility to oppose in time and with determination the growing activities of old and new Nazi forces.\n39.\tInternational economic relations based on equal rights and mutual benefit constitute an essential aspect of both peaceful coexistence and human rights. The German Democratic Republic works to ensure that the economic, scientific and technological co-operation of States takes account of the interests of all nations and, consequently, of the people. That requires the elimination of all forms of discrimination and exploitation in international economic relations and the immediate implementation of measures with a view to the restructuring of those relations on democratic lines.\n40.\tThe growing economic strength of the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance demonstrates what can be achieved through fruitful cooperation, free from exploitation. It illustrates the merits of socialist planned economy. It, and it alone, makes possible a continuous and dynamic development, free from crises. Can this be better illustrated than by the conclusion of long-term programmes agreed among the States members of the Council? Moreover, socialist planned economy offers good prospects for the continuous expansion of relations with the developing countries. In the first six months of 1978 alone, the German Democratic Republic's exports to these States increased by over 30 per cent.\n41.\tBut it is only on the basis of peaceful coexistence that the international division of labour between States having different social systems can be developed further to mutual advantage and for the benefit of all concerned. It must be based on democratic principles. As long as this has not become everyday practice, the independence of the developing countries will always be in jeopardy. An increase\nin the economic potential of the capitalist States does not automatically entail the prosperity of the developing countries.\n\n42.\tThe German Democratic Republic shares the view expressed by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of non- aligned States at their Conference in Belgrade in July that it is the legitimate right of the developing countries to claim financial and material compensation for all damages from those which practised colonialism and are practising neocolonialism. Work on a code of conduct to exclude the neo-colonialist practices of transnational corporations could certainly be completed within a very short time.\n43.\tGreater attention must be given to attempts being made by influential capitalist circles to re-establish by means of modern technology the dependence of many developing countries at a different level. For this reason, a code of conduct to govern scientific and technological assistance to developing countries is urgently needed. The United Nations should also oppose the protectionist practices of certain capitalist countries. That should be a priority concern of the fifth session of UNCTAD.\n44.\tThe General Assembly at this session faces complex but rewarding tasks. May I express the hope that our joint efforts will yield results that are conducive to strengthening security and peace, to enhancing the progress of political detente by measures of military detente and to making it irreversible. Of course, this cannot be everything, but without this, everything would be in vain.\n45.\tThe delegation of the German Democratic Republic will actively contribute to the accomplishment of the difficult and challenging tasks before this session of the General Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff134.\tOn behalf of my delegation I should like first of all to congratulate Mr. Indalecio Lievano on his election as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. His election to that high office is a tribute, to him personally and. to the constructive and positive role played by Colombia in the work of the United Nations. I wish Mr. Lievano every success in his task and assure him that my delegation will give him our fullest co-operation.\n135.\tI would like also to convey our congratulations and deep appreciation to Mr Lievano's predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who presided over the deliberations of the thirty- second session and the three important special sessions of the General Assembly with such great distinction, devotion and efficiency. His outstanding contribution to the success of these sessions won our profound admiration.\n136.\tThe delegation of Malaysia warmly welcomes this admission of Solomon Islands as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of our Organization. Accession of that Territory to independence in July this year indeed augurs well, for the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories which have yet to emerge from the bondage of colonialism. This is a tribute to the important role played by the United Nations in the field of decolonization. My delegation looks forward to close co-operation with the delegation of Solomon Islands within and outside the United Nations system.\n137.\tIt is customary for us to come here each year to review our achievements and express our views on the current world situation. Although we have seen some positive developments in some areas, the balance-sheet of the world situation in substantive terms has unfortunately continued to be weighted on the debit side. The world is still ridden with conflicts, antagonism, mistrust, poverty and under-development. The agenda before, us, which is again laden with pressing issues of oven  helming proportions and urgency, reflects in the main a situation of uncertainty and in some areas a feeling of frustration. Indeed, the non-aligned countries at their recent Conference in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, pointed out the general crisis situation in the world today [see A/331206}, at a time when we are again faced with dangers of the resurgence of cold-war politics and the persistence of rising tensions and conflicts.\n138.\tThe process of detente and world peace continues to be threatened by the expansion of bloc divisions and rivalries and the escalating arms race. We have no illusions as to the obstacles that stand in the way of the efforts of this Organization to arrest this dangerous development. The point is that there is still much tension, mistrust and suspicion, which have accumulated over the years from the negative consequences of two world wars. While this holds true, I do not think we should be disheartened by what we have failed to achieve. Let us instead dip further into the reservoir of our goodwill and with renewed vigour dedicate ourselves to the search for viable solutions to the more urgent problems that continue to beset us.\n139.\tAs we begin the thirty-third session, we can perhaps draw some satisfaction from positive' trends that have emerged during the course of this year. For one thing, our deliberations have increasingly been characterized by a willingness to accommodate each other through a spirit of tolerance and understanding. We have proved that through the continuing dialogue in which we are engaged we can work in harmony rather than divisiveness. It is as if we were now embarking on a new era of positive international co-operation.\n140.\tThis year alone, the General Assembly has held important special sessions, resulting in decisions which have significantly advanced international understanding and cooperation. The decisions of the tenth special session on disarmament give us much hope that world peace and security will be strengthened through the start of the process of genuine disarmament. Indeed, those positive developments reflect a universal recognition of the fact that the United Nations forum, still offers us the best hope for the solution of conflicts and world problems. As the Secretary-General pointed out in his report,\n\\\"... our greatest problems can only, be handled by multilateral action... Used properly, for example, the United Nations can be the instrument for overcoming much of the sense of mistrust and insecurity which makes so many international problems insoluble.\\\" [See A/3311, sect. I.]\n141.\tWe must accept that the pursuit of international peace and security is, after all, a dynamic process, and that it is through co-operation, understanding and tolerance that we can reach out to seek viable solutions to international problems. Indeed  the importance of this process should not be underestimated. My delegation hopes that it will be given further impetus at this thirty-third session. For our part, I should like to reaffirm the commitment of the Government of Malaysia to its promotion, so that we can successfully attain the goals and objectives of the United Nations.\n142.\tIndeed, the continuation of this process of cooperation is all the more imperative in serious problem areas such as the Middle East and southern Africa. Peace has eluded the people in the Middle East for far too long. It is a tragic situation that has inflicted untold sufferings on many. It is surely the duty of the international community to leave no stone unturned in the quest for a lasting and comprehensive solution that will end the sufferings of the people and enable them to live in peace and security.\n143.\tIt is in this context that my Government welcomes any initiative aimed at bringing this about. While doing so, let me also reiterate here our position, namely, that a just and comprehensive settlement of the problem can be achieved only if it is predicated, first, on the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all Arab occupied territories and, secondly on the realization of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination. We also hold strongly that Israel must desist from changing the natural, political, cultural, religious and demographic characteristics of the occupied territories.\n144.\tAt the Ninth Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Dakar, Senegal, in April this year, the position of that Conference was very clearly defined. Israel's continued illegal occupation of Arab territories, including the Holy City of Jerusalem, cannot be accepted. The Holy City of Jerusalem in particular is dear to all Islamic countries and Moslems all over the world, and any act by Israel to alter the Arab Islamic status of the City and desecrate the Islamic monuments there is to be condemned.\n\n145.\tThe struggle against colonialism, apartheid and racism remains high on the priority list of the agenda of the United Nations. It is a matter of satisfaction that there is universal recognition of the need for more resolute action to eradicate this abnormality of our times. The process of decolonization assumes increasing urgency as we face ruthless attempts by the colonialist regimes to entrench their minority rule. In southern Africa, the people continue to be deprived of their fundamental freedom and their rights to self-determination and independence. Attempts to end the unacceptable situation in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa have been frustrated by more repressive policies of the racist minority regimes there.\n146.\tEarlier this year we were looking forward to the independence of Namibia. But once again we are faced with a recalcitrant and intransigent racist regime in South Africa, which is bent on obstructing the efforts of the United Nations to bring about a peaceful transition to majority rule and independence in that country. South Africa's decision to go ahead and conduct its own elections in Namibia in defiance of the United Nations poses a serious obstacle to the progress of the settlement proposals that have been agreed upon. Surely, no independence can be genuine if it does not include the participation of SWAPO.\n147.\tWe deplore these obstructionist tactics, which demonstrate too clearly that the racist regime is not prepared to relinquish its illegal control of the Territory. If South Africa persists in pursuing this course, the Security Council must take a firm decision to impose full mandatory sanctions. In the view of my delegation, the Secretary- General's proposals for the establishment of the United Nations transition Assistance Group provide the best means for ensuring the peaceful and orderly transition of the Territory to independence. We fully support these proposals, which are embodied in the recently adopted Security Council resolution 435 (1978);\n148.\tIt would indeed be a tragedy if South Africa at this stage turned its back and refused to co-operate with the United Nations in setting in motion the peace-keeping operations in Namibia. We call on South Africa to show political goodwill and to assist Namibia's accession to independence within the framework of the Security Council resolution, so that the people of the Territory will be able to enjoy the legitimate rights so long denied to them.\n149.\tIn Southern Rhodesia, the fraudulent internal settlement by the racist Smith regime can never provide a just solution to the problem. There can be no solution unless it is based on the wishes of the black majority, including the Patriotic Front. The so-called internal settlement is nothing but a deliberate and systematic plan designed to consolidate white racist minority rule. We reject this deceptive act. No permanent solution to the problem is possible unless it is consistent with the principle of majority rule, so as to ensure the right of the people of Zimbabwe to self-determination, justice, equality and freedom.\n150.\tIn South Africa, there is still no visible sign of a change in the apartheid policies of the racist regime. On the contrary, that regime has intensified its oppression and instituted bantustans which are aimed at depriving the people of the Territory of their citizenship and legitimate rights. It is indeed a tragic situation where millions of the people there are still unable to enjoy their birthright and to live in peace, justice and equality. The recent World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination has condemned apartheid in the strongest terms and urged more concrete international action to eradicate this evil from our midst [see A/33/2621. My delegation has always held the view that no measure which does not include economic sanctions, including an oil embargo, would be effective in changing the policy of the South African regime. The Security Council should urgently consider the application of such mandatory sanctions before the situation erupts into open violence.\n151.\tIn the field of disarmament, the problem of the escalating arms race continues to pose a serious threat to international peace and security. The principles and priorities for disarmament negotiations drawn up by the tenth special session, on disarmament [see resolution S-10/2] should be implemented as soon as possible. We \u2022hope the deliberative and negotiating bodies established by\nthe special session will give priority attention to drawing up measures that will halt and reverse the wasteful arms race, stop all nuclear-weapon tests and reduce the stockpiles of nuclear weapons with a view to their complete elimination. I think the Assembly will agree with me that more urgent action is needed both multilaterally through concerted action in the United Nations, which bears the primary responsibility in this field, and bilaterally, particularly between the two leading nuclear-weapon States in the context of the negotiations proceeding within the framework of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. We do, indeed, live in a finite world, and certainly the resources released from military expenditures could usefully be diverted to economic development, particularly for the developing countries. We look forward to the early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty and to negotiations to begin the process of genuine disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, so that we can live in a world free from the constant threat of destruction.\n152.\tLet me turn next to the situation in my part of the world, South-East Asia. Malaysia, together with our other partners in the Association of South East Asian Nations, has always been strongly committed to promoting friendship, understanding and co-operation among the countries in South-East Asia. We believe that it is through regional co-operation that we can harness our efforts and resources to promote the well-being of our people. The Association is indeed strongly committed to regionalism, and, in translating this concept into practice, we are creating the conditions that would be conducive not only to forging greater understanding but also to bringing about long-term peace and stability that would be to the interest of all the countries in the region. It is a task which should be shared by all. The participation of all the countries in South-East Asia is all the more imperative now in the present situation, and only through co-operation can we act in concert in shaping the evolution of a peaceful, prosperous and stable South-East Asia for the well-being of our peoples.\n153.\tMalaysia is also committed to the establishment of a zone of peace, freedom and- neutrality in South-East Asia. The return to peaceful and stable conditions in the region would be an important contribution towards realizing such a concept. We believe that the establishment of such a zone free from outside interference and big-Power rivalry would secure for the region lasting peace and stability. The special session devoted to disarmament, it will be recalled, has noted the interest of the countries in the region in the establishment of such a zone in South-East Asia. There is indeed growing support for the proposal, and we are confident that the discussion on the matter will produce further progress towards its implementation.\n154.\tAn equally, if not more, important task for the United Nations now and in the years ahead is to address itself fully to the prevailing multifarious international economic problems by continually keeping up the momentum of the North-South dialogue until the solution to those problems is found. Hence, it is not only expected of, but also imperative for, the United Nations, as an international forum with universal participation, to be actively involved in the process of global negotiations relating to the establishment of the New International Economic Order, to which my Government is fully committed. For this reason, my delegation reiterates its full support for the mandate of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, or the Committee of the Whole, on the establishment of that New Economic Order. The Committee cannot and must not fail in its task, since there is no alternative to it within the United Nations system if the United Nations is to play a major and meaningful role and to contribute positively towards the promotion of global economic interdependence.\n155.\tUnfortunately, despite the acceptance of the importance and value of equal partnership in international economic co-operation, little progress has been made in practical action towards its implementation. This unsatisfactory state of affairs, as well as the lack of real progress in other areas of relevance to the establishment of the New International Economic Order, is a matter of serious concern to the developing countries, as reflected in the declaration of the Foreign Ministers of the Group of 77, who met in New York on 29 September [A/331278, annex]. The hardships being experienced by the developing countries are further intensified by the current depressing state of the world economy as a result mainly of divergent and uncoordinated economic policies pursued by the major industrially developed countries without giving due attention and regard to the interests of the developing countries. It seems ironic and indeed unbelievable that what has been and is happening on the international economic scene in the last couple of years has been completely against and in direct contradiction of all that for which the developing countries are clamouring.\n156.\tAs my delegation see? it, there is only one way in which we could all overcome the .recurring problems responsible for the chaotic situation of the global economy. That panacea is nothing less than complete and outright structural changes in the existing outmoded pattern of international economic relations, to be achieved only with the establishment of the New International Economic Order.\n157.\tTo that end, we would urge the developed countries to demonstrate, as they have not done before, sincere and genuine political goodwill and to undertake a positive commitment to negotiate seriously and meaningfully with the developing countries for concrete and mutually beneficial agreements on the many issues at present featured in the North-South dialogue, with a view to finding a lasting solution to them.\n158.\tOne issue that is of direct concern to my delegation is the establishment of the common fund, as well as the Integrated Programme for Commodities, the importance of which to the majority of developing countries hardly needs any further elaboration here. We hope that the resumption of the negotiating conference on the common fund scheduled for next month will end successfully with a decision for the expeditious operation of the Fund.\n159.\tOther matters equally important to the developing countries relate to the multilateral trade negotiations, the transfer of resources in real terms to developing countries, debt and food problems of developing countries, the conversion of UNIDO into a specialized agency, the reorganization of the international financial and monetary system and adequate and appropriate preparations for the new international development strategy. We hope that the negotiations on these problems in their respective forums will be able to achieve real progress as soon as possible before 1980, so that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in that year may be assured of success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff210.\tI am particularly happy to be able in my turn to congratulate the President on. his election to that. important post at the thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. The unanimity of the choice is the most eloquent testimony to his competence, and thus offers his dynamic qualities a new field of action in keeping with his qualifications and experience as a statesman.\n211.\tI also wish to pay a deserved tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Mojsov, who had the great and rare privilege of presiding over four sessions of our Assembly, which enabled him to confirm his reputation as a highly skilled and competent diplomat, devoted to the cause of peace and the progress of mankind.\n212.\tMy delegation is happy to welcome Solomon Islands, which now takes its rightful place and is assuming its role in the concert of nations. We assure it of our readiness to co-operate with it in accordance with the ideals and principles of our Charter.\n213.\tMy presence at this rostrum also offers me a pleasant opportunity to assure the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, once again of our friendship and our confidence in him, and to express the deep appreciation of the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau of the results he has obtained in his tireless efforts to find just solutions to the problems which the community of nations faces. I should like to congratulate him on the competence and dynamism that he has always evinced in the discharge of his important and difficult mission.\n214.\tThe attention of the African peoples, when not turned to economic problems, is always directed to the conflicts on the African continent.\n215.\tIndeed, at a time when the international community, aware of the dangers that threaten it, is dealing with the problem of peace, since that is the essential basis for a world of justice and progress, there has been a geographical movement of world tension in the direction of Africa, and this has created new hotbeds of tension and the most deadly conflicts.\n216.\tAlthough some among us, because of the Balkanization of Africa, may have become accustomed to the existence of minor conflicts here and there, they very nature and alarming dimensions of recent events make it impossible for us to remain passive, and prompt us to act with realism and calmness. We believe that any dispute that may arise among African States can be settled in a just and peaceful manner based on the spirit of dialogue and tolerance characteristic of African traditions.\n217.\tAfrica, of course, wishes to contribute to the creation of a modern world of progress and happiness for all. Because of its technological backwardness, it needs aid and support in its development efforts. But this co-operation based on solidarity and mutual respect, for which we appeal whole-heartedly, must not be subject to bargaining or be subordinated to an ideological alliance, for it is not in the interest of African States to belong to one or another camp. That explains why all independent African States belong to the non-aligned movement. The formation of blocs in Africa can only arouse rivalries and call into question African unity, which all African States are determined to build, step by step.\n218.\tIndeed only that unity can constitute an effective means to battle any ideological convulsions, any attempts at division, or any external interference\u2014in a word, any action contrary to the development of the African personality or to the independence and development of Africa.\n219.\tIt is precisely because we are aware of the moral responsibility incumbent on the independent African States in the struggle for the total liberation of that continent, and because we realize the importance of the contribution which they could make to the acceleration of that process, that we perceive the need to spare Africa from ideological antagonisms which, when grafted to the difficulties already assailing its economy and hindering its development, might distract African peoples from the historical role which they should play in bringing about a totally free and prosperous Africa.\n220.\tIt is therefore for the purpose of participating as best we can in the liberation of oppressed peoples and in the elimination of the policies of discrimination and apartheid that we wish to encourage the awakening of a community conscience and to unite our forces so as to act in solidarity for the defence of basic human rights and for the self-determination of peoples.\n221.\tThe situation is southern Africa, which remains one of the essential concerns of our Organization, has not made the progress that is indispensable for the creation of an atmosphere of peace in that region.\n222.\tIn South Africa our African brothers still suffer in apartheid's innumerable prisons. But need I describe the crimes of genocide perpetrated by the South African regime?\n223.\tThe international community |s well aware of them, having decided a number of years ago to unite its efforts in order to isolate the racist Pretoria regime and create conditions favourable to the replacement of that arbitrary and repressive system with a more just system, one responding to the aspirations of the majority of the population\u2014a more humane system, based on dignity and respect for the human being. The United Nations, however, despite its laudable efforts, has yet to back up its action with the means of pressure and coercion available to it in order to ensure that its decisions are respected and implemented. Obviously, the United Nations is not a court of justice, but, given the constant denunciation of the attitude of certain countries contrary to the aspirations to peace on the part of all mankind, the United Nations could contribute to a better realization of the dangers which threaten peace in that region.\n224.\tIn Zimbabwe, the ability to resist and the successes of the heroic struggle waged by the Patriotic Front have led to the desperate attempts of which we are all aware. In fact, the so-called internal negotiations, the nature and objectives of which we need hardly recall, cannot meet the legitimate aspirations of the heroic Zimbabwean people, which has clearly understood that they are perfidious manoeuvres designed to direct the problem towards a neo-colonialist solution,\n225.\tThe Zimbabwean fighters, under the aegis of the Patriotic Front, have reacted conscientiously and responsibly to that masquerade. Meanwhile, contemporary history provides many examples of agreements signed and commitments imposed which did not exactly reflect the genuine will of the struggling peoples, but were rapidly transformed into instruments for the total liberation of those peoples.\n226.\tThat means that, whatever the manoeuvres of the rebel Ian Smith and his clique, the spirit of sacrifice and combativeness of the true sons of Zimbabwe will inevitably lead that brother people to genuine independence. It is in this perspective that we support any action of the international community to extend to the Patriotic Front all the material, political and diplomatic aid it might require in its liberation struggle.\n227.\tIn Namibia, we are witnesses to the establishment of structures that are supposed to lead to that Territory's independence. The international community cannot, of course, but follow with dose interest and support the establishment of the indispensable machinery for the transfer of power to the genuine representatives of the Namibian people. But in this process, which has just started, the essential modalities have not yet been clarified and are being challenged. And despite every effort made by. the United Nations to find a peaceful solution to the Namibian problem, the racist Pretoria Government has once again challenged the international community by taking the unilateral decision to' organize so-called elections in Namibia.\n228.\tThe Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, for its part, will maintain its militant solidarity with\nSWAPO and will spare no sacrifice to support United Nations efforts to restore to the Namibian people their legitimate rights and to re-establish peace in the region.\n229.\tLast year, before this Assembly,  we affirmed our unwavering solidarity with the brother people of the Sahara. The striking successes attained by the liberation struggle of the Frente POLISARIO,\\\" whose combativeness and spirit of sacrifice we honour, encourages us in our conviction as to the inevitable end of that struggle.\n230.\tThat is why my delegation, which is aware of the latest events in that part of Africa, wishes once again to voice its support for the Frente POLISARIO in its tireless efforts to restore the rights of the Saharan people, in accordance with United Nations resolutions. It is also with the aim of contributing effectively to the efforts of the Organization of African Unity and of the United Nations to .find a just and peaceful solution to this conflict that my Government welcomes and supports any initiative which might bring the parties concerned to the negotiating table and to satisfactory results.\n231.\tIn the Middle East the situation remains alarming. Once again we must draw attention to the terrible sufferings endured by the brother people of Palestine and call on the international community to intensify its aid to that martyred people. We have, of course, been following closely the efforts undertaken to achieve a negotiated solution to the problem. But in the opinion of our Government, as long as the Palestinian people remain absent from the negotiating table, and as long as their real interests are not taken into account, the peace process will remain deadlocked, and the successes achieved will be ephemeral.\n232.\tAny settlement obtained to the detriment of the freedom and dignity of the Palestinian people cannot be considered to be a real peace settlement, either in spirit or as regards its lasting nature, because to be able to arrive at a just and lasting solution of the Middle East problem there can be no prior conditions other than the withdrawal of the Israeli troops from the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and the recognition of the right of the Arab people to self-determination, including the establishment of an independent Palestinian State, and its recognition internationally.\n233.\tThe international community is in duty bound to show severe intransigence regarding the rights of the Palestinians and must compel Israel finally to begin genuine negotiations and concessions, because despite many optimistic voices the road to peace seems far distant.\n234.\tIt is in the spirit of sincere concern for peace in the Middle East and a desire to see the ideals of justice and brotherhood triumph in the region that I renew to the Palestinian people and to the Palestinian Liberation Organization the assurance of the unflagging solidarity of the people and the Government of Guinea-Bissau.\n235.\tDespite many condemnations by the international community of the policy of aggression and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations with respect to East Timor and populations of that Territory continue to suffer the worst oppression and to endure the most abject humiliations. Indeed, in the face of the heroic struggle of the heroic fighters of the Frente Revolucionario de Timor Leste Independente the aggressors do not hesitate to perpetrate the most odious crimes, massacring men, women -and children in order to be able to perpetuate their domination. The international community, as we have said, having pronounced itself unequivocally on the illegal and irresponsible nature of this arbitrary occupation, must take more appropriate measures to prevent Member States with expansionist designs from being able to abridge the freedom of others and totally trample underfoot the dignity of men who, as in East Timor, have paid with their blood the heavy cost of liberation from colonial domination.\n236.\tAgain with respect to illegal occupation, my delegation once again wishes to express its concern over the situation which prevails in Mayotte. The illegal occupation of Mayotte is contrary to the rules which govern relations among sovereign States and what is necessary is not a demonstration of force, but the finding as early as possible of a just solution that would take account of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Comoros.\n237.\tAt a time when the international community has set itself the objective of building a world from which the spectre of war will be banished, my delegation welcomes the decisions taken at the conclusion of the special session devoted to disarmament; and my country, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, pledges itself to support within the limits of its ability a fruitful and permanent co-operation with the efforts of the international community with a view to maintaining peace.\n238.\tWhile they constitute no more than a step towards a general and complete disarmament, which our peoples ardently yearn for, so as to prevent a planetary conflagration, the documents which were adopted, including the Programme of Action [resolution S-10/2, sect. Ill], have raised new hopes and created conditions conducive to a better awareness by peoples of the importance of peace for their well-being and continued development. Peace is one and therefore indivisible, so it is the imperative duty of all mankind to maintain and strengthen it.\n239.\tBut peace does not mean merely a non-existence of war between the great Powers. The struggle for peace demands of all nations of the world the elimination of all forms of oppression, discrimination and exploitation of man by man, as well as of violations of human rights which cannot but engender violence, which inevitably brings more violence. The consolidation of peace therefore requires the building of a multidimensional structure and, by agreement and compromise among States, profound changes in the attitude of man.\n240.\tGenuine peace cannot exist except through mutual understanding and respect, the establishment and strengthening of relations of friendship and solidarity among all nations, without distinction, the elimination of the continually aggravated inequality among people and, finally, the ending of the scandalous waste of resources and energy on the unbridled arms race.\n241.\tThe gravity of the problems which the third world confronts means that the developing countries must understand more than ever the imperative necessity of the maximum effort to consolidate their national independence and to strengthen their struggle by calling into question the structures of imperialist and neo-colonialist exploitation through the organization of effective cooperation and close solidarity within international, regional and subregional organizations.\n242.\tThe action being taken by the non-aligned countries for their economic liberation, which received a broad response at the Belgrade Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, further strengthens the unity of action of the Group of 77.\n243.\tOn the basis of the provisions of the Charter of Algiers,23 the Lima Declaration,  and the resolutions adopted at the Buenos Aires Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries,  there is a growing affirmation and definition of the desire on the part of the countries of the third world to undertake actions of co-operation and regional integration.\n244.\tThese various stages constitute a transition from passive claims to the affirmation of the will of the developing countries to rely first of all on their own individual and collective resources, to take over the defence of their fundamental interests, and to determine for themselves how they wish to develop.\n245.\tThe Disarmament Decade and the second session of UNCTAD provided for the transfer of considerable resources from the industrialized countries to the developing countries. However, we note with alarm that vast human and material resources are being diverted from economic and social activities to a senseless arms race. Financial aid from the industrial countries to the developing countries four years ago totalled $20 billion. In that same year expenditures on arms amounted to $300 billion.\n246.\tThis situation gravely jeopardizes the attainment and success of the objectives set by the international community for development, particularly the reduction in a foreseeable future of the gap which separates the developing from the industrial countries.\n247.\tWith a few exceptions the developed countries, despite numerous declarations filled with good intentions, do everything to maintain the advantages which they have given themselves. We can never sufficiently denounce such selfish conduct, for the gulf which separates the rich from the poor is inimical to human dignity and to international peace and security in so far as it can lead three fourths of mankind to take unforeseeable actions for their own survival.\n248.\tWe note that the very principles of the new international economic order, although generally accepted, meet great reluctance when it comes to their application.\n249.\tIt is because of the persistence with which the \\\"have\\\" countries cling to their privileges and because of their lack of political will for conciliation that so many international gatherings fail to fulfil the hopes placed in them, whether it be the fourth session of UNCTAD, the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation or the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.\n250.\tThe fourth session of UNCTAD, for example, which was held at Nairobi in 1976, was to take up the fundamental problems of long-term development. Later certain decisions were to be taken immediately and specifically for the adoption of precise programmes of implementation for problems that require operational action. We are thinking in particular of the case of commodities and the external indebtedness of the developing countries.\n251.\tThe results obtained seem to us to be hardly satisfactory. Nevertheless, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is pleased that there was a consensus regarding the essential points of the Integrated Programme for Commodities. The provisions of the resolution on that Programme contained some innovations and improvements regarding commodities. We are convinced that this resolution constitute an acceptable framework within which the problem of commodities will be discussed in the future.\n252.\tWe also consider it squally important and indicative of a certain awareness that there was a determination to apply the decision adopted at Nairobi to begin negotiations on a certain number of products which are of special interest to the developing countries.\n253.\tIt is regrettable that the problem of the external indebtedness of the developing countries was not dealt with constructively at Nairobi. The countries of the third world have indeed throughout the years exhausted their reserves and accumulated enormous external debts which impose heavy burdens on them and hamper their development. We hope that at the fifth session of UNCTAD, which is to be held in Manila, it will be possible to respond to the fundamental aspirations of the developing countries and thus contribute to the establishment of a better balance among nations.\n254.\tThese are the concerns of my .delegation in regard to certain items on the agenda of this Assembly . Allow me to reiterate the total willingness of my country, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, to contribute to promoting joint initiatives which will lead to the solution of the conflicts which affect mankind.\n255.\tFinally, I should like to express the hope that the thirty-third session of the General Assembly of the United\nNations will live up to the hope? of peoples and of the international community and will satisfy their desire for peace and harmony.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n1.\tMr. President, on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, I congratulate you or. your election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and wish you success in this responsible post. I should like also to extend my congratulations to the newly-admitted Member of the United Nations\u2014Solomon Islands.\n2.\tIn spite of the complicated and conflicting international situation, the period following the thirty-second session of the General Assembly has abounded in vigorous action aimed at the further deepening of the process of detente and at the strengthening of peace in the world. The countries of the socialist community and the peace-loving forces have continued their efforts for the elimination of international conflicts, and for enriching the specific content of the policy of peaceful coexistence between States \\\"with different social systems. In a number of regions in the world aggressors have suffered defeat. There has been further intensification of the struggle for the self-determination and national independence of the oppressed peoples and for the elimination of racism, racial discrimination and apartheid.\n3.\tThere have \\\"been positive results in the European continent, where the process of reconstruction of international relations in conformity with the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, adopted 'at Helsinki on August 1975 goes on. It is particularly important now for all States which participated in the Conference to adhere to and implement strictly the principles and agreements that have become the foundation of detente and co-operation on the continent.\n4.\tThe situation in the Balkan peninsula is also developing favourably. Co-operation among States is becoming ever richer in content, and its forms are becoming ever more diversified. The People's Republic of Bulgaria is striving to \novercome prejudices and distrust, for business-like and concrete solutions of various issues and for strengthening good-neighbourly relations, so as to turn our backs once and for all on the black pages of the past in relations with neighbouring States. We look upon history as a source of useful experience and wisdom and not as a source for the poisoning of contemporary relations. We believe that the peoples of the Balkan countries will not allow relations among themselves to be influenced by intrigues and by the encroachments of forces which are hostile to detente, peace and co-operation. As the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Chairman of the Council of State of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, Todor Zhivkov, said in his speech in the city of Blagoyevgrad on 15 June:\n\\\"Our deep and sincere desire is to look towards the future, to build up on new foundations the political, economic and cultural relations between the Balkan peoples and States, and to move forward along the road to good neighbourly relations and co-operation. Our policy towards all Balkan States is one of principle, consistent and lasting. It does not depend on short-term considerations. It is in keeping with the interests of neighbouring countries and peoples and, of course, with the vital interests of the Bulgarian people \\\"\n5.\tAlong with the undeniable successes which have occurred in easing confrontation and strengthening peaceful coexistence among States with different social systems, some negative events have occurred in international relations during the past year. The opponents of detente are trying to return the world to the dark days of the \\\"cold war\\\" and to speed up a new round in the spiraling arms race. The long-term programme the North Atlantic Treaty Organization approved at its last session, which it is estimated will cost another S80 billion, will lead to a colossal increase in the scale of armaments. That programme is an open challenge to the will of the peoples of the whole world who desire to see genuine results promptly obtained in curbing the arms race. In order to justify that policy, member States of that Organization have time and again resorted to the worn-out and well-known allegation about the presence of a military threat on the part of the States signatories of the Warsaw Treaty. We are convinced that, despite this zealous and biased propaganda, world public opinion will not allow itself to be misled and that it is well aware of the real designs of the militaristic circles to tip the existing military balance in their favour.\n6.\tIt is necessary to do away once and for all with the anachronistic pattern of thinking on questions of peace and security as well as the outmoded stereotypes engendered by the inertia of the past and based on military superiority. There can be no doubt that the policy of the position of strength is not in keeping with the realities of the present-day world. In a nuclear age, that policy has become increasingly unfitted as a means of settling disputes among States. It is particularly sterile to pursue it vis-\u00e0-vis the countries of the socialist community and the sooner that truth is grasped the better it will be for mankind and for world peace.\n7.\tWe are convinced that the conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations would give new impetus to the extension of detente to all regions of the world and decisively reduce the danger of a military conflagration.\n8.\tWith the unanimous adoption of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security  the States Members of the United Nations have reaffirmed their desire to apply the principles of the Charter as well as the other generally accepted principles and declarations whose aim is to strengthen international peace and security and promote good-neighbourly relations and co-operation.\n9.\tIn recent years, however, certain circles in the West have assumed the role of an international judge for the observance of human rights in various countries and have been interfering in the internal affairs of those countries. It is to be noted that the most zealous \\\"champions\\\" of human rights apparently do not deem it necessary to concern themselves with the rights of citizens of their own countries, although they are in the case of many of them in a sorry state. Exploiters, aggressors, colonialists and racists have no moral grounds whatsoever to talk about human rights. The People's Republic of Bulgaria rejects any attempt to interfere in the domestic affairs of States on any pretext whatsoever.\n10.\tIn our view, the main task today is to strengthen detente and not to allow a return to the \\\"cold war\\\"; to prevent the launching of a new round of the arms race and to make a start on genuine disarmament. That would be in keeping with the aspirations and interests of all nations in the world.\n11.\tThe development of the international situation strengthens our profound conviction that the maintenance of peace and security in the world and the ensuring of normal conditions of life and creative work for its peoples and for their well-being and progress are inseparable from the struggle to end the arms race and bring about disarmament.\n12.\tThe tenth special session of the General Assembly, which was devoted to disarmament, confirmed the urgent necessity to take prompt co-ordinated measures to bring about military detente. The Final Document which it adopted /resolution S-10/2/ defines the basic areas on which the concerted efforts of States Members of the United Nations should be focused. In our opinion, now is the time to take, without delay, practical measures to halt the arms race and give an impetus to real disarmament.\n13.\tWe share the view that the principal and most urgent task before us now is to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war. An important step along the road leading to that goal would be the initiation of talks, with the participation of all nuclear States, for the conclusion of a treaty on the discontinuance of the production of nuclear weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles.\n14.\tA new contribution to the stabilization of the international situation and the reduction of the danger of a thermonuclear war would be the conclusion of a convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States. In this connection, the proposal set \nforth in the letter [A/33/241] of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Mr. Andrei Gromyko, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, is of great importance. It is our conviction that this session should devote the bulk of its attention to that proposal and take an appropriate decision on it.\n15.\tA particularly important role on the European continent could be played by the acceptance of a proposal, made by the States signatories of the Warsaw Treaty, to the effect that States participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe would undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against each other.\n16.\tThe conclusion of an international treaty on a general prohibition of the development and production of new types of weapons and systems of mass destruction would do a great deal to contribute to the discontinuation of the arms race.\n17.\tOne of the immediate tasks of the Committee on Disarmament should be the preparation of a treaty banning the manufacture and the use of the neutron weapon. We hope that common sense and far-sightedness will prevail and that the resolute condemnation of plans for the production of this barbaric weapon, as well as the demand for its unconditional prohibition, will be taken into account.\n18.\tAt the present time an extremely positive role could be played by the successful completion of negotiations which are now being conducted on various questions of disarmament. The proposals submitted by the socialist countries in Vienna at the talks on the reduction of arms and armed forces in Central Europe have provided an opportunity for achieving results which would in no way impair the security of any State and which would reduce military confrontation in this region that is so vital for the security of the entire continent. Taking into account the great significance of the Soviet-United States negotiations on the limitation of strategic offensive weapons, we hope that the artificial barriers being set up throughout these talks will be lifted. All the necessary conditions exist for the successful completion also of the talks on the cessation of nuclear weapons and on the prohibition of chemical, radiological and other types of weapons.\n19.\tThe question of the universality of the international treaties and agreements concluded thus far in this field is of great importance for curbing the arms race. The People's Republic of Bulgaria has signed and ratified all basic documents in this area. It is in the interests of the peace and security of nations that all States should follow suit, particularly the nuclear States and those countries which possess a considerable military potential.\n20.\tOur country is in favour of reducing the military budgets of States, above all those of the permanent members of the Security Council. Such a measure would have a beneficial impact on the development of all countries, particularly the developing ones.\n21.\tWe whole-heartedly support the decision of the special session to convene a world disarmament conference as early as possible, because we believe that this session of the General Assembly should lay down the time for the convening of that conference and embark upon practical preparations for it.\n127. As a participant of long standing in the negotiations on disarmament in Geneva, the People's Republic of Bulgaria highly appreciates the contribution of that important forum to efforts to resolve the problems of disarmament. We are convinced that the Committee on Disarmament can produce even more substantial results provided that there is sincere interest and that all participants make serious and unswerving efforts.\n128-. There are dangerous hotbeds of tension and war conflicts which continue to be whipped up in some parts of the world and exert a negative influence on international relations and pose a serious threat to world peace.\n129.\tThe task of solving peacefully and justly the Middle East problem is becoming increasingly urgent in nature. There has been complete confirmation of the truth that the road of separate talks can only serve to aggravate the conflict, to impede the just cause of the Arab peoples and to make even further removed a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East crisis as a whole. In our view, the Camp David agreements lead precisely in that direction, despite the attempts of the countries which participated in those talks to convince the world of their success.\n130.\tThe Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria is convinced that the establishment of a lasting peace in the Middle East requires above all a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967, the implementation and guaranteeing of the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine, including their right to self-determination and the creation of their own State, and the guaranteeing of the independent existence of all States in the area. The most effective forum for a comprehensive peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem is the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East under the co-chairmanship of th2 Soviet Union and the United States of America, with the participation of all parties to the conflict, including the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n131.\tIt is our view that the Cyprus question must be resolved in a way which would be in keeping with vital interests of the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots, and with the interests of peace in the area of the Balkan peninsula and the eastern Mediterranean. The attainment of these objectives requires a political solution of the question which would ensure the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus.\n132.\tThe \\\"international community is and has recently been seriously concerned with the hegemonistic course-of the policy of the leadership of the People's Republic of China, which is creating ever-increasing difficulties for the strengthening of peace and detente. In order to achieve its great-Power goals, it stops at nothing and is resorting to all kinds of pressure, from the cessation of the so-called selfless assistance right up to the instigation of armed conflicts and direct participation in them. This dangerous policy, which is inimical to the interests of peace and international co-operation, has also found expression in the provocative actions against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. There can be no doubt, however, that the heroic Vietnamese people, tempered as they have been in the struggle against imperialism and for freedom and independence, will be capable of resisting any such pressure.\n133.\tThe period between the thirty-second regular session and the current session of the General Assembly was marked by the active struggle of colonial and dependent peoples, fully supported by democratic and progressive forces throughout the world, for self-determination and national independence against racism, racial discrimination and apartheid. The decisions of the ninth special session on Namibia, as well as those of the World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, held at Geneva in August, have once again shown which are the forces trying to preserve their colonial domination, to delay the revolutionary liberation process in Africa and to undermine progressive regimes. These decisions clearly indicate that the unity of the African countries, of all democratic and progressive forces, is a guarantee of their victory over the colonialists.\n134.\tThe Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian people support the struggle of oppressed peoples for national liberation and the elimination of racism and racial discrimination. We have been rendering, and will continue to render, assistance and support to the newly-liberated countries struggling against aggression and neo-colonialism, for the independent and democratic development of those countries.\n135.\tThe United Nations and its Member States devoted considerable attention in the past year to the problem of the restructuring of international economic relations. The promotion of international economic co-operation on a just and democratic basis will promote the elimination of inequality in international economic relations, as well as of the exploitation of developing countries by developed capitalist States and the economic dependence of the former upon the latter.\n136.\tWe are categorically opposed to discrimination in international economic relations, just as we are opposed to attempts to link the promotion of economic. relations between States with the fulfilment of certain conditions. Such attempts have nothing in common with international co-operation and are doomed to fail.\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize, that as a member of the socialist community, the People's Republic of Bulgaria will continue to make its contribution to the strengthening of the United Nations so as to make it an active and efficient instrument for the preservation of world peace and for the security and well-being of all peoples.\n"

Your experience and skill will help to ensure a fruitful\nAssembly session. I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Mojsov of Yugoslavia, who ably led the Assembly through no less than four sessions during his year of office.\n109.\tWhen the United Nations was established at the end of the Second World War, the British Empire covered one eighth of the world's land surface and had a population of over 500 million. In the years since then, 35 independent States have emerged from among the people and territories that made up that Empire and have taken their place among the nations of the world. There can be no clearer testimony to the commitment of successive British Governments to the principle of self-determination.\n110.\tToday we are left with a handful of small dependent Territories which, because of their particular circumstances, have not become independent States.\n111.\tIt has been the firm policy of the present British Government to give every encouragement and support to those Territories which seek independence. It was in fulfilment of that policy that Solomon Islands became an independent nation earlier this year and so the one hundred and fiftieth Member of the United Nations. In a few days' time, on 1 October, yet another country, Tuvalu, will celebrate its independence and will apply for membership in the specialized agencies. The Gilbert Islands have already reached the stage of full internal self-government, and we hope they will achieve independence in 1979. In the Anglo-French condominium of the New Hebrides, a programme has been agreed which will lead to independence by 1980. Among the West Indies Associated States, which are in voluntary association with Britain, Dominica will move to independence on 3 November this year. Discussions are continuing on the constitutional future of the other States.\n112.\tOur policy is to respect the wish of the peoples of our remaining dependent Territories to determine their own future in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, to uphold that Charter in all its respects, and to put support for the United Nations at the centre of our foreign policy.\n113.\tPeople all over the world read in their newspapers day by day graphic accounts of systematic murders, cold-blooded tortures and the debilitating ravages of famine and disease. They watch pictures on television of grotesque sufferings caused by the dictatorial actions of Governments or by natural disasters. Most people hope that those countries and agencies which can do so well take practical steps to alleviate this misery; they do not want to find themselves in similar circumstances. Discussion and words of condemnation or sympathy are not enough. Ordinary people want to see real evidence that those who offend against the norms of civilized society are not accepted as members of it and that the effects of malnutrition and monsoon are mitigated for everyone. One of the United Kingdom's major aims is to encourage the strengthening of the United Nations capacity to protect human rights.\n114.\tIn upholding our Charter commitments, we, the Member States, must pay more attention to the mechanics of how in our daily business we move from dialogue to negotiation, from general principles to specific detailed agreements, from rhetoric to action and from general support to binding commitments. No world organization can ever build up its strength, authority and effectiveness without developing and adopting a machinery which would enable its member States as a whole to make decisions sure in the knowledge that they will be carried out. It is, of course, not a new problem, but it is an urgent one. It is not enough to have a dialogue between rich and poor to redress inequalities. The millions outside looking in on our meetings, debates, special sessions and committees rightly expect progress. Most of them are realistic -- they recognize the limitations; but once year at least we should examine our record objectively and seek to learn from the past year to improve our performance for the coming year.\n115.\tIt cannot yet be said our people have fully appreciated the immense importance of the relationship between the developed and the developing countries. The North- South dialogue in which we are engaged is not an elaborate stalking operation, where bureaucrats spend days and weeks locked in discussions which produce little agreement. It is potentially a deeply divisive issue and a central factor in world economic management. It can mean literally life or death for millions. There is a challenge here for the Governments of all countries. For the more developed countries the challenge is to be prepared for adaptation and change in the creation and distribution of new wealth in the world, and to generate the fullest public support for tackling the great disparity between the standards of life in fortunate countries, such as mine, and those which obtain over vast areas of the globe. For the less developed countries the challenge is to maintain the necessary disciplines both to enable them to achieve a rapid but stable expansion, with an equitable sharing of the benefits, and to continue to take part constructively in the search for an agreed approach to the problems and a shared responsibility for finding solutions.\n116.\tIt would be a failure of statesmanship on both sides if the North-South dialogue, as in the early 1970s, became again an exchange of sterile slogans between spokesmen for the developing countries on the one hand and spokesmen for the developed countries on the other. Conducted in these terms the dialogue becomes a forum for rhetoric and confrontation instead of a co-operative enterprise from which all our countries and all our peoples will gain. We have risen above this, but we have not yet focused our attention collectively, and with understanding, on the specific problems: for example the optimal management .of the world's limited resources of raw materials, energy, finance, the transfer of resources from the rich to the poorer countries, and the problem of coping imaginatively with problems of adjustment so that the output of the newly industrialized countries can find its place in the world's markets. We will need more understanding, greater political resolve and imagination in the months ahead as we approach the fifth session of UNCTAD in May of next year and the special session in 1980. The United Kingdom recently decided that, as part of our aid policy, we would take immediate steps to relieve the debt burden of the poorest countries. The total amount of principal and interest involved in some \u00a3900 million, or $1.8 billion. This was a decision to give practical expression to the agreement negotiated within UNCTAD. It reflects our willingness to take action to show low genuine compromises can be achieved within the North-South dialogue. So far seven countries have taken a similar decision. For us it was a tough, political decision, which will undeniably cost jobs at home and be a charge on our balance of payments. There is no comfortable solution. Politicians will have to fight for these measures in the world; and then defend them at home.\t\n117.\tUnderstanding and imagination will need to be shown by those relatively rich countries which at present stand aside from the common efforts of the rest of the world to help the developing countries. I believe that the Soviet Union and its partners are beginning to realize that there is a growing recognition among developing countries of the irrelevance of the time-worn excuse that the so-called \\\"colonial legacy\\\" of former imperial Powers means that the Communist countries can absolve themselves of any responsibility for helping the developing countries. I hope they also realize that the increasingly close economic interrelationships between countries of different systems and at different levels of development give all countries a- shared interest in helping the less fortunate to make progress.\n118.\tThe divide between rich and poor is everyone's problem and everyone's responsibility. The economics of all countries are now so closely interlinked that none of us can find solutions by battening down the hatches and hoping to find some isolated-or protected-salvation. On the contrary, continued economic growth in the developing countries has an important part to play in supporting the health of the world economy. But the scope for sustained growth in the developing countries will of course be limited until the economies of the industrialized countries move out of recession- Recession in the West-or North\u2014means receding hopes for the economies of the South. This is the reality and this is one of the reasons why my Government has spared no effort this year to bring about concerted action to restore confidence and growth round the world. The results of the July Bonn Economic Summit Conference show that there is a collective understanding at the highest level in the Western world of the need to stimulate growth, to make the most of our scarce energy resources, to avoid taking precipitate protectionist action and to get increased resources flowing 'to those countries where they are most needed.\n119.\tA major and acknowledged obstacle to these endeavours is the vast accumulation of military power which drains away scarce resources urgently needed for economic and social development. Four months ago here in this Assembly Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers attended the tenth special session on disarmament. We hoped to see moves to check this process of gathering and spending of money on armaments and take some practical action towards arms control and disarmament.\n120.\tWhere did we get? While all States in the United Nations agreed on a Final Document [resolution S-10/2] expressing for the first time the views of all Member States on disarmament, much of it was so watered down that one gets the impression that everyone is in favour of disarmament until the moment that any proposal could actually affect them. The session admittedly encouraged more\nStates to take an active interest in disarmament. Two nuclear-weapon States which previously had not been involved in multilateral discussion of disarmament following the reform of the negotiating committee in Geneva will, it is hoped, now participate, and this is a welcome step. The involvement of non-governmental organizations in the debate was helpful and the special session stimulated greater public interest. The United Kingdom and other nuclear-weapon States gave the non-nuclear-weapon States important assurances that they would not be the subject of nuclear attack.\n121.\tThe need for action to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons\u2014one of the most crucial issues facing mankind- was recognized. But the dilemma of how to make available to all who need them the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear, energy without the risk of weapons proliferation was not squarely faced. My country has for some years made a financial sacrifice in not exporting some civilian nuclear equipment, materials and technology because of a fear of adding to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The existence of adequate safeguards to ensure that there is no fear of adding to the proliferation of nuclear weapons is also an essential condition of nuclear exports from the United Kingdom. But sophisticated countries still compete ruthlessly in the nuclear market place, and nuclear installations have become symbols of national sovereignty, so that any unwillingness to supply is wrongly seen as a political act. The Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1980 must look deeply at these matters, for I believe that it is possible for the equipment and services which are essential to a successful civil nuclear industry to be made available while minimizing the proliferation risk. Of course, one way to reinforce the non-proliferation regime is through the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones.\n122.\tIt was natural that many countries at the special session should place the emphasis on nuclear disarmament. That must be the major concern. But let us not forget that four fifths of the military expenditure in the world goes on conventional forces and weapons. The system of nuclear deterrence has helped to keep the peace in Europe for over 30 years. But what has happened elsewhere? According to one estimate, there have been over 120 wars in the world since 1945. Not one day has passed in which a war was not being fought somewhere in the world. War casualties since 1945 number tens of millions, all caused by conventional weapons.\n123.\tWe should give more attention to conventional arms control. The Final Document of the special session makes a negligible contribution to balanced reductions in military budgets and a halt to the world-wide build-up of conventional weapons. The brief and rather qualified reference to consultations on limiting transfers of conventional weapons is inadequate. The passage on reduction of military budgets is general and, unlike the Western draft programme of action, does not call for the testing of a means of measuring budgets so that actual reductions can be planned, with all the social and economic benefits that could ensue. In short, do not let anyone delude himself: an historic opportunity has been missed and we must resolve to achieve more at the next special session on disarmament. Otherwise another expensive session and a stream of words\nwill produce cynicism rather than commitment. A major reform is needed in the way we negotiate the final document. The political leaders make the speeches, but the final document is negotiated by officials. One senses in reading the words no clash of political view, no give-and- take. We appear to talk at each other rather than to each other, and so the bureaucratisation of international politics relentlessly proceeds. Declarations, principles abound, but action is relegated to second place.\n124.\tAt least in the bilateral negotiations being conducted between the United States and the Soviet Union to achieve a second strategic arms limitation agreement, one is aware of a political debate at the highest level between Presidents and Foreign Ministers. This is a vitally important negotiation and needs to be followed as soon as possible by further reductions in strategic offensive weapons as well as by controls on qualitative improvement.\n125.\tMy country, the United States and the Soviet Union are involved in negotiations on a comprehensive test ban. This would be entirely non-discriminatory; it could, if properly designed, curb the development of nuclear weapons and hinder their spread to more countries. We should like to see the widest possible adherence to the treaty, but that will only come if the non-nuclear-weapon States see the nuclear States as making a step-like change downwards in their development programme. There are some who want to take no action and to continue testing without any impediment to their scientific and technical plans- oblivious of the wider implications that would have for those States that need to be persuaded not to engage in testing themselves.\n126.\tAnother priority is to maintain and accelerate the momentum injected recently into the Vienna talks on mutual and balanced reduction of forces in Central Europe. The Eastern response to the latest Western proposals has been encouraging, although serious difficulties remain unresolved. The Western participants will be ready at the right moment to propose that the talks be raised to ministerial level. Without this kind of political input, caution will predominate, the years will go by, and we shall all complain about the gap or the imbalance in forces while it widens before our very eyes, as it has done in every year that the negotiations have continued. The prize for us all is an agreement providing a more stable relationship and a lower level of military confrontation in Europe. It could be a major achievement in arms control and detente, but it will not be achieved at the present tempo and style of the negotiations.\n127.\tIn one key area-peace-keeping\u2014the United Nations has responded extremely well throughout the year. My Government is totally committed to the concept of United\n\u2022 Nations peace-keeping. With our fellow-members of the European Community we shall be appealing to all members of the United Nations to reaffirm their support for United Nations peace-keeping measures. We have backed this support of principle with men, facilities and money.\n128.\tWe have recently reviewed our own national capacity to assist in the preparation and conduct of peace-keeping operations, and I am pleased to be able to make the following offer of support, which is in addition to our current contribution to United Nations forces in Cyprus\nand Lebanon. If requested, and subject to national commitments and exigencies, the United Kingdom will make available an infantry battalion group or a Royal Marine commando group for up to six months. The force will be available at seven days' notice and we shall airlift the force and its equipment to the area of operation. We shall also be willing to provide a small number of military personnel for duty as observers, and we shall consider as sympathetically as possible requests for other types of forces or forms of military assistance. In view of the experience which the United Kingdom armed forces have acquired in peacekeeping, we stand ready to share our knowledge and experience with others.\n129.\tWhen I addressed this Assembly a year ago,  I singled out Lebanon as an example of a situation where the United Nations should be involved in trying to resolve a major crisis before it occurred. In retrospect, I think we would all wish it had been possible to take more preventive action in spite of the difficulties. It took the Israeli military involvement in south Lebanon last March to make the international community fully aware of the vital need for the United Nations to play a part in that troubled country. Thereafter, the Security Council acted with admirable speed in securing the creation of UNIFIL to bring about the withdrawal of Israeli forces and to help the Lebanese Government to reintroduce its authority in the south. UNIFIL has undertaken its task with remarkable tenacity. It has faced great obstacles, but has nevertheless progressively fulfilled its mandate by military courage and skilful diplomacy. Already it has carried out the first part of its mandate; the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces has been effected. The difficult task of restoring the authority of the central Government in the south still lies ahead.\n130.\tBut this is not a problem they can solve in isolation. A solution to the problems in the south depends on a solution to the larger political crisis which still racks Lebanon. All Members of the United Nations committed to the restoration of the authority of the Lebanese Government throughout the country should make a determined effort to work urgently for a political solution to Lebanon's problems. Only a political solution can guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon and put an end to the internal fighting which threatens to destroy the country.\n131.\tPeace in Lebanon depends also upon a solution to the wider conflict between Israelis and Arabs. The Camp David meetings have given renewed hope that a just, durable and comprehensive settlement can be achieved. Many major questions remain to be resolved, and I do not underestimate the difficulties. Nevertheless, the gap between the two sides has narrowed significantly. 1 believe that the success of the Camp David framework agreement  was because it did get into detail, not just declare principles, and because it involved the two Presidents and the Prime Minister. The detailed provisions in the Sinai Accord for demilitarization, force reductions and United Nations involvement  are something which my Government has long advocated. The Camp David agreements provide, too, a reasonable basis on which realistic interim arrangements for the most difficult problem, the West Bank, can now, given the will, be negotiated in greater detail.\n132.\tThose who condemned the agreements so hastily should, look at them again more carefully. They are based upon the principles of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and upon the international consensus in its favour. A perfect settlement cannot be achieved by exchanging declarations of principle any more than by making speeches at one another. Politicians have to be prepared to get down to what I term the \\\"nitty-gritty\\\" detail and then explain and defend the position to their own people. For our part, we have set out on a number of occasions\u2014in particular in the statement on the Middle East made by the European Council in London on 29 June 1977-our views on the principles which should govern a peace settlement. The Camp David agreements are a positive step in that direction and they have our full support.\n133.\tAnother major initiative has been that undertaken with regard to Namibia. We will be debating this issue in the Security Council, and I will reserve my remarks until then. But the Secretary-General's report on the United Nations Transition Assistance Group, the political commitment and atmosphere of patient diplomacy that has characterized the whole process, is an example of how the United Nations can act. At all times these negotiations have involved political leaders, whether foreign ministers or nationalist leaders, and their officials and supporters. African nations and leaders, as well as those of us outside Africa, have worked for an African solution and an international solution. It would be a tragedy for southern Africa if, at this late stage, the opportunity for Namibia to become independent was rejected. The alternatives\u2014another Transkei, continued fighting and an escalating confrontation between South Africa and the world-would represent a shameful retreat from the ideals to which all parties have, I believe, been committed. Yet success here could not fail to have an impact upon the fundamental issue of racialism which haunts southern Africa, besides giving hope for a negotiated settlement in Rhodesia.\n134.\tRacism is one of the greatest evils which we face in the world community today and, in this International Anti-Apartheid Year, it is imperative that we should make clear our absolute, united condemnation of apartheid.\n135.\tSadly, we see no real sign of movement towards fundamental change in South Africa since the General Assembly last met, but the message must go out again. Change is inevitable, and time is not on our side if that change is to be peaceful.\n136.\tAt the time we meet, a new State President and Prime Minister are about to be chosen in South Africa. I\nhope that these new leaders will respond to what I believe to be the true aspirations of the South African people for change, and will show courage and resolution in bringing that country back to its place in our community of nations. I believe that a united South Africa, through the efforts of all its people, can meet this challenge in the knowledge that failure will have the gravest consequences not only for the people of South Africa but for the world as a whole.\n137.\tAfrica, and all of us outside Africa, are pledged to bring about majority rule, a return to legality, and independence in Zimbabwe. We want to do so without further bloodshed and in a way acceptable to the people as a whole. The objective for us all is a non-racial society in an independent Zimbabwe.\n138.\tThe gravity of the present situation cannot be exaggerated. Deaths in the war have been over 3,000 this year. Civilian casualties since 1972 include nearly 3,000 Africans and some 600 whites. Intimidation and fear grow daily; atrocities have been committed on all sides. There is a growing refugee problem both inside and outside the country. One thousand people per week flee to Botswana. Inside Rhodesia the rural population affected by the war is fleeing to the cities, homeless and jobless. If the war continues, and the farmers do not plant and sow for next year, there are growing prospects of widespread famine in a country once endowed with plenty.\n139.\tThe effect on the economic stability of southern Africa is now marked. There is a danger of foreign intervention and of embroiling the whole of Africa in a conflict out of all proportion to its original dimensions. The threat to the security of neighbouring States\u2014Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique-is already only too evident, and has been highlighted by the latest raids into Mozambique.\n140.\tThe < United Kingdom has never administered Rhodesia. In 1965 following the unilateral declaration of independence we came to the United Nations because we decided then, and have not shifted from that view since, that the United Kingdom acting alone could not end the rebellion and bring about majority rule. We accept our responsibilities and have tried to live up to them.\n141.\tWe have striven for a negotiated settlement on the basis of the principles endorsed by the United Nations and the principles approved by the British Parliament. One of these principles is that, before granting independence, it must be established that any settlement is acceptable to the people of the country as a whole.\n142.\tProgress has been slow, but, encouraged by the support of many African States and the international community, we are urgently making every effort, together with the Americans, to bring about a satisfactory solution. But no one, including Britain and the United States, has a magic formula for peace in Zimbabwe. Ultimately it is for the people to decide the basis of their independence. It is not for any of us to impose a particular constitution or a particular leader on Zimbabwe.\n143.\tIt is frankly recognized in private but often ignored in public rhetoric that, in contrast to most other liberation struggles, the Zimbabwean nationalist movement is not united. Its divisions are long-standing and have constantly bedevilled negotiations. It has been a major tactic of the regime to exploit these differences. It has never been part of our philosophy to seek to split the liberation movement or to widen divisions between the nationalists. Greater unity within the nationalist movement would make a comprehensive settlement far easier and a cease-fire a reality. The OAU has wisely endorsed the right of all the leaders to participate in elections. There must be no exclusions; we want an inclusive settlement.\n144.\tWe are committed to working by persuasion and negotiation: we cannot impose, and this is a restraint which is not always recognized.\n145.\tMost of us in the United Nations support the objectives of freedom and of independence of the various liberation movements in southern Africa. Some support the armed struggle. My Government does not supply arms. To do so would gravely inhibit our ability to work for a negotiated settlement between all the parties to the conflict. I regret, though acknowledge, that many people have felt driven to take part in the armed conflict. No one can deny that this struggle has had a considerable effect, in addition to sanctions and diplomatic pressures, in making the possibility of majority rule a real one. Yet if the armed struggle continues with no negotiations it will result in massive damage to Zimbabwe: not just to its economy but perhaps above all to the chances of its being a non-racial society.\n146.\tArmed intervention by the United Kingdom \\\".vas ruled out in 1965 and there is no question of Britain or any other Western Power sending troops now to impose a settlement. We have committed ourselves to seek a solution through the international community and in the context of the Anglo-American proposals published on 1 September last year  and debated in the Security Council. Within that framework, we will honour our obligations, play a major part in any settlement, and contribute fully in terms of money, manpower and expertise. But we are not about to assume a colonial role which we have never exercised, which was rejected in 1965, and which is even more inappropriate in 1978.\n147.\tMy Government's objective is to do everything possible to bring about a peaceful settlement through negotiations providing for majority rule and independence on a basis acceptable to the people of Zimbabwe as a whole.\n148.\tWe have listened carefully to the criticisms of the detailed proposals we put forward a year ago. We have been trying to find common ground and, in elaborating and refining our proposals, we have had to take account of the strong views of those of the parties who wish to reduce the powers of the proposed resident commissioner. After the Geneva Conference i7 we thought that the inability of the parties to agree on a form of power-sharing could be quickly circumvented only by giving powers to the resident commissioner. Events have shown that judgement to be wise. We never sought those powers for ourselves; they were \nonerous and difficult. We willingly proposed that they should be exercised in concert with the United Nations. We advocated a special representative of the Secretary-General, a United Nations peace-keeping force and a United Nations civilian police element to monitor the existing police force. We have wasted a year arguing about the powers of the resident commissioner. I hope now, that after our consultations with the parties, we have found a workable formula for an executive and legislative council with powers on law and order reserved to the resident commissioner.\n149. We now must agree on: the balance of representation on the council and the decision-making procedure; the appointment of a resident commissioner and the length of time he should remain; the timing of elections and the timing of independence; the details of the proposals put forward by the resident commissioner designate for the Zimbabwe national army and already explained in the presence of General Prem Chand to all the parties; the establishment of a unified command of all armies; the time-table for a cease-fire; and the structure of the United Nations Zimbabwe force.\n350. We have presented some of these proposals to the parties in the form of options. We have not issued ultimatums. The detail is negotiable, but, if the parties continue to argue over the structure of a settlement, then-let us\\\" be clear-the war will continue, and the bloodshed will increase; and neither the United Kingdom nor the United States will be able to prevent a fight to the finish.\n151. All these preparations have been done in the belief that it is necessary to prepare the ground for final negotiations. Nothing has been pre-empted. The parties must decide for themselves; yet no decisions can be made without compromise. If they agree, then the United Kingdom is poised to enact the necessary legislation immediately. I hope the Security Council would then pass the necessary resolution for the establishment of a United Nations Zimbabwe force as speedily as in the case of Lebanon. In playing a neutral role as peace-keeper, the United Nations has never been partisan. The United Nations will stand up for the rights of all the people of Zimbabwe, as it will for the people of Namibia.\n152.\tThis is a critical moment: if we are to prevent the escalation which could take all parties over the brink, then the voice of the international community must make itself heard in support of a negotiated solution and of our proposals. More insistent still is the voice of the people of Zimbabwe themselves, weary of war and seeking a just peace. They want a settlement; they want an all-party conference; they want majority rule; and above all they want peace.\n153.\tThat is our commitment. We are actively preparing the ground now for round-table talks. I hope we can in the near future issue invitations to all the parties to come to negotiate a final settlement for an independent Zimbabwe. I hope that all of us as Members of the United Nations will do everything in our power to make such a meeting a success. The next few months in southern Africa are critical for us all, and the United Nations has, in my view, a major role to play. \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n"

The lofty responsibilities entrusted to you are a just recognition of your eminent personal merit and the constant observance of the legal rules and procedures which has been characteristic of Colombia.\n143.\tI also wish to pay a tribute to Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who so intelligently and wisely guided the work of the General Assembly at its previous regular session and during the three special sessions which were evidence of the dynamic work of the world Organization during the past year.\n144.\tOn behalf of the Government and the people of Ecuador, I greet and welcome the new State of Solomon\nIslands which joined the community of ISO free and sovereign nations of our Organization.\n145.\tAs a basis for its participation in the international community, Ecuador has maintained fundamental principles which are at the very root of our tradition-principles such as that of the legal equality of States and that of non-intervention, which is derived from the former. All States being equal, none can claim that it can impose its will over others. Accordingly, no pressure and no use of force in international relations can be accepted, nor is it possible to recognize territorial acquisitions obtained by the use of arms.\n146.\tBeing in favour of the principle of self-determination, Ecuador firmly supports the prompt accession to independence of peoples who are still under the colonial yoke, condemns every form of racial discrimination and, in particular, the shameful policy of apartheid, and strives to see to it that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms will become a universal, effective and permanent practice.\n147.\tBy the rejection of recourse to the use of force, a decisive moral character has been given to the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes. Ecuador believes in the effectiveness of this principle in the solution of any problem, bilateral, regional or universal, and further believes that in this respect the community of nations have a serious responsibility. It was with this sense of responsibility that we actively participated in the Special Committee on Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Principle of Non-Use of Force in International Relations, the mandate of which will be reaffirmed at this session of the Assembly so as to strengthen the Charter and make this way of settling conflicts compulsory.\n148.\tWe have participated in the United Nations since it came into being. We have always sought to make it and the specialized agencies stronger in the certainty that these are the best forums for discussion and action for all countries. Within a community of nations which is increasingly interdependent, each must make its contribution to strengthening peace, lessening international tensions, and seeking equitable solutions to the far-reaching economic, social, humanitarian and cultural problems which the troubled world of today faces.\n149.\tOur Organization is one of the instruments best suited to the achievement of mutual understanding and joint progress. It is the appropriate forum for constructive dialogue, setting aside hegemonic positions or claims of privilege, with the aim of establishing a new political and economic order as the result of the concerted action of all people on earth.\n150.\tA constructive spirit of understanding, and not of imposition of one's will, is the only means to attain international peace and security on a genuine basis of justice, international peace and security, the universality of human rights, the end of all colonialist or neo-colonialist manifestations, and the urgent establishment of the new international economic order, leading to the final elimination of the existing difference between the standard of living of the developing countries and that of the industrialized countries.\n151.\tThis year there have been some results regarding disarmament questions. The tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament has left us a Final Document [resolution S-10121, which was adopted by consensus. That document comprises a Declaration which ratifies general and complete disarmament under effective international control as the ultimate objective of the efforts of States, and a Programme of Action containing priorities and measures to be adopted urgently to halt and put an end to the arms race. The Final Document also establishes machinery which combines a body in which all States participate with a limited-membership negotiating body, the Committee on Disarmament, in which changes have been introduced which make it more democratic and, it is to be hoped, more effective in performing the work entrusted to it.\n152.\tAs regards nuclear disarmament, it is worth while to point out the growing importance of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco), the full implementation of which has been recommended from this rostrum by the most responsible spokesmen of the peoples of the world and mentioned as a desirable example for other regions which are equally interested in the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. We are particularly pleased to hear statements of support for this Treaty and the announcements of the nuclear Powers, as well as those of the Latin American countries which are still not parties to the Treaty, regarding their intention to adhere to that instrument.\n153.\tA preparatory meeting has just been held in Geneva for the United Nations Conference on Prohibitions or Restrictions of Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects. That Conference no doubt will be held in 1979. The prior work done and future efforts designed to achieve prohibitions or effective restrictions in the use of weapons of this type have received and will receive every support from the Government of Ecuador.\n154.\tWorld-wide attention on what has been the fundamental item of the United Nations since it came into being have had special characteristics in the Latin American regions. On 22 June 1978 the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the countries signatories to the Declaration of Ayacucho10 in Washington signed the text of a declaration on regional disarmament, in which:\n\\\"They reaffirmed the importance which they attribute to the postulates of the Declaration of Ayacucho in respect of the limitation of armaments in Latin America, and reaffirmed the need to redouble efforts to bring about conditions which will be conducive to effective arms limitation in the region and to devote all possible resources to the economic and social development of each and every one of the countries of Latin America;\n\\\"They agreed that the continued existence of problems in the international field is one of the major causes of armaments and they accordingly reaffirmed their will to seek the solution of all disputes by peaceful means, thus contributing to the elimination of tensions and to the preservation and strengthening of peace\\\".\n155.\tEcuador is pleased that the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly has taken up this concept of the peaceful settlement of international disputes as an effective means to lessen the causes of the arms race.\n156.\tIn connexion with the foregoing I believe that it is vital for the international community to pay due attention to all the problems which constitute or might constitute a reason for the emergence of tensions or breaches of the peace. The pacifying action of the international community must prevent conflicts from becoming more serious. It is the responsibility of all to preserve and maintain international peace and security. It is our common duty to see to it that differences among countries are settled in accord with reason and justice.\n157.\tAnother of the efforts made by the countries of my region in disarmament was the beginning of a historical dialogue at the informal meeting of Latin America and the Caribbean on conventional weapons, which was held in Mexico in August of this year, the gradual and balanced continuation of which will, it is hoped, make it possible to progress with the participation of all the States of the region.\n158.\tThe alternative whether to settle disputes by peaceful means or whether to use force in international relations is tied to the very destiny of human beings, whose essence is transcendent and who are the basic nucleus of societies and of States as their efficient cause and final cause. In this respect the arms race is also a clear negation of human rights and a distortion of the most profound philosophical concepts.\n159.\tHow is it possible to speak of the full enjoyment of human rights when the prosperous and large Powers allocate for assistance to economic and social development barely four cents for each dollar devoted to arms? How is it possible to promote the social and economic well-being of peoples as an urgent duty of international co-operation when investments are made or favoured in vast amounts of war material which sometimes have no security purposes and are not in accord with the real interests of peoples? Nor can complete progress and the full enjoyment of human rights be attained as long as practices of economic domination are maintained which are Obviously discriminatory.\n160.\tThe integral protection of human beings and of the inviolable nature of their rights is possible only if there is an end to the chain of injustices which overwhelm the developing countries, if the industrial Powers decide to adjust their conduct to the principles which they have proclaimed domestically and internationally in favour of human rights, and if they assist in building a democratic international society wherein inhabitants of all nations will enjoy equal civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights.\n\n161.\tConsistent with the traditional legal structure of the State of Ecuador, the Government of my country condemns racial discrimination and energetically repudiates apartheid as a crime against mankind. Ecuador, the fundamental Charter of which recognizes \\\"the right of peoples to be liberated from these oppressive systems\\\", is a party to the international conventions on those subjects and renews its confidence that by means of international action mankind will be freed from every kind of racism and racial discrimination.\n162.\tBeing convinced of the validity of the principles which were proclaimed at a time similar to this, Ecuador reaffirms its rights over the segment of the geostationary synchronic orbit which, because of its geographical location, belongs to us. Together with other States on the Equator my country has said in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space that it is willing to comply with the obligation to protect this natural resource which is a limited resource and one of potential benefit for the social and economic development of peoples through multiple peaceful applications now opened up by the era of satellites, particularly in the field of education, communications and energy.\n163.\tAs regards the law of the sea, Ecuador has been contributing substantially to the quest for agreements which will enable a consensus to be reached so as to conclude a universal convention. This is one of the most intractable questions mankind now faces because there are many aspects involved. Ecuador will continue to maintain that to arrive at this consensus the rights of States in maritime spaces must be respected. These rights in many cases are derived from historical legal precedents which cannot be ignored without the risk of vitally affecting vital interests which States cannot nor should not renounce.\n164.\tOne of the basic principles on which the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has been working is respect for the common heritage of mankind which is the sea-bed beyond the limits of the national jurisdiction of each country. Therefore there was grave concern internationally when it was announced that the sea-bed might be explored and exploited unilaterally without awaiting approval of the rules which the Conference is preparing. That policy, besides running counter to principles and decisions already adopted by the United Nations, would be a serious setback in the formulation of a new international law in which all States would participate on an equal footing.\n165.\tThe exchange of the instruments of ratification of the new Panama Canal Treaties was the successful conclusion of a process of affirmation of the principles of mutual respect and co-operation among States. At the same time, those Treaties were the result of negotiations which contributed to strengthening the fundamental principle of the peaceful settlement of international disputes. In that respect, bright hopes emerge that all remaining problems on our continent may, through cordial and objective dialogue, find adequate and just solutions. Ecuador, true to its peaceful tradition and in a spirit of frankness and goodwill, as I said a year ago at this rostrum, is persistently seeking \\\"a goodwill agreement [with Peru] that would effect a satisfactory solution to its territorial claim, inline with the\nrequirements of its national honour and of its destiny in the Amazon river basin\\\".\n166.\tIn the same spirit, we hope that appropriate solutions will be found for other existing problems in Latin America which affect regional solidarity and development.\n167.\tSince peace is essential for the progress which the peoples of the American family need so much, Ecuador is seriously disturbed by the situation in Nicaragua. Observing the fundamental principles that inspire the regional system and the United Nations Charter, notably the principles of non-intervention, the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for human rights, all countries, particularly in the Americas, must give their humanitarian assistance in this crisis, and the parties directly concerned should, by efforts at conciliation, effectively contribute to a solution of the problem-all this within the basic spirit of the resolution recently adopted at the seventeenth meeting of consultation of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Organization of American States.\n168.\tAs regards the Middle East question, Ecuador's position is well known, it having been reiterated at this rostrum on many occasions. I now express my sincere hope that the recent Camp David talks and the subsequent stages of that process will yield a just and lasting solution that will include all the parties affected by this explosive dispute and, of course, recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and settle the various pending questions so as to arrive at an agreement that will guarantee peace and security for all countries of the region.\n169.\tThe restoration of peace and normal living conditions in Lebanon is imperative. UNIFIL can discharge its lofty mission in that country only if it receives the full and appropriate co-operation of all the parties concerned.\n170.\tEcuador views with constant concern the situation prevailing in Cyprus and wishes to see a prompt and complete solution by peaceful means, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and in particular without the use of force as a determinant of rights\u2014that is to say, a solution based on justice and on the interests of the inhabitants of that friendly country.\n171.\tThe persevering action of the United Nations in the field of decolonization must go on until the last vestiges of foreign domination have been removed from Territories that have not yet attained self-determination and independence. The continued illegal presence of South Africa in Namibia must come to an end as soon as possible. It is urgent that free elections, under United Nations supervision, be held to decide the political future of that country, whose territorial integrity includes Walvis Bay. The United Nations must prevent the failure of the negotiated solution of this problem which is now under way. Another challenge by South Africa to our Organization's resolutions would be intolerable and should be\nduly considered by the competent organs of the world Organization.\n172.\tSimilarly, my country believes that we cannot postpone a peaceful and equitable solution of the problem of Zimbabwe which will ensure the establishment of a government based on majority rule.\n173.\tEcuador condemns all terrorist actions and agrees that it is necessary to ensure proper punishment for those who try to make terror and intimidation permanent weapons against the international community. We especially repudiate aerial hijacking and are therefore a party to the international Conventions of The Hague, Tokyo and Montreal and have supported the relevant United Nations resolutions. We further believe that it is the duty of the world Organization to adopt more effective measures in this respect.\n174.\tThe efforts of the international community for the maintenance and strengthening of peace would be sterile were they not directed towards the establishment of a new international economic order wherein the well-being of and respect for the individual were the essential objectives. We therefore believe that the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 is of vital importance. Now that its work has unfortunately been suspended, we must reaffirm the mandate of the Committee so that, through genuine negotiations, it will be able to adopt guidelines on matters of general policy and arrive at agreements on action that will produce specific results, within specified time-limits, on the priority questions of development and international economic co-operation. To consider the Committee merely as a debating society for general statements would be discouraging to those who have placed in it their hope of strengthening the North-South negotiations.\n175.\tOnly when there is a genuine will to reach understanding among the rich and the poor countries will it be possible to find gradual methods of international co-operation for the establishment of more equitable and stable relations among all nations and ensure the lessening of the tensions-which jeopardize peace:\n176.\tTherefore Ecuador has maintained that the transfer of resources to developing countries in real terms must cover every aspect which, in one way or another, represents foreign financial transfers, not only by means of official aid to development but also by the application-of just terms of trade and the elimination of restrictive trade practices such as tariffs or closed markets or shipping restrictions, which will enable primary-producing developing countries genuinely to enjoy the fruits of their labours without lowering the purchasing power of their exports. The countries of the third world  must also participate adequately in establishing a new monetary liquidity, and capital-exporting countries should make it available to developing countries on favourable and adequate terms.\n177.\tThe means made available by international financial institutions such as IMF must also be increased so as to provide the resources needed by the developing countries in accord with their respective national priorities.\n178.\tI reiterate my conviction that the Economic and Social Council must be strengthened. Its functions of co-ordination and political guidance must be carried out with the effective co-operation of all countries in accordance with the commitment undertaken in the Charter and, above all, with a greater contribution by the great Powers in all actions of the system.\n179.\tThere is a profound imbalance in national access to contemporary science and technology. The Vienna world conference to be held in 1979 on the subject'7 offers an opportunity to study and solve problems regarding the transfer of that knowledge in such a manner that the developing countries will find the most just and secure ways to progress.\n180.\tOne of the most concrete channels for the transfer of technology, of effectively opening up investment and encouraging self-reliance, is to be found in the operational programmes of the United Nations, particularly in UNDP, there can be no further delay in the broadening of its objectives and in an increase in real resources for UNDP. It is up to the rich countries to make an effort to commit 0.8 per cent of their gross national product so that UNDP may meet the needs of countries at their various levels of development. If, as a first step, all the major contributors matched the contribution levels of the Scandinavian countries, that would be a considerable and appropriate step in the direction of universal benefit.\n181.\tThe major part of our agricultural production is being transformed gradually into an agro-industry; in that process the developing countries must achieve the goal of a 25 per cent share of world industrial production by the year 2000 in accordance with the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action on Industrial Development Co-operation. In that way it will be possible to redefine next year the development strategy for the decade of the 1980s so as to arrive at a better ratio between resources and consumption for the benefit of the less favoured nations of the world.\n182.\tAnother matter of general concern is the disquieting resurgence of protectionist measures on a world-wide scale adopted by the industrialized nations which have reached a level which has not been registered for many years, to the detriment of commitments to liberalize trade as provided for in the 1973 Tokyo Declaration.\n183.\tOne of the fundamental mechanisms for the establishment of the new international economic order is the Integrated Programme for Commodities which was\napproved at the fourth session of UNCTAD, held in Nairobi in May 1976.\n184.\tThe lack of political will of the developed world has so far made it impossible to advance suitably in the negotiations and in the establishment of the common fund which is the backbone of the programme. Ecuador is pleased with the announcement that the negotiating conference for the common fund will be resumed and reaffirms its integrated approach which is to be found in UNCTAD resolution 93 (IV) both regarding the negotiations on the products included in that resolution as well as in respect of the nature of the measures to be adopted for each product.\n185.\tEcuador reiterates its faith in the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and expresses its certainty that all that contributes to the qualitative improvement of human society, to the strengthening of peace and of the rights of peoples and to the consolidation of the dignity of man will be firmly supported so as to make a reality of an international society whose greatness is based on the supreme needs of peace with justice and justice with freedom.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n75.\tAs I address this Assembly of the Organization in which mankind has placed its highest hopes for the\n12 See Official Records of the General Assembly, Tenth Special Session, Plenary Meetings, 3rd meeting, para. 72.\npreservation of peace, the development of the peoples of the earth and the prevalence of respect for the rights of the human person, it is with deep satisfaction that I extend a respectful greeting to the honourable representatives of the sovereign States which participate as members, with identical rights, in the deliberations of this supreme body of the most prestigious international organization. And to you, Mr. President, as one who ranks high among the intellectuals and men of outstanding insight who have lent distinction and renown to our Latin American spiritual community, I wish to express my heartfelt satisfaction at the well-deserved recognition accorded to your merits by your election to preside over this session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in a year so crucial to that noblest of endeavours, the advancement of human rights, a cause to which your country and my own attach such great importance.\n76.\tThis year marks the thirtieth. anniversary of the unanimous adoption of both the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man,13 signed on 2 May 1948 in Bogot\u00e1 - the cultured capital of Colombia\u2014and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted on 10 December of that same year in Paris, that city beloved of all free men since the historic day when from the barricades in its ancient streets arose the immortal cry of \\\"Liberty, equality, fraternity\\\". And now, as if to attest to the strength of their belief in this noble cause, a group of States Members of the United Nations is preparing for the forthcoming inauguration of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, whose seat is to be in Costa Rica, a country which was also the seat more than 70 years ago of our first regional court of justice, the Central American Court, which was given competence to hear grievances and accusations by persons who considered that their rights had been violated by any of the Governments of Central America.\n77.\tThirty years will shortly have elapsed since the Universal Declaration was written. Much progress has since been made in this unfinished struggle to secure recognition and respect for the rights of the human person in every corner of the globe. That Declaration, a valuable yet limited expression of the legal conscience of mankind, gave way to the International Covenants on Human Rights adopted in this very hall on 16 December 1966. Over 90 countries have secured the inalienable right recognized by the United Nations freely to determine their own destiny. Discrimination among men for reasons of race has wholly disappeared from the law of many countries, where the separation imposed by social custom has also diminished or abated. Although today one nation or another may still cling to the laws and practices of apartheid\u2014abhorrent though they may be to all who believe in the oneness of the human race, the innate equality of men and the ideals of the United Nations\u2014we may be certain that no such laws or practices can long endure, for they are infringements of the most sacred of the rights of the human person: respect for the dignity of man, which is both the wellspring and at the same time the foundation of the legal doctrine of human rights. We\ntherefore welcome the news which has recently reached us that the biracial Government of Zimbabwe has adopted a series of measures that constitute the first step towards the abolition of all rules and measures implying unequal treatment of the inhabitants of that long-suffering country merely by reason of the colour of their skin.\n78.\tThe work done by the United Nations in this field, which affects so many millions of men and women, as well as other innocent beings, such as children and adolescents, has been great and fruitful. Worthy of special mention is the arduous work done by the Commission on Human Rights and the sub-commissions, committees and subcommittees created to deal with related problems. But this is not enough. Here and there in every corner of the earth there continue to occur frequent cases of violation or non-recognition of rights which the universal conscience and the United Nations consider sacred, because the domestic peace of States and, in the final analysis, peace among nations, rest upon respect for those rights.\n79.\tIn this connexion, Costa Rica has, for more than 12 years, tirelessly advocated the establishment of the post of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, which, like that of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, would strengthen, through specific personal action, the application of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Covenants on the fundamental human rights and freedoms, which is essential to enable all men to enjoy peace and the blessings of progress and civilization.\n80.\tWe have once again pressed for the inclusion of this item /item 86} because we feel that its continued presence on the agenda of the General Assembly will serve constantly to underscore its importance to the world. This, however, does not imply that we underestimate in any way the major role which has been played, with respect to this item and to human rights in general, by the special committee entrusted with studying the item and reporting to the General Assembly.\n81.\tA fortnight ago, my country, which has made peace a habit and a way of life, was the victim of the violation of a fundamental human right, the right to peace.\n82.\tMy country's Constitution forbids the establishment of an army and allows only a police force to keep the peace. Resources earmarked by other nations for maintaining military forces are allocated by us to education. Costa Rica is thus able to appropriate one third of its national budget for education at all levels.\n83.\tCosta Rica has no arsenals, military forces or economic might. Yet it is not by default but by conviction that my country has clearly chosen a civilian vocation, one which places right over might, and the search for the riches of the spirit over the desire for dominance. Costa Rica's strength lies in its lack of force.\n84.\tOn 12 September aircraft of the Nicaraguan Air Force violated the border with Costa Rica and proceeded to strafe the only army our country has: its students and teachers. The order was given by the Government of Nicaragua, and the target was the innermost heart of our nationhood.\n85.\tMy Government, which is based upon the rule of law and respect for international agreements, repelled the attack with its finest weapons: the moral courage of its people and reliance upon international treaties. It immediately appealed to the Organization of American States (OAS), invoking its Charter, and supported the open and exemplary initiative of the Government of Venezuela, which called for a meeting of American Foreign Ministers. My Government brought its case before the OAS, as a regional body, before appealing to the United Nations Security Council.\n86.\tIn this matter my Government has enjoyed the resolute and effective support of the Governments of Venezuela and Panama, which have shown themselves ready to come to the aid of a country which has no army and no weapons, as well as the support of other friendly nations. Before this world forum 1 convey to them the gratitude of my Government and my people.\n87.\tHow great a task lies before us in the field of human rights when a country can be attacked because it lives in peace. How great is our responsibility when dedication to culture, to education, health and development can be greeted with a treacherous aggression. How much yet remains to be done to uplift the minds of men and nations when weapons, in the hands of a foreign ruler, can be raised against children, teachers and students walking joyously and peacefully through the fields of their homeland organizing the celebration of their independence day, as has just occurred in my country.\n88.\tMembers of the Assembly, compare the character of the attacker and the position of the attacked, and ask yourselves whether this case leaves any room for doubt as to who is in the right.\n89.\tMy Government and people solemnly undertake., before this forum of universal expression and dialogue, to continue publicly to demonstrate their support for the cause of human rights and the cause of peace, and to strive without respite to secure respect for the law and for human dignity in the face of aggression, genocide, violence and the stifling of liberty. This is my Government's reply to those who, in word and deed, have left the stain of their treachery upon our land.\n90.\tI am confident that the international community will recognize who is right and will issue a just verdict as an expression of its faith in its principles and as a demonstration of their faithful application.\n91.\tThe International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights, of 16 December 1966, which Costa Rica had the honour to sign, approve and ratify before any other country, are an embodiment of the inalienable right of peoples freely to exercise self-determination in the political, economic and social domains. Both Covenants, using the same wording, place this right in paragraph 1 of article 1, to indicate thereby that the legal framework of respect for human rights and peace among nations rests fundamentally upon recognition of the right of peoples freely to determine their political status. Thanks to this sound principle, we have today in this General Assembly representatives of a great\nmany States which secured independence, recognition and sovereignty after 1945, among them the newest State Member of our Organization, Solomon Islands, to which I wish to extend my Government's heartfelt congratulations and our best wishes for the development and prosperity of that new nation. Costa Rica cannot conceal its satisfaction at having contributed, on all previous occasions, to ensuring that the aspirations of different groups of human beings to govern themselves freely and independently should be recognized by other nations and by our Organization.\n92.\tWith respect to the Middle East, my Government publicly expresses its joy at the signing by President Anwar El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel of a preliminary peace agreement,14 under the auspices of the President of the United States, Mr. Jimmy Carter, which augurs an historic change in international relations in the Middle East, provided good will, the pursuit of the ideal of peace, and direct dialogue between the two countries continue.\n93.\tIt is the fervent hope of my Government that in the long-awaited settlement of the very delicate problems of the Middle East the right of the Palestinian people freely to determine its own destiny will, as the Camp David document suggests, be exercised in the near future. My Government similarly reaffirms the right of the State of Israel to have its status as a free and sovereign State acknowledged and guaranteed by all Members of this Organization.\n94.\tThe direct dialogue between Israel and Egypt has inspired new hope among all peace-loving men and peoples. Peace is possible. In that conviction, I appeal to all the leaders concerned in the Middle East conflict to join in this effort and pursue this fruitful and exemplary dialogue so that before long they can offer the world imposing evidence of faith in man, and so that once again, as in Biblical times, the dove of peace may take flight and peoples be united. On that day mankind will turn a new page in its history and the blessings of all men of goodwill will be on the leaders who achieved this.\n95.\tMy Government upholds the unique effectiveness of frank and cordial dialogue, as shown in the case of Egypt and Israel. We also harbour the highest hopes for Central America, expressing once again the heartfelt wish and concern of the Government and people of Costa Rica to see a speedy solution of the problems still pending between the sister nations of El Salvador and Honduras. Accordingly, I reaffirm my Government's confidence in the mediation mechanism which has been established.\n96.\tParagraph 2 of article 1 of each of the International Covenants of 16 December 1966 recognizes to all peoples the right freely to dispose of their natural wealth and resources. Nothing could be more right, nothing could be more just. Costa Rica is pleased that the application of that principle and other lofty principles has fortunately led this year to the end of a lengthy process by which the United States, in a praiseworthy gesture of respect for the principles of equity and justice, has agreed to transfer to\nthe Republic of Panama the inter-oceanic Canal built through a narrow stretch of its territory and which constitutes the most valuable natural resource of that Republic because of the facilities it offers in providing easy communication and the quick movement of goods and persons from one ocean to another. My Government is very pleased by this memorable event, of which Panama and the United States were the protagonists, and this shows that a happy result can be achieved when a spirit of justice prevails over all other considerations, and when there is serenity, perseverance, patience and firmness in presenting a position or a request.\n97.\tMy Government hopes that the same spirit of justice will prevail in the deliberations at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which has just completed another session, its seventh, as well as in the multilateral negotiations being conducted by several countries concerning the rights and obligations of States which have interests in or carry on fishing activities in the economic zones which the new law of the sea recognizes for coastal States.\n98.\tCosta Rica, whose land territory is small, possesses broad maritime zones in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans which it has claimed for many years, with no open objection by other States, on legal grounds which correspond to those that have already been incorporating the text which the Conference on the Law of the Sea is working out by consensus. These zones abound in marine species of all kinds-some sedentary, others migratory\u2014all of which are part of the natural resources which both law and equity recognize as the economic heritage of Costa Rica, and which the Government that took office in my country on 8 May proposes to defend with all the force of the law in order to ensure that the Costa Rican people receive their just share of the benefits derived from permitting the exploitation of their fisheries by Costa Rican vessels or by foreign vessels which have previously obtained the necessary permission in accordance with duly established regulations. It is all very well that on the high seas, which are the res communis of mankind, fishing fleets of economically powerful nations should take the harvests without sharing the product of their sale with any other country other than their own; it would be inequitable, however, for such fleets to transfer their bases thousands of kilometres away in order to take advantage of the thunnidae which abound, in the economic zones of other nations without those nations, which are generally under-developed or at an early stage of development, receiving a fair share of the proceeds of the sale of a natural resource taken from their economic zones.\n99.\tIt is not right that great industrial Powers should reserve for themselves extensive fishing zones, send their fleets thousands of kilometres away to reap resources lying off the coasts of developing States, and yet not recognize the rights of those States with regard to the exploitation of their marine resources, which are the only resources accessible to their generally poorly equipped national fleets.\n100.\tAs I stated during my first visit to our island territory most distant from the mainland, Cocos Island:\n\\\"The President of the United States has opened up a new and promising era in international relations by\nproceeding to the exchange of documents concerning the Panama Canal Treaties. The principles he laid down are categorical and, if the new Canal Treaties are the first sign of this new policy, Costa Rica trusts that those same principles will apply in the case of fisheries, in the interests of justice in relations between our two countries.\\\"\n101.\tThe resources of the sea are an important part of the national wealth of coastal States. Costa Rica hopes that, at this promising juncture, as nations strive to find just formulas conducive to development, bilateral or multilateral agreements can be worked out that will recognize the right of Costa Rica, as of other States that authorizes exploitation of their resources by foreign fleets, to receive the equitable share of the proceeds to which it is entitled by the use of the living resources of its exclusive economic zone,\n102.\tAll men who long for peace are concerned about the arms race that has been unleashed among the largest world Powers and which is consuming enormous economic resources and absorbing the efforts of privileged, intelligent men who could otherwise place their inventive genius at the service of peaceful arts and sciences and thus contribute to die worthy tasks of development and the gradual eradication of the ignorance and poverty that persist in many large areas Of the globe. My Government, which represents a people known for its love of peace, cannot fail to reiterate its hope that the major military Powers will find a formula which will enable them to earmark for peaceful purposes a substantial part of the financial resources and man-hours which are now being devoted to the construction of ever more sophisticated instruments of death and destruction.\n103.\tAs we enter the closing years of the twentieth century and near the dawn of the third millennium, the question of disarmament as the basis for the establishment of peace in the world must, in my Government's view, be accompanied by a new vision of peace.\n104.\tThe purpose of global efforts for disarmament is to eliminate the principal physical instrument of war. All things considered, what is involved is a world-wide decision and a world-wide struggle which may fail to alter the fundamental problem: the absence of a collective and positive will for peace.\n105.\tThe struggle for disarmament must therefore be accompanied by a pedagogy of peace: in other words, education for peace. Disarmament may serve to avert imminent disaster; education for peace is a permanent attitude. Disarmament means discarding an instrument of war in order to achieve the objective of peace. Education for peace means creating the real conditions for a peaceful world. Consequently disarmament should advance hand in hand with education for peace.\n106.\tI therefore propose to this thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly the creation of a university for peace, within the framework of the United Nations University network, as a concrete expression of this new vision of a triumphant and dynamic peace, this new vision of peace a result of education and consciousness.\n107.\tThat university would be a great centre of higher learning, open to alt peoples and all men of goodwill, whose primary objective would be to contribute, through research, teaching, dissemination and free inquiry, to the cause of peace, to mutual knowledge for men throughout the world, and to the promotion among alt men of a spirit of understanding, tolerance, and peaceful coexistence, in order to stimulate international co-operation and eliminate any situation which could imperil universal peace and the progress of peoples.\n108.\tThe United Nations is, by definition, dedicated to the cause of peace; that is its supreme and inescapable purpose.\n109.\tThe United Nations has created various bodies to perform specific tasks in economic, social and cultural development. However, it lacks the supreme institution, that from which it derives its essence and its reason for being\u2014the institution of peace. The United Nations was created to safeguard peace and the entire Organization is oriented towards that central goal. Nevertheless, for historical reasons, its concept of peace has been closer to the notion of peace as the absence of war than to that of peace as the supreme achievement of man as a continuing task in the domain of learning. Accordingly, I propose the creation of an institution to prepare men and nations for peace.\n110.\tEvery positive and concrete effort against the arms race meets with opposition from those who wield the old Latin principle \\\"Si vis pacem, para bellum\\\"-\\\"If you desire peace, prepare for war\\\". Today, however, preparing for war has a different goal\u2014not the achievement of peace, but the prevalence of fear, as the means to world equilibrium. This, then, is world peace founded on an act of fear, not on conviction or on an act of conscience. I therefore propose not a military maxim but a human one: \\\"If you desire peace, prepare for peace.\\\"\n111.\tPeace is a dynamic concept. It is a condition of life and, consequently, one of the fundamental human rights. Viewing the matter in this way, it becomes a question not of keeping the peace but of achieving it. Peace is a right of the human species, but it is also a duty. It follows that every man, and mankind as a whole; must be not only the object but also the subject of peace. Men may enjoy this right, but they must at the same time keep it in existence. Peace is the work of justice and the fruit of love, but it must also be the product of education; or, to put it better, education must be one of its most effective instruments of action.\n112.\tAt this point in the twentieth century we are being called upon to face, in all their tragic urgency, the needs of mankind. However, we must at the same time face up to the requirements of our species. The university for peace must be the laboratory of the spirit of peace, the crucible in which we must form the new mentality of peace over the decades to come\u2014for the twenty-first century shall be peaceful, or it shall not be at all.\n113.\tPeace is not the end of a conflict or an interlude between wars; it is a constantly renewed challenge. It must be our supreme objective and, as such, we must provide concrete means for affirming it, recalling that the present\ngeneration reserves its trust for words that are accompanied by deeds,\n114- Peace, like War, is not the result of historical predestination; its springs from man's freedom. Peace is within man, but it urgently requires measures to safeguard and create it: diplomatic relations, covenants, agreements, treaties, economic and social resources, means of information and education, laws and, finally, a vast machinery to give visible and tangible shape to this ceaseless quest of man on earth. What would become of the human species without all of these institutions, to which my Government now proposes the addition of a specific institution dedicated to preparing for peace and training for peace two decades before the new millennium?\n115.\tPeace is not merely a matter of noble sentiments. By its very nature it requires some measure of precise and diversified knowledge, both theoretical and practical. That is why it is urgent that man's intelligence and culture be directed towards peace, What is involved, as has been proposed by one eminent person, is marshalling all man's intellectual faculties, all the cultural and scientific heritage of mankind, in order that we may become an instrument of peace. What this implies, finally, is preparing and training man's will and intelligence for peace.\n116.\tPeace is made, not found. Peace is not rest. It is not another word for fear. Peace is the pulse of life.\n117.\tSettlements imposed by fear do not constitute peace. The institutions of peace we have today were born in the wake of the Second World War. They were inspired by pain and fear; but, as the pain and fear of that holocaust subside, the possibility of a new war looms ever greater. Why is this happening? Because, as the old Latin maxim would have it, we are still preparing for war in order to bring about peace. Thus, the vicious circle continues and mankind is never prepared for peace.\n318. With this in mind, what I offer for representatives' consideration is an institution not to be built on fear but on a triumphant and vigorous idea of peace. The world must instil a dynamic mentality of peace in adults, children and young people. To that end, we must put to use one of the greatest and most effective means of ennobling and transforming man\u2014education. In this way we may forge in man the thoughts and habits of peace, bringing peace first into the minds and hearts of men, and then into world politics.\n119.\tMy Government will submit a specific draft resolution on the subject requesting the General Assembly to consider the initiative of creating a university for peace along the lines that I have described as the contribution of a peaceful people to the cause of peace, the supreme goal of the United Nations, on the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights approved at Paris.\n120.\tAs a token of goodwill and of the desire to take part in the creation of the university for peace, I offer my country, Costa Rica, as its host. I hope that representatives of Member States will view this offer as testimony to our\nfaith and trust in the ability of this Organization to find new ways of strengthening and nurturing a flourishing and positive peace in the world through the education of mankind. Let us rally to peace.\n121.\tCosta Rica places at the disposal of the United Nations architectural drawings and study programmes which we have already developed, as well as a site which is ample and ideal from ecological and geographical points of view for the carrying out of this project. The tropical features of the site, coupled with its refreshing altitude, produce a spring-like climate. Largely surrounded by virgin forest, the site is an ecological paradise.\n122.\tThe area set aside for the university for peace enjoys a climate which from the physical and biological standpoints is particularly well suited to the implementation of a historic project for peace.\n123.\tSoon 35 years will have elapsed since the signing in Moscow on 30 October 1943 of the four-nation declaration on general security, which for the first time recognized:\n.. the necessity of establishing at the earliest practicable date a general international organization, based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States, and open to membership by all such States, large and small, for the maintenance of international peace and security.\n124.\tThat Declaration planted the seed which, finding fertile soil in a mankind racked by bloodshed and destruction, was to grow into this General Assembly of sovereign States, the largest and most exemplary organ of international action that the centuries have ever witnessed.\n125.\tI call to mind here the illustrious names of so many eminent persons of the old world and the new, of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, from strong countries and weak countries, leaders of Christianity and of other spiritual movements, who have spoken at this rostrum and who have contributed so much to this Organization's endeavours to fulfil the hopes that led to its creation.\n126.\tMay I once again extend to all present my respect and esteem.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff186.\tI should like first of all to address to you, Mr. President, my warmest greetings on your election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. It is with the greatest pleasure that we see presiding over the General Assembly the representative of a Latin American country, a friend of Portugal, to which we are united by so many common traditions and historical links. We are sure, Mr. President, that you will bring to this debate the invaluable experience of a career devoted to international affairs in the rich juridical tradition of Latin America and in particular that of Colombian diplomacy, further strengthened by the spirit and love of freedom that inspired the heroism of Bolivar.\n187.\tAllow me also to pay a tribute to the eminent qualities of your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who presided so ably over the activities of the last regular session and the three special sessions of the General Assembly with his great political and diplomatic qualities during the whole year.\n188.\tI wish also to salute the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim. I recall the interested and devoted manner in which Mr. Waldheim followed the Portuguese decolonization process, and the constant efforts he has made in the same spirit towards peace which reveal the dedication, the competence and the human qualities he has always shown in the exercise of his high functions.\n189.\tI should like also to extend our fraternal greetings to Solomon Islands upon its admission this year to the United Nations, bringing the number of United Nations Members to 150, almost three times as many countries as belonged to this Organization at the time of its founding. Thus the United Nations takes a considerable further step towards accomplishing one of its most noble aims, universality. Since I have referred to universality I believe it appropriate\n21 Mr. Correa Gago spoke in Portuguese. The English version of his statement was supplied by the delegation.\nto consider the United Nations position within the world at this time when we are beginning our work in this General Assembly.\n190.\tIn this context, I should like to emphasize how strongly my delegation shares the concerns expressed in the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization (A/33/1]: namely, regarding the necessity of strengthening the prestige of the United Nations, of bringing greater efficiency to its activities, and of providing this Organization with the means that will enable it to exercise a decisive influence in the situations of conflict that our world faces.\n191.\tAs the Secretary-General says in his report, which was written with his usual firmness and clarity that are the fruit of his experience and knowledge of the problems, the essential purpose of the United Nations at the time of its creation was to ensure justice and peace among nations and especially to protect the small countries or those deprived of sufficient means of self-defence [see A/33/1, sect. II]. We must admit that the United Nations has not always been able to fulfil this essential function or, what is perhaps more important, to guarantee the enforcement of its own decisions. This state of affairs affects the confidence that the Member States should have in this Organization, and therefore needs to be corrected. We firmly believe in the advisability of granting the United Nations the necessary means to enable it to exercise immediately and permanently its role of guarantor of the peace. Portugal especially supports all initiatives aimed at strengthening the United Nations peace-keeping forces and in particular the creation of a reserve force to be available in an emergency. Although we acknowledge that the task of the United Nations peace-keeping forces has been a difficult one throughout the years, we are convinced that such United Nations operations, in many grave moments of international life, have been invaluable.\n192.\tThe agenda of this Assembly presents us with a long series of problems that assume a global dimension in our interdependent world\u2014problems whose gravity so often jeopardizes peace and international security. As representatives of the community of nations, we have the duty, when confronted with the responsibility of studying, analysing and discussing those problems, in conformity with the spirit and letter of the Charter, of sparing no effort to contribute to their solution. This political will and determination that inspires my delegation is directly in line with the ancient traditions of Portuguese diplomacy. Throughout history, with a profoundly humanistic vision of life, we have preached and practised arbitration, conciliation, dialogue and peaceful negotiation as methods for the settlement of conflicts; and we believe that the moment has come for us to seek to make its presence felt, within this Organization, in such a way that will enable Portugal to continue that tradition in an efficient and fruitful manner for the international community.\n193.\tOstracized here for almost 25 years, Portugal, having now completed its process of decolonization and fully strengthened its democratic institutions, today has a just and legitimate claim to participate fully in international life and to collaborate openly at all levels with the organs and agencies of the United Nations. It is our belief that the long human experience acquired by my country throughout its\nhistory could be a valuable asset to the cause of better understanding among the peoples of so many different origins and cultures which today form the community of nations. As an eloquent sign of the richness of that experience, let me point to the fact that I am quite naturally able to address you here in Portuguese, a language spoken today by about 150 million people, represented here by several sovereign States, to which from this rostrum I address my most fraternal and warm good wishes.\n194.\tIt is in the light of the ideals I have just mentioned that we follow the serious situation in the Middle East and welcome all the initiatives that have been taken to bring peace eventually to that part of the world. These initiatives, which, in our opinion, should be pursued, with the necessary moral and political courage, have brought hope to all those who recognize that the continuation of tensions in that area could easily lead to a new war of incalculable proportions, resulting in great human suffering and material destruction. Despite the obstacles and difficulties still to be overcome or the understandable doubts and suspicions, the echo that these gestures of peace have found in the very peoples most closely affected by the problems of the region and their repercussions in the world lead us to foresee the possibility of a less arbitrary solution which would be more just for the peoples, the values and the interests at stake. We support the full implementation of the relevant resolutions adopted by this Organization on this matter. As we are bound by significant cultural and historical ties to the various peoples of the Middle East, it is with the greatest attention and care that we follow all the steps taken towards a solution that could ensure for all the States of the region the right to exist in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.\n195.\tFor us, that solution should obviously respect the rights of the Palestinian people and assure the fulfilment of their legitimate hopes and aspirations. Let us not forget that the Palestinians are, after all, in their own land at this very moment the major victims of a conflict that has lasted over 30 years. But one point has to be made clear: never will there be peace in the Middle East-because peace implies the mutual recognition of States and full respect for their boundaries\u2014as long as alien territories remain occupied-by force. As soon as peace is reached, on the other hand\u2014with all its implications, with all its guarantees \u2014the abusive and unnecessary nature of occupation will become obvious to all.\n196.\tNevertheless, it is only with a genuine political will on the part of all the interested Governments and peoples and their effective participation that it will be possible to find and implement a peaceful, just and lasting solution to the conflict.\n197.\tWe would be happy to believe that we are heading towards such a solution, a solution which could bring peace to the peoples in the Middle East in the not-too-distant future, thus crowning with success the patient efforts that have been made and continue to be made, the latest of which was the courageous and noble initiative of the President of the United States to call the Camp David summit meetings. However limited they may be, all steps towards diminishing the risk of violent confrontation during the period still required for bringing about definitive solutions deserve our support.\n198. But let us not expect miracles from them. For it would indeed be a miracle if it were possible in a meeting of a few days to find a definitive solution for a problem that for over 30 years has gradually become more complex and more difficult. In an area where so many national interests, so many divergent - if not opposing-ideologies meet or are in conflict, where so many vital interests of the whole world community are at stake, where all the questions under discussion have become emotional issues making a rational approach almost impossible, we can only expect the road to peace to be long, sinuous and full of obstacles. We therefore welcome the steps aiming at peace, but we do not overrate them, nor do we entertain the dangerous illusion that their results-however encouraging-lead, or will in a short while lead, to the over-all settlement required in the Middle East in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the relevant resolutions adopted by the United Nations on the question.\n199.\tIt is in the same spirit that we have been following the developments of the situation in Africa-in the same spirit, but perhaps with additional concern due to the sentimental association and cultural and historical links that irrevocably bind us to that continent. This we do with no aim other than the solidarity which the struggle that continues to be waged there against colonialism and racism in their most intolerable forms deserves.\n200.\tIt has always been our view that only through an open discussion of ideas and problems between Africans would it be possible to find lasting solutions for the problems of the continent; and for the first time after the decolonization and the return of democracy to my country we were invited this year to attend the fifteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU in Khartoum, where we enjoyed the generous hospitality of the Government of Sudan. And, indeed, we were gratified to witness how creative, fertile and dignified a debate can be when it brings face to face men, albeit of diverse cultures and backgrounds but nevertheless united in the just and lawful defence of the causes which they believe can best enhance the prestige of Africa, its peoples, its traditions and the vitality and richness of its future.\n201.\tWe believe in the prospects of that future and in the determination of the African peoples and Governments in defining the patterns of their national destinies through the exercise of the full powers of their sovereignty, a sovereignty often conquered at such high cost. We are therefore increasingly worried to see that Africa may once again become a ground for confrontation between great-Power blocs alien to the realities and, indeed, to the very interests of Africa. We therefore express all the more strongly our hope for the stability of the African Governments, legitimized and sanctioned by their peoples through a prolonged and arduous struggle for independence and for the definition of their national identities.\n202.\tWe follow the problems that are a source of concern to  he majority of African countries with strict respect for the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of third countries. Nevertheless, we cannot avoid viewing with deep concern the situations which in theory or practice institutionalize racial discrimination or other forms of oppression which are a blatant denial of the most fundamental human rights. No historical argument can be invoked to delay the solutions which the conscience of the international community and the very dignity of man demand.\n203.\tThus in relation to southern Africa we express our hope that within this Organization or through machinery created by it quick solutions will be found for the following problems which mankind finds more intolerable every day: apartheid, the utmost form of racism, iniquity and injustice; the independence of Namibia, with full respect for its territorial unity and integrity-an independence almost attained thanks to the good of) ices of the five Western members of the Security Council, to whose perseverance we wish to pay a tribute, but an independence which, unfortunately, today still remains a promise loaded with risks of failure; and, lastly, the drama in Zimbabwe where, despite all efforts, it has still not been possible to find a formula that could put an end to a doubly fratricidal war, a war of tragic consequences not only for the people of Zimbabwe but also for the neighbouring countries.\n204.\tStill in the realm of problems that most directly concern us, we cannot refrain from mentioning the case of East Timor, where we believe the United Nations should promote compliance with the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council aimed at allowing the people of the Territory to exercise their legitimate rights to self-determination. The innumerable and relevant resolutions regarding the rights of people to self-determination adopted here in accordance with the principles contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) have been the basis of the decolonization process that my country has carried out since April 1974. However, the trend of events in the specific case of East Timor has not enabled its people to exercise that right. We therefore urgently appeal to all those who can to intervene in this matter so that the population of the Territory of East Timor may freely express itself regarding its own future.\n205.\tOn another level we wish to join our voice to those of many others that, here and in other organs within the United Nations and in the specialized agencies, insistently ask how it is possible that in a world of growing scientific and technological progress,- dramatic and alarming situations of poverty, anger and inequality continue to persist if not to multiply. We therefore support all the initiatives aimed at developing a new international economic order. But we cannot hide our disillusionment at seeing how little progress has been made towards that aim. The difficulties that have arisen must be faced clearly and courageously and adequate remedies must be sought.\n206.\tFor, despite the sincere will of the sponsors and supporters of resolutions and initiatives and the gravity of the problems under consideration, nothing concrete can possibly be achieved without the creation of a vast and comprehensive movement of political solidarity; a movement that would recognize the aspirations of the least favoured nations of the globe, interpret them and compel the main decision-making centres, whose action will be decisive, to take them into account.\n207.\tIn this context, Portugal attaches the greatest importance to the continuation of the North-South dialogue. It is\nwith serious apprehension that we view the recent stalemate in the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174. We hope that this can be overcome during the present session of the General Assembly, thus accelerating the process which will ensure, through the establishment of the necessary new international economic order, a fuller and more balanced economic growth, whose fruits will be shared equitably by the richer and the poorer members of the world community. In the same context, Portugal welcomes the efforts undertaken over several years by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The convening of the Conference was certainly one of the historic initiatives of the United Nations. Its efforts are destined to find just and balanced solutions for the preservation and exploitation of the wealth common to all mankind constituted by the resources of the sea.\n208.\tIn other areas also, the United Nations has a fundamental role to play. I wish to refer specifically to disarmament and human rights. Portugal supports general and complete disarmament, a principle expressed in its Constitution, and for this reason is pleased at the step that was taken in this direction at the tenth special session of the General Assembly. The fact that that session was held was also significant for the United Nations, for it is within tills Organization that important negotiations will take place. Without considering them to be spectacular, we appreciate the results achieved at the special session, in so far as we now have a rational framework. Organs which we hope will be effective have been created and will begin functioning according to a strategy for disarmament, as stated in the Declaration approved at the special session [resolution S-10/2, sect. II]. Principles and priorities were defined; a document was drafted to guide us in our tasks in this area; ideas were expressed and many have developed into the proposals that we must now examine and discuss. Finally there is a Programme of Action [ibid., sect. Ill]. All these efforts must have our support, given the danger of a nuclear war, the seed of which is contained in every conflict, and given the contemporary absurdity represented by the under-development of . such large regions of the world, and the volume of technical and financial resources absorbed by the arms industry and the arms trade.\n209.\tThis year we commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the activities of the United Nations in this field are therefore especially in the limelight. In view of its importance to us-an importance all the greater since Portugal was elected this year for the first time to the Commission on Human Rights\u2014I shall devote a few moments to this matter, in particular to two aspects which, to my mind, are particularly relevant: the eventual contradiction between the need to protect human rights in all countries and the obligation to refrain from interference in the internal affairs of any State; and the hierarchy, or relative importance, of the various categories of human rights.\n210.\tWith respect to the first problem, I believe we can accept the following premises or fundamental principles: first, the theme of human rights is the object of treaties and international conventions, including the very Charter of the United Nations; thus it cannot be said that the protection of those rights is a matter only for the internal jurisdiction of each State.\n211.\tSecondly, the boundaries of international law and those of the various rights guaranteed by internal law in matters of human rights do not necessarily coincide. It is not to be wondered at that the internal legislation of some States has a wider field of application or contains a more effective machinery for the protection of human rights. Thus, not all that may be protected by the laws of a particular State necessarily falls under the authority of international law. But this jurisdiction exists; it has a specific area of application and means of application which are proper to it.\n212.\tThirdly, the existing situation regarding human rights in the various countries involves questions and aspects which, although not irrelevant from the point of view of the exercise or protection of those rights, are, in fact, internal questions within the exclusive jurisdiction of every State. We are of the view that consideration of the internationally relevant aspects of human rights should not constitute a pretext for interference in internal affairs, but we also understand that the prohibition of interference should not impede the consideration of those rights.\n213.\tIn accordance with these premises, Portugal does not consider valid as a general argument the allegation that discussion of the existing situation in the field of human rights in a particular country necessarily constitutes interference in its internal affairs. We are aware, on the other hand, of the risks of overstepping the boundaries of the area of international concern, for once we had crossed those limits we would effectively be interfering; and we are well aware of the dangers, already evident in certain circumstances, of using the matter for political purposes. For our part, we intend scrupulously to respect the boundaries of international law in these matters, and we shall never manipulate the question of human rights as a means to other ends.\n214.\tAnother aspect which at times becomes a matter of polemics in the debates on human rights is that of the existence of a hierarchy in the various types or categories of such rights. Listening to such debates, one would think that there was a competition between civil and political rights on the one hand and economic, social and cultural rights, on the other.\n215.\tAs far as we are concerned, this is a false problem, for we believe that what is fundamental is the protection of each and all. Historical situations may make people more sensitive to a certain type of right. Social and political conditions may reveal that certain rights are more vulnerable and therefore require more protection. Social and economic conditions Can, it a specific moment, require that more urgent attention be directed to one category of rights, because only when these are secured can the peoples truly believe in the observance of others.\n216.\tBut there are no such things as first-class and second-class rights. Because some laws give insufficient protection, that does not legitimize or justify the non-recognition of others. And, lastly, because the historical importance of some laws is emphasized by struggles carried out on their behalf, that does not mean that other rights, of equal human importance, can be forgotten.\n217.\tThe problem is not that of a hierarchy of rights, but rather that of trying to ensure an increasingly wider and\nmore effective protection of all rights, and of remaining hopeful that the progress of human society will continue to widen the field of human rights, establishing concepts which today are only hopes or whose weakness is blamed on the imperfections of society.\n218 We must begin by achieving this on an internal level in each of our countries, and I declare that Portugal, with its Constitution, its laws and its day-to-day practices, cannot be accused of not practising what it preaches. Conscious of the solidarity among all the peoples of the world, we must also give our full co-operation to the international bodies for the universal protection of human rights. The methods of doing this in any given case, on the internal or the international level, will certainly be different, but the objective is the same, as should be our determination.\n219.\tIn reiterating the desire of my country to continue and to strengthen its co-operation with the United Nations, I wish to confirm once again, albeit briefly, what we have declared in this forum since my country again became governed by democratic institutions.\n220.\tWe have clearly assumed and shall continue to discharge our responsibilities as a European nation whose most significant historical links place us today with full rights in the group of countries that have found, through institutionalizing ideological pluralism, the type of .social and political organization that best serves their peoples.\n221.\tAlthough we are Europeans, as a result of the spirit of enterprise and scientific risk that has always been a notable characteristic of Western life we have been led by historical destiny to maintain a secular and continuous presence in other latitudes and other continents. Having now returned to Europe, we feel we have left throughout the world\u2014in America, in Africa, in Asia-cultural ties that impose on us obligations, an appeal and an identity to which we cannot be indifferent. We have gained opportunities for living together in harmony that we should like to realize fully.\n222 We shall strive consistently, through our participation in international life and particularly in the United Nations and its specialized bodies, to shoulder the complex responsibilities that we happily claim and to make our contribution to the establishment of a better understanding between peoples and the maintenance of peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff99.\tMr. President, it gives me pleasure to hail your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of our Assembly. Upper Volta particularly welcomes the fact that it is the representative of a friendly country, Colombia, who is guiding our work. You are the son of a continent whose destiny is akin to that of Africa. Therefore, we are both bound to fight in solidarity against under-development and for peace and justice. My delegation assures you of its full collaboration, especially as we place our trust in your personal qualities.\n100.\tAllow me on behalf of the delegation of Upper Volta to congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, for\nthe outstanding way in which he guided the work of the regular and special sessions of the last year.\n101.\tI would be remiss if I forgot all those whose daily efforts contribute to the smooth functioning of our Organization.\n102.\tIt is only right to recognize the leading role played by our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and his various assistants. May I again assure him of our entire trust, and congratulate him most cordially for his ceaseless efforts in favour of the poorer countries.\n103.\tWe also congratulate Solomon Islands on its admission to membership in our Organization. We have no doubt that that young State will make a valuable contribution in the quest for peace and international security.\n104.\tThe 30 years from 1948 to 1978, the space of a generation, should have sufficed for man to make changes commensurate with his genius. Our Universal Declaration of Human Rights is surely a huge profession of faith. It is the creed of those who, having lived through the worst horrors that man has ever inflicted on man, had the moral strength to proclaim that man is still the only value. As for the means of restoring humanity's battered dignity, those who signed the Declaration in 1948 relied on the genius of their fellowman and the will of Governments.\n105.\tWe all know what the situation was, and what it is now.\n106.\tWhile fantastic scientific progress each passing day demonstrates anew the intelligence of our species and its capacity to progress beyond the realm of what is conceivable, exasperating inequalities make us doubt the possibility of satisfying the requirements set forth in the Declaration of Human Rights.\n107.\tUpper Volta, which endorses the principles of that Declaration in the preamble to its Constitution of 28 November 1977, also makes it its main preoccupation, not in order to be in the fashion but because the people of Upper Volta are profoundly committed to the ideals of freedom, dignity and justice.\n108.\tWhat some have called the \\\"Upper Volta experiment\\\" is nothing but an attempt by an entire people to achieve its own idea of happiness by its own means and by actions of its choice. Our experiment is a struggle for freedom, since it enshrines respect for man in his physical, moral and intellectual integrity. Our experiment, under the enlightened guidance of General Aboubakar Sangoule Lamizana, the President of the Republic, is a struggle for the dignity of our proud, hard-working people, with whom, however, nature has not been lavish. Our experiment is, finally, a daily struggle for justice-justice which is emblazoned in our motto and in our hearts, justice for our peoples and for the peoples of the whole world. This is well known by our partners in the United Nations, who have followed our militant efforts for the establishment of an international order based on equity and justice.\n109.\tIt is in the name of these principles that we reject attempts at denial of the human person, especially when they are accompanied by violence.\n110. Aerial hijacking and international terrorism, to quote but these two phenomena, have been able to make their appearance in recent years as simultaneous products of a world of interdependence and of a society of rapid communication. We cannot but be anxious given their ever-increasing scale. We are entitled to ask ourselves why the international community seems nonplussed, even defenceless, in the face of these acts of violence. Perhaps the universal conscience, revolted to the very core by their effect, is not sufficiently abreast of the causes.\nIll Indeed it seems urgent to ask that the international community and in particular our Organization strive to find equitable solutions to the problems which are at the basis of this violence.\n112. In Upper Volta we place our faith in man. That is why we wage relentless war against such outmoded concepts as racial discrimination and its most ignoble manifestation, apartheid.\n113 The Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination which we proclaimed five years ago [resolution 3057 (XXVIII)] runs the risk of being the greatest failure of our Organization unless we are determined to implement the repressive measures which are called for and to use some of the means provided for in our Charter. The year 1978, which marks the mid-decade and which we call \\\"International Anti-Apartheid Year\\\", must not come to a close without the international community chalking up even a slight victory against the Pretoria regime\n114.\tThe best opportunity would be for us to find a solution to the Namibian problem\n115.\tThe patience of our Organization has been taxed with regard to that Territory. The subtle facets of the problem require caution if its ideal of peace is to be achieved. Unfortunately the other side has never been equal to its responsibilities. The declaration of the racist, Vorster, dated 20 September last, is proof that Soum Africa only understands the language of violence. For our part we have followed with the greatest interest, although without any illusions, the efforts of the five Western Powers, members of the Security Council, in their desperate attempts to persuade South Africa to accept the inevitable independence of Namibia in dignity.\n116.\tThe ninth special session, which we devoted to the question of Namibia, was an occasion to spell out in no uncertain terms the condition of accession of that Territory to international sovereignty. Six months later, those conditions still remain valid. Namibia, an international Territory under the direct responsibility of the United Nations, cannot be liberated in violation of the sacred principles of our Organization. To spare the South African usurper any longer would cause us to endorse the annexation of Walvis Bay on the one hand and to consecrate the introduction of apartheid in Namibia on the other. We must therefore decide whether we want to make Namibia yet another Bantustan or a sovereign State that we would be proud to welcome as a full-fledged Member of our Organization. Upper Volta for its part, welcomes resolution 435 (1978), adopted by the Security Council on 29 September 1978,\nand requests the international community to face up to its responsibilities, all its responsibilities.\n117.\tIt is interesting to note the similar methods used by the racists of Pretoria and Salisbury. From hoodwinking to slurp practices, from vain promises to frauds made into a system of Government, the Ian Smith regime has nothing to learn from that of Pretoria.\n118.\tToday it is clear for everybody including the friends of Salisbury that the so-called internal settlement was simply aimed at perpetuating the domination of the white minority at the risk of imperilling the very existence of that community.\n119.\tThe agreements dividing the people of Zimbabwe soon showed their limitations because they even failed to conceal the rivalries which tear asunder those who subscribed to them.\n120.\tThe failure of the biracial Government of Salisbury and the exacerbation of tension in the subregion should be enough to convince the racist Ian Smith that the salvation of Rhodesia and the white minority lies in majority rule.\n121.\tThe peril to international peace caused by these discredited regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury is one of the principal concerns of my Government. Africa in general and Upper Volta in particular require guarantees. Our concern is that our development should be accomplished in an uninterrupted way without the threat of world conflagration which we know is inevitable as long as certain pockets of tension persist especially on the African continent and in the Middle East.\n122\tThat is why my country, Upper Volta, follows with the greatest of attention and the keenest interest the efforts for peace being deployed on the Middle East question.\n123\tMy Government will be among those who welcome any hope of peace in the region, on the condition, nevertheless, that they do not carry the seeds of their own destruction. For that, the partners should make sure that they do not trample underfoot the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\n124\tSeveral events have occurred over this year which, whatever their importance and their impact on the policies of nations, have scarcely eased the lot of peoples still enslaved by poverty. Nevertheless the rich countries are over-equipped They have bought more armaments; they have proliferated their sovereign enterprises of the most wasteful kind. As an example world military expenditure has increased from $245 billion in 1973 to more than S500 billion at the present time.\n125.\tWhat is to be done? Only international co-operation based on a dynamic, genuine solidarity can save our civilization from the scourges of hunger, malnutrition, disease and ignorance.\n126.\tThe initiative of our Organization to hold the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries was an opportunity to stress once again the seriousness of the international economic situation. The fact that mankind is divided into two very unequal camps is something to which we are now accustomed, since it is so true that the disparities in development stem from the very nature of things. But for the international conscience to stand by helplessly as it witnesses the growing gap between the rich and poor is both disconcerting and revolting. It is no secret to anyone in this hall that of 4 billion inhabitants on our planet, 800 million only, that is to say one fifth of the world population, are free from material worries. The rest, that is to say more than 3 billion men, still live in deprivation or even utter poverty\n127 Last year I had an opportunity in this same forum10 to advocate on behalf of my country, Upper Volta, the definition of a new international morality.\n128.\tThe present situation does not lead me to think that my proposal is obsolete. In no way .would I claim to invent the definition but I believe that the President of the United States Mr. Jimmy Carter has already emphasized one of the crucial points by taking up the challenge of human rights.\n129.\tThat is certainly a gigantic undertaking, on which, however, depends the very survival of the whole of mankind, because it is only the people, when they have an opportunity to think and to have their say, who can dispel the countless threats which torment our world today.\n130.\tIndeed, the atmosphere generally prevailing is one of merciless rivalry, economic and commercial competition and ideological confrontation, which allows no time for humanistic feelings and still less for consideration of the individual rights of human beings and citizens.\n131.\tFortunately, nations with a tradition of generosity in the conception of human rights and freedom know how to escape from the threat of this gangrene and do not hesitate to use all their moral authority to secure respect for this moral imperative.\n132.\tIn an infinitely more modest context, and without presuming to lecture anyone, Upper Volta also has resolutely committed itself to this course, which is certainly difficult and full of pitfalls but which in the long run should further improve the flattering image others already have of us.\n133.\tOur task, however, is made particularly arduous because of certain objective situations which limit the impact and the results of our efforts.\n134.\tThere is, first of all, that circumstance which is a more or less interdependent phenomenon, of desertification and drought, which for the past eight years now has kept the countries of the Sahelian region in a state of permanent anguish. The world's public has been sensitized to this tragedy and has already responded in active and effective solidarity, but a valid solution can be sought only through a certain number of medium-term and long-term actions.\n135.\tIn this respect one may and should recall the action now being taken in liaison with the Permanent Inter-State\nCommittee on Drought Control in the Sahel. That action, on the basis of the \\\"compendium\\\" adopted by the conference of the .Heads of State of the Sahelian countries, which met at Ouagadougou in 1973, consists in the medium-term planning of studies and projects to propose a weather warning system, to establish a regional plan to mobilize action in the event of future droughts, to supervise the shipment of means of assistance by road and to establish a regional pasture rehabilitation plan.\n136.\tOn a longer-term basis, CILSS intends to develop a global development strategy to prevent a repetition of such a calamity, by laying the emphasis on the control of weather factors, reafforestation, hydro-agricultural management, training and research.\n137.\tThe current Chairman of CILSS explained here, on 22 September [4th meeting], the action taken for the rehabilitation of the Sahel and drew the attention of the international community to the immense tasks which remained to be carried out. Upper Volta, where headquarters of CILSS and the regional office of the United Nations Sahelian Office are situated, fully endorses that statement and would like to avail itself of this opportunity to pay a particular tribute to the President of the Gambia for his tireless efforts. However, it would perhaps be conceivable for the United Nations to launch, in parallel, a \\\"decade of the tree\\\", which would promote the necessary sensitivity concerning that aspect of the problems of the Sahel, and at the same time to establish an appropriate framework for decisive action to be carried out by people of goodwill who are waiting only to be called upon to act.\n138.\tHowever, beyond this crisis situation which prevails in the Sahelian countries we must emphasize the problems of food and water which affect our world. Indeed, as was appropriately emphasized by the United Nations Conference on Desertification, only an ecological readjustment on a world scale can assist us in facing the world food shortage.\n139.\tFor the developing countries, where the situation is most alarming, that deficit is caused by two decisive factors. First, there is the decline in world cereal production According to FAO statistics 26 developing countries at present suffer serious food shortages. Those countries, whose total population amounts to 250 million inhabitants, are located in Africa and South-East Asia Most of them belong to the group of least developed countries. Since 1970, the food production of the developing countries has risen at the rate of 1.5 per cent per year compared with 3 per cent per year in the industrialized countries, while the population of the third world has grown at twice the rate of that of the rich countries. Further, there is the reduction in international aid. It is estimated that in 1976 agricultural aid granted by the rich countries to the poorer countries declined by 9 per cent in real terms. The effect of that is obviously a lowering in the standard of living. Whereas at the beginning of the present decade, that is to say in 1971, it was estimated that 400 million people suffered from malnutrition, today that figure has risen to 455 million. Without going into the details of it, that observation starkly reveals the tragedy which traumatizes four fifths of\nmankind. To ensure the daily subsistence needs of 3 billion people subjected to deprivation and to preserve future generations from the psychosis of hunger seems to us the primary task of the international community. Apart from the fact that food aid serves to alleviate the chronic undernourishment and malnutrition of particularly vulnerable people, such as the aged and mothers and children, it also meets the pressing needs created by natural disasters. The countries of the Sahel, members of CILSS, have in their time been able to appreciate the benefits of international assistance in this field. Let us also recognize that this form of aid also helps the balance of payments of developing countries since it lowers the cost of imports in that sector. According to FAO statistics, the cereal import needs of 49 developing countries, the least advanced, which have priority from the point of food needs, amount this year to 21 million tons. At the same time, the cost of cereals imports in all developing countries rose from $4 billion in 1972 to some $13 billion in 1976. In view of these observations, I am sure the Assembly will agree with mo that we must establish bases for genuine world food security. That concept could be reflected in the initial stage, to help in meeting the needs of the most needy, by the establishment of buffer stocks, the regulatory rule of which would make it possible to cope with changing needs. From the structural point of view, FAO, which has already done so much, would play a supervisory role and the WFP would carry out the regulatory function. Such a proposal, if it were to be implemented through a strict methodology, would have the triple advantage of at all times compensating for the food shortages of the needy countries, restraining the rise of food prices, and encouraging farmers not to lower their production.\n140. However, these are only expedients, at least as regards the particular situation of my country and the other countries in the Sahel. The true \\\"long-term solution\nlies in large-scale ventures to provide irrigated land, because we are convinced that water is one of the primary factors of life-hence the importance of the water problem. The treatises drafted for the United Nations Conference on Water,12 bear witness to the great potential of the third world's water resources. The rivers of Asia, South America and Africa are the principal rivers of the world, because of their volume and their exploitability. The only remaining problem is to apply a rational policy of water control. The most serious studies show that Africa and Asia can become the granaries of the world, as long as the necessary financing, material and technology are made available to them. That is why we appeal once again to the solidarity of the nations gathered here to bring about an improvement in aid policies. To this end, we must redefine and draw up a system of global co-operation for a world that will be no longer a world of donors and recipients but one of interdependence based on equality of rights among partners. For never has the international community been so aware of the interdependence that links the rich and the poor countries in the same destiny, that of establishing a just and lasting peace through the final solution of the greatest scourge of our time\u2014under-development.\n141. To paraphrase an illustrious, now departed, pioneer of peace, Upper Volta expects that in the field of international solidarity every man will do his duty. That duty is, as it was 33 years ago, to safeguard man and ensure his daily survival; that duty is, as it was 33 years ago, to safeguard peace.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff223.\tI would like to begin my speech by congratulating Mr Indalecio Lievano on his election as President of the current session of the General Assembly. I would also like to take this opportunity to extend warm congratulations to Solomon Islands on its admission to membership in the United Nations and sincerely to wish it new successes in advancing independently along the road to progress.\n224.\tSince the thirty-second session of the General Assembly last year, there have been new developments and changes in the international situation. The struggle of the people of all countries to win and defend national independence, safeguard international peace and security and oppose imperialism, colonialism and hegemonism has developed vigorously and scored new victories. In this struggle the countries and people of the third world have played the major role. Some Asian and African countries\nand peoples have succeeded in defending their national independence and territorial integrity by repulsing military intrusions engineered by a super-Power and frustrating its schemes of subversion and sabotage. The African countries have voiced strong opposition to foreign interference in African affairs. The struggles of the people in southern Africa against racism and for national liberation have developed in depth. The people of the Arab countries and Palestine have fought persistently and resolutely against Israeli Zionism and the rivalry between the super-Powers in the Middle East. The people of the Latin American countries have achieved important successes in safeguarding their independence and sovereignty, developing their national economy and strengthening regional co-operation. The non-aligned movement, withstanding super-Power pressure, has maintained its basic orientation and become an important force in the present struggle of the people of the whole world against imperialism, colonialism and hegemonism. There is a clear trend growing among the Western European and other second-world countries towards strengthening their unity, expanding their cooperation and opposing super-Power interference and domination. All these are signs that the international situation has continued to develop in a direction favourable to the people of the world.\n225. However, we must not fail to notice that over the past year there has been great turbulence in the international situation, and world peace and international security have been seriously threatened. The two superpowers have intensified their struggle for world hegemony, with one striving to preserve its vested interests and the other trying hard to extend its spheres of influence. Strategically the, focus of their rivalry is in Europe, where the two sides are locked in sharp confrontation as before. To outflank and encircle Europe, social-imperialism has stepped up its aggression and expansion in Africa, the Middle East and the Gulf region, seizing positions and resources of strategic importance and trying to control transportation routes, and this constitutes an important component of its strategy for world domination. Meanwhile, in an effort to strengthen its position in seeking domination in the Asia-Pacific region, it has stepped up its expansion and infiltration, created frictions and conflicts, and thus posed a direct threat to the security of the countries involved. In this period, the salient features of the tactics used by this super-Power in its offensive were as follows: in an increasingly flagrant way it has employed agents, has organized mercenaries and has incited Africans against Africans and Asians against Asians so as to make them pull its chestnuts out of the fire for it. It even has no scruples about using terrorist means of assassination and creating shocking incidents of subversion and disturbance. The social-imperialists' unbridled acts of aggression and expansion constitute a new trend in the international arena which calls for attention. They prove once again that social-imperialism is the more aggressive cid adventurous of the two super-Powers and is the major threat to world peace and security.\n226. As a result of the intensified rivalry between the two hegemonist Powers and the accelerated global strategic deployment of social-imperialism, there have been more local wars and the danger of a world war has increased. Therefore, putting off a world war and maintaining world\npeace has now become an important task for the people of all countries.\n227.\tOver the past year, the people of the world, in the face of the threat of a new war, have been increasingly awakened and have waged struggles in many fields. In order to safeguard their independence and security, many countries have been striving to strengthen their defence capabilities. People all over the world have condemned the super-Powers for their arms expansion and war preparations and have voiced a loud demand for a halt to the arms race. A growing number of discerning persons have urged a sharper vigilance against war. All this is no doubt of positive significance for preserving peace and delaying war.\n228.\tThe super-Powers are busy spreading illusions of peace to lull the people of the world in an effort to cover up their plans for war. The social-imperialists babble that \\\"detente has been a dominant feature\\\" in the international political climate. If this were so, why should they spend colossal sums of money every year hectically expanding their arms? Why should they desperately seek an edge in nuclear weapons after establishing a superiority in conventional armaments? Clearly, the social-imperialists have ulterior motives when they foster a false sense of detente.\n229.\tA correct path must be followed in order to win and maintain world peace and put off the outbreak of war. The approach we stand for is that, first, it is necessary to tell truthfully the people of all countries about the growing danger of war, so that they may heighten their vigilance and make all preparations to comb t the aggressor. Secondly, efforts should be made to reinforce the struggle against the warmongers, frustrate every act of aggression and expansion of theirs, and upset in good time their deployment for war. Thirdly, there should be continued opposition to the policy of appeasement, which means compromises and concessions in dealing with the aggressor. Because, like rearing a tiger and suffering for it later on, such a policy is harmful and simply augments the danger of war. China has been acting on these three principles and will continue to do so in the future.\n230.\tThe super-Powers are outwardly strong but inwardly weak. The more aggressive they are, the stronger the resistance they meet from the people of all countries. Over the past year, social-imperialism has stepped up its aggression and expansion only to teach the people of all countries by negative example and arouse them to a more resolute struggle against it and to bring about the further consolidation and broadening of the international anti-hegemonist united front. Such is the logic of history. The strength of the people is great. It is entirely possible to put off the outbreak of a world war so long as the people of the world get united, wage a tit-for-tat struggle against the superpowers' war plans and constantly thwart their schemes of war.\n231.\tThe rivalry between the super-Powers endangers world peace and poses a direct threat to the independence and security of various countries. So it has become an urgent task for the people of all countries to defend national independence and State sovereignty.\n232.\tAt present, the countries of the third world find themselves in a new and complex situation in their struggle to safeguard national independence. To further its aggression and expansion, social-imperialism is trying to fool people by flaunting a signboard saying \\\"a natural ally of the developing countries\\\" who \\\"supports the national liberation movements\\\". Besides, it is doing its utmost to sow discord among third-world countries. It confers on you the title \\\"progressive\\\" one day, but labels you \\\"reactionary\\\" the next. Now supporting one against another, now the other way round, it stops at nothing in creating dissension and undermining the unity of the third-world countries. The people of the third world have come to realize through their own experience that upholding unity and struggling jointly against the enemy are an important guarantee for victories in the fight to defend national independence. Over the past year, when confronted with the arch-enemy, they have attached importance to the general interest and have sought common ground on major issues while putting aside minor differences. They have upheld unity, opposed division and foreign interference, and have persevered in the struggle against hegemonism. At the fifteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU in Khartoum in July and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, held in Belgrade also in July, satisfactory results were achieved in the teeth of super-Power interference and sabotage. The Khartoum summit meeting strongly condemned any foreign interference in the internal affairs of the African continent, decided to strengthen African-Arab co-operation and laid stress on the peaceful settlement of disputes between the member States of the OAU and on strengthening unity and economic co-operation. The Belgrade Conference maintained the unity of the non-aligned movement by frustrating super-Power designs to split it. The Conference once again affirmed and safeguarded the nature and principles of the movement, stressed the fight against \\\"all forms of foreign domination and hegemony\\\" [see A/33/206, annex I, para. 10] and kept to its anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist and anti-hegemonist orientation. The two Conferences fully demonstrated the great vitality of the non-aligned movement and the OAU as well as their significant roles in current international relations, and they were an important indication of the further development of the united struggle of the people of the world against hegemonism.\n233.\tThe grave danger of social-imperialist aggression and annexation has also prompted the countries of the second world to pay ever greater attention to the defence of their national independence. Faced with this super-Power's military threat and divisive schemes, the Western European countries and some other second-world countries have further built up their national defences, harmonized their mutual relations and strengthened their economic, political and military alliance. This not only conforms to the interests of these countries in safeguarding their independence and security, but it is also in the interests of the people of -all countries.\n234.\tThe situation in the Middle East merits serious attention. The Israeli Zionists now still adamantly refuse to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories or to recognize the national rights of the Palestinian people, and they are carrying out new threats of war against the Arab and Palestinian peoples. Such truculence on the part of the Israeli Zionists is closely related to the support and abetment given them by the two super-Powers. One super-Power has always been shielding Israel. The other\nsuper-Power, while trying hard to maintain a state of \\\"no war, no peace\\\" in the Middle East, has been stirring up trouble and sowing dissension among the Arab countries in order to undermine their unity and sap their fighting strength so as to fish in troubled waters.\n235. The Chinese Government and people have always held that the Arab and Palestinian peoples are the immediate victims of the fierce rivalry of the super-Powers and the aggression and expansion committed by Israel. The settlement of the Middle East question can be realized only when it truly leads to the recovery of the lost territories of the Arab people and the restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian people, and only thus can it bring peace to the Middle East. The struggle of the Arab countries and people against Israeli Zionism is perfectly just, and it is closely linked with the struggle against hegemonism. The Chinese Government and people consistently and resolutely support the Arab and Palestinian peoples in their struggle to recover their lost territories and to regain Palestinian national rights, and we are firmly opposed to the two super-Powers competing for hegemony in the Middle East and grossly trampling upon the interests of the Arab people. We strongly condemn the Israeli Zionist policies of aggression and expansion. We do not recognize Israel and will have nothing to do with it. It is our sincere hope that through patient consultations the Arab and Palestinian peoples will eliminate their differences, ceaselessly strengthen their unity, gradually overcome the difficulties on their road to progress and finally win great victories in their struggle against aggression.\n236 Southern Africa remains the biggest colonial region in the world today. Abetted and backed by the imperialists, the reactionary regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia are still zealously pushing their colonialist and racist policies. This state of affairs must not continue but must be thoroughly changed. Under heavy blows from the Zimbabwean and Namibian peoples rising in armed struggle, the racist regimes are h ding for their doom, but they are still putting up a last-aitch fight by pressing ahead with such political tricks as the so-called \\\"internal settlement and making incessant incursions into neighbouring African States in an effort to maintain their reactionary rule. Moreover, there is no slackening in the rivalry between the two super-Powers in this region. The late-coming superpower, in particular, is carrying out infiltration and expansion by every possible means. We have always held that all countries which uphold justice should strongly support the people of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Azama in their struggle for liberation. Zimbabwe and Namibia should attain genuine national independence free from any outside interference and on the basis of territorial integrity and unification. South Africa's policy of apartheid must be abolished. The United Nations must follow the historical trend and perform its bounden duty of putting an end to the colonialist and racist rule in southern Africa in accordance with the eager desire and just demands of the African people. China firmly supports the just struggles of the Azanian, Zimbabwean and Namibian peoples. We are sure that the great African people will shatter the last stronghold of colonialism and racism and win .complete independence and liberation for the whole of Africa.\n237. The Korean people's just struggle for the independent and peaceful reunification of their fatherland has won\nthe sympathy and support of the people of the world. At present, the key to a solution of the Korean question is that the United States must withdraw all its troops and armaments from South Korea and that the so-called \\\"United Nations Command\\\" must be disbanded. The United States and the Park Chung Hee clique of South Korea must stop all their scheming activities to create two Koreas\\\". We firmly support the position and efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. The resolution for promoting the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at its thirtieth session resolution 3390 (XXX)] should be implemented in earnest and without delay. The Korean question should be settled by the Korean people themselves free from any foreign interference.\n238. Disarmament is' one of the important items on the agenda of the current session. The tenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament, convened not long ago on the proposal of the non-aligned countries was the first of its kind in the history of the United Nations. At the session, many countries strongly condemned the imperialist and hegemonist policies of aggression and war. Rightly pointing out that the real cause of the intensifying arms race between the super-Powers was their increased rivalry for world hegemony, these countries demanded that the super-Powers carry out genuine disarmament. They also put forward a number of reasonable ideas and proposals. The special session on disarmament has a positive significance inasmuch as it exposed the superpowers' arms expansion and war preparations and demanded that they be the first to carry out disarmament. But the super-Powers were very obdurate. They rejected any genuine nuclear or conventional disarmament. The facts show that the struggle for genuine disarmament is most arduous.\n239. Under the pressure of the people of the world for disarmament, the super-Powers have been playing the tricks of sham disarmament to deceive the public. Recently, the Soviet Union put before the current session a new proposal entitled \\\"Conclusion of an international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States\\\". Under the signboard reading \\\"guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States\\\", this proposal is designed to bind hand and foot the numerous small and medium-sized countries and deprive them of their capabilities for self-defence. Not contented with the large amount of nuclear weapons in its possession, the Soviet Union is desperately expanding its nuclear armament. Instead of undertaking the obligation not to use nuclear weapons under whatever conditions against the large number of non-nuclear countries, the Soviet Union wants those countries to abandon their right of possessing nuclear strength for self-defence. This proposal of the Soviet Union is simply designed to allow itself alone to possess large numbers of nuclear weapons, while forcing the non-nuclear countries to act according to its dictates in all docility. Otherwise, those countries would be exposed to its nuclear attacks at any time. Is this not pure gangster's lope, undisguised nuclear blackmail and nuclear threat? We have consistently held that the most effective means of eliminating the danger of a nuclear war and of guaranteeing the\nsecurity of all countries is the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. Moreover, we have reaffirmed on many occasions that at no time and under no circumstances shall we use nuclear weapons against the non-nuclear countries. If the author of the proposed \\\"international convention\\\" had the slightest concern for the security of the non-nuclear countries and for international peace, it should at least undertake the obligation not to use nuclear weapons under whatever conditions against the non-nuclear countries, instead of playing tricks of one kind or another.\n240.\tDuring the current session, a further decision is to be taken on the machinery for disarmament. It is entirely legitimate for the numerous small and medium-sized countries to demand strongly a change in the super-Power manipulation of the disarmament negotiations and a reform in the disarmament machinery. The decision of the tenth special session to reform the disarmament machinery reflects to some extent the aspiration of these countries. However, the new negotiating body still falls far short of the demand of many countries, and it can hardly free itself entirely from super-Power control and ensure the realization of the reasonable propositions of various countries on disarmament. Of course, the progress of the struggle for disarmament does not depend entirely on the negotiating body; rather it depends essentially on whether the superpowers can be forced to change their intransigent stand. The struggle for disarmament must be closely linked with the struggle to safeguard national independence, defend state sovereignty and territorial integrity, and combat hegemonism. We are ready to continue to work together with the large number of small and medium-sized countries for genuine disarmament.\nr\n241.\tIn the past year, the third-world countries have continued their unremitting struggle for the establishment of a new international economic order. United as one, they have made great efforts for the realization of their just proposals in disregard of the threats and promises of the super-Powers. They have greatly expanded their economic and technical co-operation, and various organizations of raw-material-producing countries and regional co-operative bodies have been established and steadily consolidated. The third-world countries have also increased their economic and technical co-operation with many second-world countries. Some developed countries have taken measures to reduce or cancel some debts owed by developing countries. All this has a positive effect on the reform of the old international economic relations and the establishment of a new international economic order and on ,the development of the national economies of the third world.\n242.\tHowever, owing to super-Power obstruction and sabotage, no real progress has been made in destroying the old and establishing the new in the international economic field. One super-Power is playing with the words \\\"new order\\\" but is in fact still obstinately defending the old order. The other super-Power has put up the slogan of \\\"democratic reform\\\" but has tried to make international economic relations serve its interests in gaining world hegemony so as to extend and aggravate exploitation and control of developing countries: This is the main obstacle to the establishment of a new international economic order.\n243.\tThe urgent desire of the developing countries for establishing a new international economic order has become a great historical trend. At the same time, it must be noticed that arduous and complex struggles have to be waged before this goal can be attained. We believe that, so long as the third-world countries keep to the correct principles and orientation of the sixth special session of the United Nations General Assembly, persist in solidarity and unite with all forces that can be united and wage a long and unremitting struggle, they will surmount all difficulties and win successive victories. The Chinese Government resolutely supports this just struggle as well as the reasonable proposals of the developing countries, such as an integrated programme for commodities and its common fund, the reduction or cancellation of debts, an increase in funds for development, and better conditions for the transfer of technology so as to promote production and scientific and technological progress in the developing countries. It is also our hope that the second-world countries will all adopt a correct attitude to strengthen their co-operation with developing countries on an equal footing and contribute to the establishment of a new international economic order.\n244.\tAt present, China is in a new period of development. Following the behests of our great leader Chairman Mao Tsetung and beloved Premier Chou En-lai, the Chinese people have set off on a new Long March and are determined to turn China into a prosperous socialist country with modernized agriculture, industry, national defence and science and technology by the end of the century. In high spirits, the Chinese people are working hard to attain this magnificent goal.\n245.\tIn international affairs, China will pursue, as always, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in foreign affairs. Firmly adhering to Chairman Mao's theory of the three worlds, we will strengthen our unity with the oppressed peoples and nations of the world and with all third-world countries, and unite with all countries which are subjected to super-Power aggression, subversion, interference, control or bullying to form the broadest possible united front against super-Power hegemonism. We will establish or develop relations with other countries on the basis of the Five Principles: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity; mutual non-aggression;  non-interference in each other's internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence. We support all the oppressed peoples and Nations in their revolutionary struggles and all countries struggling to safes their independence and sovereignty and to defend international peace and security, and we are opposed to all forms of foreign rule, domination and hegemony.\n246.. The past year has witnessed great progress in our friendly relations with many countries. We have warmly entertained on-friendly visits many State leaders from , whom we have received much encouragement, sympathy and support. In the current new situation, our State leaders, -out of a sincere desire for friendship, peace, understanding and co-operation, have taken the initiative of visiting many countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe. Our friendship with many countries and our mutual understanding have been enhanced through sincere and candid talks based on mutual respect. With joint exploration and endeavour, our economic links, scientific and technological co-operation and Cultural exchanges with them have been\nmarkedly strengthened. Our friendly contacts with other peoples have also become more frequent. The Chinese people, and people of other countries likewise, are happy to see mo growth of friendly relations between them. We will continue our efforts in this direction.\n247.\tThis year, our supreme leader, Chairman Hua Kuo-feng, has visited Korea, Romania, Yugoslavia and Iran. These visits, which have had satisfactory results, constitute a major event in China's relations with foreign countries, have received wide attention and have been given a positive appraisal by international opinion. These historic visits have greatly deepened the sincere understanding between China and the countries concerned, have opened up broader vistas for bilateral friendly co-operation, and are conducive to world peace.\n248.\tRecently, China and Japan signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship after making prolonged efforts and overcoming various obstacles. This treaty records the desire of the Chinese and Japanese peoples to live in amity from generation to generation. It includes the explicit stipulation that \\\"... neither of them should seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region or in any other region and that each is opposed to efforts by any other country or group of countries to establish such hegemony\\\". This is the first time that such a stipulation is included in an international treaty. The treaty is of great importance both to the development of relations of peace and friendship between China and Japan and to the defence of peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region.\n249.\tThe Chinese people ardently love peace and are opposed to a new world war. Moreover, we need an enduring, peaceful international environment in which to build up our country. Faithful to Chairman Mao's teachings, China will never seek hegemony or act like a super-Power, neither now nor in the future, when China becomes a powerful modernized socialist country. Confronted with the growing danger of war, we are determined, while engaging in peaceful construction at home, to do our part, together with the people of all other countries, to safeguard peace and put off war.\n250.\tReviewing the international developments of the past year and looking ahead into the future, we see that countries want independence, nations want liberation and the people want revolution-this historical trend is irresistible though the road may be tortuous and the sky may be overcast from time to time. The world belongs to the people, and the future of the world is bright. Of this we are fully confident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I should like to express our warm welcome to that country, wish it every success and extend to it the best wishes of Algeria for the well-being and prosperity of its people.\n216.\tAt a time when numerous attempts are being made to call into question the movement for the liberation of peoples, this session seems an appropriate moment in which to assess the real determination of the forces which profess themselves ready to promote the necessary changes. The changes that we have recently observed in international relations are so little compatible with the spirit and requirements of our time that they lead us to believe that those whom we thought to be our partners, far from truly favouring consultations and constructive co-operation with the third world, continue to be deeply attached to obsolete notions of power. Fully aware of the weaknesses and contradictions of the third world, constantly a prey to difficulties for the most part inherited from the colonial past, the imperialist Powers, rather than proceeding to make the necessary structural changes, appear in their actions to be preoccupied with finding ways of overcoming the effects of the economic crisis which afflicts them, while at the same time endeavouring to refine a new strategy to impede the process of national liberation.\n217.\tThe manifestations of this strategy are particularly visible in Africa and throughout the Arab world and openly betray the true purpose that certain countries are seeking to achieve through the dialogue that is now going on.\n218.\tIn addition, recent events have not failed to reveal that the true motive of outside intervention in Africa, and of actions directed against the Arab nation is obedience to a tenacious determination to safeguard and consolidate at all costs the last bastions of colonialism and racism and to weaken progressive positions and acquire control over those regions and their resources.\n219.\tSuch conduct in fact is aimed at jeopardizing our independence as well as wiping out the results obtained in the area of decolonization and co-operation. Even within the third world certain countries are working out theories that are in absolute contradiction with the principles and ethics of the United Nations and that, because they are the negation of coexistence between nations, can only exacerbate, crises and sidetrack us from the true course of development. Thus recently colonized countries are opposed to the process of decolonization and the peoples' right to self-determination and go so far as to return to the divisive policies practised unsuccessfully in the past by others much more powerful than themselves.\n220.\tSuch ventures naturally foster the greed of powers whose constant objective is to injure the movement of solidarity which the sacrifices which the third-world peoples have made for the cause of peace-and economic and social progress.\n221.\tThus the situation imposed upon Africa and the Arab world results from the imperialist aim which is at the least to maintain unchanged the relations of domination and exploitation. The fact is that imperialism has changed neither in its nature nor-in its methods. It persists in inventing many new manoeuvres aimed at division and diversion and does not hesitate to fabricate a situation that can give credence to the notion that our regions exist for no other purpose than: to be private preserves for external rivalries.\n222.\tIt was therefore in a context fraught with uncertainty that the United Nations special session on disarmament, the fifteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries were held. The last two gatherings in particular made it possible to evaluate the international situation engendered by the importation of policies of division and provocation into the non-aligned movement and the OAU.\n223.\tThus the determination to attenuate differences and to preserve the necessary cohesion was reaffirmed.\n224.\tThe efforts made in various parts of the African continent to put an end to disputes between brother countries or to seek out ways and means of completing decolonization attest to the beginning of an awakening. These efforts at any rate reflect the determination of the third-world countries to and themselves against foreign intervention and manipulation and at the same time to make their full contribution to the search for solutions for the problems of our era, out of a conviction that peace and detente will continue to be precarious as long as their field of application does not encompass all the regions of the world. Inasmuch as our concerns are closely linked with the problems that afflict Asia, Africa and Latin America I should like without any further delay to express our fraternal solidarity with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its legitimate struggle for the peaceful reunification of the great Korean country. Inspired by the same ideal of justice and liberty I should like to reiterate here the full support of the Algerian people for the Puerto Rican people struggling for the free exercise of their right to self-determination.\n225.\tGeneral and definitive decolonization is the sine qua non condition for a return to peace and for the promotion of relations of trust that will be conducive to development and co-operation. The exercise of a people's right to self-determination and its right to adopt the economic and social system of its choice is an indestructible achievement of mankind. The United Nations, more than any other body, must assume its responsibilities in this area and cannot lay them aside without great detriment to the integrity of peoples and the safeguarding of international peace and security.\n226.\tFor obvious reasons the situation in Africa is of great concern to us. To colonial problems are added those of racial discrimination, apartheid and the intervention of foreign Powers which are seeking to re-establish themselves in our continent and re-conquer lost positions.\n227.\tHow, then, can we fail to remain sceptical about the concern those same Powers show\u2014or so we are told-for the search for solutions that can fully satisfy the aspirations of African peoples in the southern part of their continent?\n228. Certain Western countries have in fact never tried to make their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in power in South Africa and in Rhodesia see reason nor taken any action to moderate their arrogance and aggressiveness vis-\u00e0-vis the people they oppress or to prevent their committing aggression against independent neighbouring States:\n229. This attitude of complicity that has so many times been. condemned by the United Nations has no doubt\nprolonged the survival of the illegal and racist regimes and enabled them to grow in strength in full disregard of the principles of law and international morality. For various reasons, however, and in each case inspired, we hope, by the lofty ideals of the Charter, those same countries have recently been very active. Today they seem to be working for as negotiated settlement of the problems of decolonization which have ripened to such an extent that the end of the process can no longer be in question\n230.\\\"\tIn Namibia it is no longer for us to pass any judgement on the positions taken by the five Western countries that since last July have become the United Nations settlement plan. We should like to note that throughout the lengthy course of this process that today has entered the phase of execution the Secretary-General and the United Nations Council for Namibia have always made clear the true dimensions of the Namibian problem. Therefore it is for the people of Namibia and SWAPO, its only authentic representative, to thwart any attempts to despoil them of the results of their struggle and their sacrifice. The international community, for its part, will follow closely the implementation of the modalities that are accepted by SWAPO in the settlement plan, so that the objective remains full decolonization which would safeguard the national unity and territorial integrity of Namibia.\n231.\tIn Zimbabwe we have witnessed diplomatic initiatives to promote a settlement of the problem The change in attitude cannot make us forget the indifference and the responsibility of those who for a long time went along with the rebellion and government of the white minority. There again, a plan for a negotiated settlement was proposed. We hope that it will not have as its only merit that of revealing to the international community the nature of the links that exist between the situations prevailing in Namibia and in Rhodesia.\n232.\tHere and there the United Nations continues to, be the guarantor of true decolonization, despite the manoeuvres of Ian Smith, who is trying to legitimize abroad a neo-colonial solution which the people of Zimbabwe, as well as the Patriotic Front, its sole representative, could never accept.\n233.\tSo that the process of decolonization and the restoration of national dignity to the peoples of Africa may be concluded, the situation that prevails in South Africa should not remain on the periphery of events in southern Africa. It is an aberration that the international community, which has proclaimed this year the international Anti-Apartheid Year, should not be consistent in its approach to the problem of South Africa as a whole and in the search for true political solutions that would safeguard the national rights of the South African people. The incompatibility of the Pretoria regime with the promotion of freedom and peace in Africa is attested to by its systematic identification with all oppressive regimes throughout the world. It would be futile to continue to wish to limit a condemnation of that system to a mere reference to violations of human tights, just as it would be illusory thus to elude the imperatives of national liberation and independence. The United Nations, which has relentlessly stepped tip Its efforts -to eliminate apartheid. Will no\ndoubt be able to thwart the current attempts at partitioning South Africa, whose objective is to perpetuate the existence of the racist regime and the defence of the foreign privileges and positions in Africa. For its actions to be commensurate with the general condemnation it has aroused and channelled against apartheid, the United Nations should immediately see to it, as an extension of the action it has initiated in Namibia and Rhodesia in particular, that all conditions are met that would make it possible for the oppressed people of South Africa to achieve their national aspirations and recover their dignity while maintaining their unity and territorial integrity.\n234.\tAny attempt against decolonization and the principles of the United Nations with regard to the safeguarding of peace and security, any policy of fait accompli and military occupation, any annexation of territory by force, or any action based on the negation of a people's existence, or even its extermination, inevitably engenders conflicts, insecurity and instability. Because we have departed from the path charted by the Organization for resolving the problems of Non-Self-Governing Territories, certain regions, including -Timor, Belize and the Western Sahara, have entered a dangerous phase. The' United Nations, which remains seized of these questions, has regularly indicated its concern at this state of affairs, both from the standpoint of respect for the principles of the self-determination of peoples and from that of the still unforeseeable consequences of violation of that principle. Drawing inspiration from the Charter and from its resolutions, the OAU has endeavoured to make its contribution to a solution of the problem of Western Sahara in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations, naturally. These joint efforts, however, have not made it possible to register any progress in this area, and the problem of Western Sahara continues to persist in its entirety.\n235.\tThe invasion and splitting up of the territory in conditions well known to us, aside from the fact that they constitute a strong challenge to the entire international community, have totally distorted the process of decolonization. Events have shown that the proponents of the policy of fait accompli have provoked an escalating chain reaction, as well as the determined resistance of the Saharan people, the intensification of the war, foreign interference and a deterioration in relations among a number of States in the region and the western part of the Mediterranean. This attests to the extent to which our Organization remains responsible for implementing a solution that would enable the Saharan people fully to exercise their inalienable rights which the General Assembly has guaranteed to them as it has to all other colonial peoples.\n236. On another level, it was not Algeria's fault that the climate in the Maghreb, which in the past was one of co-operation and detente, has become a subject of concern not only to the peoples of the region but to the entire international community.\n237.\tIt is because Algeria is being periodically involved and placed in a situation which all its actions were intended to prevent. The situation today is such than an awareness of the well-understood interests of all requires a sense of responsibility, and the courage that implies should lead to\nhumility and circumspection rather than obstinate persistence in an adventure as futile as it is disastrous.\n238.\tMorocco and Mauritania have, before this Assembly and without any reservations whatsoever, subscribed to the principle of self-determination for the Saharan people, and much as they feign ignorance of this now, the United Nations, the movement of non-aligned countries and the OAU know that the question of Western Sahara is part of the decolonization process and that the conflict taking place in that Territory is a war of national liberation waged exclusively by the Saharan people. Thus no one can take seriously the diversionary manoeuvres which would have Algeria endorse the consequences of a policy of conquest which, from the outset, in faithfulness to ourselves and to the principles of the Charter, we have denounced vigorously. Whatever might be the subterfuges and the manipulations of facts, nothing can hide the true nature of a fundamentally political problem which, as such, can be settled only through a political solution. The fighters of the Frente POLISARIO, it will be recalled, twice came to the gates of Nouakchott. In turn they operated at Tifariti, Chenguiti, Jdiria, El-Ayoun, Boukraa, Sniara, Ain-Bentli, Dakhla, Guelta-Zemmour, Tantan and many other places. In other words, according to the requirements of the struggle, being masters of the terrain and of the initiative, they have chosen and imposed their battlefield and, for reasons inherent in the consequences of aggression, they have also caused harassment where they could do so, that is to say, both in Mauritania and in Morocco.\n239.\tThat is an undeniable fact. But, in all justice, who would have cast a stone at Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau for waging their struggle for liberation inside what was then called the metropolitan country?\n240.\tChanges did occur in Mauritania and a unilateral cease-fire was decided upon by the Frente POLISARIO-indications, albeit still slight ones, of a movement towards the peace that all the peoples of the region whole-heartedly desire\u2014but it became clear to everyone that there would inevitably be tension and confrontation again, and in increased measure, between the Royal armed forces and the Saharan fighters. That situation is all the more deplorable because, in contrast to this, everyone seems to desire to offer-each in his own way\u2014his good offices in the search for the establishment of a just and lasting peace, within the framework of. the United Nations and the OAU. Those, in our opinion, are the elements of a policy worthy of those who know that self-criticism is a virtue, that a return to justice can only make just men greater,' that the denial of the existence of peoples is not necessarily synonymous with peace, that realism and evasion of responsibility are contradictory concepts and, above all, that no one has the right to sacrifice the joint future of the peoples of our continent to the euphoria of vain momentary glory. We make another fraternal and sincere appeal from this rostrum to Morocco to help the Saharan people to exercise their inalienable rights.\n241; -Convinced that such an approach is the only one likely to lead rapidly to peace, harmony and stability in the Saguia el Hamra y Rio region, Algeria once again expresses its will to make its modest contribution, as soon as the objective conditions are met, to the settlement of this painful matter, which daily becomes more tragic and soon will be out of control.\n242.\tIt is obvious that the situation in the Middle East is continuing to deteriorate, despite diplomatic action which some seek to picture as a decisive contribution to the quest for a just and lasting solution, while they stubbornly refuse to recognize the true nature of the problem and concentrate on the consequences of the crisis rather than on its origins. Need I recall here that the origin of the Middle East crisis is, above and beyond anything else, the denial of the right of the Palestinian people to its national existence, and that the constant aggravation of the crisis is essentially the result of a deliberate will to ignore the core of the problem which is the restoration to the Palestinian people of its national rights. That is why all the recent initiatives taken outside the framework set by the United Nations can only lead to undermining the Arab solidarity that is so necessary, to promoting attempts at a separate peace, and to encouraging the Zionist occupier in his policy of aggression, expansion and defiance of the international community.\n243.\tIt is a strange plan \u2014 to say the least\u2014to create at the outset the conditions for a false solution, to overlook the basic fact of the problem by invoking so-called immediate political requirements, and to conceal the contradictions inherent in the very nature of the undertaking by claiming that the only possibility of achieving peace is to give in to the policy Of abandonment.\n244.\tBut events will destroy all these illusions; one by one, the instruments forged in order to stifle the voice of Palestinian resistance will be broken. The Palestinian resistance will be able to free itself from the web of these manoeuvres and clearly affirm the right of the Palestinian people to its national existence.\n245.\tThe approach to which I have been referring was doomed to failure from the start because it falls squarely within the logic of the aggressor. Thus, the reply the Zionist State has given to these initiatives that everyone is trying so hard to present to us as steps towards peace has been an escalation of its policy of aggression and its efforts to \\\"liquidate the Palestinian people and to destroy another Arab State, Lebanon. Proof of this is the frenzy with which the Tel Aviv regime is trying to make its territorial gains permanent by implanting new settlements on Palestinian soil and \u2014 as recently as yesterday - by occupying a part of Lebanese territory Thus we see Israel's true nature constantly revealed, its role as a relay point in a policy of domination that obviously is part of the imperialist strategy.\n246.\tConfronted by these challenges, the Palestinian resistance, strengthened by the solidarity of all the peoples of the world, continues to embody-despite all the plots\u2014the will of the Arab nation to free itself from the grasp of imperialism. It constitutes a tangible fact, recognized by the entire international community. It is precisely because of its struggle and the irreplaceable instrument in that struggle with which it has endowed itself through the Palestine Liberation Organization, its sole-representative, that the Palestinian people has been able to impose the fact of their\nexistence and the correctness of their cause, as well as their determination to regain their rights.\n247.\tNo undertaking truly designed to encourage a just solution can be viable if it does not satisfy the national rights of the Palestinian people and if it does not provide for the recovery of all the occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem. Of course that goal requires that the international community be faithful to its own decisions; of course it requires that - unity in the Arab ranks be re-established; of course it requires that there be a constant affirmation of an' international solidarity capable of responding to the vast plot being hatched against the Palestinian people.\n248.\tAlgeria, for its part, is faithful to the decisions taken by the Arab summit meetings in Algiers and Rabat and endorsed by the international community through the United Nations, in which the Palestine Liberation Organization has been a permanent observer since 1974. From this very rostrum we have repeatedly, expressed our determination to promote, by all the means at our disposal, a solution in conformity with the Charter and the relevant resolutions of our Organization. We greeted with satisfaction the United States-Soviet communiqu\u00e9 of 1 October 1977. All this means that we intend, in the search for solutions, to abide by international legality. And, in any case, no deviations, no personal initiatives, no isolated acts, no separate peace can shake our faith in the justness of the cause of the Palestinian people and; in the inevitable victory of the Arab peoples, like that of other peoples of the world.\n249.\tStill on the subject of the Mediterranean region, where a general conflagration could break out at any time, the absence of progress in the search for a solution-to the problem of Cyprus is another source of concern.- The intercommunal talks being held under the aegis of the Secretary-General have still reached no results. But these efforts must be pursued so that a satisfactory , settlement may be reached that will guarantee the rights of each community, while preserving the political unity and territorial integrity of an independent and non-aligned Republic of Cyprus.\n250.\tFor the rest, the persistence of these hotbeds of tension is not likely to promote the extension of the policy of detente beyond the rivers of Europe -to the Mediterranean basin. Nevertheless, despite the reluctance and resistance of some,- the idea is today gaining ground that global considerations and systematic opposition must progressively yield to regional concerns and to the reapprochement of the coastal States. The idea is certainly not taking shape because of the vast obstacles interposed, but the very importance of the road to be traversed should prompt us to unite our efforts, so that understanding and co-operation may- replace, suspicions and divergent actions, Then when a climate of confidence is restored and peace and; security are strengthened by the development of common and complementary interests, each coastal country will be able to assume, in harmony, with its neighbours, its .natural role. Thus, moving from pacification to stabilization, and, from stabilization to co-operation, the  constant aspiration; of all peoples of the region to make of the Mediterranean a lake of peace  will be realized. My country  here reaffirms its willingness to make its contribution so that this cross-roads\nof civilizations may finally recover its vocation of linking all peoples.\n251.\tIt was in this spirit that we participated in the tenth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to disarmament. Of course, on the basis of past experience we had not expected concrete and effective measures that would have made possible the beginning of a genuine process of disarmament, but we had expected of the nuclear Powers a more positive reaction to the concern of our countries at the reluctance shown so far to give real guarantees regarding the security of non-nuclear-weapon States and their access to nuclear technology. The persistence of this reluctance made impossible the inclusion in the Programme of Action that was adopted last June  of measures likely to meet our legitimate requirements regarding the security of our States and the removal of the unilateral restrictions and restraints that are always a barrier to the free transfer of nuclear technology to countries that urgently need it for their development. And yet the very fact that for the first time a special session devoted solely to the problem of disarmament was held is an encouraging event in itself. The central role and primary responsibility of our Organization in this field has been reaffirmed. The deliberative and negotiating mechanisms have been renewed; they have become more democratic and there is better geographical and political representation, thus making possible the participation of all countries, and primarily all the nuclear Powers, in the drafting and implementation of the solution of one of the moat serious problems that our peoples face. This is a first step, however timid, that will promote the establishment of the necessary framework for the affirmation of a genuine political will to disarm Algeria, which is pleased to be a member of the new Committee on Disarmament, is determined to spare no effort to make a modest but effective contribution to the attainment of what constitutes the ultimate goal of our Organization: to ensure international peace-and security through general and complete disarmament.\n252.\tInternational peace and security also depend on the solutions that are found for the problem of the profound crisis that affects the world economy. There seems to be a great deal of emotion everywhere because of this crisis in the world economy, as though it was of alien origin and imposed by occult forces that could be conjured away by incantations, the privileged site of which would be the General Assembly. But such powerlessness is by no means the powerlessness of the international community as a whole. It is the result of what can best be termed a lack of foresight on the part of some of its members. This is in singular contrast to the foresight shown in the resolutions adopted at the special sessions devoted to the new international economic order which, starting with a diagnosis that still remains valid, advocated remedies that have yet to be applied.\n253.\tFor their part, the developing countries bear no responsibility for that crisis. As proof I need only mention the failure of theses that were represented to us as being strictly and scientifically accurate and according to which the prices of the exports of third-world countries caused the present price fluctuations because, it was alleged, they were either too high or too low. And yet these same\ncountries had had to bear an unjustifiable part of the burden of the adaptations imposed by the crisis in the world economy. At some sacrifice, because of their imports from the rich countries of inflation and unemployment as well as of products, they have played a recognized anti-cyclical role, which has undoubtedly lessened the impact of the recession in those countries.\n254.\tOne cannot, however, find a permanent solution to a crisis that is exacerbated by excessive stimulation of consumption in the developed countries and by the unprecedented growth of international liquidity, on the initiative of the latter and for their benefit alone. Inflation, which used to be a national phenomenon, has become since the end of the last decade a permanent feature of the world economy. The mechanisms which transmit this inflation from the industrialized countries to the third world have proved more effective than the pseudo-mechanisms for the transmission of prosperity so dear to those who believe in the automatic fall-out of growth.\n255.\tEquity as well as effectiveness require that we take into account in the equation of the global balance, as an autonomous factor, the rights of the third world because of its contribution to world economic activity.\n256.\tUp to now the industrial Powers have deliberately attempted to manipulate the cycle of economic activity. This is based on the selfishness of the rich and, if experience is to be believed, is inevitably doomed to failure because everyone knows that the crisis is really the result of structural imbalances in the world economy, of which the third world, we must repeat, is the principal victim.\n257.\tSupport for the new international economic order implies, of course, a recognition of the structural character of these imbalances, but this has rarely gone beyond the stage of rhetoric. While appetites for our natural resources grow and strategies are devised to recover our raw materials, and while our just claims to an equitable share in the resources of the world economy are challenged, it is difficult to believe that the widespread acceptance of the term \\\"new order\\\" has effectively dispelled,, misunderstandings and ulterior motives. Otherwise, how can one explain the continued deterioration of an economic environment that is already hostile to developing countries?\n258.\tThus the wave for protectionism has reduced almost to nothing the prospects for exports from the third world. Similarly, the constant decline in official resource transfers from the developed to the developing countries, the aggravation of the latter's food deficit, the limitations imposed on their access to technology and the delays in negotiations on the Integrated Programme for Commodities and- in the conclusion of commodity agreements have constituted obstacles to the restructuring of international economic relations.\n259.\tNo new structure can be viable if it is distorted by unilateral manipulation of the principal reserve currency and by failure to adapt the international monetary system that it supports, in particular in regard to the fundamental interests/Of the developing countries.\n260.\tThe obstacles to setting up such structures show the imperative need to include in the same dialectic the struggle of the third-world countries, in which they demonstrate their solidarity within the framework of strengthening their collective self-reliance, which does not mean autarchy and the need for a world-wide dialogue to establish healthy international economic relations.\n261.\tTrue, very few have failed to acquiesce in the ritual of reaffirming the inevitable nature of interdependence, the recognition of which should be the point of departure of a true dialogue. But has it not too often been invoked simply to justify the application of the same procedures as made it possible to ensure post-war progress in the industrialized countries, whose present crisis shows the limits to growth? Has there not been an attempt, in the name of a certain interdependence and so-called shared responsibility, to bring the developing countries that challenge the established order back into line? Further, do not some seek under the cover of interdependence to thwart the objectives of the third world by setting as a global priority for all the developing countries solutions that would serve only to legitimize and systematize the external economic, financial and even political pressures to which they are subjected?\n262.\tIn such circumstances, the concept of interdependence would only serve to perpetuate relations of domination. We are bound to recognize that in truth it is futile to try to rediscover this interdependence while our task obviously consists, rather, in ascertaining its true implications.\n263.\tThe present chaos in negotiations to establish a new framework for international economic relations raises the problem of the very purpose of the dialogue. The reverses suffered in the dialogue in past years prompt scepticism. Instead of serving as a catalyst for setting up the new international economic order, the dialogue seems, paradoxically, to have served as a pretext for certain developed countries to erode the gains that constituted the premises of the new order. Because those premises are part of this approach by the developed countries, their professions of faith in favour of a dialogue can only mask the absence of political will to take real action. Thus we witness attempts to question the right to collective self-expression of General Assembly bodies while elsewhere the developed countries proclaim the imperative need for democratization in the international decision-making process.\n264.\tHaving first challenged the value of any majority decision and then of decisions taken by consensus, which are alleged to be less \\\"authentic\\\" than others, the developed countries do not hesitate over the idea of eliminating the very principle of adopting decisions in global economic bodies by alleging the risk of duplicating the positions taken up by specialized organs. The effect of this attitude, if not its objective, is to remove any meaning from the dialogue by limiting it to a simple exchange of views, with no commitment and no future, while the real decisions continue to be taken in forums where the industrialized countries predominate.\n265.\tThese are the thoughts that come to mind, given the deadlock in the dialogue both outside the United Nations and within it in the Committee of the Whole of our\nAssembly, that is, the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174. The Committee's work was deliberately interrupted even at its very start by an opposition that had its origin in the patent absence of real political will to bring about change.\n266.\tWhat is at stake, and what is ultimately being challenged, is the General Assembly's central role in any global negotiation about the establishment of the new order. In the light of these considerations, should we not question the use that might be made of the dialogue in future negotiations? In particular, at a time when our Assembly is about to begin drafting a new international strategy for development, it is to be feared that in this dialogue the developed countries might try to replace the framework already drawn up in the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [Resolution 3201 (S-VI)] by a highly questionable substitute strategy.\n267.\tSuch a strategy, in the name of I know not what \\\"pragmatism\\\", would renounce a global approach to international economic problems in favour of piecemeal and isolated measures. Further, in the guise of \\\"good Samaritans\\\", its advocates would attempt to blame underdevelopment on the internal system of distribution while ignoring its external causes, which are far more constraining.\n268.\tThe better to overcome the resistance that this action might arouse, the resources of economic science would be mobilized to cause the division of the developing countries into a growing number of autonomous categories, which the developed countries would hope would even oppose one another. Thus they would pretend to ignore the fact that the unity of the third world is based oh the common political will of its members to put an end to the relations of domination and exploitation from which all suffer and not on the affirmation of any similarity in their respective levels of development. Such action would support a hazardous thesis designed to reduce the dialogue to a diversionary operation that would, at best, attenuate the erosion of positions already gained and polarize attention towards marginal problems.\n269.\tHow much longer will the peoples of the world agree to be lulled by this illusion of a dialogue, which makes light of problems that nevertheless condition their future? Is there still time for the international community to make a fresh start so that the 1980 special session of the Assembly will constitute a decisive phase on the way towards restructuring international economic relations, rather than a prelude to a new era of crisis and confrontation?\n270.\tIn a world haunted by the limits to growth, whether they are in the nature of things or in the mind of men, this restructuring would make it possible to promote genuine international co-operation, which certainly constitutes a challenge but also contains generous promises. Indeed, the North-South dimension opens to the world economy this \\\"new frontier\\\", capable of ensuring the real prosperity of all, a prosperity that consists in greater well-being as much as, if not more than, in simply having more.\n271.\tIn the troubled world in which we live, and given the critical state of international relations, it is not superfluous\nto emphasize once again the role incumbent upon the United Nations. It is obvious that the faction at the root of the situation am. the manifestation of a refusal to accept the changes required by the evolution of the world, thus delaying the emergence of a new system of international relations. Yet the United Nations is the appropriate instrument whereby we may overcome this fundamental contradiction of our times. For the solution of the problems that mankind Dices, and therefore the elimination of-present tensions and uncertainties in international life, urgent decisions and bold measures must be taken, based on respect for the principles that give our Organization its raison d'etre.\n272. Furthermore, the future of the Organization is linked to its ability to adapt to the realities and requirements of our era, taking into account, in particular, the ever-growing role that the third-world countries should play in seeking peace and security and in promoting just and equitable\ninternational co-operation. This ability to evolve will depend above all on the political will of States, regardless of their economic strength or military power, to transcend narrow selfishness, strategic concerns and divisive and interventionist policies, so that they may take action with respect for the Charter principles and ideals and unite their efforts for the greater good of mankind. That is the fundamental condition for strengthening peace and security throughout the world. It is our joint responsibility.\n"

We wish the people of the young State from the Pacific every success in the creation of its statehood and in its economic and social advancement.\n10. The more than 30-year-old history of the United Nations has abounded in instances both of successful development of international co-operation and of its obstruction. For Poland, throughout that entire period the maintenance and strengthening of peace have been and continue to be the basic and most important cause.\n108- From the very first days of this Organization's existence Poland has actively joined in the work of the United Nations, seeing it an important instrument for establishing international peace and security.\n109. Let me recall that, having put his signature to the Charter of the United Nations on 15 October 1945, the representative of my country declared that the Polish Government:\n.. set a very high value on the system of collective security founded by the Charter of the United Nations,... willing to co-operate to all possible extent with the other Members of this Organization in the task of maintaining peace and in securing the prosperity and welfare of nations...\\\".\n110.\tWe have remained faithful to this commitment in all our actions by developing our external relations and making our contribution to the search for solutions which will ensure peace and strengthen security, and to the development of equitable and international co-operation in all spheres.\n111.\tWe have been fully involved in the implementation of General Assembly resolutions, in particular those of such historic importance as the Declaration on the Deepening and Consolidation of International Detente [resolution 32/155] and the resolutions on arms reduction, disarmament, economic co-operation and the establishment of a New International Economic Order. We are thus making a contribution to the achievement of the purposes of the United Nations and to developing and translating the principles of its Charter into a universally prevailing reality.\n112.\tWe strive consistently to ensure that the lofty principles of the Charter find their expression and concrete application in the intensification and expansion of international co-operation, the imperative of our time.\n113.\tIn view of the need to consolidate the achievements of the policy of detente and to counteract the disquieting negative tendencies, our Organization and all its Member States must intensify efforts to eliminate international tensions. Such action has to be accompanied by the awareness that peace is the supreme desire of nations. We should therefore demonstrate enough political will and maturity to strengthen peace on a global scale, to put an end once and for all to the arms race and to adopt concrete disarmament measures; for the central issue of our time is military detente, which must keep pace with the advances made in the field of political detente and thus contribute to its deepening.\n114.\tThe important decisions of the tenth special session of the General Assembly, which was devoted to disarmament last June have mapped out a tangible programme of action designed to curb the arms race and achieve disarmament.\n115.\tWe welcome, in particular, the momentous and comprehensive disarmament proposals submitted by the USSR at the special session.  We also lend our full support to the new important Soviet proposal concerning the conclusion of an international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States [A]33/241], as recently put forward by the Foreign Minister of the USSR, Andrei Gromyko[8th meeting],\n116.\tIt is with concern that we note the attempts of certain States to revert to the conduct of international politics from a position of strength by unleashing a new technological arms race and increasing the role of the military factor in politics. Indeed, similar attempts had already been made in the past, and it is common knowledge that they benefited no one. They only bred tension, and at times pushed the world to the brink of a nuclear catastrophe.\n117.\tIt has also been acknowledged that the arms race continues to be a heavy burden on States and peoples, that it absorbs resources that might otherwise be utilized for their social and economic growth and does not allow adequate assistance to be rendered to the many countries so much in need of it.\n118.\tThe Soviet-United States disarmament negotiations conducted in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and at other important levels are of major consequence for the entire process of international detente and of the arms race. Poland attaches great signify to these negotiations and gives them its full support\n119.\tPoland is vitally interested in concluding agreements that would strengthen security in Europe. This is why, in June of this year at the Vienna disarmament negotiations, we, together with our socialist allies, submitted new proposals on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in central Europe. To a considerable extent these proposals take account of the position of the Western States, and, we submit, they could form the groundwork on which to negotiate an agreement on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments based upon the fundamental principle that the security of each party should not be diminished.\n120.\tWe continue to stress emphatically the need for the strengthening of the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, both by achieving the universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and by stricter IAEA safeguards, while constantly developing the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\n121.\tEfforts should be intensified within the existing organs of disarmament negotiations to draft new agreements, in particular on nuclear disarmament, new types sad systems of weapons of mass destruction and on chemical weapons.\n122.\tPoland has contributed actively to the work of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva from the earliest days of its existence. We also pledge to continue this active involvement in the enlarged Committee on Disarmament.\n123.\tWe are looking forward to the conclusion of the negotiations among the three nuclear-weapon States with a view to the drafting of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. We note with satisfaction some progress in the negotiations on working out an international convention on the elimination of all chemical weapons.\n124.\tMy country has always used the forum of the United Nations to submit all its important, international proposals, even those of a regional character. That was the case on 2 October 1957 when the then Minister for Foreign Affairs,\nMr. Adam Rapacki, proposed the creation of an atomic- weapon-free zone in central Europe,  as well as on 14 December 1964 when we put forward the idea of convening an all-European conference on security.  We intend to follow the same line of action in the future. I am saying this to stress the importance Poland has always attached to the United Nations and its General Assembly.\n125.\tThis year marks the sixtieth anniversary of Poland's independence, recovered after nearly 150 years of partition and foreign occupation. The anniversary also brings to mind some reflections, the most important of which, to my mind, is the observation that, in contrast to the 20-year period between the two wars, conditions now exist for ensuring the peaceful development of Europe, including Poland. If only for this reason, and also mindful of the fact that the two world wars originated on that continent, we focus our efforts to strengthen international peace and security first and foremost on our own region, Europe.\n126.\tThe process of detente, which in recent years has been developing and is being consolidated on that continent, is taking the shape of concrete and advanced co-operation between States with different socio-economic systems.\n127.\tThe inviolability of the political and territorial reality constitutes the foundation of security and peace in Europe. Any questioning of the existing and generally recognized political and territorial realities on our continent runs counter to the vital interests of peace.\n128.\tIt remains important for the historic Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe-that Magna Carta of peace in Europe-to be translated into action, for it is also the charter upon which to shape the future of Europe and an instrument for overcoming difficulties in the continent. Hence we favour a full and comprehensive implementation of all the provisions of that document by its signatories. We hope that the agreed multilateral meetings, and especially the future meeting in Madrid, will promote the positive trends of detente and all-European co-operation.\n129.\tPoland is determined to continue to make its contribution to the strengthening of these positive changes in Europe. The multilateral political meetings notwithstanding, there are still many hitherto unutilised opportunities in the sphere of co-operation in economics, technology, science, culture, protection of the environment and so on. For our part, we are prepared to expand co-operation with all States, given strict adherence to the principles and provisions of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. In practical terms, such co-operation is also evidenced by Poland's political dialogue and bilateral relations, which are developing favourably with many Western States. We shall continue to act in this spirit so as to serve to an ever increasing extent the general interests of peace, security and co-operation for the benefit of all.\n130.\tThe implementation of the resolutions of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is having a positive impact, not only on Europe, but also on the entire international situation. Recognizing as we do the principle of the indivisibility of peace, we are convinced that the greatest contribution Europe can make to improving the state of security in the world is to transform itself into a region of lasting detente and advanced peaceful co-operation.\n131.\tIn favouring the policy of detente and peaceful coexistence, limiting the arms race, achieving disarmament Mil developing equitable international co-operation,\n\u201e Poland, like its allies, is proceeding on the assumption that only a policy such as this is in accordance with the interests of peace and thereby with the interests of all peoples, including also those of the developing countries and those fighting for their independence and national and social liberation.\n132.\tRegrettably, there are States which actually oppose the policy of detente. There are States and increasingly active political circles within them, which although verbally declaring support for the policy of detente, in fact take action m the opposite direction, balancing on the brisk of \\\"cold war\\\".\n133.\tEqually dangerous are political actions that consist of attempts to form alliances directed against other States Members of the United Nations, and in openly preaching the inevitability of a new world war, creating tensions and destabilizing situations in certain areas of the world. Any attempts at breeding new tensions, whether on a regional or global scale, are harmful to all nations.\n134.\tActions of this kind adversely affect conditions for the peaceful growth of the world, notably along the East-West axis, they hamper efforts towards the elimination of conflicts and points of tension, hinder progress in disarmament, and are also an impediment to international economic co-operation and to the establishment of the new economic order.\n135.\tWe are m full solidarity with States that oppose leniencies towards, hegemonistic domination and pressure m South-East Asia where, following a protracted period of wars, peace has finally been restored. The international community should support the efforts of the people of Vietnam and of other nations in the region aimed at their\nfrom the ruins of war and at their peaceful development. \n134. We are likewise concerned over the existing hotbeds of conflict and tension threatening international security. This primarily applies to the situation in the Middle East as well as to that in southern Africa.\n135. The Middle East conflict continues to be a perennial threat to peace and security, not only regionally. We once again reaffirm that the road to peace in the Middle East leads through a comprehensive implementation of the provisions of the well-known resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, and not through deals of a separatist nature. Any solution should comprise the return of all Arab territories occupied by Israel, the exercise of the right for independent statehood of the Arab people of Palestine, and the guaranteeing of the security of all States of the region. Only the resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all parties concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, the only representative of the Arab people of Palestine, can bring about a settlement of the conflict there.\n138.\tThe national liberation struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia enjoys both the support and the sympathy of Poland, A plan has been prepared this year to solve, through the United Nations, the acute problem of Namibia for which our Organization bears direct responsibility, a responsibility that has devolved upon it as a legacy of the League of Nations. The current plan for the independence of Namibia still contains, we submit, too many unclear elements allowing for divergent interpretations. In keeping with its anti-colonial stand, Poland declares itself in favour of the broadest protection of the rights and interests of the people of Namibia and in support of the full implementation of its right to self-determination, in conformity with the resolution adopted at the ninth special session of the General Assembly.\n139.\tRacism and racial discrimination, still afflicting the world, are a threat to peace and hamper peaceful cooperation among States. We therefore place considerable emphasis on the results of the World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, recently concluded in Geneva.\n140.\tWe are in support of bringing the process of decolonization to its completion and at the same time ensuring to the liberated States conditions for full and genuine participation in international life, free from neo- colonial restrictions and exploitation. Indeed, their full participation in international exchanges, on the basis of the just principles of the new economic order, is the paramount means for the authentic strengthening of their statehood and the acceleration of their development.\n141.\tThe continuance of discriminatory practices in international trade exchanges and resort to protectionism are phenomena that adversely affect the climate of international relations and the general level of co-operation. On our part, we believe that, rather than through protectionism a considerable and lasting improvement of the world economic situation and in particular that of the developing countries, can be effected through comprehensive and mutually advantageous economic co-operation based on partnership in development and on the restructuring of international economic relations according to just principles.\n142.\tIt is generally acknowledged that international security, co-operation and mutual confidence are closely related with one another. Measures contributing to the growth of reciprocal trust and serving better understanding between nations occupy an important place in the process of ensuring peace and creating more favourable conditions for international co-operation.\n143.\tAmong these measures, we attribute a special role of the extent of the concern that States demonstrate for the preparation of their societies for life in peace, friendship and respect for other nations.\n144.\tPreparation for life in peace is the kind of activity which could be defined as the building of an infrastructure of peace in the consciousness of nations. The creation of a peaceful world can neither be fully effective nor durable unless there is a most profound awareness in the minds of men that world peace is of supreme value and thereby an objective of the highest priority. The realization that, in the era of nuclear weapons, peace is the only alternative to annihilation and thus the indispensable premise on which to resolve our pressing international problems should be profoundly and lastingly impressed upon the minds of all.\n145.\tDirect reference to the subject was made by the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers Party, Edward Gierek, who, in addressing the Assembly from this very rostrum on 10 October 1974, stressed in particular the right of all nations to life in peace.\n146.\tWe are confident that conditions are now ripe for the General Assembly at its present session to discuss the subject of the preparation of societies for life in peace, a question of such great importance for the building of mutual confidence.\n\n147.\tWith this in mind, the Polish delegation will be submitting a draft declaration on the subject.  This document will provide a comprehensive approach to, and an elaboration of, the accomplishments of the United Nations up to now in cultivating among societies the lofty ideals of peace and fostering relations based on mutual respect and understanding. We shall propose to invite all States to guide themselves in their activities by the recognition of the supreme importance and necessity of establishing, maintaining and strengthening a just and lasting peace, with due regard for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.\n148.\tIn the declaration we shall propose, in particular, to urge all States to act with perseverance and consistency to ensure that educational curricula and procedures, instruction and upbringing in the family, at school and in public life, as well as the relevant activities of the mass media, are compatible with the task of the preparation for life in peace of all societies, including in particular the younger generations. \\\"Ever will the republics be a mirror of the education of their young citizens\\\", said one of the most enlightened of Polish thinkers; Stanislaw Staszic.\n149.\tWe shall also call for the elimination from school curricula and mass media material advocating racial hatred, chauvinism, intolerance, injustice and the glorification of violence and war. We regard it as particularly important that international relations should not be disrupted by propaganda campaigns launched in one country against the other.\n150.\tIn proposing to bring the question of the preparation for life in peace before the General Assembly for consideration and include it in the work of the United Nations,\nwe are guided by the desire to complement measures already taken by Member States on the political, disarmament, economic and social levels. Our initiative arises out of Poland's concern over the difficulties being encountered along the road towards consolidating co-operation and detente and achieving new disarmament agreements. We conceive of our draft declaration on the preparation of societies for life in peace as an essential means of building confidence between nations and thereby strengthening international security. We hope that our proposal will be received with understanding and will win the support of all States represented in this hall.\n151.\tI am also glad to note that an earlier Polish initiative concerning a convention on the rights of the child12 has received the support of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council. We are confident that the adoption by the General Assembly of a convention on the rights of the child will be one of the important events marking the observances of the International Year of the Child in 1979.\n152.\tBefore us lie 12 weeks of work of the current session of the General Assembly at which it will consider 129 items on its agenda. I sincerely hope that this session will succeed in achieving marked progress in resolving many difficult international problems. The Polish delegation will actively participate in all efforts with that end in view. Acting in conformity with the spirit and the letter of the Charter of the United Nations, we shall make a constructive contribution to the proceedings of the session, thus facilitating the attainment of the noble purposes of our Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff123. It gives me great pleasure,\nMr. President, to join the representatives who have preceded\nme in congratulating you on your election as\nPresident of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly\n. Your long experience in .international affairs and\nthe prestige that you enjoy in the international community\n. will undoubtedly assist you in successfully 'conducting the\nwork of this Assembly. We are greatly pleased by your\nelection.\n124. I should like to pay a tribute to my friend, Mr. Lazar\nMojsov, our outgoing President, Representatives here will\nremember that during the past year he played a major role\nand contributed most effectively to the successful conduct\nof the thirty-second session of the General Assembly and\nthe special sessions held this year.\n125. I should like also to associate myself with previous\nspeakers who have expressed high regard for and appreciation\nof the contribution of our Secretary-General,\nMr. Kurt Waldheim, whose continued determination to\nmake the United Nations an effective instrument for the\ncreation of lasting peace and security in the world has\nearned him the co-operation and support of all Member\nStates.\n126. Only recently we were grieved to learn of the passing\naway of three eminent world statesmen whose contributions\nto international peace and. harmony are so well\nknown to all of us. The late Pontiff, Pope Paul VI,\ndedicated his ministry and his efforts to bringing peace to\n-all mankind. While expressing our deep regret at his passing,\nI am confident that his words and his mission will long be\nremembered. Last week we were shocked to learn or the\nsudden passing away of Pope John Paul I, whose brief but\npromising period of office was marked by dedication to\nworld peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n127. The late President of Kenya, Mr. Jomo Kenyatta, was a symbol of a nationalist statesman who dedicated his life to securing freedom for his people at a crucial stage in Africa's struggle against colonialism. He emerged as a great\nworld leader dedicated to the struggle for international peace and universal freedom.\n128.\tIt is a great pleasure for me on behalf of Sri Lanka to welcome Solomon Islands as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of this Organization. The admission of Solomon Islands reflects the constant widening of the membership of the United Nations towards ultimate universality.\n129.\tIt is my personal privilege to address this Assembly as the first Foreign Minister of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. I have pleasure in conveying to this Assembly the good wishes and greetings of my President, His Excellency J. R. Jayewardene.\n130.\tIn our Constitution, adopted on 7 September of this year, we have pledged to build a fair, just, democratic and socialist society. The Constitution enshrines the rule of law, guarantees the enforcement of the fundamental rights of the citizen, and outlaws discrimination, be it on grounds of caste, colour or creed. The new Constitution is a national declaration of commitment and dedication not only to the domestic ideal of a fair and just society but also to the ideals of the United Nations, its Charter and the obligations of its Members.\n131.\tThe agenda that will occupy the General Assembly at this session includes the issues that are of major concern to the international family. For several years mankind had, after bitter experience, worked out arrangements in various stages for the stabilization of peace. Those efforts gave rise to an improvement in the environment of international relations. However, in recent months we have been unwilling witnesses to a deterioration in this climate. The period of detente witnessed some relaxation of tensions, but now detente seems to be threatened. The question is therefore legitimately asked, Are we returning to another cold-war era? We hesitate to answer in the affirmative. It is our hope that this interruption in the relaxation of tensions we are witnessing is only a temporary one. Detente, in our view, means the acceptance of peaceful coexistence, not just in limited areas of the world for limited periods by a limited, number of countries, but throughout the whole universe in which we live. We believe that detente should not be overthrown; and we believe that it cannot survive by being limited to particular areas or particular groupings.\n132.\tLooking back at the momentous events of the past year I see four international conferences as being of vital political importance to those of us who belong to the third world. There was the tenth special session, devoted to disarmament, in May of this year; the fifteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU], in Khartoum in July, the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries, in Belgrade, also in July; and, finally, the World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, in Geneva in August.\n133.\tTo my mind, those four Conferences symbolize the genuine efforts of the third-world countries to restructure the world political order,, No doubt it will take more conferences before we see the reality of a new international society. But we have come a long way from the time when the voice of the third world was unheard, unnoticed and unheeded.\n134.\tYear after year we have in this Assembly discussed the threat to peace that arises from the arms race and the qualitative and quantitative escalation of armaments. We met in this Assembly last May in the tenth special session to discuss the question of disarmament, the problem of greatest concern for the future of all mankind. The reactions to the results of that special session have been many and varied. Sri Lanka, together with the other non-aligned countries, had agitated for the special session, and Sri Lanka had the privilege of introducing, on behalf of the non-aligned countries, the United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for the special session [resolution 32/88J. The results of the special session have only partially satisfied us. However, we feel it has opened the way to a serious examination of the problem and to the adoption of practical measures that could help in realizing the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control.\n135.\tThe special session has also made possible the reform of the machinery for accelerating the process of disarmament. We welcome the revival of the United Nations Disarmament Commission and the reconstitution of the Committee on Disarmament, of which Sri Lanka is one of the new members. In both bodies we shall contribute whatever is within our capacity to help the advancement of the cause of disarmament.\n136.\tSri Lanka's concern over the problem of the arms race and the threat it poses to mankind has been expressed by the President of Sri Lanka, His Excellency J.R. Jayewardene. In a special appeal to all Heads of State or Government, our President sought their support for the creation of a world disarmament authority within the United Nations system.18 We hope that that proposal and the many others that were laid before the special session will receive the serious consideration of those who have been entrusted with the task of studying this problem. We feel that the conscience of mankind has now been stirred to a point where it is realized that practical and urgent steps must be taken to curb the threat that armaments pose to mankind.\n137.\tTwo months ago the largest single regional group of both the United Nations and the non-aligned movement met in Khartoum. We hail the success of the OAU Assembly and applaud its conclusions [see A/331235 and Corr.1] as a sharp rejection of the beginning of a new scramble for Africa. The African position on the questions of colonialism, apartheid and racism emerged united and unshakable. The leadership given by that meeting to the peoples of Africa constitutes a firm determination to keep foreign intervention outside the African continent. We admire the resolution of African problems by the Africans themselves, as symbolized in the proposals made for the solution of the Western Sahara question and for the normalization of relations between Angola and Zaire. We support the OAU position on Zimbabwe and Namibia, and we look forward to the day when the Patriotic Front in Zimbabwe and SWAPO in Namibia will, as the true representatives of their people, enjoy their right to govern their countries. We welcome, in this connexion, the admission of SWAPO to full membership in the non-aligned movement.\n138.\tLater in July this year 87 non-aligned nations, all of which are Members of the United Nations, met in Belgrade at the Foreign Minister level. It was a Conference that was preceded by a considerable amount of adverse publicity. That publicity highlighted bilateral differences among the non-aligned members in an attempt to create the impression of disunity and disarray. As the Chairman of the non-aligned movement, Sri Lanka viewed those assessments with great concern. We recognized that those attempts to challenge the unity and progress of the movement stemmed from a fundamental recognition that the movement has grown into a formidable factor on the international scene.\n139.\tWhat the 87 nations achieved in Belgrade represented a major reaffirmation of the fundamental principles of non-alignment and the basic unity of the non-aligned countries in their commitment to those principles. The non-aligned movement was not diverted by bilateral disputes that had unfortunately arisen among them. The Belgrade Declaration [A/33/306, annex I] stands, therefore, as a remarkable and courageous document. We stand united for a new system of international relations based on true independence and non-interference in internal affairs and for equality and justice in relationships among countries.\n140.\tSri Lanka is proud that at this crucial juncture of the history of non-alignment the responsibility was placed on it to be Chairman of the movement. We are dedicated to the course of strict non-alignment. I referred earlier to the non-aligned movement's initiative on holding a special session on disarmament. This is one of the many achievements that the non-aligned group of nations has recorded in its history. We look forward to greater achievements. Our aims are in complete harmony with the aims of the United Nations, and indeed the efforts of the non-aligned strengthen the role of the United Nations. We seek to democratize the decision-making process in international affairs. The non-aligned movement stands resolutely for a system of complete equality and justice in all spheres. We believe that the era of an international system based on unequal exchange is over. The fact that so many nations of the world belong to the non-aligned movement and the desire on the part of newly liberated countries to join the movement are ample testimony to the validity of the principles of the movement. It is also significant that no member of the non-aligned movement has expressed a desire to leave the movement.\n141.\tThe non-aligned movement has never pretended to be a solid monolith. Indeed, we have specifically rejected the idea of a bloc. Two thirds of the world's countries and peoples belong to the non-aligned movement, and we go forward to the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, to be held in Havana in 1979, confident of the future. These principles and objectives constitute the framework for a new world political and economic order which the non-aligned seek to usher in. They are the principles of self-determination, independence and the equality of nation States, freedom from all forms of domination and pressure, international peace and justice, and mutually beneficial co-operation. These principles will ensure the creation of conditions for all nations to live in dignity and prosperity.\n142.\tThese principles are not merely of academic value, for their application, be it to the situation in Africa, that in the Middle East or that in the Indian Ocean, is clearly evident in the Belgrade Declaration. They are non-aligned positions which the Government of Sri Lanka endorses.\n143.\tWith regard to the Middle East, we are disappointed that all our efforts so far have failed to ensure the return of all occupied territory and the restitution of the inalienable national rights on the Palestinian people.\n144.\tWe are aware of the developments that have taken place with regard to the Middle East question since the Belgrade Conference. Those developments have now become the subject of serious study by Member States and by members of the non-aligned movement. However, we wish to reiterate our position, which has been made clear in this forum and elsewhere. It is our view that the solution to the Middle East question should be in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the decisions of the non-aligned movement.\n145.\tWith regard to the Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)], Sri Lanka is glad to note that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean is recommending to the General Assembly that a meeting of the littoral and hinterland States be held in New York, from 2 to 13 July next year [see resolution 32/86], We believe that the next step should be the early convening of a conference.\n146.\tThe attention of the world is focused now on the great continent of Africa. The final phase of the struggle of the African people against colonialism and minority racist domination has gathered momentum. We look forward to the total elimination of colonialism and racism from Namibia and Zimbabwe. We earnestly hope for an end to the inhuman practice of apartheid and await the day when majority African rule is a reality in South Africa. The true course of history cannot be diverted. The just cause of the African people must triumph. It is surprising that we still have among us those of whom it may be said that they have eyes but see not and ears but \\\"hear not.\n147.\tThe tragic irony is that these minority racist regimes refuse to see their inevitable end. They seek instead to perpetuate themselves. By doing so, what do they hope to gain? How long can they cling on? Their stay is temporary. We salute the courageous nationalist forces in those countries for their heroic struggle; they are not far from their goals.\n148.\tI Would be failing in my duty if I did not refer to the situation in Cyprus. We call for the effective implementation of United Nations resolutions which call for respect for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus and non-interference in its internal affairs.\n149.\tWe are greatly disturbed by the recent developments in Lebanon, which is a member of the non-aligned movement. Therefore I wish to make an appeal on humanitarian grounds: I appeal for an immediate cease-fire and urge that no party involved should attack civilian targets, but should allow the supply of food to the sick and the wounded and to the civilian population.\n150.\tA special word on human rights, which figure so prominently in the Belgrade Declaration, is relevant. Sri Lanka stands resolutely on the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our participation in the World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, held in Geneva in August this year, was based on the premise that human rights, like peace, are indivisible. We support an integral and comprehensive approach to the question of human rights, which must be viewed in the national, social and economic context.\n151.\tThe insignificant progress in the negotiations for the New International Economic Order has been very clearly brought out in the Belgrade Declaration adopted by the non-aligned Foreign Ministers. The one body that sought to negotiate a package deal encompassing the principal issues at stake-namely, the Conference on International Economic Co-operation\u2014ended in miserable failure.\n152.\tMeanwhile, in the absence of purposeful action on the kinds of interrelated issues discussed at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation, the world economy has continued to stagnate. Unemployment in the member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development is in excess of 17 million. The defensive reflex action of each developed country to raise prevailing levels of protection can only deprive developing countries of access to markets. The collective effect of such action can only result in the worsening of stagnation. If, in addition, international credit becomes curtailed, then the world as a whole is bound to face unprecedented levels of unemployment.\n153.\tYet it is not difficult to see areas of mutual interest common to developing and developed countries alike. It has been accepted, for example, for quite some time now that, in the absence of mechanisms for recycling the balance-of-payments surpluses warranted by the world's economic potential, actual growth must inevitably be well below capacity. In a sense, the relative degree of ease with which the international banking system has so far coped with the recycling problem of recent years has distracted attention from more durable attempts to translate short-term liquidity into long-term investment.\n154.\tIt was with a view to exploring ways and means of enhancing, diversifying and making more stable the long-term flows of investment funds that, in my address to this Assembly last year, I suggested possibilities for action in two areas: first, better facilities for exploration for natural resources, including petroleum; secondly, the diversification of investment channels that will become possible through a revival of the idea of multilateral investment insurance or reinsurance mechanisms and other forms of guarantee facilities. Their total impact would be expected better to utilize global excess capacities. As it happens, not long after the relevant resolution was passed in the United Nations General Assembly [resolution 32/176], there was presented to the Intergovernmental Group of 24 on International Monetary Affairs at its meeting on 28 April this year in Mexico a proposal for a long-term recycling facility to\n19 See Official Records of the General Assembly, Thirty-second Session, Plenary Meetings, 12th meeting, paras. 1-36.\nfinance purchases of capital goods by developing countries. That proposal was also placed on the agenda of the relevant United Nations expert group, as well as on that of the Development Committee of IMF and IBRD. Unfortunately, the United Nations expert group was unable to devote sufficient attention to the proposal.\n155.\tModifications of this proposal are possible and desirable with respect to both the amounts and the terms of the finance to be raised. It is, moreover, an open question how far the desired expansionary impact of the proposal on the world economy can be adequately achieved if it is tied too rigidly to project finance. The decision of the IMF Interim Committee of the Board of Governors on the International Monetary System last week to allocate 4 billion special drawing rights in each of the next three years\u2014that is from 1979 to 1981\u2014is welcome in the present context.\n156.\tThis same broad objective\u2014namely, the development of the relevant degree of mutuality of interest within the international community\u2014was the intent of my remarks last year on the question of natural resources exploration. The report of the expert group20 which resulted points out, for example, that on certain assumptions the financing requirements for the exploration of petroleum between now and 1990 could be in the range of $US 12 to 25 billion in the oil-importing developing countries alone [see A/.33/256, para. 10].\n157.\tA wide range of mutual interests could be served by a suitably devised multilateral financing mechanism-estimated by the expert group to require' at least $US 500 million [ibid., annex, para. 83] \u2014that would go into areas of further exploration and wildcat drilling which have been a traditional preserve of multinational corporations. It would also continue to provide an expanding export market for oil-exporting developing countries. The lessening of exploration risks resulting from such a multilateral fund could, in turn, permit the negotiation of better terms between countries and investors in the development phase. Directly within the ambit of the activities of UNDP are the group's suggestions for the improvement of facilities and coverage of the United Nations Revolving Fund for Natural Resources and I would urge the General Assembly's endorsement of both sets of proposals.\n158.\tThe vexed question of the common fund has still not been resolved except in so far as a commitment to principle is concerned. We therefore attach' the greatest importance to a successful conclusion of the meeting21 now scheduled for 14 November this year. We are encouraged by recent expressions of positive views made by several developed countries, .particularly at the last Development Committee meeting in Washington concerning the common fund, and we would naturally welcome the establishment of that fund on a generally agreed basis, without driving the developing countries to establish a fund through the mobilization of their own resources..\n20\tGroup of Experts on Mineral and Energy Exploration in Developing Countries.\n21\tUnited Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities.\n159.\tWithout in any way prejudicing the common fund, Sri Lanka has proposed to the non-aligned countries the creation of a better co-ordinated information system with regard to trends in prices and supplies of at least those key commodities which bulk large in international trade. The proposal has already been earmarked for study by a group of non-aligned countries, and we hope that it will gain the attention of the Assembly at this present session.\n160.\tMuch has been said in this forum about the New International Economic Order. The General Assembly at its last session set up the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, otherwise known as the Committee of the Whole, where the dialogue and negotiations on the New International Economic Order could take place. We are disappointed that the Committee has not been able to perform the functions that were entrusted to it. Great concern has been expressed by representatives of third world over this break-down in the work of the Committee. At the same time, we note that those countries that had certain problems or difficulties regarding the work and mandate of the Committee have expressed a sincere desire to find a method whereby the Committee could resume its work.\n161.\tWe reiterate our firm belief that dialogue and negotiations on the New International Economic Order should take place within the United Nations system and that the Committee should be in a position to enter into negotiations. And we hope that the deep concern expressed at the break-down of the work of the Committee will give impetus to the search for a mutually acceptable and productive basis for the continuation of its work.\n162.\tThis is the second occasion I have had to address this distinguished gathering in my capacity as Foreign Minister. I must admit to knowledge of the existence of a growing body of cynical opinion which views the statements made by Foreign Ministers of the Member States of the United Nations as a ritualistic exercise. We arrive here every year; we say what we have to say, and we disperse. The words we utter do not, and indeed cannot, change the course of international events. More importantly for us in the poorer countries, the words we speak do not accelerate the development process in our countries. Why is it then that we persist in this exercise? Why is it that we continue to make these statements, adding to the enormous volume of paper that is already produced by the United Nations?\n163.\tI wish to say, in all humility and modesty, that for us the small nations, the weaker nations, the poor nations, the United Nations General Assembly represents a unique forum. It is a forum where what we say echoes throughout the world. We speak here in the hope that some of our words may get through, so that the hopes and aspirations of the men, women and children of third-world countries will register in the consciousness of the leaders of the world. We are here because our people have sent us here. We speak here to articulate the problems, hopes and fears of our people. Not to do so would be a shameful betrayal of the mandate given to us by our people. It is in this spirit that I, coming as I do from a democratic socialist country, Sri Lanka, which is both a small and a developing nation, have placed before you some thoughts on how we in Sri Lanka see the present state of international development.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\n1.\tThe great English writer, Charles Dickens, began one of his celebrated novels thus: \\\"It was the best of times; it was the worst of times.. .\\\". I suggest that these words form the theme of this session of the General Assembly. But 1 should amend them to read that if this is not the worst of times, it is also not the best of times.\n2.\tAt every session of the Assembly, we do in fact hover between the brink of hope and the abyss of despair in a recurrent schizoid pattern symbolic of the profound readjustments in the ongoing relations among nations. Reduced to the simplest level, the problems which face this Assembly can be described as the struggle for supremacy among the \\\"haves\\\", and the struggle for equality between the \\\"haves\\\" and the \\\"have-nots\\\". But the two are not unrelated since the consequences of one impinge on the other and suggest strongly that it is not nations but rather issues which are interdependent.\n3.\tWe open this, the thirty-third session of the General Assembly, in the afterglow of the agreements on the Middle East reached at Camp David.  One of the most intractable and danger-fraught questions of our century may have been moved substantially toward a solution as the result of the extraordinary leadership and personal skill of the President of the United States, Mr. Jimmy Carter. Great credit is also due to the President of Egypt, Mr. Anwar El-Sadat and the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Menachem Begin, whose goodwill and earnestness enabled them to discover their common interest in the search for lasting peace. As with every breakthrough, how it is pursued will determine its ultimate fruits. It is our earnest hope that the road which led to Camp David shall in the future lead to the final healing of wounds caused by a full generation of unremitting confrontation in the Middle East.\n4.\tBut we should note two things about the Camp David agreements-the first with pleasure and the second with caution. The first is that the spirit of Camp David reflects the spirit of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and in that respect proves the validity and wisdom of that resolution. The second is that the Camp David agreements do not represent a final settlement, but rather a necessary framework.\n5.\tThe same note of guarded optimism applies to the situation in black Africa as a whole, with the exceptions of the intractable problems in Zimbabwe and Namibia. Although agreements have been reached in principle, these have not notably diminished tensions.\n6.\tIn Asia, the signing of the Treaty of Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China has added a new dimension to efforts to strengthen the stability of the region. At the same time it has aroused misgivings in some quarters, raising the possibility of fresh tensions in the future.\n7.\tOf more proximate interest to the Philippines and to its partners in the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN/ are the conflicts which, unexpectedly as well as dangerously, have flared into armed skirmishes in our region. We feel that these should be settled as quickly as possible at the negotiating table on terms mutually acceptable to the parties concerned. Within ASEAN itself progress has accelerated markedly in the past year, both in terms of regional economic co-operation and in increased political cohesion. The external relations of ASEAN have also progressed in satisfactory fashion with additional prospects for further co-operation with other countries and international organizations.\n8.\tBut this Assembly is faced with two persistent problems which concern the whole of mankind. The first is the problem of disarmament, and the second is the North- South dialogue, most fittingly exemplified in the quest for a New International Economic Order.\n9.\tThe apparent lack of progress in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the principal actors in the nuclear drama is the dramatic symbol of the hazards which confront us daily. While the talks continue to lag, vast sums of money are being spent in the development of another generation of weapons infinitely more sophisticated and therefore more deadly than the older engines of destruction.\n10.\tAdmitting that disarmament is a slow process, there still are a number of confidence-building measures which could be taken in an effort to halt the runaway race for arms superiority. \n\n\n \n11.\tLast year I proposed three measures which could lead to the establishment of a climate of trust among the nuclear Powers. Because they continue to be relevant today, I reiterate them now: first, the achievement of the long- sought comprehensive nuclear test ban among Governments willing to participate; secondly, an ancillary moratorium on the testing or use of non-weapon nuclear devices pending the completion of a comprehensive study of their impact on the nuclear-arms race; thirdly, an agreement among major weapons-supplying nations to reduce, progressively and in a balanced manner, the conventional arms race.\n\n12.\tAt the same time, more direct measures could be taken once a climate of confidence had been established based on the principle of reciprocal initiatives in which an initiative by one party could be reciprocated in kind by the other parties.\n13.\tThe following measures deserve to be examined: first, an undertaking not to produce or deploy new weapons systems, which add a new dimension of escalation to the nuclear-arms race, as has been the case, for instance, with multiple missiles; secondly, an announcement that the most lethal chemical weapons, the dreaded nerve gases, would be removed from stockpiles, destroyed and no longer produced; thirdly, a moratorium on the production of fissionable material for weapons purposes, and a reduction of stockpiles; fourthly, a percentage or quantitative reduction in military budgets, nuclear-weapons stockpiles and delivery systems; and fifthly, an undertaking to suspend sales and delivery of nuclear reprocessing plants which have the capability for concentration of weapons-grade material, and to forgo such arrangements in the future.\n14.\tThe need for confidence-building measures was nowhere more evident than at the tenth special session, on disarmament. It was not a total loss, for it reaffirmed the principle that, since disarmament is a global problem, the proper venue for discussions is the General Assembly. It also resulted in the creation of a committee,  now in session in Geneva, to study the question of the reallocation of savings from disarmament to the establishment of a New International Economic Order. Such a study should dramatize, and, it is hoped, convince the nuclear club of, the enormous waste of resources devoted to the mission of death which could be applied to the nobler purpose of enhancing life.\n15.\tThe connexion between disarmament and a New International Economic Order is not accidental, for the restructuring of the world economic system is itself a central preoccupation of mankind. Yet progress is slow. Since the landmark sixth special session on this subject, a fundamental resistance to changes in world economic relations has begun to resurface, which leads to the painful suspicion that in fact the developed countries are impeding the progress of the dialogue in an effort to maintain the status quo.\n16.\tTo the developing countries this position is incomprehensible. The desideratum is to establish a just balance in the interest of both developed and developing countries. The goal is not to rob the rich to pay the poor, but to create international mechanisms for the redistribution of growth opportunities. Since the developing countries are an integral part of the human community and their economic progress or decline affects the whole, it is not only fair but prudent to allow them to participate actively in the processes of economic decision-making which affect the whole world.\n17.\tWhile a certain amount of disruption in the economic systems of the developed countries is to be expected, the developing countries feel that the costs of such disruption are far outweighed by the profits of accommodation. Surely the rise of the third world is the principal and most dramatic historical event of the last quarter of this century. Its requirements can be ignored only at the peril of world peace.\n18.\tIf world interdependence is to acquire real meaning it must be based on equality, fairness and justice. Interdependence based on the status quo perpetuates the relationship of dependency between developed and developing countries. While assistance and resource transfers are welcome, they are interim measures and do not constitute a solid basis for the continued growth and progress of developing countries. What is needed, and needed urgently, is a restructuring of the existing system to permit the equitable sharing of world economic growth.\n19.\tThe heart of the two problems of disarmament and of the North-South dialogue lies in the most elemental human right, the right to survive. Nothing more vividly illustrates the mortal danger to the human race than the prospect of a nuclear holocaust\u2014a prospect that will continue to haunt mankind as long as the arms race continues.\n20.\tBut there are other, less apocalyptic, dangers. The prospect of creeping death from disease, malnutrition or outright starvation is, if not as dramatic in impact, as surely fatal for the future of mankind.\n21.\tThough these two problems differ in degree, they are both aspects of human rights. Yet how many of us, seated complacently before our colour television sets, eating instant television dinners, understand what it means to be deprived of food and shelter or to await inevitable death without the necessary medical attention? A 10 cent increase in the price of meat can cause a food riot in an affluent metropolis, yet the absence of meat, and indeed of food of any kind, in deprived areas causes hardly a ripple of concern among the same citizens.\n22.\tEveryone in this Assembly subscribes to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; nobody can doubt that, although it is a matter for regret that some have delayed ratification of the implementing Covenants. What is in question is not so much human rights as the priority of choice in the hierarchy of human rights.\n23.\tAny Government worthy of the name will accord priority to the preservation of human life. This does not mean forswearing the other human rights; it means relegating them to their appropriate place in the scale of that society's values. For most of us the ideal remains the promotion of human rights coextensively. But few societies would be able to do this even in the best of all possible worlds.\n24.\tThe fact is that we remain prisoners of the ideals of the nineteenth century. Emotionally and intellectually we reject the lessons of the great revolution of our own time, for the revolution of the third world requires adjustments, not in our ideals, but in priorities made necessary by inevitable constraints.\n25.\tYet it should be obvious that civil and political rights cannot flourish in an environment of economic and social deprivation. Indeed, economic and social progress is the necessary pre-condition for the growth of civil and political rights. There is no more eloquent testimony to this fact than the history of the developed countries. 1 dare say (hat if human rights, in the restricted meaning current today, had been applied in an inflexible manner one or two centuries ago in those now advanced countries which were then struggling with the critical problems of survival-just as the third world is struggling today-most nations now advanced would have remained not nations but fragmented tribes.\n26.\tThe ideal of human rights is hardly new. It was there, just as was the Pacific before Magellan braved its vast waters. But the confused emphasis on human rights today raises serious questions, and 1 ask them. Are we interested in human rights as such, or are we interested in human rights for their presumed political utility? If human rights are intended to apply to the length and breadth of our planet, why are some countries singled out as alleged \\\"violators\\\" while others are conveniently ignored? If it is accepted that the seed-bed of civil and political rights is economic and social progress, how is it possible to explain the sudden and unpredictable withholding or withdrawal of assistance which impeded the development of the very rights economic aid is intended to promote?\n27.\tAnd who among us, I ask, is without sin in respect of human rights? Who among us? Let us look at the mote in our eyes and reflect that, in the name of public order, civil and political rights are periodically violated in the very societies which champion the cause of human rights.\n28.\tBut one should not condemn too quickly the regulation of civil and political rights when this is rendered necessary by the need of the community to defend itself from the depredations of a few. To give free rein to the nihilist few in the name of human rights would mean the ultimate folly of collective suicide. In war every country defends itself through extraordinary measures. Today many countries find themselves lighting internal wars as desperate and real as the traditional wars between nation-States. These are wars against terrorists and subversives and separatists, wars against the scourges of hunger, social and economic deprivation and stagnation, illiteracy, pestilence. To overcome these extraordinary adversaries each country must calculate and apply the right blend of extraordinary measures that will be effective in protecting and promote the well-being of the majority without tearing apart the entire social fabric. It is not only possible but essential to construct such carefully calibrated measures, and those compelled to devise them act in the highest Interest of human rights and rational conduct,\n29.\tWe inhabit a plural universe and must learn to accept the diversity of customs, values and specific sets of economic and political circumstances. To compel other nations to conform to another country's values is itself an unpardonable violation of human rights. With some justification, many of us begin to wonder if a subtle form of exerting leverage is on the rise and whether the show-the- flag diplomacy of another era is being revived in the name of morality. The great pity is that naked intervention in other people's affairs could ultimately rob the noble ideal of human rights of any true worth or meaning.\n30.\tIn the increasingly interdependent world we live in, we must constantly be on guard against confusing interdependence with interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States. One is as healthy and desirable as the other is reprehensible and unacceptable. Today interference may take many subtle forms, from supranational crusades for causes that on their face are altruistic to gestures of helpfulness that sometimes blur the line between goodwill and good faith on one side and undue, if well-intentioned, meddling on the other. The climate of interdependence can flourish only where nation-States are secure and strong in their sense of independence. Then they can interact with others in confidence and serenity.\n31.\tMr. President, we face a crowded and multifaceted agenda at this thirty-third session of the General Assembly. We are fortunate that, through the next three months of intensive work that lie ahead, this Assembly will be steered by one such as you, who is so rich in experience, patience and wisdom. Thus, Sir, in offering you my congratulations and those of the Philippine delegation on the occasion of your election to the presidency of this session, I also congratulate the Assembly on its good fortune in having you at the helm.\n32.\tInasmuch as the work of the United Nations is a saga of continuity, I believe 1 express the general sentiment when I say that we approach our new tasks with confidence and buoyant spirits because of what we accomplished last year under the able leadership of our past President, Mr. Lazar Mojsov, who guided us through unprecedented multiple sessions with great skill, serenity and goodwill, and the momentum generated under his stewardship will prove useful to all of us at this session.\n33.\tThe Philippines happily associates itself with the remarks of welcome that have been addressed to Solomon Islands on the occasion of its accession to membership in the United Nations. It was our privilege to be one of the sponsors of its membership, and this adds a special sense of satisfaction to the fond welcome that we extend to our newest nation-colleague and co-worker in the unceasing effort to build a better and happier world.\n34.\tMay 1 also be allowed to say that the Assembly once again finds itself hugely in debt to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim for the substantive report that he has written for our thirty-third session [A/33/1]. This report is a model of conciseness, clarity, perceptiveness and realism, leavened with hope, faith and confidence. It logs what we have done and where we have been as clearly and crisply as it charts the course we are on and the various directions we may opt for. I wish to single out his statesmanlike reference to spheres of influence, and particularly his wise counsel that we should not expect instant and total solutions to our problems, or dramatic results from all our plans and programmes, I agree with him that it is cause enough for thanks and rejoicing that we constantly move forward and make progress-substantial if possible, modest if that is all that is possible-towards our goals and ideals. The important thing is that we never give up trying, working and striving to construct the best of all possible worlds and bring about the best of all possible times for all mankind. Mr. Secretary-General, we are beholden to you, and you have our profound gratitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
