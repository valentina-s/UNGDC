# United Nations General Debate Corpus (UNGDC)

## Data Description
This corpus contains 10568 English transcripts of speeches delivered by state representatives of the UN member states at the United Nations General Debate from 1946 until 2022. Text data was made available by Baturo et al. (2017). Original data is in a form of .txt file, each containing speech transcript from one member state in a given year. This RDS dataset was generated by executing “RDS_generator.R” file to read in all .txt files into a single dataframe. File size is 58.61 MB. Alternatively, run “json_convertor.R” file to transform plain texts into structured .json files.

Datasets can be found [`here`](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1SaDhXeWakkTRtrlg5drTV_vOVJjgbuwL).
Three identifying variables across all documents are: ccode_iso (ISO 3-letter character country code), session (session number of the given UNGD meeting), year (year of UNGD).
